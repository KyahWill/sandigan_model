				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this special civil action for prohibition to nullify a
legislative act directing the expropriation of the <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span>
Estate, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court is called upon to inquire further into how far the power of Congress
under the Constitution to authorize upon payment of just compensation the
expropriation of lands to be subdivided into small lots and conveyed at cost to
individuals<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
may extend, the more so as this is the first time the judiciary is confronted
with such a challenge addressed to the validity of a statute specifically made
applicable to a particular piece of land, owned by petitioner J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co. In the leading case of Guido v. Rural
Progress,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
decided in 1949, this Court in passing upon the scope of the power of the
President conferred by statute "to acquire private lands or any interest
therein, through purchase or expropriation, and to subdivide the same into home
lots or small farms for resale at reasonable prices and under such conditions
as he may fix to their <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> tenants or occupants"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
had occasion to delineate the contours of the above constitutional provision,
reconciling the undoubtedly broad grant of constitutional authority to Congress
with the right of property that might be adversely affected by its exercise.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prevailing opinion in the later case of Republic v. <span class="SpellE">Baylosis</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
tilted the balance in favor of property. In deciding this suit, filed with the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, the lower
court, as was understandable, bowed to what it considered the compulsion such
an opinion carries and being unable to perceive any relevant ground for
distinction, declared the challenged statute invalid. The respondents, the Land
Tenure Administration, the Solicitor General and the Auditor General in this
prohibition proceeding, appealed. We are possessed undoubtedly of greater
discretion on the matter. Nor is it to be lost sight of, as above-mentioned,
that this is the first controversy where the expropriation of a particular
property authorized by Congress under the above constitutional provision is
assailed as beyond its power. The opportunity is thus here present of making
more definite the boundaries of such congressional competence.</p>

<p class="BODY">As will hereafter be explained with some measure of fullness, we
cannot affix the stamp of approval to the judgment of the lower court; we reach
a different conclusion. There is to our mind no sufficient showing of the
unconstitutionality of the challenged act. We reverse.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1959</st1:date>,
Republic Act No. 2616 took effect without executive approval. It is therein
provided: "The expropriation of the <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span>
Estate in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>
jointly owned by the J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> and Company, Inc.,
Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> and Company, Inc., and <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>, et al., is
hereby authorized."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted in the appealed decision: "The
lands involved in this action, to which Republic Act No. 2616 refer and which
constitute a certain portion of the Sta. Mesa Heights Subdivision, have a total
area of about 109 hectares and are covered by Transfer Certificates of Title
Nos. 42774 and 49235 of the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City) registered in the name of
petitioner."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, on <st1:date year="1960" day="15" month="11">November
 15, 1960</st1:date>, respondent Land Tenure Administration was directed by the
then Executive Secretary to institute the proceeding for the expropriation of
the <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span> Estate. Not losing any time, petitioner
J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc. filed before the lower
court on <st1:date year="1960" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1960</st1:date>
a special action for prohibition with preliminary injunction against
respondents praying that the above act be declared unconstitutional, seeking in
the meanwhile a preliminary injunction to restrain respondents from instituting
such expropriation proceeding, thereafter to be made permanent after trial. The
next day, on <st1:date year="1960" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1960</st1:date>,
the lower court granted the prayer for the preliminary injunction upon the
filing of a P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> bond. After trial, the lower
court promulgated its decision on <st1:date year="1963" day="10" month="1">January
 10, 1963</st1:date> holding that Republic Act No. 2616 as amended is unconsti­tutional
and granting the writ of prohibition prayed for.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this appeal by respondents, one we find meritorious. With
the problem thus laid bare and with an exposition of the constitutional
principles that compel a result different from that arrived at by the lower
court, we cannot accept its holding that the statute thus assailed should be
annulled.</p>

<p class="BODY">1. Respondents would interpose two procedural bars sufficient in
their opinion to preclude the lower court from passing on the question of
validity.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first is the allegation that in effect
this special proceeding for prohibition is "actually a suit against the
State, which is not allowed without its consent."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The second would require, on the assumption that the suit could proceed, that
the Executive Secretary, as the real party in interest, ought to have been <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>. Neither objection suffices to preclude the lower
court from passing upon the question of validity of the statute in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">As was held by this Court in the leading case of <span class="SpellE">Angara</span> v. Electoral Commission,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
speaking through Justice Laurel, the power of judicial review is granted, if
not expressly, at least by clear implication from the relevant provisions of
the Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This power may be exercised when the party
adversely affected by either a legislative or executive act, or a municipal
ordinance for that matter, files the appropriate suit to test its validity. The
special civil action of prohibition has been relied upon precisely to restrain
the enforcement of what is alleged to be an unconstitutional statute.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
As it is a fundamental postulate that the Constitution as the supreme law is
binding on all governmental agencies, failure to observe the limitations found
therein furnishes a sufficient ground for a declaration of the nullity of the
governmental measure challenged. The argument then that the government is the
adverse party and that therefore must consent to its being sued certainly is
far from persuasive. Moreover, it is equally well-settled that for the purpose
of thus obtaining a judicial declaration of nullity, it is enough if the
respondents or defendants named be the government officials who would give
operation and effect to official action allegedly tainted with
unconstitutionality. As it cannot be denied that in 1959 the then Land Tenure
Administration as well as the Solicitor General were called upon to enforce the
statute now assailed, it would appear clear that the insistence on the
Executive Secretary being made a party lacks support in law.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would be then to set aside and disregard doctrines of
unimpeachable authority if the plea of respondents on these procedural points
raised were to meet an affirmative response. <span class="GramE">That we are not
disposed to do.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">2. Thus we reach the merits. It would appear, as noted at the
outset, that for the purpose of deciding the question of validity squarely
raised, a further inquiry into the scope of the constitutional power of
Congress to authorize the expropriation of lands to be subdivided into small
lots and conveyed at cost to individuals<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
is indicated, if for no other purpose than to attain a greater degree of
clarity. The question is one then of constitutional construction. It is well to
recall fundamentals. The primary task is one of ascertaining and thereafter
assuring the realization of the purpose of the framers and of the people in the
adoption of the Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We look to the language of the document itself in our search for
its meaning. We do not of course stop there, but that is where we begin. It is
to be assumed that the words in which constitutional provisions are couched
express the objective sought to be attained. They are to be given their
ordinary meaning except where technical terms are employed in which case the
significance thus attached to them prevails. As the Constitution is not
primarily a lawyer's document, it being essential for the rule of law to obtain
that it should ever be present in the people's consciousness, its language as
much as possible should be understood in the sense they have in common use.
What it says according to the text of the provision to be construed compels
acceptance and negates the power of the courts to alter it, based on the
postulate that the framers and the people mean what they say. Thus there are
cases where the need for construction is reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is one of them. It does not admit of doubt that the
congressional power thus conferred is far from limited. It is left to the
legislative will to determine what lands may be expropriated so that they could
be subdivided for resale to those in need of them. Nor can it be doubted either
that as to when such authority may be exercised is purely for Congress to
decide. Its discretion on the matter is not to be interfered with. The language
employed is not swathed in obscurity. The recognition of the broad
congressional competence is undeniable. The judiciary in the discharge of its
task to enforce consti­tutional commands and prohibitions is denied the
prerogative of curtailing its well-nigh all-embracing sweep.</p>

<p class="BODY">Reference to the <u>historical</u> basis of this provision as
reflected in the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention, two of the
extrinsic aids to construction along with the contemporaneous understanding and
the consideration of the consequences that flow from the interpretation under
consideration, yields additional light on the matter. The opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, in the Guido case did precisely that. It cited the
speech of delegate Miguel <span class="SpellE">Cuaderno</span>, who, in speaking
of large estates and trusts in perpetuity, stated: "'There has been <span class="GramE">an impairment</span> of public tranquility, and to be sure a
continuous impairment of it, because of the existence of these conflicts. In
our folklore the oppression and exploitation of the tenants are vividly
referred to; their sufferings at the hand of the landlords are emotionally
pictured in our drama; and even in the native movies and talkies of today, this
theme of economic slavery has been touched upon. In official documents these
same conflicts are narrated and exhaustively explained as a threat to social
order and stability. '"<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
He invoked likewise what happened to the family of our national hero Jose <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>: "<span class="GramE">'But</span> we should go to <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> for inspiration and illumination in this problem of
the conflicts between landlords and tenants. The national hero and his family
were persecuted because of these same conflicts in <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span>,
and <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> himself met a martyr's death because of his
exposal of the cause of the tenant class, because he would not close his eyes
to oppression and persecution with his own people as victims.’”<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Delegate <span class="SpellE">Cuaderno</span> closed with this appeal: "'If
we are to be true to our trust, if it is our purpose in drafting our
constitution to insure domestic tranquility and to provide for the well-being
of our people, we cannot, we must not fail to prohibit the ownership of large
estates, to make it the duty of the government to breakup existing large
estates, and to provide for their acquisition by purchase or through
expropriation and sale to their occupants, as has been provided in the
Constitutions of Mexico and <span class="SpellE">Jugoslavia</span>. '"<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The above address was delivered during the early days of the
convention on <st1:date month="8" day="21" year="1934">August 21, 1934</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Subsequently, the day before the above constitutional provision was voted on <st1:date year="1935" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1935</st1:date> he reiterated what
was said by him in the above address. Thus: "Mr. President, this will be
my last speech in the Convention. And I just want to remind the Convention of
the first speech that I delivered - the first speech I delivered before this
Assembly. I believe, Mr. President, that one of the best provisions that this draft
of the Constitution contains is this provision that will prevent the repetition
of the history of misery, of trials and tribulations of the poor tenants
throughout the length and breadth of the Philippine Islands."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This is not to say that such an appeal to history as disclosed by
what could be accepted as the pronouncement that did influence the delegates to
vote for such a grant of power could be utilized to restrict the scope thereof,
considering the language employed. For what could be expropriated are
"lands" not "landed <span class="GramE">estates.</span>" It
is well to recall what Justice Laurel would impress on us, "historical
discussion while valuable is not necessarily decisive."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
It is easy to understand why.</p>

<p class="BODY">The social and economic conditions are not static. They change
with the times. To identify the text of a written consti­tution with the
circumstances that inspired its inclusion may render it incapable of being
responsive to future needs. Precisely, it is assumed to be one of the virtues
of a written constitution that it suffices to govern the life of the people not
only at the time of its framing but far into the indefinite future. It is not
to be considered as so lacking in flexibility and suppleness that it may be a
bar to measures; novel and unorthodox, as they may appear to some, but
nonetheless imperatively called for. Otherwise, it might expose itself to the
risk of inability to survive in the face of complexities that time may bring in
its wake.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would thus be devoid of the character of permanency, which is the
distinguishing mark of a constitution. Such was the conclusion deliberately
arrived at after extensive discussion in the Constitutional Convention that the
Consti­tution as adopted in 1935 would be good not only for the Commonwealth
but for the Republic, with all the vicissitudes that time and circumstance
would bring. Our people in signifying their adherence to the Constitution at
the plebiscite thereafter held were of a similar persuasion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The continuing life of a constitution was stressed by one of the
chief architects of the Constitution, Manuel A. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>,
later to be the first President of the Republic. For him it is "the
essence [of such an] instrument."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
It was his view that the constitution to be adopted by the Constitutional
Convention of 1934 would "have an indefinite life, will be permanent,
subject of course, to revisions, amendments and other changes that may be
adopted constitutionally."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
That would be an assurance that constitutional guarantees "will be
maintained, property rights will be safeguarded and individual rights
maintained immaculate and sanctified. * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Another prominent delegate, Gregorio Perfecto, later a member of this Tribunal,
aptly noted that the transitory character is essentially incompatible with the
nature of laws, and necessarily so of a constitution, which is the supreme law
of a people and therefore must be impressed with such attribute of permanency,
much more than ordinary statutes passed under its authority.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It could thus be said of our Constitution as of the United States
Constitution, to borrow from Chief Justice Marshall's pronouncement in <span class="SpellE">M'Culloch</span> v. Maryland<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
that it is "intended to endure for ages to come and consequently, to be
adapted to the various crisis of human affairs. " It cannot be looked upon
as other than, in the language of another American jurist, Chief Justice Stone,
"a continuing instrument of government."<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
Its framers were not visionaries, toying with speculations or theories, but men
of affairs, at home in statecraft, laying down the foundations of a government
which can make effective and operative all the powers conferred or assumed,
with the corresponding restrictions to secure individual rights and,
anticipating, subject to the limitations of human foresight, the problems that
events to come in the distant days ahead will bring. Thus a constitution, to
quote from Justice <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span>, "states or ought to
state not rules for the passing hour, but principles for an expanding
future."<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To that primordial intent, all else is subordinated. Our Constitution,
any constitution, is not to be construed narrowly or pedantically, for the
prescriptions therein contained, to paraphrase Justice Holmes, are not
mathematical formulas having their essence in their form, but are organic
living institutions, the significance of which <span class="GramE">is vital</span>
nor formal. There must be <span class="GramE">an awareness</span>, as with
Justice Brandeis, not only of what has been, but of what may be. The words
employed by it are not to be construed to yield fixed and rigid answers but as
impressed with the necessary attributes of flexibility and accommodation to
enable them to meet adequately whatever problems the future has in store. It is
not, in brief, a printed finality but a dynamic process.</p>

<p class="BODY">3. The conclusion is difficult to resist that the text of the
constitutional provision in question, its historical background as noted in
pronouncements in the Constitutional Convention and the <span class="SpellE">inexonerable</span>
need for the Constitution to have the capacity for growth and ever be adaptable
to changing social and economic conditions all argue against its restrictive
construction. Such an approach was reflected succinctly in the dissenting
opinion of Justice J. B. L. Reyes, concurred in by the present Chief Justice,
in the <span class="SpellE">Baylosis</span> case. We find it persuasive.</p>

<p class="BODY">His dissenting opinion opens thus: "I am constrained to
dissent from the opinion of the majority. The reasons set forth by it against
the validity of the proposed expropriation strike me as arguments against the
expropriation policies adopted by the government rather than reasons against
the existence and application of the condemnation power in the present
case."<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
Then he stated: "The propriety of exercising the power of eminent domain
under Article XIII, section 4 of our Constitution can not be determined on a
purely quantitative or area basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
only does the constitutional provision speak of <u>lands</u> instead of <u>landed</u>
<u>estates</u>, but I see no cogent reason why the government, in its quest for
social justice and peace, should exclusively devote attention to conflicts of
large proportions, involving a considerable number of individuals, and eschew
small controversies and wait until they grow into a major problem before taking
remedial action."<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to the role of the courts in the appraisal of the
congressional implementation of such a power, he had this to say: "The
Constitution considered the small individual land tenure to be so important to
the maintenance of peace and order and to the promotion of progress and the
general welfare that it not only provided for the expropriation and subdivision
of lands but also opened the way for the limitation of private land holdings
(Art. <span class="GramE">XIII, section 3).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not for this Court to judge the worth
of these and other social and economic policies expressed by the Constitution;
our duty is to conform to such policies and not to block their realization.
"<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The above dissent, as well as that penned by the then Chief
Justice <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> with whom the then Justice Pablo was in
agreement, with Justice Alex Reyes writing a concurring opinion, resulted in
that the main opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span>, while
prevailing, failed to elicit the necessary majority vote of six.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If for that reason alone its re-examination
would not appear to be inappropriate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, it could not be considered as controlling the present suit, in
view of the fact that the exercise of the congressional authority to
expropriate land was not direct as in this case but carried out in pursuance of
the statutory authority conferred on the President under Commonwealth Act No.
539.</p>

<p class="BODY">The absence of any controlling force of such prevailing opinion
can likewise be predicated on facts which would differentiate the present
situation from that found in the <span class="SpellE">Baylosis</span> case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus Justice <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span>
noted: "The evidence shows that both Sinclair and <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span>
P. <span class="SpellE">Baylosis</span> at one time were willing to sell to some
of the tenants and occupants herein involved under certain conditions and
provided that they buy in groups, presumably to avoid subdivisions and the
problem of dealing with many individual buyers, but the tenants failed to
buy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Naturally, they may not now compel
Sinclair and <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Baylosis</span>
to sell to them through the Government by means of expropriation. Besides, the

have lands of their own."<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The more fundamental reason though why we find ourselves unable
to yield deference to such opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span>,
well-written and tightly-reasoned as it is, is its undue stress on property
rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It thus appears then that it
failed to take into account the greater awareness exhibited by the framers of
our Constitution of the social forces at work when they drafted the fundamental
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be more specific, they were
seriously concerned with the grave problems of inequality of wealth, with its
highly divisive tendency, resulting in the generous scope accorded the police
power and eminent domain prerogatives of the state, even if the exercise
thereof would cover terrain previously thought of as beyond state control, to
promote social justice and the general welfare.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is not to say of course that property rights are
disregarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is merely to emphasize
that the philosophy of our Constitution embodying as it does what Justice
Laurel referred to as its "nationalistic and socialist traits discoverable
upon even a sudden dip into a variety of [its] provisions" although not
extending as far as the "destruction or annihilation" of the rights
to property,<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
negates the postulate which at one time reigned supreme in American
constitutional law as to their well-nigh inviolable character. This is not so
under our Constitution, which rejects the doctrine of <u>laissez</u> <u>faire</u>
with its abhorrence for the least interference with the autonomy suppose to be
enjoyed by the property owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Laissez</u>
<u>faire</u>, as Justice Malcolm pointed out as far back as 1919, did not take
too firm a foothold in our jurisprudence.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a> Our
Constitution is much more explicit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no room for it for <u>laissez</u> <u>faire</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So Justice Laurel affirmed not only in the
above opinion but in another concurring opinion quoted with approval in at
least two of our subsequent decisions.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">This particular grant of authority to Congress authorizing the
expropriation of land is a clear manifestation of such a policy that finds
expression in our fundamental law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So is
the social justice principle enshrined in the Constitution of which it is an
expression, as so clearly pointed out in the respective dissenting opinions of
Justice J. B. L. Reyes and Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> in the
<span class="SpellE">Baylosis</span> case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Why it should be thus is so plausibly set forth in the ACCFA decision,
the opinion being penned by Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We quote: "The growing complexities of
modern society, however, have rendered this traditional classification of the
functions of government quite unrealistic, not to say obsolete.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The areas which used to be left to private
enterprise and initiative and which the government was called upon to enter
optionally, and only 'because it was better equipped to administer for the public
welfare than is any private individual or group of individuals,' continue to
lose their well-defined boundaries and to be absorbed within activities that
the government must undertake in its sovereign capacity if it is to meet the
increasing social challenges of the times.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here as almost everywhere else the tendency is undoubtedly towards a
greater socialization of economic forces.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here of course this development was envisioned, indeed adopted as a
national policy, by the Constitution itself in its declaration of principle
concerning the promotion of social justice."</p>

<p class="BODY">It would thus appear that the prevailing opinion in the <span class="SpellE">Baylosis</span> case is far from compelling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the extent that the conclusion reached by
us in this suit proceeds from a different reading of the constitutional
provision in question, it must be deemed as being possessed of less than
decisive weight.</p>

<p class="BODY">4. There need be no fear that such constitutional grant of power
to expropriate lands is without limit. As in the case of the more general
provision on eminent domain, there is the explicit requirement of the payment
of just compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well-settled
that just compensation means the equivalent for the value of the property at
the time of its taking. Anything beyond that is more, and anything short of
that is less, than just compensation. It means a fair and full equivalent for
the loss sustained, which is the measure of the indemnity, not whatever gain
would accrue to the expropriating entity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The market value of the land taken is the just compensation to which the
owner of condemned property is entitled, the market value being that sum of
money which a person desirous, but not compelled to buy, and an owner, willing,
but not compelled to sell, would agree on as a price to be given and received
for such property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There must be a
consideration then of all the facts which make it commercially valuable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question is what would be obtained for it
on the market from parties who want to buy and would give full value.
Testimonies as to real estate transactions in the vicinity are admissible. It
must be shown though that the property as to use must be of similar character
to the one sought to be condemned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
transaction must likewise be coeval as to time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To the market value must be added the consequential damages, if any,
minus the consequential benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The assessed value of real property while constituting <u>prima</u>
<u>facie</u> evidence of its value in case of condemnation proceedings is not
conclusive.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Then, too, it is a prerequisite for the valid exercise of such a
congressional power that the taking be for the public use.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To quote from the Guido decision: "It
has been truly said that the assertion of the right on the part of the
legislature to take the property of one citizen and transfer it to another,
even for a full compensation, when the public interest is not promoted thereby,
is claiming a despotic power, and one inconsistent with every just principle
and fundamental maxim of a free government."<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
It is on that account that we granted prohibition to restrain respondent Rural
Progress Administration from proceeding with the expropriation of petitioner's
land, two adjoining lots, <span class="GramE">part</span> commercial with a
combined area of slightly more than two hectares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was stressed by Justice <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> in his opinion: "<span class="GramE">No fixed
line of demarcation between what taking is for public use and what is not can
be made</span>; each case has to be judged according to its peculiar
circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It suffices to say for
the purpose of this decision that the case under consideration is far wanting
in those elements which make for public convenience or public use."<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
Such is not the situation before us now. Nor are we disposed to dispute the
legislative appraisal of the matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">5. The failure to meet the exacting standard of due process would
likewise constitute a valid objection to the exercise of this congressional
power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was so intimated in the
above leading Guido case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was an
earlier pronouncement to that effect in a decision rendered long before the
adoption of the Constitution under the previous organic law then in force,
while the Philippines was still an unincorporated territory of the United
States.<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious then that a landowner is covered by the mantle of

that smacks of whim or caprice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
negates state power to act in an oppressive manner. It is, as had been stressed
so often, the embodiment of the sporting idea of fair play. In that sense, it
stands as a guaranty of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is
the standard that must be met by any governmental agency in the exercise of

was not given the sanction of approval by this Court, the failure to meet the
due process requirement being quite evident.</p>

<p class="BODY">6. It is primarily the equal protection guaranty though that
petitioner's case is made to rest. The Constitution requires that no person be
denied "the equal protection of the laws."<a style="" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></span></span></a>
A juridical being is included within its terms.</p>

<p class="BODY">The assumption underlying such a guaranty is that a legal norm,
whether embodied in a rule, principle, or standard, constitutes a defense
against anarchy at one extreme and tyranny at the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereby, people living together in a
community with its myriad and complex problems can minimize the friction and reduce
the conflicts, to assure, at the very least, a peaceful ordering of
existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ideal situation is for
the law's benefits to be available to all, that none be placed outside the
sphere of its coverage. Only thus could chance and favor be excluded and the
affairs of men governed by that serene and impartial uniformity, which is of
the very essence of the idea of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The actual, given things as they are and likely to continue to
be, cannot approximate the ideal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is
the law susceptible to the reproach that it does not take into account the
realities of the situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
constitutional guaranty then is not to be given a meaning that disregards what
is, what does in fact exist.<a style="" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></span></span></a>
To assure that the general welfare be promoted, which is the end of law, a
regulatory measure may cut into the rights to liberty and property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those adversely affected may under such
circumstances invoke the equal protection clause only if they can show that the
governmental act assailed, far from being inspired by the attainment of the
common weal was prompted by the spirit of hostility, or at the very least,
discrimination that finds no support in reason.</p>

<p class="BODY">It suffices then that the laws operate equally and uniformly on
all persons under similar circumstances or that all persons must be treated in
the same manner, the conditions not being different, both in the privileges
conferred and the liabilities imposed. Favoritism and undue preference cannot
be allowed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For the
principle is that equal protection and security shall be given to every person
under circumstances, which if not identical are analogous.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>If law be looked upon in terms of burden or
charges, those that fall within a class should be treated in the same fashion,
whatever restrictions cast on some in the group equally binding on the rest.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is precisely because the challenged statute applies only to
petitioner that he could assert a denial of equal protection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As set forth in its brief: "Republic Act
No. 2616 is directed solely against <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and for
this reason violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unlike other laws which confer authority to
expropriate landed estates in general, it singles out the <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span>
Estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be said, therefore,
that it deals equally with other lands in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city> or elsewhere."<a style="" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></span></span></a>
With due recognition then of the power of Congress to designate the particular
property to be taken and how much thereof may be condemned in the exercise of
the power of expropriation, it is still a judicial question whether in the
exercise of such competence, the party adversely affected is the victim of
partiality and prejudice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the equal
protection clause will not allow.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judiciary can look into the facts then, no conclusiveness
being attached to a determination of such character when reliance is had either
to the due process clause which is a barrier against arbitrariness and
oppressiveness and the equal protection guaranty which is an obstacle to
invidious discrimination.</p>

<p class="BODY">We start of course with the presumption of validity, the doubts
being resolved in favor of the challenged enactment.<a style="" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></span></span></a>
As this is the first statute of its kind assailed, we should not stop our
inquiry there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The occasion that called
for such legislation, if known, goes far in meeting any serious consti­tutional
objection raised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We turn to the
Explanatory Note of the bill,<a style="" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></span></span></a>
which was enacted into the challenged statute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It started with the declaration that it provides for the
"expropriation of the <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span> Estate, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>, and for the sale at
cost of the lots therein to their present bona fide occupants, authorizing <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> the appropriation of ten million pesos." Then
it continued: "The <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span> Estate has an area of
more than ninety-six hectares and the lots therein are at present occupied by
no less than one thousand five hundred heads of families, most of whom are
veterans of World War II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the
earnest desire of this group of patriotic and loyal citizens to purchase the
lots at a minimum cost." Why there was such a need for expropriation was
next taken up: "The population of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
  City</st1:place></st1:city> has considerably increased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This increase in population is posing a
serious housing problem to city residents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This bill will not only solve the problem but will also implement the
land-for-the-landless program of the present Administration. "</p>

<p class="BODY">What other facts are there which would remove the alleged
infirmity of the statute on equal protection grounds? The brief for respondents
invited our attention to the social problem which this legislation was intended
to remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "There is a vital
point which should have great weight in the decision of this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner led the occupants of <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span> Estate to believe that they were dealing with the
representatives of the real owners, the Veterans Subdivision, in the purchase
of their lots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The occupants believed in
good faith that they were dealing with the representatives of the owners of the
lots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This belief was bolstered by the
fact that the petitioners herein even entered into a compromise agreement on <st1:date year="1953" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1953</st1:date> with the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>, agreeing to give the latter millions of pesos in
settlement of their claim over the <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span>
Estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The occupants, therefore,
purchased their respective portions from the Veterans Subdivision in good
faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner allowed the
Veterans Subdivision to construct roads in the <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span>
Estate; it allowed said firm to establish an office in the <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span>
Estate and to advertise the sale of the lots inside the <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span>
Estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner admits having full
knowledge of the activities of the Veterans Subdivision and yet did not lift a
finger to stop said acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The occupants
paid good money for their lots and spent fortunes to build their homes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was after the place has been improved with
the building of the roads and the erection of substantial residential homes
that petitioner stepped into the picture, claiming for the first time that it
is the owner of the <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span> Estate. Some of the
occupants had erected their houses as early as 1947 and 1948 * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The cutting edge of the above assertions could have been blunted
by the brief for petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is all
it did say on the matter though: "Appellants alleged that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> 'led the occupants of <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span>
Estate to believe that they were dealing with the representatives of the real
owners, the Veterans Subdivision, in the purchase of their lots' * * *. There
is absolutely no evidence on record to establish this ludicrous
allegation."<a style="" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></span></span></a>
Only the alleged duplicity of petitioner was denied, leaving unanswered the
rather persuasive recital of conditions that could rightly motivate Congress to
act as it did. Clearly, there is no sufficient refutation of the seriousness of
the problem thus underscored by respondents, the solution of which is the aim
of the statute now under attack.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is not to deny that whenever Congress points to a particular
piece of property to be expropriated, it is faced with a more serious scrutiny
as to its power to act in the premises.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would require though a clear and palpable showing of its having singled
out a party to bear the brunt of governmental authority that may be
legitimately exerted, induced, it would appear by a feeling of disapproval or
ill-will to make out a case of this guaranty having been disregarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If such were the case, then in the language
of Justice Laurel, it "will be the time to make the [judicial] hammer fall
and heavily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But not until then."<a style="" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></span></span></a>
The most careful study of the matter before us however yields the conclusion
that petitioner was unable to sustain the burden of demonstrating a denial of
equal protection.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, there is nothing to prevent Congress in view of the
public funds at its disposal to follow a system of priorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could thus determine what lands would
first be the subject of expropriation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This it did under the challenged legislative act. As already noted,
Congress was moved to act in view of what it considered a serious social and
economic problem. The solution which for it was the most acceptable was the
authorization of the expropriation of the <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span>
Estate. So it provided under the statute in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was confronted with a situation that
called for correction, and the legislation that was the result of its
deliberation sought to apply the necessary palliative. That it stopped short of
possibly attaining the cure of other analogous ills certainly does not
stigmatize its effort as a denial of equal protection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have given our sanction to the principle
underlying the exercise of police power and taxation, but certainly not
excluding eminent domain, that "the legislature is not required by the
Constitution to adhere to the policy of 'all or none'."<a style="" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, to reiterate, the invocation by petitioner of equal protection clause is
not attended with success.</p>

<p class="BODY">7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other points raised
may be briefly disposed of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much is made
of what the lower court considered to be the inaccuracy apparent on the face of
the challenged statute as to the ownership of the <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span>
Estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could very well be that
Congress ought to have taken greater pains to avoid such imprecision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the lower court, unduly alarmed,
would consider it a deprivation of property without due process of law.<a style="" href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></span></span></a>
Such a fear is unwarranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
course of the expropriation proceedings, there undoubtedly would be a judicial
determination as to the party entitled to the just compensation.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As of now then, such a question would appear
at the very least to be premature.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Reference is likewise made as to the effect of the authorized
expropriation on those purchasers of lots located in the <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span>
Estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, on the occasion of the
expropriation, whatever contractual rights might be possessed by vendors and
vendees could be asserted and accorded the appropriate constitutional
protection.</p>

<p class="BODY">8. What appears undeniable is that in the light of the broad
grant of congressional power so apparent from the text of the constitutional
provision, the historical background as made clear during the deliberation for
the Constitutional Convention, and the cardinal postulate underlying
constitutional construction that its provisions are not to be interpreted to
preclude their being responsive to future needs, the fundamental law being
intended to govern the life of a nation as it unfolds through the ages, the
challenged statute can survive the test of validity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were otherwise, then the judiciary may
lend itself susceptible to the charge that in its appraisal of governmental
measures with social and economic implications, its decisions are characterized
by the narrow, unyielding insistence on the primacy of property rights, contrary
to what the Constitution ordains.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In no
other sphere of judicial activity are judges called upon to transcend personal
predilections and private notions of policy, lest legislation intended to bring
to fruition the hope of a better life for the great masses of our people, as
embodied in the social justice principle of which this constitutional provision
under scrutiny is a manifestation, be unjustifiably stricken down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appealed decision cannot stand.</p>

Sec. 1, Republic Act No. 2616. The two succeeding sections follow: "Sec.
2. Immediately upon the appropriation of funds by the Congress of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for the payment of just compensation for the said <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span>
Estate, the Solicitor General, or any other proper Government authority shall
institute the necessary expropriation proceedings before the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City. <span class="GramE">Sec. 3.</span>
After the expropriation of the <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span> Estate as
provided in this Act, the lots therein shall be sold at cost to their present
bona fide occupants in not more than two hundred forty equal monthly
installments with interest of not more than six <u>per</u> <u>centum</u> <u>per</u>
<u>annum</u> on the unpaid balance." The fourth section was thereafter
amended by Republic Act No. 3453 to read thus: "Sec. 4. Upon approval of
this amendatory Act, no <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> proceedings shall
be instituted or prosecuted against the present occupants of any lot in said <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span> Estate, and no <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
proceedings already commenced shall be continued, and such lot or any portion
thereof shall not be sold by the owners of said estate to any person other than
the present occupant without the consent of the latter given in a public
instrument. " It was held in <span class="SpellE">Cuatico</span> <i>v</i>.
Court of Appeals: "It is, therefore, imperative that we declare, as we now
do, that Section 4 of Republic Act No. 3453 which prohibits the filing of an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> proceeding, or the continuance of one that has
already been commenced, even in the absence of expro­priation proceedings
offends our Constitution and, hence, is unenforceable." <span class="GramE">(6

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur, and this separate opinion is intended only to clarify
two statements in the scholarly main opinion of Mr. Justice Fernando that
appear to me to be quite inconsistent with each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is said therein that "it (the
language of the constitutional provision herein involved) does not admit of
doubt that the congressional power thus conferred is far from limited" (p.
6) and that it has a "well-nigh all embracing sweep", (p. 7) but at
page 14 it is also said that "there need be no fear that such
constitutional grant of power to expropriate is without limit".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To avoid any mistake regarding my view as to
which of these two statements should prevail, I would like to state
categorically that I consider the power granted to Congress by the Constitution
to "authorize, upon payment of just compensation, the expropriation of
lands to be subdivided into small lots and conveyed at cost to
individuals" <u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>unlimited</u> by any other provision
of said Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just compensation
is in reality a part of the power granted rather than a limitation thereto,
just as just compensation is of the essence in any exercise of the power of
eminent domain, as, otherwise, it would be plain commandeering.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Withal, I hold that the power of eminent
domain, in general, is an inherent power of any government, as, otherwise, it
would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the government to adequately
respond to the demands of public need and interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What government can exist without the power
to expropriate lands for streets, schools, public buildings, wharves and
military reservations, to mention only some of the indispensable things that
any country worthy of its name must establish as necessary means to accomplish
its purposes?</p>

<p class="BODY">As a statement of principle, it is right to reiterate as the main
opinion does, that "for the valid exercise of such (the) congressional
power, (to expropriate lands for the purpose indicated) that the taking be for
public use", but it is entirely a different matter <span style="">to </span>imply that in the judicial proceeding instituted towards such
end, the Government is still required to present evidence of such public use as
a fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I take it that the
constitutional provision itself declares the public objective, purpose or use
of the expropriation contemplated, which is the amelioration of long standing
socio-agrarian conditions endangering the very ideology on which our government
and way of life rest, hence, it should <span style="">follow
that as long as a congressional legislation declares that the condemnation of a
particular land is for the </span>specific<span style="">
purpose stated in the Constitution, it is not for the Judiciary to inquire as
to whether or not the taking of such l</span>and <span style="">is </span>for public use.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Constitution itself which is supposed to be the supreme law on private property
rights declares it to be so, and leaves it to Congress, not to the judiciary,
to make the choice of the lands to be taken to attain the objective the
constituent assembly aimed to achieve.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The scope and the limit of the power of the judiciary in this regard is
only to determine the existence of enabling legislation, to see to it that the
facts are <span style="">as </span>contemplated in
such enabling act and to provide the vehicle for compliance with procedural due
process in the implementation of the congressional act.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The concurring and
dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>,
particularly because he is joined by our eminent Chief Justice Roberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> and three of my distinguished senior colleagues,
Messrs. Justices Jose B. L. Reyes, <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and Fred Ruiz Castro, commends itself for the deep
concern it holds for individual property rights, </span><u><span style="">albeit</span></u><span style=""> personally, I feel that the present tendency the world over is to meet
the exigencies arising from the seemingly inevitable constant increase of
population of all countries, the most important of which is to provide people
with lands to cultivate or to live on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">To paraphrase the thoughts of Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>
in ACCFA vs. Confederation of Unions, G. R. No.</span> L-21484, </span><st1:date year="1969" day="29" month="11"><span style="">November
 29, 1969</span></st1:date><span style="">, expressed
in the quotation contained in the main opinion in this case, here as almost
everywhere else the irreversible trend is towards socialization of economic
resources.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is my considered view that
the task to cope with this challenge of the times is primarily with the
political departments of our government and not with the judiciary, more </span><span style="">so, </span><span style="">when, as in the particular aspect of governmental powers to solve
social problems, the Constitution itself more than hints a drift along the universal
course I have just pointed out and in unmistakable words allocates such powers
to the legislature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am afraid that </span>if
the opinion of my brethren is pursued to its logical conclusion, there is
danger that the judiciary may be overreaching the traditional boundaries of its
faculties at the expense of the other departments who should be in a better
position than the courts to determine the factual bases of any social action
needed at any given time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the extent,
however, that Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> holds that the
matter of whether or not, <span style="">in a given
case, the expropriation in pursuance of an enabling law expressly stating that
it should be for the purpose of subdividing a land for resale to tenants is
indeed to be done for that specified objective, I agree with my learned
colleague. </span>In other words, in any instance where it is shown that <span style="">contrary </span>to the assumption of
Congress, a land has already been <span style="">subdivided
</span>and all or almost all of it are already the subject of conventional
transactions between the owners and the occupants thereof, even if this happens
after the enactment of the law and its actual implementation, I would hold that
the law is inoperative, or no longer so, but not unconstitutional.</p>

<p class="BODY">With all due respect to the writer of the main opinion whose
prolific pen and capacity to make lengthy <span style="">dissertations
on </span>constitutional rights in the context of the development of political,
social and economic forces, from his own point of view and more, from those of
great legal and judicial exponents thereof, native and foreign, with more of
the latter rather often, is unequalled in this Court, in my humble view, the
questions of property rights involved in this case have been so foreclosed in
the letter of the constitutional <span style="">precept
itself, in its </span>evident spirit and, if recourse to <span style="">it is still </span>needed, in the
deliberations in the constitutional <span style="">convention
</span>of 1934, as to need any lengthy discussion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On these bases, I consider the specific
authority granted under the provision in question as an exception to the Bill
of Rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, it is not alone
the judiciary that can serve as forum for the objections to the exercise of the
power so granted because the landowners concerned can make their
representations before Congress which as I have said is in a better position to
solve social and economic problems.</p>

<p class="BODY">No less than two of the foremost legal luminaries known to the
bench and bar, Delegates <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Orense</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> and Vicente J. Francisco of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city> reminded their colleagues
of the risks to private property rights the envisaged congressional authority
entailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither their lucid
explanations nor their unerring logic could overcome the consensus that was
formed after the appeals of Delegates Miguel <span class="SpellE">Cuaderno</span>
of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place> and <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Saquin</span> of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> to the convention to put an end to the social
problems pointed out in the speech of Delegate <span class="SpellE">Cuaderno</span>
quoted in the main opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Delegate
Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Conejero</span> of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>
tried to help the opponents, and subsequent to the session of January 29, 1935
when the attempt to eliminate or emasculate the proposal was debated, in the
session of the succeeding day, no less than the vice-president of the
convention delivered a privileged speech in a vain effort to turn the
tide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So stirring was the impassioned
speech of Delegate <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Montinola</span>
of <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city> that Delegate <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Kapunan</span> of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place> attempted to move for the
reconsideration of the action taken by the convention the day before, but again
the convention remained immutable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
another parliamentary maneuver, Delegate <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>
Lopez of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> <span style="">tried to </span>reopen the question and upon being upheld by the chair,
occasion arose for Delegates <span class="SpellE">Orense</span>, <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> Sotto of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, <span style="">Lopez </span><span style="">himself, </span><span style="">Jose </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Locsin</span></span><span style=""> of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Brionest</span> </span>of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> to indulge in such an illuminating and instructive
debate on practically all aspects of the matter, embellished by the complete
mastery of language of the speakers, that <span style="">a
</span>reading of these portions of the deliberations should settle all doubts
as to where the heart of the convention was.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">I </span>would have attempted to
follow the usual fashion of quoting choice portions to add force and beauty to
this opinion, but, I have found the try futile, as it would certainly fail to
convey with adequate fidelity the wisdom, the patriotism, <span style="">the </span>social consciousness and the <span class="SpellE">fullsome</span> comprehensiveness of <span style="">the consensus that prevailed, and rather than risking the </span><span style="">pit</span><span style="">fall of projecting individual opinions of particular members, no matter
how prominent and prestigious in talent and love of country or social activism,
as the intent of the convention as a whole, and in order also that all those
who may read the decision and the separate opinions in this case may examine
them from a fairer perspective, and more importantly, so that those who are apprehensive
and jittery about the forthcoming constitutional convention may have an insight
into how Filipinos, once given the responsibility, truly act as such, with only
the interest of the nation uppermost in their minds and </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>hearts, I am making as an annex of this
opinion and an integral part hereof, a scanned <span class="SpellE">Ricohfax</span>
copy of the complete record of the deliberations I have mentioned above which
took place on January 29 and 30, 1935 on the floor of the constitutional
convention of 1934, as they are reported in Vol. VI, pp. 533 to 594 (excluding
pp. 559-564) of the Proceedings of the Philippine Constitutional Convention by
Laurel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, no portion of this
debate should be lost to history and our posterity.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It may just as well be
also stated, at this juncture, in the interest of historical truth, that the
social philosophy underlying the constitutional provision herein involved is
neither new nor purely indigenous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Truth
to tell, the idea of opening public agricultural lands for acquisition, without
compensation in the case of natives who are actual occupants thereof, or lease
by individuals and corporations, with such limited areas </span>as <span style="">to afford as many persons as possible the
opportunity to enjoy such privilege of acquiring or leasing was already in the
first legislative organic law of this country, the Philippine Bill of 1902,
enacted by the Am­erican Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Secs</span>. 14 and 15) Anent the expropriation of private lands,
the Philippine Bill of 1902, in its Section 64 already "authorized"
the government to exercise the right of eminent domain "in respect of any
lands, easements, appurtenances and <span class="SpellE">hereditaments</span>
which, on the thirteenth of August,</span> eighteen hundred and ninety eight,
were owned or held by asso­ciations, corporations, communities, religious
orders, or private individuals in such large tracts or parcels of land <span style="">and in such manner as in the opinion of the
Commission injuriously affect the peace and welfare of the people of the Phil</span>ippine
Islands" and our present Constitution provides <span class="SpellE">parallelly</span>
in Sec. 4, Art. XIII, that "the Congress may authorize, upon payment of
just compensation, the expropriation of lands to be subdivided into small lots
and conveyed at costs to individuals."</p>

<p class="BODY">I would like to close by saying that I consider it necessary to
view the question before Us beyond its socio-economic aspect as such, and to
realize that fundamentally what the Constitution envisages in the precept under
discussion is to bring soonest possible to a reality the slogan of land to the
landless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the jargon of the
activists, the accomplishment of this end is no longer an open option for us,
it is an irreversible commitment unmistakably written by our constituent
fathers.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the result of the main opinion, insofar as it
reverses the decision of the lower Court which granted petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> petition for a writ of prohibition and
permanently enjoined respondents<span style="">-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> </span>from instituting the proceedings for the <span style="">expropriation, </span>of the "<span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span> Estate" as specifically authorized by Republic
Act No. 2616.</p>

<p class="BODY">The result is that respondents may now properly file the corresponding
expropriation proceedings for the expropriation of the "<span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span> Estate".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It will be recalled that in 1961, the Court in G.R. No. L-18128 upheld
the preliminary injunction issued <span style="">by
the lower </span>Court enjoining the filing of such expropriation proceedings,
until decision of the prohibition case on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the various views expressed by the members of the Court
during the deliberations on the case, I gather that our deci­sion now does not
foreclose petitioner from raising in the expro­priation proceedings what it may
deem as proper and valid objections and defenses to the action, including those
it has advanced in the present case, just as respondents may therein adduce
additional facts, besides, those of record, in support of the petition to be
filed by them.</p>

<p class="BODY">To the extent that the main opinion tends to prematurely judge
petitioner's objections and defenses, I reserve my vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do not believe that all the relevant facts
and circumstances are properly and adequately before the Court to enable it to
rule on them now.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For purposes of this
separate opinion, it shall suffice to list the principal issues which should
properly be resolved, in my estimation, in the expropriation proceedings yet to
be instituted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1. To begin with, the question of what remains of the "<span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span> Estate" that may be subjected to expropriation
proceedings has to be threshed out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Solicitor General speculates in his Memorandum (at page 12) that the lower
Court's finding of fact that "only 11. 68% of the Sta. Mesa Heights
Subdivision remained unsold" is "deceptive", because "the
remaining 11. 68% could all be inside the <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span>
Estate." On the other hand, petitioner asserts categorically in its
memorandum (at page 9) that "As a matter of fact, as of <st1:date year="1969" day="17" month="2">February 17, 1969</st1:date>, of the original
area of about 109 hectares, 411,968.80 square meters had already been
sold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that 50,612.30 square
meters are reserved for public parks, 3,724.20 square meters for alleys, and
241,989.50 square meters for streets, only 388,989. 50 square meters, or less
than 39 hectares, remain unsold. "<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the question
of whether there remain "<u>bona</u> <u>fide</u>" occupants on the
property, who are the express beneficiaries of Republic Act 2616 or whether
such occupants are merely illegal squatters and occupants as found by the lower
court in its decision and asserted by petitioner is one of sharp conflict.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these factual
questions should first be determined, be­fore the vital issues of necessity of
the taking and whether it is for the public use, may be resolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do not think that the re-examination of the
<span class="SpellE">Baylosis</span> case can properly be undertaken now without
the relevant facts before us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever
facts these are, as found by the lower court, appear to be adverse to
respondents, but respondents shall have another opportunity at the
expropriation proceedings to establish the necessary facts which could bring
the questioned Act within confines of constitutional limits.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the main opinion
quotes with favor from Justice <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> in the leading
Guido case that "no fixed line of demarcation between what taking is for
public use and what is not can be made; each case has to be judged according to
its peculiar circumstances" and that, "the assertion of the right on
the part of the legislature to take the property of one citizen and transfer it
to another, even for a full compensation, when the public interest is not
promoted thereby, is claiming a despotic power, and one inconsistent with every
just principle and fundamental maxim of a free government. " I share the
view in the dissenting opinion of Justice J.B.L. Reyes that the constitutional
provision is not necessarily limited to landed estates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Article XIII, section 4).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But that case clearly involved agrarian discontent
and with the pertinent facts yet to be established, I am not prepared to say
that it is <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">pari</span></u></span><u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">materia</span></span></u> with the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We must first have the peculiar facts and
circumstances governing the case at bar, before we can judge it.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither do I agree with
the observation that the constitutional power of Congress for the expropriation
of lands is well-nigh all embracing and forecloses the courts from inquiring
into the necessity for the taking of the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is noted that this is the first case where
Congress has singled out a particular property for condemnation under the
constitutional power conferred upon it. Does this square with the due process
and equal protection clauses of the Constitution?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is the explanatory note of the bill later
enacted as Republic Act 2616, without any evidence as to a hearing with the
affected parties having been given the opportunity to be heard, and citing
merely the population increase of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
  City</st1:place></st1:city> and the land-for-the-landless program sufficient
compliance with these basic constitutional guarantees?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, does not the need for a more serious
scrutiny as to the power of Congress to single out a particular piece of
property for expropr<span style="">i</span>ation,
acknowledged in the main opinion, call for judicial scrutiny, with all the
facts in, as to the need for the expropriation for full opportunity to dispute
the legislative appraisal of the matter? And who should bear the burden of
demonstrating that the equal protection guarantee had been observed, the State
or the owner whose property has been singled out?</p>

<p class="BODY">6. Pertinent to note with reference to these questions is the
guideline in the Guido case that "the size of the land expropriated, the
large number of people benefited, and the extent of social and economic reform
secured by the condemnation, clothes the expropriation with public interest and
public use", and the Court's admonition in the subsequent Arellano Law
College case that where such limitations and conditions governing the need of
taking property for public use are not present, "the National Government
may not confer upon its instrumentalities authority (to expropriate) which <span style="">it </span>itself may not exercise. "
This would indicate precisely that where Congress itself directly exercised the
power to expropriate and singles out a specific property under the Act, rather
than have the Executive agencies institute the corresponding expropriation proceeding
under the general laws it has enacted in pursuance of its constitutional power,
the question of its ap<span style="">p</span>raisal of
the necessity and of the validity of its exercise of the authority to
expropriate the specific property is not foreclosed from judicial scrutiny.</p>

<p class="BODY">7. Finally, the main opinion acknowledges that existing contractual
rights that have been acquired by vendor and purchasers of subdivided lots of
the property shall be accorded the appropriate constitutional protection of
non-impairment, at the expropriation proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Importantly related to this unassailable
dictum are questions not founded on primacy of property rights concepts or personal
predilections or private notions of <span class="GramE">policy.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>These concern the fact that the <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span> Estate has been subdivided into lots for sale to
the public, with priority after the passage of Republic Act No. 2616 to the
occupants (and such purchasers <span style="">may have
been </span>theretofore landless themselves), and the Court's reason in
dismissing the action for condemnation in the analogous Urban Estates, Inc.
case that "the people on whose behalf this action has been instituted
could acquire the remaining lots by direct purchase from the defendant like
those (direct) purchasers."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In view of the cardinal principle of eminent domain that just compensation of
the market value of the land must be paid as well as of the constitutional
limitation that the land be conveyed at cost to the individuals concerned,
respondents may well consider that the objectives of the Act may be
accomplished more expeditiously by a direct purchase of the available unsold
lots for resale at cost to the remaining bona fide occupants in accordance with
the Act's provisions or by extending financial assistance to enable them to purchase
directly the unsold lots from petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I do not see anything to be gained by respondents from the institution
of expropriation proceedings, when petitioner-owner is actually selling the
property in subdivided lots.</p>
