				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The facts of this case were stipulated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1954" day="28" month="10">October
 28, 1954</st1:date> <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Sare</span>
imported from <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> two shipments of various
merchandise.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1954" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1954</st1:date> he
again imported from <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> a shipment of various
merchandise.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The corresponding bills of lading and commercial invoices accompanied said
importations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lacking however, were the
import licenses and release certifi­cates required by Central Bank Circulars 44
and 45, and consular invoices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view
of these deficiencies, the three shipments were subjected to seizure and
forfeiture proceedings by the Collector of Customs of Manila for violation of
Central Bank Circulars 44 and 45 in rela­tion to Section 1363(f) of the Revised
Administrative Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cases were
docketed as Seizure Identification Nos. 2112, 2121 and 2134.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the goods were released to <span class="SpellE">Sare</span>
under Surety Bonds PICSC Nos. 151, 154 and 158 of the Pioneer Insurance and
Surety Corporation in the respective amounts of P2,890.69, P2,411.00 and
P4,067.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Customs duties and sales
taxes were paid.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1955" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1955</st1:date>,
after hearing, the Collector of Customs of Manila declared the imported goods
forfeited and since they had already been released he ordered <span class="SpellE">Sare</span> to pay the Government the value thereof in the amount
of P9,368,69.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sare</span>
appealed to the Commissioner of Customs who affirmed the decision of the
Collector of Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not satisfied, <span class="SpellE">Sare</span> appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Tax Appeals sustained the
Commissioner of Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this
appeal to Us.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues are: (1) Is the forfeiture valid?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(2) Did Central Bank Circular 133 repeal
Circulars 44 and 45?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If so, did the
repeal abate the forfeiture?</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Sare</span> maintains that forfeiture of his
goods cannot be ordered inasmuch as Circulars 44 and 45 do not impose
forfeiture for their violation; and, that the goods he imported are not goods
of prohibited importation contem­plated in Section 1363(f) of the Revised
Administrative Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These propositions
had already been rejected by Us in <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> v. The
Commissioner of Customs,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
the facts of which are similar to the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We there said:</p>

<blockquote>"But it is contended that there is no­thing in Circular No. 44
which provides for the seizure of merchandise which may be im­ported in
violation thereof even if it be maintained that the same has been validly
issued and so the seizure of said merchan­dise by the Collector of Customs has
been made without authority of law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, while it is true that said circular does not provide for the
penalty of forfeiture in case of a violation thereof, it is none­theless true
that the same is subject to enforcement by the Bureau of Customs and as such is
deemed part of the customs law un­der Section 1419 of the Revised Administra­tive
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may, therefore, be said that
the shipment in question which was imported in violation of Circular No. 44 is
subject to forfeiture under Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code
which specifical­ly provides that all merchandise imported <u>contrary to law</u>
is subject to forfeiture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
although a circular duly issued is not strictly a statute or a law it has how­ever
the force and effect of law according to the settled jurisprudence in this
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is no point to make a distinction between merchandise
of 'prohibited importa­tion' and those 'imported contrary to law' used in
Section 1363(f) of the Revised Admi­nistrative Code considering that no such
dis­tinction is made in Central Bank Circular No. 44.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This circular punishes the importation of any
merchandise whether prohibited or other­wise if the same is effected without
the re­lease certificate issue by said bank or any of its authorized
agents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The distinction that petitioner
makes is therefore of no legal con­sequence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">We need not say further to dispose of the
same issue raised here.</p>

<p class="BODY">In respect to the question of whether or not Circu­lar 133
repealed Circulars 44 and 45, this Court has ruled that Circular 133 in effect
did not repeal them for the reason that in paragraph 6 thereof it reitera­ted
the requirement of a release certificate.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
We still hold the same view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that Circular 133 did repeal
Circulars 44 and 45, such repeal did not legalize the illegal importations made
before the alleged repeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against appellant.</p>
