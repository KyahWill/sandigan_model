				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Camotes</span> Shipping Corporation
would have us review the decision of the <span class="SpellE">Workmens</span>
Compensation Commission of March 27, 1967 reversing an order of <span style="">dismissal </span>of
an acting referee and sustaining the claim of respondents Julian <span class="SpellE">Otadoy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zoila</span> <span class="SpellE">Garciano</span> arising from the death of their son <span class="SpellE">Felino</span> <span class="SpellE">Otadoy</span> who was lost at sea
while in the employ of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
the attack on the above decision primarily centered, as noted in petitioner's
brief, on the substantiality and sufficiency of the evidence, and considering
further that there was a failure to controvert in time, there was no justification
for the reversal sought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">As noted in the aforesaid decision under review, respondents, on
July 31, 1964, filed a notice and claim for compensation alleging that their
son, <span class="SpellE">Felino</span> <span class="SpellE">Otadoy</span>, while
in the employ of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Camotes</span> Shipping
Corporation, was, on the night of July 13, 1964, on board its vessel Ave Maria
II, but upon arrival the next morning in <span class="SpellE">Poro</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cebu</span></span><span style="">, he </span>could not be found, having
disappeared and presumably drowned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
copy of such notice and claim was sent to petitioner on <st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1964</st1:date>, but it was not until two months
and five days later, on October 15, that the employee's report was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing before the acting referee at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
respondents presented their evidence with petitioner filing a motion to dismiss
on the ground <span style="">of </span>in sufficiency
of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was sustained by the
acting referee, but on appeal to the <span class="SpellE">Workmens</span>
Compensation Commission primarily on the issue of the substantiality of the
evidence adduced, the decision now sought to be reviewed was entered sustaining
the claim of respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is expressly stated in the decision now sought to be reviewed
that there was a conclusive showing "that <span class="SpellE">Felino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Otadoy</span> was with the respondent's Ave Maria II when it
sailed from <span class="SpellE">Poro</span> to <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>
on <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On its return trip from <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
to <span class="SpellE">Poro</span>, via <span class="SpellE">Mandawe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Otadoy</span> was still aboard the boat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was even requested by <span class="SpellE">Teresito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Baidal</span>, one of the boat passengers who boarded at <span class="SpellE">Mandawe</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>,
for something to eat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was on the
night of <st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="7">July 13, 1964</st1:date> when
the boat lifted anchor from <span class="SpellE">Mandawe</span> on its way to <span class="SpellE">Poro</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another
passenger, <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabroa</span>,
said that <span class="SpellE">Otadoy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Baidal</span>
and he slept together on the roof of the boat on the night of said July
13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As there was a slight drizzle, they
had to go down the deck to look for some other place to resume their
sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the boat reached <span class="SpellE">Poro</span> on the early morning of <st1:date year="1964" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1964</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Baidal</span>, while
still aboard the boat, tried to look for <span class="SpellE">Otadoy</span> to
ask for coffee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, he could not find
<span class="SpellE">Otadoy</span> <span class="GramE">so,</span> he boarded the
rowboat that carried passengers <span style="">from
the Ave Maria II to the </span><span style="">shore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fabroa</span> likewise
stated that </span><span style="">from the time <span class="SpellE">Otadoy</span> and he separated at the roof </span><span style="">of the </span><span style="">boat he did not see <span class="SpellE">Otadoy</span> again."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Reference was likewise made to another
witness, Vicente Ale, who "stated that on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="14" month="7"><span style="">July 14, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, he went to the wharf at <span class="SpellE">Poro</span>
purposely to look for <span class="SpellE">Otadoy</span> for the medicine which
his sick father had requested <span class="SpellE">Otadoy</span> to buy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He arrived at the wharf ahead of the arrival
of the Ave Maria II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the Ave Maria
II docked, he looked for <span class="SpellE">Otadoy</span> from among the
passengers that were being rowed from the Ave Maria II by means of a rowboat to
the shore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, he failed to find <span class="SpellE">Otadoy</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So he
boarded the rowboat and went aboard the Ave Maria II to continue his search for
<span class="SpellE">Otadoy</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again,
he did not see <span class="SpellE">Otadoy</span>."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion flowing from the above is set forth in the
decision under review thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"These
overwhelming circumÂ­stantial evidence on the unexplained disappearance of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Otadoy</span></span><span style=""> </span>while aboard Ave Maria II, plus the
inherent impossibility for him to leave the boat voluntarily while the boat was
sailing on the high sea between <span class="SpellE">Mandawe</span> and <span class="SpellE">Poro</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, the fact that he
could not be found dead or alive notwithstanding the diligent efforts of his
parents to locate him, the failure of the respondent to establish that he was
alive, are more than sufficient to support the inference that he fell into the
sea and was drowned and said incident was not noticed by anybody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, inasmuch, as, at the time of his disappearance,
<span class="SpellE">Otadoy</span> was in the course of his employment with the
respondent, his dependent parents should be entitled to the benefits provided
by the Act."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> (Phil.) Inc. v. Villanueva<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
comes to mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The fact that the employee was found
missing while on board the petitioner's vessel MV '<span class="SpellE"><span style="">C</span>altex</span> Mindanao' became known
to the captain of the vessel on 10 October <span style="">1956 </span>but it was only on 6 November 1956 when the petitioner
transmitted to the respondent Commission WCC Form No. 3 stating that the employee
was 'lost at <span style="">sea
</span>and presumed dead as of October 10, <span style="">1956,' </span>and that it was <span class="SpellE">controverting</span>
the respondent's claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> of the claim having been made beyond the
period provided for by the law and the rules, the petitioner should have stated
under oath the reasons for his failure to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having failed to comply with this
requirement, the petitioner is deemed to have renounced its right to controvert
the respondent's claim, the claim may be considered <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>
and the regional administrator may adjudicate the respondent's claim on the
basis of the evidence at hand."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>

<span style="">we </span>categorically affirmed that

With the summary above made of the evidence offered and the careful analysis of
its implications so evident in the decision now under review, it would be
unwarranted to indulge petitioner in its plea for a reversal.</p>
