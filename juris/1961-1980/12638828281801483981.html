father and son, were prosecuted and thereafter convicted of murder, apparently
was motivated by the firm determination of the father that the prospective
marriage between his daughter, <span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span>, and the
deceased should not take place as the parents of the deceased "were
engaged in the practice of witchcraft and sorcery."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
From the judgment of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
with all the accessory penalties as well as the indemnification to the heirs of
the deceased in the amount of P12,000.00, they appealed to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plea for reversal is anchored on the
constitutional presumption of innocence,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
which, according to them, had not been overcome, the first two errors assigned
being that their guilt had not been shown beyond reasonable doubt and that the
element of moral certainty as to their participation in the crime charged was
lacking, with the third impugning the actuation of the lower court for lending
credence to the testimony of the prosecution and disregarding that of the
defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The task before this Court then
is to examine with care the evidence of record and to ascertain whether the
lower court arrived at its decision contrary to the above mandate of the fundamental
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be admitted that the
counsel for appellants, Attorney Luis V. <span class="SpellE">Diores</span>,
submitted an exhaustive brief to sustain such a contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his valiant attempt to demonstrate that
culpability beyond reasonable doubt had not been shown, he tried to discredit
the testimony of the two principal witnesses, one of whom directly saw the gory
event and the other saw the appellants at the scene of the tragedy, by
assailing their credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
difficulty confronting counsel is thus apparent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has consistently adhered to the
doctrine of according respect to findings of fact of the trial judge, unless it
could be shown that a fact or circumstance has been overlooked or has been
misinterpreted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More specifically, as
far as this case is concerned, with such positive identification of the
appellants as the perpetrators of the act, along with the third accused, <span class="SpellE">Gaudioso</span> <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span>, still at large at
the time of the trial, the task of overturning their conviction is far from
easy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under such circumstances, the
defense of alibi, as repeatedly held by this Tribunal, is futile and
unavailing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A thorough scrutiny of the
records of the case, in the light of controlling principles, does not call for
a reversal.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the evidence of the prosecution, it was shown that the
deceased <span class="SpellE">Ptolomeo</span> <span class="SpellE">Talisic</span>,
sometime in <st1:date year="1968" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1968</st1:date>,
accompanied by <span class="SpellE">Sulpicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Antolihao</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> <span class="SpellE">Ubay</span>, went to
the house of appellant Vicente <span class="SpellE">Mahinay</span>, the father of
<span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span> <span class="SpellE">Mahinay</span>, his
sweetheart the past four years, the purpose being to ask for her hand in
marriage.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
They were informed by him that he would give them his answer the next day, and
accordingly they came back the next morning.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Mahinay</span>, who was contacted in his farm, gave
a negative answer; he was opposed to his daughter <span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span>
marrying <span class="SpellE">Ptolomeo</span>, the reason given being his belief
that the <span class="SpellE">Talisic</span> family was engaged in the practice
of witchcraft and sorcery.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
That did not deter the family of the deceased from renewing on <st1:date year="1968" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1968</st1:date>, again with the
help of <span class="SpellE">Ubay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Antolihao</span>,
the proposal of marriage, but the father was adamant in his refusal.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The daughter, <span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span>, was of a different mind; she
confided to <span class="SpellE">Antolihao</span> that regardless of the wishes
of her father, she would marry <span class="SpellE">Ptolomeo</span> in the month
of January, 1969.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1968</st1:date>, at
about four in the afternoon, <span class="SpellE">Ptolomeo</span> saw <span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span> at the Carbon market at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>;
they agreed to meet at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Cotcot</span> which was then
celebrating its barrio fiesta.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span> went home and, together with her aunt, <span class="SpellE">Ildefonsa</span> <span class="SpellE">Mahinay</span>, proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Cotcot</span>, where they were together until about seven-thirty
in the evening, when they parted company, it turned out for the last time.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
That same evening of December 29, 1968, the spouses Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Longakit</span>
and Esperanza <span class="SpellE">Tundag</span>, coming from <span class="SpellE">Cotcot</span>
and proceeding towards their house et <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balingasao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cotcot</span>, <span class="SpellE">Liloan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, were traversing a
trail via <span class="SpellE">Mahayahay</span> when they heard a man's shout for
help, apparently from a distance of about twelve arms-length.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Leaving his wife, Esperanza, and proceeding to the place where the voice came
from, he saw from a distance of about five-arms length, <span class="SpellE">Ptolomeo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Talisic</span> with his right hand being held by appellant
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Mahinay</span> and his left hand by appellant Isidro
<span class="SpellE">Mahinay</span> while <span class="SpellE">Gaudioso</span> <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span> was striking <span class="SpellE">Ptolomeo</span> with
a piece of wood.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
He fell down, and the two appellants, father and son, with <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span>,
continued attacking him.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Apprehensive for his own safety, <span class="SpellE">Longakit</span> returned to
the place where he left his wife and told her to rush back home.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1969" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1969</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Talisic</span>, a brother of <span class="SpellE">Ptolomeo</span>, was informed by another brother, Alfredo, that
the deceased did not come home after attending the <span class="SpellE">Cotcot</span>
fiesta on <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1968</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> and Alfredo proceeded to the house of the <span class="SpellE">Mahinays</span>, where <span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span> and her
aunt, <span class="SpellE">Ildefonsa</span>, informed them that they were with <span class="SpellE">Ptolomeo</span> when they went home from <span class="SpellE">Cotcot</span>,
even adding that they invited <span class="SpellE">Ptolomeo</span> to stay with
them overnight and to go home only the next morning.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
The two ladies, replying to the inquiry of the <span class="SpellE">Talisic</span>
brothers, said that <span class="SpellE">Ptolomeo</span> was not in the house.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
It was the brother, <span class="SpellE">Matias</span>, who not being satisfied
with the answer given by them, went back later to the <span class="SpellE">Mahinay</span>
residence and noticed at a distance of thirty meters a two-foot long wooden
club, a cigarette pack with sticks of cigarettes inside, and overturned stones.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
When he arrived at the house of the <span class="SpellE">Mahinays</span>, he saw
Vicente and he inquired about the whereabouts of <span class="SpellE">Ptolomeo</span>,
receiving the reply from the latter that he did not know, coupled with the
suggestion that a telegram should be sent to <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Quite worried about his brother's fate, he decided to keep on looking.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
The search for <span class="SpellE">Ptolomeo</span> <span class="SpellE">Talisic</span>
ended on <st1:date year="1969" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1969</st1:date>
when his dead body was discovered in the farm of <span class="SpellE">Gaudioso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jayme</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
The police and a doctor were summoned to the place to conduct an investigation
and autopsy.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant Vicente <span class="SpellE">Mahinay</span> arrived at the scene of the
exhumation at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">five o'clock</st1:time> in
the afternoon and immediately he said, "That shirt is mine,"
referring to the sweater which was found near the body of <span class="SpellE">Ptolomeo</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
He also prodded the policeman who was then at the scene of the exhumation to
immediately arrest <span class="SpellE">Gaudioso</span> <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span>,
his own nephew, who was reared by and lived with him until marriage, as the
person responsible for the killing of <span class="SpellE">Ptolomeo</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
The sweater and the shoes which were found near the body of <span class="SpellE">Ptolomeo</span>
were given by Vicente to <span class="SpellE">Gaudioso</span> <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span>
when the latter was still living with Vicente.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon the discovery of <span class="SpellE">Ptolomeo's</span> body, <span class="SpellE">Gaudioso</span> disappeared from the barrio and his whereabouts
had not been found.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
The autopsy conducted on the body of <span class="SpellE">Ptolomeo</span><a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
revealed that the victim died between five to six days before the date of the
autopsy on <st1:date year="1969" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His death thus occurred on or before <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1968</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was on the basis of such evidence that the conviction of
appellants was predicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
thirty-page decision<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
of Judge Francisco Ro.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cupin</span> is notable for the care and circumspection with which
the respective versions of the prosecution and defense were appraised and
analyzed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted at the outset, there
is no justification for a reversal.</p>

<blockquote>1. It is readily apparent why the brief for appellants in their
first two assignments of errors alleged that their guilt had not been proved
beyond reasonable doubt and that there was no moral certainty as to their
participation in the offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For prior
to the presumption of innocence being expressly embodied in the 1935
Constitution,<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
the controlling rule of evidence was that there must be a showing beyond
reasonable doubt of the culpability of the person accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As set forth in the opinion of Justice Trent
in the leading case of United States v. <span class="SpellE">Lasada</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
a 1910 decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is incumbent
upon the prosecution to establish the guilt of the defendant beyond a
reasonable doubt, and if there remains a reasonable doubt as to his guilt or
innocence this doubt must be resolved in his favor and he must be
acquitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By reasonable doubt is not
meant that which of possibility may arise, but it is that doubt endangered by
an investigation of the whole proof and an inability, after such investigation,
to let the mind rest easy upon the certainty of guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Absolute certainty of guilt is not demanded
by the law to convict of any criminal charge but moral certainty is required,
and this certainty is required as to every proposition of proof requisite to
constitute the offense."<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
As a matter of fact, in the first case after the 1935 Constitution, relying on
the constitutional presumption of innocence, People v. <span class="SpellE">Dalmani</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
Justice Laurel relied on the <span class="SpellE">Lasada</span> doctrine:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"There are, however, facts and
circumstances of record which considered in isolation may seem unimportant, but
if taken together and considered in the light of certain events now to be
referred to, are sufficient to raise in the mind of this court a grave doubt as
to the guilt of the defendant-appellant <span class="SpellE">Dalmani</span>,
'that doubt en­dangered by an investigation of the whole proof and an inability
after such investigation, to let the mind rest easy upon the certainty of
guilt."<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
In two other cases, People v. Peralta,<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
and People v. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
the then Justice, later Chief Justice, Moran, in acquitting the accused in both
instances, spoke of this Court being unable "with a peaceful mind" in
the former, and letting its mind "rest at ease" in the latter to
explain why such Consti­tutional presumption of innocence had not been
overcome.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. Even a cursory reading of the appealed decision would readily
disclose why the trial judge reached the conclusion that the guilt of
appellants was proved beyond reasonable doubt, the stage of moral certainty
being reached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact,
there was reference to such a question in the appealed decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Was the evidence of the prosecution
sufficient enough to establish the guilt of the accused for the commission of
the crime of murder beyond a shade of doubt?"<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, he made clear that as the prosecution, in his own language,
"leaned heavily on the testimonies" of the eyewitnesses, Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Longakit</span> and the witness Vicente <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>
who, while not seeing the perpetration of the act, saw the two appellants with
the other accused leading a <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> on the top of
which was the body of a man at the scene of the crime, "it is incumbent
upon the Court to evaluate their respective declarations with caution."<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
That norm of conduct he did observe; in the next pages of the decision, there
was a careful analysis of the defense raised by appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only then did he state why a finding of guilt
against them is justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"After a careful review of the evidence
and mature deliberation, the Court is definitely convinced that the accused had
been sufficiently identified to have committed the crime charged in the
information, and that they should be held liable for the death of <span class="SpellE">Ptolomeo</span> <span class="SpellE">Talisic</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court is persuaded by the evidence on
record that prosecution witness Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Longakit</span> saw
the accused Vicente <span class="SpellE">Mahinay</span>, Isidro <span class="SpellE">Mahinay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gaudioso</span> <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span> beat and club to death <span class="SpellE">Ptolomeo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Talisic</span> at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>
of <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1968</st1:date>, in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mahayahay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Liloan</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact was corroborated by another
witness, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>, who saw the same three
accused passed by leading a <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> with the body of
a man loaded on the back of a <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that there were inconsistencies
and discrepancies extracted by the accused from the witnesses for the
prosecution on cross-examination, the Court has observed that these were minor
matters and not very material to the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, if the prosecution witnesses' testimony at times varied at
length, the fact was that they were sufficiently explained on redirect and on
rebuttal; they could easily reconcile the alleged discrepancies to the material
points raised in the case at bar."<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nor did the trial judge stop there:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The Court believes that credence should
be given more weight in favor of the government witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, no motive has been shown
why they should fabricate the facts and foist a very serious crime against the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the identification of
the accused by prosecution witnesses Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Longakit</span>
and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span> were clear and positive,
considering that they had the best oppor­tunity for observation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only that, these prosecution witnesses
have known for quite a long time all the accused considering that they live in
the same place and being familiar with their movements, their figures, and the
manners and peculiarities of their individual personalities, these must have
been literally burned into their memory to enable them to identify the accused
vividly with confidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Following the
argument of the defense that these two prosecution witnesses had shown serious
discrepancies and contradictions in their testimonies on the witness stand, it
is the opinion of the court that even the most intelligent witnesses commit
inconsistencies and discrepancies as to a particular fact, but this does not
necessarily render such testimony unworthy of credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, our Supreme Court has consistently
held:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Where the testimony of a witness
is in conflict in some of its details with her extrajudicial confession due to
her imperfect memory in matters of detail and also to the lengthy
cross-examination to which she was subjected by a renowned and justly feared
criminal lawyer, but the contradictions in important parts have been
satisfactorily explained by her and on the whole her statement agree as to the
main and ultimate facts the testimony of the witness may be given weight.'
(People vs. Go, et al., 38 Phil. 203, 213)."<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>1. Clearly then, the first two assignments of error that there was
no showing of guilt beyond reasonable doubt and that the stage of moral
certainty was not reached find no support in the evidence of record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the facts as testified to by disinterested
witnesses, possessed of a high persuasive quality, the insistence on the
constitutional presumption of innocence is futile.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. It is likewise evident considering the foregoing, that there is
no basis for the third assignment of error that the lower court should not have
given credence to the testimony for the prosecution and should not have
disregarded the evidence for the defense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A rational mind bent on objectively appraising the matter would have
reached the same conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was
testified to by the prosecution was clearly deserving of belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This observation found in the decision would
further bolster the stand of the trial judge:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Besides, the Court has observed the behavior of the accused which
was unusual and inconsistent with human experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their actions betray their guilty
conscience."<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>
Again, an excerpt from the opinion of Justice Trent in <span class="SpellE">Lasada</span>
would demonstrate how well-grounded in the law was the actuation of the lower
court:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The trial judge had an
opportunity to see these witnesses, hear them testify, and observe their
demeanor on the witness stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
one of the best ways of determining the credibility of a witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing all these witnesses testify he
was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the witnesses for the prosecution
testified the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of these
facts we must give great weight to the findings made by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We only have the record, and, as we have
said, the testimony for the prosecution is reasonable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is direct and positive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the clear and explicit findings
made by the trial court, and after a careful consideration of the testimony
presented, we are fully satisfied that the defendant is guilty of this
crime."<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>3. That is the norm invariably followed by this Court since
then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a restatement of such a
principle in a fairly recent decision, People v. <span class="SpellE">Carandang</span>:<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a>
"Thus in People v. <span class="SpellE">Angcap</span>, it was said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'There is need to stress anew that this Court
has long been committed to the principle that the determination by a trial
judge who could weigh and appraise the testimony as to the facts duly proved is
entitled to the highest respect, unless it could be shown that he ignored or
dis­regarded circumstances of weight or influence sufficient to call for a
different finding.' So it was announced by Justice Moreland in 1915 in one of
the first cases of consequence enunciating such a doctrine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he pointed out, in the event of a conflict
in the testimony of the witnesses, "the peculiar province of the trial
court is to resolve the question of credibility, and, unless there is something
in the record impeaching by fair interpretation the resolution of the trial
court in relation to that question, this court will assume that he acted
fairly, justly, and legally in the exercise of that function." So it has
been since then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a case reported in
the latest volume of the Philippine Reports, Justice <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>,
speaking for this Court succinctly stated "that with respect to the
credibility of witnesses, the trial court's findings and conclusions, command
great respect and weight." Its more usual formulation was also set forth
by Justice Malcolm in these words:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"After everything is said and done, we come back, as we invariably
do in cases of this nature, to a recognition of the rule that the Supreme Court
will not interfere with the judgment of the trial court in passing on the
credibility of the opposing witnesses, unless there appears in the record some
fact or circumstances of weight and influence, which has been overlooked or the
significance of which has been misinterpreted."<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>4. Lastly, there is the defense of alibi, certainly in the light of
so many past decisions hardly sufficient to call for a reversal of the
conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another excerpt from People
v. <span class="SpellE">Carandang</span> is relevant:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Nor is their case for a reversal bolstered
by their plea of alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not to
lose sight of the fact that the presence elsewhere of the accused would
preclude their participation in a crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such a fact, if there be such, has to be shown though by evidence that
commands assent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately for
appellants in this case, they were unable to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The categorical nature of the identification
made by the offended spouses placed a burden on them too difficult to overcome
by the allegation that they could not have been the perpetrators of the foul
deed."<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a>
The case for the prosecution was stronger in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants were identified by disinterested
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matter was more
succinctly put in People v. <span class="SpellE">Berame</span>:<a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a>
