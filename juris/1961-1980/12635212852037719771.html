				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Submitted for resolution are the motion for reconsideration of
the decision of this Court in this case, filed by the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
and adopted by respondent Com­mission on Elections, and the other motion to the
same effect and practically on the same grounds of the re­spondents Chief
Accounting Officer and Auditor of the Constitutional Convention of 1971, both
seasonably answered by petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision sought to be reconsidered holds as null and void
Organic Resolution No. 1 of the Conven­tion which proposes the amendment of
Section 1 of Art­icle V of the Constitution by reducing the age require­ment
for voters therein from 21 to 18 years, "without prejudice to other
amendments that will he proposed in the future by the 1971 Constitutional
Convention on other portions of the amended section or on other portions of the
entire Constitution", and provides further that said proposed amendment
shall be submitted for ratification or rejection by the people in a plebiscite
to be held coincident with the forthcoming election of senators and local officials
on November 8, 1971, and finally appropriates part of the funds of the Conven­tion
for the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In brief, the said
decision is based on the ground that, having in view the obvious reasons
underlying the provisions of Section 1 of Art­icle XV of the Constitution which
prescribe the proce­dure of amending the fundamental law, aside, of course,
from the ordinary import of its language, the Court is convinced that said
provisions do not permit the hold­ing of more than one "election" or
plebiscite for the submission to the people of any and all of the amend­ments
to be proposed by the present convention and this, We say, is without
considering anymore the fact that the proposed amendment in question is
expressly saddled with reservations which naturally impair, in great measure,
its very essence as a proposed constitutional amendment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Reconsideration of this decision is now sought on the following
grounds:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That inasmuch as Congress, acting as a consti­tuent
assembly, can submit to a plebiscite, whether, singly or together, the
constitutional amendments it may propose, the Convention being <u>at</u> <u>par</u>
with such con­stituent assembly must also be considered as having such power;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the phrase "at an election" in
Section 1 of Article XV of the Constitution does not necessarily mean only one
plebiscite but may be construed as signi­fying several plebiscites, because
there is jurispru­dence holding that a word in singular in a statute or
constitution may be understood in the plural;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the question of whether or not the
Convention should submit the amendments it may propose in a single plebiscite
or otherwise is a matter that goes in­to the wisdom of the action of the
Convention rather than to its authority or power, hence outside the pale of judicial
review;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that, in relation to the point in the deci­sion
to the effect that the proposed amendment in ques­tion regarding the reduction
of the voting age in the Philippines has no frame of reference on which the
voters at the projected plebiscite may base their judgment as to its
acceptability, there is no need of such frame of re­ference because the
proposed amendment "is a simple fix­ing (lowering) of the minimum voting
age from 21 to 18," and "it is difficult to conceive of any possible
future amendments where (sic) this fixed voting age could be out of tune"
and hard to "imagine how this amendment on this minimum voting age could
conceivably be better understood if presented together with the various sub­stantial
and fundamental amendments in the whole draft when concluded."</p>

<p class="BODY">The rest of the motion of <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
deals with the additional arguments discussed in the separate con­curring
opinion of Justices J. B. L. Reyes, <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>, Castro
and <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After full and serious consideration of the above grounds and the
arguments adduced in support thereof, together with the answer thereto of
petitioner, the Court does not find sufficient cause to alter or modify its rul­ings
on the points covered by the motions for reconsider­ation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ironically for respondents and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>, as will be presently demonstrated, the points
now being raised by them serve to <span class="SpellE">reenforce</span> rather
than to destroy the bases of said rulings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Importantly, before discussing the arguments of the parties, it
is well to emphasize that respondents and <span class="SpellE">in­tervenors</span>
impliedly, if not expressly, admit now that the provisions of Section 1 of
Article XV of the Constitution, dealing with the procedure or manner of
amending the fun­damental law, are binding upon the Convention and the other
departments of the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must
be added that, as well pointed out by petitioner in his answer to the motions
for reconsideration, they are no less binding upon the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The preamble of the Constitution says that
the Constitution has been ordained by the "Filipino people, imploring the
aid of Divine Providence." Section 1 of Article XV is nothing more than a
part of the Constitution thus ordained by the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, in con­struing said section, <span class="GramE">We</span> must read it as if the people had said, "This
Constitution may he amended, but it is our will that the amendment must be
proposed and submitted to Us for ratification only in the manner herein
provided." This is not to say that the people may not, in the exer­cise of
their inherent revolutionary powers, amend the Constitution or promulgate an
entirely new one otherwise, but as long as any amendment is formulated and
submitted under the aegis of the present Charter, any resolution for the
submission of any such amendment which is not in confor­mity with the letter,
spirit and intent of the provisions of the Charter for effecting amendments,
cannot receive the sanction of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, the real issue here cannot be whether or not the amending
process delineated by the present Constitution may be disregarded in favor of
allowing the sovereign people to express their decision on the proposed
amendments, if only because it is evident that the very idea of departing from
the fundamental law is ana­chronistic in the realm of constitutionalism and
repugnant to the essence of the rule of law; rather, it is whether or not the
provisional nature of the proposed amendment and the manner of its submission
to the people for rati­fication or rejection conform with the mandate of the
peo­ple themselves in such regard, as expressed in the Consti­tution
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the inescapable
function of the Court in this case is to determine <span class="GramE">what is
the pro­per construction of Section 1 of Article XV,</span> and, <span class="SpellE">corolla­rily</span>, to declare whether CC Organic Resolution No.
1 falls within or without said construction.</p>

<p class="BODY">As already stated, <span class="SpellE">movants</span> claim that
inasmuch as<i> </i>Congress, as a constituent assembly, has the power to submit
amendments proposed by it in a piece-meal manner for ratification, it follows
that the Convention, which is at par with said assembly, also has such
power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fault in this posture lies in
the simple fact that the factual truth and legal correctness of its major
premise are assumed, and it happens that after mature study, <span class="GramE">We</span>
find that said premise suffers from inaccuracy, factual­ly and legally.</p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, in trying to draw a parallelism bet­ween the
Convention, on the one hand, and the Congress, as a constituent assembly, on
the other, <span class="SpellE">movants</span> would ignore, at the same time,
the distinction, between Congress as the Legislature and Congress acting in its
capacity as a, constituent body. Although Congress as the Legislature is a
continuing body, factually and in contemplation of law, it is not so whenever
it sits in its capacity as a constituent assembly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the latter instance, its juridical
existence as such is coextensive only with the legal duration of the joint
session assembled to perform any particular work of proposing amendments to the
Constitution. Each of such joint sessions ad­journs finally after it has
approved its proposal or proposals and becomes <span class="SpellE"><u>functus</u></span>
<u>officio</u> thereafter in order to give way to the submission of its
proposal or proposals to the people. In the juridical sense, each such joint
session is a constitutional convention in it­self, distinct and separate from
the others of similar nature, and may be distinguished from the convention <u>per</u>
<u>se</u>, like the current one, only in that the latter is constituted upon the
election of delegates by the people, whereas the constituent assembly of
Congress constitutes itself upon mere concurrent resolution of the two Houses
to such effect passed by simple majority vote of the respective members
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, while Congress
may easily reconvene as another constituent body after it has finally adjourned
as such, from the very nature of its existence, such cannot be done by a
convention, since in the case of the latter, a new call for election of
delegates who would compose a new Constitutional Convention would be needed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It can thus be seen that the submission by Con­gress of proposed
amendments after each final adjourn­ment of its joint constituent session, and
not before such adjournment, is conclusive proof, not of the legal possibility
of piece-meal submission of proposed amend­ments to the people by Congress,
but, on the contrary, of the validity of the proposition that the constituent
assembly has to become <span class="SpellE"><u>functus</u></span> <u>officio</u>
first before the Constitutional amendments it proposes may be submitted to the
people for ratification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the
holding of a plebiscite only after every joint constituent session of Congress
has already approved all its proposed amendments to the Constitution is not in
any sense a piece-meal submission of such amendments, but rather the whole­sale
submission thereof, since they would be all that the particular assembly
approving them wants to propose, irrespective of their actual number, whether
one or more than one.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's well-reasoned discussion of this point, albeit
confined to theoretical rationalization, could sufficiently refute <span class="SpellE">movants</span>' contentions, but a little bit of historical
exposition should serve to lay the matter in issue at rest on more solid
ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incident ally, in the same
manner that <span class="SpellE">movants</span> have not cited any specific
factual basis for their pose, petitioner's answer is silent as to the facts
extant in the Congressional records relative to the important issue under
discussion.</p>

<p class="BODY">What do the congressional records reveal in his regard?</p>

<p class="BODY">Since its ratification on May 14, 1935, the Philip­pine
Constitution has been amended three times, not counting, of course, the
unsuccessful attempt in that direction caused by the rejection by the people of
the two amendments proposed by the constituent Congress in 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These amendments were approved in 1939, 1940
and 1947.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 7, 1939, the Congress of the United States passed the <span class="SpellE">Tydings-Koscialkowski</span> Bill providing for terms of the trade
relation between the United States and the Philippines purportedly improving
those contained in the Philippine Independence Act and requir­ing that, in
order that said terms may become effective on January 1, 1940, the ordinance
appended to the Cons­titution should be correspondingly amended to include them
not later than January 1, 1940.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
meanwhile, earlier in the same year 1939, agitations had started already for
the possible extension of the term of Pre­sident <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
which was to expire, under the original Constitution, in 1941.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The idea snowballed steadily, such that in
the convention of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party assembled on
July 7 and 8, 1939, it was resolved to request the National Assembly to meet as
a constituent body to propose three amendments to the Constitution,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) to change the term of the
President from six years without reelection to four years with one re­election;
(2) to restore the bicameral system of legis­lature; and (3) to establish a
constitutional commis­sion on elections. Taking advantage of the approval of the
<span class="SpellE">Tydings-Koscialkowski</span> Act on <st1:date year="1939" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1939</st1:date>, Presi­dent <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
called the National Assembly to a special session purposely to consider
proposals to amend the Constitution, not only to comply with the said American
law but also to act on the request contained in the above-mentioned resolution
of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party convention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The response of the National Assembly was
rather fast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1939" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1939</st1:date>, all four proposed amendments
were approved in two separate resolutions, Nos. 38 and 39, (a) the proposed
amendment of the <u>Or­dinance</u> being embodied in Resolution No. 39 and (b)
the three other proposals for amendment of the <u>Constitution</u> in
Resolution No. 38. Four days later, on Sep­tember 19, 1939, the National
Assembly, acting this time as the Legislature, approved Commonwealth Act 492,
providing for the submission of the foregoing approved proposals to amend the
Constitution to the people in two separate plebiscites, (a) Resolution No. 39
in the first to be held on October 24, 1939 and (b) Resolution No. 38 in the
second scheduled to coincide with the following election of local officials in
1940.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, inasmuch as strong public
opinion developed against the submittal of the three amendments proposed in
Resolution No. 38 in one single question, the National Assembly had to recon­vene
as a constituent body to make the corresponding chan­ges in the wording of the
proposals in such a way that the three proposed amendments could be embodied in
three sepa­rate questions and thereby make it possible for any of them to be
accepted or rejected independently of any of the other two.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus on <st1:date year="1940" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1940</st1:date>, the amendatory Resolution No. 73 was
approved, and shortly thereafter, the Legislature enacted Commonwealth Act 517
correspondingly amending Com­monwealth Act 492 and advancing at the same time
the second plebiscite to <st1:date year="1940" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1940</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three amendment proposals were all
ratified at this plebiscite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
meanwhile the proposed amendment of the Ordinance to the Constitution proposed
in Resolution No. 39 was ratified by the people on the previously scheduled
plebiscite on <st1:date year="1939" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1939</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The third amendment ratified on <st1:date year="1947" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1947</st1:date> was in connection with the added provision
of the Ordinance appen­ded to the Constitution granting parity rights to the Ame­ricans.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this historical account, it does appear that fact­ually, the
National Assembly sought to submit several pro­posed amendments approved by it
in a single session as a constituent body separately or "piece-meal"
in two separate plebiscites or elections a little reflection will reveal that
what actually happened in 1939 cannot be invoked to justify the proposed
plebiscite now in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Our decision, <span class="GramE">We</span> held that the legal
objection to a piece-meal submission of the proposed amendment is that it does
not provide the people with a frame of re­ference on the basis of which they
can determine the acceptability of the proposal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More specifically, since the proposed
reduction of the voting age to eight­een years cannot apply to the forthcoming
election, of November 8, 1971 and could hardly have any relevance to the
framework and principles of the present Constitu­tion, considering that these
are precisely being the subject also of proposed changes in the Convention, the
result is that the proposed amendment is completely an isolated one which
cannot even be related to the amend­ed or new constitution which the Convention
will pro­pose, for the simple reason that, as things now stand in the
Convention; no one can foretell what shape, color or size the other amendments
will have.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, as indicated in Our
decision, and as thoroughly dis­cussed in the deliberations of the Court,
properly ana­lyzed, the proposed amendment in question cannot in truth be
considered as a complete one, but merely as a fractional, provisional and
incomplete proposal that hardly qualifies to be a part of the fundamental law
of the land, which is the embodiment of permanence, defi­niteness, security and
stability in all that it embra­ces, for the better protection and enjoyment of
all the people under it, considering that the proposed amend­ment is coupled
with express and implied reservations,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the specific extent and magnitude of which are not pos­sible to define, delimit
and delineate, on the basis of what appears on the face of the Convention's
reso­lution, in a manner that would give the voter a clear and definite idea of
what the exact amendment would lat­er on turn out to be, and thus enable him to
make an intelligent decision, which is what the Constitution con­templates as
indispensable in any plebiscite for the amendment thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">All these shortcomings were absent in the 1939 proposals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, there was no idea then of
completely overhauling the Constitution outside of the specific areas of the
presidency, Congress and the Commission on Elections covered by amendatory
Resolution No. 73. Consequently, the existing Constitution was readily the
frame of reference of all the proposed amendments, which could, therefore, be
studied and judged in the light of the other parts of the whole
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, all the proposed
amendments then were complete and in final form before they were submitted to
the people, unlike the one here in ques­tion which, as already discussed, is
fractional and conditional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thirdly, the
proposed amendment related to the Ordinance appended to the Constitution was no
less than an ineluctable imposition of the sovereign power, the United States
of America, which imposition, if not yielded to, would cost the loss of
preferential treatment of our country in the American trade market, something
which our leaders at that time considered, rightly, or, wrongly, as essential
to our national eco­nomy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in a
sense, it was psychologically de­sirable that said imposition was separated
from the op­tional proposals to avoid mistaking the latter as being also
obligatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, there was the
element of time; the United States Congress gave the Philippines only up to
January 1, 1940 to accept its offer of pre­ferential treatment; upon the other
hand, more time was needed by the people to distill the effects and
implications of the optional proposed amendments and the wise leaders of the
country knew that, under the circumstan­ces, it was only fair and proper that
the people be given sufficient opportunity to study them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further­more, in another sense, the
submission of the amendment to the Ordinance might have been considered a
formality because the American Government then still retained some measure of
sovereignty over the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Withal, looking at the matter from an alternative point of view,
it can even be said that, in effect, the scheduling of the second plebiscite in
Commonwealth Act 492 was reconsidered in favor of another separate cons­tituent
session of the National Assembly which in actuality convened and forthwith
approved Resolution No. 73 which became the one submitted for the ratification
of the people on June 18, 1940 by virtue of the provi­sions of a law other than
Commonwealth Act 492, namely, Commonwealth Act 517.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it can be said that
Resolution No. 38 was abandoned and in a different constituent assembly,
Amendatory Resolution No. 73 was approved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly, therefore, what happened in 1939 does not detract from the
premises of <span class="GramE">Our</span> decision in this case, nor has it
established any precedent which can justifiably apply to the background
circumstances of this case in the sense <span class="SpellE">movants</span> would
perchance have such 1939 events understood.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be stated, at this juncture, that the real lessons from
the above chapter of our Constitutional history seem to have escaped the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
already observed, <span class="GramE">We</span> did hold two separate plebiscites
for the ratification of several amendments apparently proposed by the same
constituent assembly, but it should be emphasized that, as explained above,
Resolution No. 38 of the first assembly was disregarded and a new assembly
approved Resolution No. 73, on the basis of which the <st1:date year="1940" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1940</st1:date> plebiscite was set.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, when the two plebiscites were
scheduled or set all the amendments had already been approved in defi­nite and
final form, hence the frame of reference of the people was likewise already
fixed and clear, i.e., not only the other parts of the existing Constitution
but also the proposed amendments taken toge­ther and in relation to each
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the view of some members
of the Court, this writer included, articulated and discussed during the
deliberations, the cause for the participation of the eighteen-year-olds in the
plebiscite or election for the ratification of the amendatory Constitution to
be proposed by the Con­vention is not precluded by the decision in this case,
much less lost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said justices have
expressed the opi­nion that once the Convention has completed all its work on
the whole constitution, this proposal to allow the eighteen-year-olds to vote
in the ratification plebiscite may be included among the transitory provi­sions
thereof and a special advance plebiscite may be held for the sole purpose of
submitting this particular transitory provision in favor of the eighteen­-year-olds
for approval or rejection ahead of the main body of the new Constitution or the
rest of the pro­posed final amendments to be approved by the Conven­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such an event, according to this view, the
frame of reference would already be clear, and in that sense, the advance
plebiscite can no longer be considered as piece-meal within the contemplation
of Section 1, Article XV of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, the writer of this opinion recalls that under
the second sentence of Section 1 of Article V of the Constitution as approved
on February 8, 1935, woman suffrage was to be allowed by law only if in a
plebiscite which shall be held within two years after the adoption of the
Constitution, that is, after its ratification by the people, not less than
three hundred thousand women possessing the necessary qualifications should
vote in its favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This means that in a
sense, there were actually two plebiscites held separately to ratify the
Constitution, the first to approve or reject the whole of it and the second, to
ratify the extension of woman suffrage, albeit the latter was <span class="GramE">participated</span> in only by women.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, it is not strange that a
particular provision of the Constitution is submitted to the people separately
from the whole, provided the latter is already complete.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further, those of <span class="GramE">Us</span> holding the view
just dis­cussed, see no constitutional objection to the Con­vention itself
fixing the dates of the respective plebiscites.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While no definite consensus has been reached yet as to whether the rest
of the amendment process is exclusively within the legislative juris­diction of
Congress or belongs concurrently to the Convention and Congress, because some
justices do not see the necessity of deciding said issue here, the Court is
unanimous in not seeing any reason for apprehension of failure in the funding
of a separate plebiscite or of any plebiscite, for that matter, even if it were
held that the power belongs exclu­sively to Congress.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The Court does not share the argument of distrust in the sense of duty and
respon­sibility of Congress which <span class="SpellE">movants</span> so heavily
rely upon, even if this were conceived, as it must be, in the interest of the
independence of the Convention.</p>

<p class="BODY">The reason for this position of the Court is simple. In the main,
the organic part of the Consti­tution has, by necessity, to allocate powers and
du­ties among the different departments, branches and offices of the
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These powers are stated
either in black and white in its provisions or are necessarily inferable <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
legal sense, the definition and allocation are made by the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is neither reasonable nor fair to assume
that any of the departments, branches, or offices upon which any duties afire
imposed by the Constitution would ignore and evade the mandate of the
people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their motion for
reconsideration, <span class="SpellE">movants</span> give assurances that if this
Court should recognize some powers as belonging to the Convention, the high
sense of re­sponsibility of its members will not permit the abusive exercise of
said powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This the Court readily
concedes, but at the same time, the Court feels it cannot concede any less to
the other depart­ments of the government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here, as in any other constitutional democracy, as contrasted to a
totalitarian or authoritarian government, every department must ne­cessarily
rely not only on its powers and indepen­dence but also on its interdependence
upon and the sense of duty and responsibility of the other depart­ments.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the words of this Court in <span class="SpellE">Abueva</span>
vs. Wood, 45 Phil. 612:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> If the
Courts could in­tervene in the administration of the other independent
departments of government, or vice versa, they would break away from those
checks and balances of government which are meant, under our system of
government, to be checks of cooperation and not of antagonism or mastery, and
would concentrate in their own hands something, at least, of the power which
the people, either di­rectly or by the action of their representatives, decided
to entrust to the other departments of the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the form of govern­ment established by
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in the Philippine Islands, one department of the government has no power or
authority to inquire into the acts of another, which acts are performed within
the discretion of the other department.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The absur­dity of any other rule is manifest upon the slightest
meditation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judicial and executive
and legisla­tive departments of government are distinct and independent, and
neither is responsible to the other for the performance of its duties, and nei­ther
can enforce the performance of the duties of the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dangers and difficulties which would grow
out of the adoption of a contrary rule would be destructive of the harmonious
relations of the differ­ent departments of government, and lead to confusion
and disorder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each of the three
departments of government has separate and dis­tinct functions to perform.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one department of the government can or
ever has claimed a greater zeal than the others in its desire to promote the
welfare of the individual citizen and to protect his rights. No one department
of the government can claim that it has a monopoly of these benign purposes of
the government."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, Congress would be inutile with its power to appropriate
unless the Executive can be relied upon to disburse the appropriated sums; the
Executive would be helpless in issuing orders the other officials will not give
effect to; even this Court would better not exist if it cannot depend on the
Executive to enforce its decisions and the Congress to abide by its inter­pretation
and construction of the laws and the Consti­tution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, as this Court has already re­peatedly
held, in earlier decisions, and as <span class="SpellE">movants</span> themselves
posit, the possibility of abuse is no rea­son for the denial of power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Briefly then, whether it is the Convention or
the Congress that should appro­priate the funds for the plebiscite, there is no
cause to fear there would be failure in that respect.</p>

<p class="BODY">Less concern should there be according to the same justices,
about the apparent hugeness of the amount needed for a plebiscite separate from
an election of officials whether local or national.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Granted the importance of giving the youth of
the country a more meaningful participation in the exercise of the people's
sovereign power in step with other nations of the world, it is a matter of
public knowledge that bigger amounts have been spent or thrown to waste for
many lesser objectives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All previous
plebiscites for the ratification of the proposed constitutional amendments have
almost invariably been held separately from such elections, mid in the solitary
case when Congress provided for coincidence, six members of this Court, only
two short of the required constitutional number, voted to declare the practice
unconstitutional.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Surely, the amount of seventeen million pesos or even more is not too much a
price to pay for fealty and loyalty to the Constitution and the cause <span class="SpellE">movants</span> and many other segments of the country are so
assiduously espousing. Withal, consideration should also be give to the fact
that even some members of the Convention have gone on record as to their doubts
on whether or not there is sufficient time by November 8, 1971 for our people
to study seriously and adequately the pro­posed amendments, even as they
complained of the many short cuts and virtual "log rolling" procedure
adopt­ed within the Convention in the course of the passage of, the resolution
in question, not to mention the apprehension, not without basis, that the
manner in which <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> is undertaking its
constitutional and statutory duties in the premises, and the way the proposed
plebiscite is to be funded, may not be within the contemplation of the
Constitution and the provisions of the election laws.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second ground of <span class="SpellE">movants</span> deserves
scant consi­deration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, it
is based on the erroneous factual premise that <span class="GramE">Our</span>
decision was based only or mainly on a grammatical analysis of the phrase
"an election" as exclusively signifying only one plebiscite under any
circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The truth of the matter
is that the Court did not merely read and interpret the constitutional
provision in question, but went further and construed it, by going behind the
actual words used in the provision and ascertaining the purpose and in­tent of
die framers of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
on this basis that <span class="GramE">We</span> held that there can be no
piece-meal sub­mission of amendments proposed and to be proposed by the
Convention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in what We<i> </i>said
denies the possibility that the phrase "an election" may compre­hend
more than one plebiscite; what We held in effect was that as between two
possible interpretations, the one more consistent with the spirit of the
provisions, is that which proscribes piece-meal submission before the whole
draft of the new Constitution or all the amendments to be proposed by the
Convention have been finally approved by that body, considering that before
that there could be no safe frame of reference for in­telligent voting,
specially because the particular amendment proposed is subject to many
undefined reser­vations which it is in the power of the Convention to approve
at any time before or after the ratification of their final handiwork.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the third ground of <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>'
motion for reconsideration, suffice it to say that it is ob­vious that <span class="SpellE">movants</span> have confused wisdom of the ques­tioned action
taken by the Convention with the wisdom of the provisions of Section 1 of
Article XV of the Constitution which is applicable thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What <span class="GramE">We</span> discussed in
Our decision is not whether or not the Convention acted wisely; We simply held
that for the reasons given in the decision, We see wisdom in the construction
that piece-meal submission, before all the proposed Constitutional amendments
as a whole have been approved, is not allowed by the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, <span class="SpellE">movants</span> contend that the
proposed amend­ment in question does not need any frame of reference because it
refers solely and only to the reduction of the voting age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already indicated earlier in this
resolution and as discussed in the decision, <span class="GramE">We</span> con­sider
<span class="SpellE">movants</span>' position to be a shortsighted view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right to vote is not as simple as it
might appear to be when considered in relation to the form of government, the
fundamental principles and the educational policies, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that the other amendments to the Constitution
may adopt and pursue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, We
reiterate that in the way the proposal is worded, read together with the
reservations tacked to it by the Convention thru Section 3 of the questioned
resolution, it is too much of a speculation to assume hat exactly the amendment
would really amount to in the end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
in all, as already pointed out in <span class="GramE">Our</span> discussion of <span class="SpellE">movants</span>' first ground, if this kind of amendment is allowed,
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
will appear before the world to be in the absurd position of being the only
country with a constitution containing a provision so ephemeral no one knows
until when it will be actually in force.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Incidentally; in this connection, the writer of this resolution is
persuaded that had the Convention clearly and definitely provided that the
proposed amendment was intended solely to enable 18 to 20-year- olds to vote in
the plebiscite for ratification or rejection of the Constitution as to be <u>finally</u>
amended by the Convention and proposed for ratification, his vote now could
have been in favor of respondents.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the end, <span class="GramE">We</span> see no plausible reason
to alter the judgment in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="GramE">We</span> see it, the consti­tutional provision in question presents
no doubt which may be resolved in favor of respondents and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not believe such doubt can exist only
because it is urged that the end sought to be achieved is to be desired.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Paraphrasing no less than the President of the Constitutional Convention of
1934, <span class="SpellE">Claro</span> M. Recto, let those who would put aside,
invoking grounds at best controversial, any mandate of the fundamental law
purportedly in order to attain come laudable objective bear in mind that
someday somehow others with purport­edly more laudable objectives may take
advantage of the precedent and continue the destruction of the Constitu­tion,
making those who laid down the precedent of justi­fying deviation from the
requirements of the Constitu­tion the victims of their own folly.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

The continued existence of the Convention is in it­self the most pervasive

or modification it may conceive in any and all as­pects of the proposed
amendment, all present nega­tive intentions on the matter notwithstanding.</p>

The writer is personally more inclined to the view that the power lies
concurrently in the Convention and Congress, similarly, as in the case of the
pow­er of Congress sitting as a constituent assembly to call a constitutional
convention, as held in <span class="SpellE">Imbong</span> <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, 35 SCRA 28, L-32432, Sept. 11, 1970.</p>

Justices <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span> and Castro would join in this view

In sharing this conclusion, I have not failed to consider the appeals addressed
to the Court and to its members individually by scores of persons, young and
adult, singly and in groups, urging <span class="GramE">Us</span> to reconsider
Our stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, even if the
Court dis­regarded the impropriety, in the light of traditional norms, of
appeals made to it outside of the pleadings and by persons other than the parties
directly invol­ved, I find that there are graver considerations that compel <span class="GramE">Us</span> not to yield.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I
see it, the Constitution is clear; if I had entertained any doubts as to its
meaning, I would have hesitatingly given the benefit thereof to respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since anyway, as suggested in the
opinion, there could be valid ways of pursuing and effecting the objective
which the questioned resolution intends to accomplish, why should the Sup­reme
Court sanction something that at best could be of dubious constitutionality It
is my considered opinion that while the financial costs of a separate
plebiscite may be high, it can never be as much as the dangers in­volved in
disregarding clear mandates of the Constitution, no matter how laudable the
objective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Justice Laurel, one of the
most distinguished members of the 1934 Constitutional Convention would put it,
"Of greater import than the damage caused by the illegal expenditures of
public funds as the mortal wound in­flicted upon the fundamental by the enforcement
of an invalid statute." <span class="GramE">(People <i>vs</i>. Vera, 65
Phil. 56, at p. 89.)</span> Conversely, no consideration of financial costs
should deter <span class="GramE">Us</span> from adherence to the requirements of
the Constitution.</p>

has, <u>so far</u>, been decided in the affirmative by the Constitutional
Convention of 1971; hereinafter referred to as the Convention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The authority to determine whether the
proposal to this effect shall be a part of our Constitution is vested <u>exclusively</u>
in the people - voting in a plebis­cite or election called <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
- and <u>beyond</u> our competence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue before Us is <u>limited</u> to the validity of Section
2 of CC Organic Resolution No. 1, providing for the submission of said proposal
- as set forth in Section 1 of the Resolution, to the effect that:</p>

<blockquote>"Section One of Article V of the Constitution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is amended to read as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Section 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffrage may be
exer­cised by (male) citizens of the Philippines not otherwise disqualified by
law, who are (twenty-one) EIGHTEEN years or over and are able to read and
write, and who shall have resided in the Philippines for one year and in the
municipality wherein they propose to vote for at least six months preceding the
election.'"</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">- to "a plebiscite, to coincide with
the local elections in November 1971." Section 3 of the same Resolution
provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"This <u>partial amendment</u>, which refers only to the age
qualification for the exercise of suffrage shall be <u>without prejudice to
other amendments</u> that <u>will be proposed</u> in the future <u>by the 1971
Constitutional Convention</u> on other portions of the<u> amended Section</u>
or on other portions of the entire Constitution."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Convention has thus expressed its intention not only <u>not</u>
to adjourn <u>sine die</u> and to continue discharging its functions, and,
accordingly, to consider and adopt proposals for amendment to "other
portions of the entire Constitution, " but, also, to entertain other
proposals for amendment to the <u>very same</u> Section 1 of Arti­cle V of the
present Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consistently with
this intent, the Convention refers to its above-quoted proposal for amendment
as a "partial amendment" of said provision of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, such intent is amply borne out by
the journal of the pro­ceedings of the Convention on the passage of said
Resolution No. 1.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, it appears from said Journal that there were and there
are before the Convention several other proposals for amend­ment of Section 1
of Article V of the Constitution, apart from the proposal reducing the minimum of
age of voters from 21 to 18 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
obvious reasons, the sponsors of said other proposals wanted the same to be
discussed and passed upon by the Convention together with the one now embodied
in Resolution No. 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To clear the way
for the reduction of the voting age, its sponsors urged the immediate approval
thereof, <u>without prejudice</u> to the subsequent consideration by the
Convention of other amendments to the same constitutional provision on
suffrage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, Section 3 of Resolu­tion
No. 1.</p>

<p class="BODY">The proposal for amendment contained in Section 1 thereof is,
therefore, <u>not meant or intended</u> by the Convention to reflect the <u>complete</u>
and <u>definite</u> amendment to Section 1 of Article V of the Constitution <u>to
be proposed</u> by the Convention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
same has <u>not</u>, as yet, made up its mind on the <u>final</u> tenor of the
provision on suffrage it will propose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of fact, it does not seem to have even an idea thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the proposed amendment of
Section 1 of Article V of the Constitution, as set forth in Resolution No. 1,
was approved by the Convention with a <u>temporary</u> or <u>provisional</u>
character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This character is due, not
merely to the legal possibility of further amendments to said constitutional
pro­vision by the present Convention, but mainly to the <u>intent</u> and <u>pur­pose</u>
with which this body had adopted the amendment contained in Section 1 of
Resolution No. 1, "as explicitly stated in Section 3 thereof, and clearly
reflected in the journal of the Convention.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that any provision of the Constitution is susceptible
of amendment, It is, no less true, however, that such amendment must be made by
a Constituent Assembly <u>other</u> than that which drafted the Constitution or
the provision thereof sought to be amended.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In­deed, every amendment must be made in accordance with the pro­visions
of the existing Constitution, pursuant to which it may not be amended except by
resolution of Congress in joint session assem­bled or by a Convention called by
Congress so assembled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once the
Convention or Congress, sitting as a Constituent Assembly, has adjourned <u>finally</u>,
its authority to propose amendments is <span class="SpellE"><u>functus</u></span><u>
officio</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, it is <u>not</u>
possible for <u>either</u> to, thereafter, propose further amendments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Another</u> constituent assembly is
necessary <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate; there can be no question about the proposed
amendment set forth in Section 1 of Resolution No. 1 being <u>incomplete</u>,
legally and factually, in view, particularly, of the provision of Section 3
thereof declaring that said amendment is a "<u>partial</u> amendment"
of Section 1 of Article V of the Constitution and reserv­ing the power of the
Convention to introduce other amendments to said provision, and of the
circumstances under which the amendment was approved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such "partial amendment" it does
not incorporate the <u>whole</u> proposal for amendment to said provision of
our Fundamental Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily,
therefore, the proposed amendment is <u>incomplete</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is self-evident, I believe, that, when the Constitution
ordains, in Section 1 of Article XV thereof, that:</p>

<blockquote>"The Congress in joint session assembled, by a vote of
three-fourths of all the Members of the Senate and of the House of
Representatives voting separately, may propose amendments to this Constitution
or call a convention for that purpose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such amendments shall be valid as part of this Constitution when
approved by majority of the votes cast at an election at which the amendments
are submitted to the people for their ratification.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">it permits or sanctions the submission to
a plebiscite of one or more <u>complete</u> proposals for amendment, <u>not</u>
of <u>part</u>, or a fraction or segment of a proposal for amendment to a
constitutional provi­sion, or of parts, fractions or segments of several
proposals for the amendment of different constitutional provisions; <u>still in
the process <span style="">&nbsp;</span>of amendment</u>, which
process has not, as yet, ended or been completed, regardless of whether the
proposal or proposals have been approved by Congress as a Constituent Assembly
or by<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a Convention called <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> by Congress.</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, when the Constitution speaks of a proposal for
amendment, it does not mean a "part" or a portion of such proposal,
for, otherwise, the provision "partially" amended would have to be
submitted to <u>another</u> plebiscite, once the proposal has been completed
and finalized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, if
Congress or a Convention continued discharging its duties as a Constituent
Assembly, after the adoption of a "partial" amendment to a
constitutional provision, said "partial amendment" could still be the
object of a proposal for <span class="SpellE">reamendment</span> or repeal by the
same Assembly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the ratification of
said "partial" amendment would have a <u>temporary</u>, <u>provisional</u>
or <u>tentative</u> character.</p>

<p class="BODY">Surely the framers of our Constitution could not have coun­tenanced
such a peculiar and unusual type of ratification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apart from the waste of public funds - the
avoidance of which respondents and the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
invoke, in their motion for reconsideration; as a factor militating against
plebiscites by special election - that mul­tiple plebiscites would normally
entail, we must reckon with the fact that - as fittingly elucidated in the
majority opinion - a partial amendment would deprive the voters of the context
which is usually necessary for them to make a reasonably intelligent appraisal
of the issue submitted for their ratification or rejection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, if the Constituent Assembly has
been unable, as yet, to determine the final text of the complete proposal it
expects to make later, it would manifestly, be unjust and unfair to impose upon
the people the task of envisaging the milieu of which the partial amendment
will eventually constitute an integral part.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, too, the submission to a plebiscite of a partial amend­ment,
without a definite frame of reference, is fraught with possi­bilities which may
jeopardize the social fabric.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one
thing, it opens the door to wild speculations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It offers ample opportunities for overzealous leaders and members of
opposing political camps to unduly exaggerate the pros and cons of the partial
amendment proposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, it is apt
to breed false hopes and create wrong impressions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, it is bound to unduly
strain the people's faith in the soundness and validity of democratic processes
and institutions.</p>

<p class="BODY">And let it not be said that these factors are relevant only to
the wisdom of submitting partial amendments to a plebiscite, not to the
authority to make the submission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
are, likewise, pertinent and material to the question whether or not the
framers of our Fundamental Law have vested such authority in our Consti­tuent
Assembly, for, in the absence of a clear intent to the con­trary, the
presumption should be that they have not granted powers that Would ordinarily
bring about the evils adverted to.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been intimated that the case at bar is an exceptional one
and that the hazards aforementioned are absent therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am not satisfied, however, that this is
true. Besides, the Constitution cannot be so interpreted and construed as to
permit a partial amend­ment, as regards the voting age, to be submitted to a
plebiscite, and to prohibit the same when the partial amendment refers to
another provision, aspect or part of the Fundamental Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such action would be open to the charge of
compartmentalized justice, Which would be highly regrettable; not only because
it affects the highest court of the land, but, also, because the charge would
not be alto­gether unfounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
to distinguish the partial amendment on the voting age from other partial
amendments that may be trig­gered by the first, should the plebiscite thereon
be sanctioned, it would normally be necessary to dwell on matters more relevant
to the wisdom of the measure - which is beyond the jurisdiction of courts of
justice - than to the authority to adopt such measure.</p>

<p class="BODY">The view has, also, been advanced that the foregoing con­siderations
are not decisive on the issue before Us, inasmuch as the people are sovereign;
and the partial amendment involved in this case is being submitted to
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue before Us is whether or
not said partial amendment <u>may be validly submitted to the people</u> for
ratification "in a plebiscite to coincide with the local elections in
November 1971, and this particular issue will <u>not</u> be submitted <u>to the
people</u>. What is More, the Constitution does <u>not</u> permit its submission
<u>to the people</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question
sought to be settled in the scheduled plebiscite is whether or not the people
are in favor of the <u>reduction of the voting age</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">To illustrate graphically the situation confronting the Court, let
us suppose that the President has called a special election to fill a vacancy
in Congress allegedly caused by the death of a Member thereof, who had not been
heard from for sometime, and that the validity of the call is judicially
contested upon the ground of insuffi­ciency of the indicia of the incumbent's
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Would it be proper for Us to
dismiss the case upon the ground that, since the people are sovereign, it is up
to them to do what they deem best in connection with such election? If it were
proper for the Supreme Court to sanction the holding of a plebiscite - even if
it felt that the Fun­damental Law does not permit it - for the ratification of
a partial amendment to a provision of the Constitution, in view of the, sov­ereignty
residing in the people, why should that sovereignty be inadequate to offset the
illegality of an election to be held in con­travention of a statute which is
lower in rank than the Constitution?</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus Obvious, manifest and clear, beyond a scintilla of
doubt, that being fragmentary and incomplete, the proposal for partial
amendment under consideration, can not be submitted to the people for
ratification, consistently with the letter and the spirit of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Is this approach to the problem too "legalistic"? This
term has several possible connotations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It may mean strict adherence to the law, which in the case at bar is the
<u>Supreme</u> Law of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this
point, suffice it to say that, in compliance with the specific mandate of such
Supreme Law,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the Members of the Supreme Court have taken the requisite "oath to support
and defend the Constitution."</p>

<p class="BODY">The term "legalistic" may, also, be used to indicate
adherence to the letter of the law, even if it contravenes its spirit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In relation thereto, it may not be amiss to
advert to the fact that the spirit of the law is not a matter of sheer
speculation, and that it is no more than the intent and purpose of the lawmaker
or framer of the Cons­titution as determined by a consideration of the whole
context thereof - and, hence of the letter of the law, in its entirety<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and the circumstances surrounding its enactment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our attention has not been called, however,
to any inconsistency between the lang­uage of Section 1 of Article XV of the
Constitution and the intention and purpose of its framers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, again, the term "legalistic" may be used to
suggest inversely that the somewhat strained interpretation of the Constitution
being urged upon this Court be tolerated or, at least, overlooked, upon the
theory that the partial amendment on the voting age is badly needed and
reflects the will of the people, specially the youth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This course of action favors, in effect, the
adoption of a <u>political approach</u>, inas­much as the advisability of the
amendment and an appraisal of the people's feeling thereon are political
matters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, apart from the obvious
message of the mass media, and, at times, of the pulpit, the Court has been
literally bombarded with scores of handwritten letters, almost all of which
bear the penmanship and the signature of girls, as well as the letterhead of
some sectarian educational institutions, generally stating that the writer is
18 years of age and urging that she or he be allowed to vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus the pressure of public opinion has been
brought to bear heavily upon the Court for a reconsideration of its decision in
the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">As above stated, however, the wisdom of the amendment and the
popularity thereof are political questions beyond our province.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, respondents and the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> originally maintained that We have no
jurisdiction to entertain the petition herein, upon the ground that the issue
therein raised is a political one. Aside from the absence of authority to pass
upon political questions, it is ob­viously improper and unwise for the bench to
delve into such ques­tions owing to the danger of getting involved in politics,
more likely of a partisan nature, and, hence, of impairing the image and the
usefulness of courts of justice as objective and impartial arbiters of <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> controversies.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, too, the suggested course of action, if adopted, would
constitute a grievous disservice to the people and the very Convention
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the latter and the
Constitution it is in the process of drafting stand essentially for the Rule of
Law. However; as the Supreme Law of the land, a Constitution would not be
worthy of its name, and the Convention called upon to draft it would be engaged
in a futile undertaking, if we did not exact faithful adherence to the
fundamental tenets set forth in the Constitution and compliance with its
provisions were not obligatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If we,
in effect, approved, consented to or even overlooked a circumvention of said
tenets and provisions, because of the good intention with which Resolution No.
1 is animated, the Court would thereby become the Judge of the good or bad
intentions of the Convention and thus be involved in a question essentially
political in nature.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is confirmed by the plea made in the motions for recon­sideration
in favor of the exercise of judicial statesmanship in de­ciding the present
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, "politics" is
the word commonly used to epitomize compromise, even with principles, for the
sake of political expediency or the advancement of the bid for power of a given
political party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand,
statesmanship is the expression usually availed of to refer to high politics or
politics on the highest level.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any
event, politics, political approach, political expediency and statesmanship are
generally associated, and often identified, with the dictum that "the end
justifies the means." I earnestly hope that the administration of justice
in this country and the Supreme Court, in particular, will never adhere, to or
approve or indorse such dictum.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the aforementioned extra-legal pressure brought to
bear upon the Court, well settled is the rule that it is its duty "to
follow the law as it is written <u>in all cases</u> and <u>under all cir­cumstances</u>,
without fear and <u>without regard to public clamor</u> x xx" and that
"<u>any</u> other course would bring the law into disrepute x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>. "<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
in the language of Dr. Jose P. Laurel, one of the foremost leader of the
Constitutional Convention of 1934, speaking for the Supreme Court, in 1937:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it is ever necessary for us to make any
vehement <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> during this formative period of
our political history, it is that we are x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> independent in the performance of our functions,
undeterred by any consideration, free from politics, <u>indifferent to
popularity</u>, and <u>unafraid of criticism</u> in the accomplish­ment of our
sworn duty as we see it and as we understand it. "<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, Canon 13 of Judicial Ethics provides that "<u>a
judge should not be swayed by public clamor</u> or <u>considerations of
personal popularity.</u></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>It is obvious, however,
that most of the writers of the commu­nications aforementioned, although bent
on influencing the Court's action, did not realize the implications of their
own act, insofar as the same tended to affect the independence of the
judiciary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In point of fact, they
seemingly had a hazy idea of the issue before the Court and of its authority in
relation thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, most of
the writers were under the wrong impression that it is a matter of discretion
for the Court to reconsider or not to reconsider its decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A good many of them were under the mistaken
notion that the proposed reduction of the voting age had been annulled,
disapproved or vetoed by the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
can be said, with reasonable certainty, that hardly any one knew that the
proposed amendment is a partial and incomplete amendment of a provision of the
Constitution and that the Convention had reserved its authority to introduce
further amendments to said provision, which would have to be submitted for ratification
in another plebiscite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is even quite
probable that those who directly persuaded, induced or encouraged them to write
said communications were in a similar predicament.</p>

<p class="BODY">Just the same, it cannot be overemphasized that, regardless of
whether they will actually affect or influence court action, de­monstrations,
publications, letters and other acts similar to those just adverted to have a
tendency to impair the freedom of courts of justice in the discharge of their
difficult and delicate functions; that parties who wish to be heard in
connection with any litigation and have therein an interest recognized by law,
may obtain judicial permission to intervene in such litigation and make direct,
official representations to the court in connection therewith, in the manner
provided by law and the Rules of Court; that the attempt to influence court
action by any other means may constitute contempt of court and be dealt with
accordingly and that courts can not possibly per­mit a party to resort to such
means without allowing its opponent to avail of the same or analogous means.</p>

<p class="BODY">One need not have a rich imagination to envisage vividly what
would happen if both parties had such authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, instead of being the most potent
factor for the maintenance of peace and order, through the peaceful settlement
of <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> controversies, the judiciary would
pose the gravest threat to the social order, for court proceedings would be
characterized by a display of strength of the opposing litigants, and thus
foster a frontal clash between their respective forces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would, moreover, be advantageous to the
party in power, the vested interests and those who are other­wise influential
or strong and detrimental to the interest of the poor, the weak and the average
citizen, apart from being incon­sistent with the climate of freedom essential
to the impartial ad­ministration of justice under a Regime of Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Referring to the role of the judge as a legislator, Benjamin N. <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span> had the following to say:</p>

<blockquote>"'The statute,' says the Swiss Code, 'governs all matters
within the letter or the spirit of any of its mandates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In default of an applicable statute, the
judge is to pronounce judgment according to the customary law, and in default
of a custom according to the rules which he would establish if he were to
assume the part of a legislator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is
to draw his in­spiration, however, from the solutions consecrated by the
doctrine of the learned and the jurisprudence of the courts -- par la doctrine
et la jurisprudence.' There, in the final precept, is the gist of the differ­ence
between 'le <span class="SpellE">phènome</span> <span class="SpellE">Magnaud</span>,'
and justice according to law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge,
even when he is free, is still not wholly free.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He is not to innovate at pleasure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He is not a knight-errant roaming at will in pursuit of his own ideal of
beauty or of goodness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is to draw his
inspiration from consecrated principles. He is not to yield to spasmodic senti­ment,
to vague and unregulated benevolence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
is to exercise a discretion informed by tradition, methodized by analogy,
disciplined by system, and subordinated to 'the primordial-necessity of order
in the social life.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the extensive resolution penned by Mr. Jus­tice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> denying the motions for reconsideration filed by
res­pondents and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> and in the illuminating
concurrence filed by Mr. Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would only summarize hereunder, as briefly
as possible, the fundamental considerations for my vote against the
constitutionality and legality of submitting the proposed constitutional
amendment to an advance plebiscite coinciding with the forthcoming <st1:date year="1971" day="8" month="11">November 8, 1971</st1:date> elections.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out in the
Court's decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
the amendment proposed under Organic Resolution No. 1 of the 1971
Constitutional Convention is by its own terms (per section 3 of said
resolution) a "<u>partial amendment</u> which <u>refers only to the age
qualification</u> for the exercise of suffrage, (but) shall <u>be without
prejudice to other amendments that will be proposed in the future</u> by the
1971 Constitutional Convention <u>on other portions of the amended section</u>
or on other portions <u>of the entire Constitution</u>."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is then a <u>provisional</u>, <u>incomplete</u> and <u>fractional</u>
proposal - "<u>admittedly tentative</u>", according to Mr. Justice
Fernando's dissent<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> -which
cannot even be dignified with the character of final and complete amendments
which may be duly submitted to the people for ratification, under the
amendatory process provided in Article XV, section 1 of our Constitution.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>partial and
tentative</u> character of the proposed amendment reducing the voting age, as
expressly reserved in section 3 of said Organic Resolution No. 1, was expressly
made of record by the author of said section 3, Delegate Feliciano <span class="SpellE">Jover</span> <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> who said in
introducing the same that:</p>

<blockquote>"DELEGATE LEDESMA (J):<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Now there are
several delegates presenting amendments on the education qualification and on
the residence qualification <u>because they are afraid that once the age
qualification is presented to a plebiscite, later on they may not be able to
present their intended amendments on the residence and the educational
qualification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now the other objections
(sic) to this Res. 1 is based on the apprehension that once we proposed one
amendment to the Constitution and submit this amend­ment to the people, this
Convention will be considered <span class="SpellE">functus</span> officio</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now this amendment that I am intending to
present is intended to dispel that apprehension and the other fear that we will
not be able to present any further amendment to this particular section of our
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>May I therefore read this
proposed amendment, Mr. President.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'Whereas, some of the objections to Res. 1 of the Committee on Suffrage
and Electoral Re­forms which resolution seeks to lower the voting age to 18 are
<u>based on the fear</u> that after approving the said Res. No, 1 and
submitting the same to the people for ratification on <st1:date year="1971" day="8" month="11">Nov. 8, 1971</st1:date>, <u>no further amendment could be
made on Sec. 1, Art. 5 of the Philippine Cons­titution</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on the fear and doubt that once the said
amendment is submitted to the people, the Constitutional Convention would be
deemed dissolved <span class="SpellE"><u>functus</u></span><u> officio</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Whereas, the above mentioned fears and
doubts can be dispelled if this Convention can make it clear in the reso­lution
that the partial amendment that it is submitting to the people shall be without
prejudice to other amendments that will follow</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now therefore, resolved that Res. 1 of the
Committee on Suffrage and Electoral Reforms <u>be amended adding thereto
another section to read as follows</u>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'SEC. 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This partial amendment
which refers only to the age qualification for the exercise of suffrage shall

of the very Rules of the Convention, thus:</p>

of presenting to the people a <u>clear and fixed frame of reference</u> would
furnish them a basis to arrive at an intelligent judgment on the amendment
proposal being submitted to them for ratification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is but to say that a provisional,
incomplete and frac­tional amendment such as the partial voting age reduction
amendment before us obviously can of be tied up to a clear and fixed frame of
re­ference and necessarily leaves the voter in the dark, for by the very terms
of section 3 of the questioned resolution and by the very Rules of the
Convention, the amended section is subject "to other amendments that will
be proposed in the future by the 1971 Constitutional Convention" and the
amended section is yet to be incorporated "in the Complete and final draft
of the Constitution" and remains subject to full debate and amendment.</p>

<p class="NUM">7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Movants</span>'
contention that the proposed amendment is a simple reduction of the voting age
to enfranchise 18 to 20-year olds and needs no tying-up to any possible future
amendments to be under­stood and voted upon begs the question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proposed amendment proposes to enlarge
the present electorate "by about 2.5 to 3 million additional voters",
in petitioner's estimate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once the electorate
is so enlarged, as envisaged by the committee on plebiscite and ratifi­cation
report<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
"it would be reasonable to expect that they [the newly enfranchised young
18-20 year old voters] will generously reciprocate our gesture by supporting
and ratifying our other proposals, they being change-oriented." It is thus
conceivable that should such future amendments-proposals include the pending
proposal of requiring a high school diploma as an academic qualification for
suffrage, the same may be approved by the <u>enlarged electorate</u>, over the
opposition of a large sector of the <u>present</u> electorate who would be
thereby <u>disenfranchised</u> and whose opposition might have decisively
defeated the proposal, had they not blindly voted to enlarge the present
electorate and weaken their own voting strength, since they did not have before
them the <u>com­plete and final amendments as an integrated whole.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="NUM">8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contemporaneous
construction, as well as the practical construction consistently placed since
adoption of the present Constitu­tion, upon the amendatory process provided in
Article XV, section 1, thereof, to wit, that proposed amendments may not be
submitted for ratification <u>piece-meal</u>, be such amendments adopted by
Congress acting as a constituent assembly or by a Constitutional Convention
elected for the purpose, is entitles to great weight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such construction is manifest in the fact
that there has never been a case where a specific amendment is proposed to be
submitted in an advance plebiscite "as a separate, anterior amendment
prior to others that will be submitted as a whole later" - to borrow the
descriptive phrase of Senator <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The principle has thus been restated by a recognized commen­tator:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Where there has been a practical

considerations in favor of ad­hering to this construction sometimes present
themselves to the courts with a plausibility and force which it is not easy to
resist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, where a particular
construction has been generally accepted as correct, and especially when this
has occurred <u>contemporaneously with the adoption of the constitution</u>,
and by those who had opportunity to under­stand the intention of the
instrument, it is not to be denied that a strong presumption exists that the
construction rightly interprets the intention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And where this has been given by officers, in the discharge of their
offi­cial duty, and rights have accrued in reliance upon it, which would be
divested by a decision that the construction was erroneous, the argument <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>inconvenienti</u></span> is
sometimes allowed to have very great weight.<span style="">&nbsp;

acquiring approval of "<u>such amendments</u> …. by a majority of the
