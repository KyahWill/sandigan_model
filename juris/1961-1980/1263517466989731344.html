				<BR><STRONG>RUIZ CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The
petitioner Jose Sol <span class="SpellE">Baloria</span> and the respondent <span class="SpellE">Jacobo</span> S.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Amatong</span> were among the candidates for councilor of <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte in
the elections held on </span><st1:date year="1997" day="14" month="11"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">November 14, 1997</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attention of the municipal board of
canvassers, in the course of its work, was called to the fact that while the
municipal treasurer's copy of the election returns from precinct 18 showed a
total of 37 votes cast for <span class="SpellE">Amatong</span>, the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party and the Liberal Party copies of the same
returns as well as the tally sheet gave him 47 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the difference materially affected the
result of the election for the eighth councilor, the Board of canvassers
suspended proclamation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thereafter,
on November 23, <span class="SpellE">Amatong</span> asked the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte to order a recount of the
votes in precinct 18, citing the discrepancy in the number of votes cast for
him between the municipal treasurer's copy of the elec­tion return, on the one
hand, and the NP and LP copies of the same return as well as the tally sheet,
on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Named as respondent, among
others, was <span class="SpellE">Baloria</span> "as the candidate most
[likely to be] affected" by the action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Baloria</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> moved to dismiss the action on the principal ground that neither the
NP and LP copies of the return nor the tally sheet could be made the basis of
an action for judicial re­count, but his motion was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His verbal motion for reconsideration was
likewise denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thereafter
<span class="SpellE">Baloria</span> sought to introduce the provincial
treasurer's copy of the return to show that, as similarly indi­cated in the
municipal treasurer's copy, <span class="SpellE">Amatong</span> received only 37
votes in precinct 13 of <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span>, but the court denied
his motion in its resolution of </span><st1:date year="1967" day="4" month="12"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">December 4, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His subsequent mo­tion for a subpoena <span class="SpellE"><u>duces</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>tecum</u></span> for the
production of the provin­cial and municipal treasurers' copies of the return
was similar­ly denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Baloria</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> therefore filed this petition for certiorari and mandamus to annul the
orders of the respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span> <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> <span class="SpellE">Abalos</span> as having been
issued in excess of jurisdiction and with grave abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The thrust of his arguments is that there is
no e <span class="SpellE">vidence</span> of discrepancy to support the order of
recount and that at all events the discrepancy claimed by the res­pondent <span class="SpellE">Amatong</span> and found by the court is not between a copy of the
election return and "another copy or other authentic copies" thereof
within the meaning of section 163, in relation to section 168, of the Revised
Election Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On the
other hand <span class="SpellE">Amatong</span> claims that the NP and LP co­pies
of the election return as well as the tally sheet give him a total of 47 votes
and that these copies can serve as basis for an order of recount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise presented affidavits of the chair­man,
the poll clerk and a member of the board of canvassers in precinct 18 who all
attest that contrary to the pertinent recital in the municipal treasurer's copy
the respondent <span class="SpellE">Amatong</span> received 47 votes in precinct
18.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Baloria's</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> claim that the order of recount has no factual basis rests on the
observation that after denying his motion to dismiss the respondent judge did
not set the case for hearing but instead, immediately directed a recount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we think that it was no longer necessary
to do that, considering that the existence of the discrepancy claimed by the
respondent <span class="SpellE">Amatong</span> was not in dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed it was because of the discrepancy that
the muni­cipal board of canvassers suspended the proclamation of the win­ning
candidate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even <span class="SpellE">Baloria</span>
himself impliedly admitted the existence of such discrepancy when in his
memorandum to this Court he tried to explain it thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"[T]he Tally Sheet shows that A <span class="SpellE">matong</span> landed the 8th place and <span class="SpellE">Ealoria</span>,
the 9th place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was so because of
the mistake in the addition and was found wrong by the Board of Canvassers who
used three adding machines during the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So it was found that <span class="SpellE">Baloria</span> landed the 8th
place and <span class="SpellE">Amatong</span> the 9th.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is how the Tally Sheet crea­ted much ado
about nothing, as <span class="SpellE">Amatong</span> now avers that the Tally
Sheet show a discrepancy."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In truth
the only issue before the trial court was a legal one: whether the discrepancy
found was within the contemplation of section of the Code so as to justify a
recount of the votes cast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What is
more, actions for judicial recount must be dis­posed of as promptly as
possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court is free to observe
any procedure that would achieve this end.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Technicalities should be
kept to a minimum, unless their indulgence is necessary as a requirement of due
process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so it may not be argued
that, as a necessary consequence of the denial of <span class="SpellE">Baloria's</span>
motion to dismiss the respondent judge should have set the case for
hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That would have been a useless
formality, as already pointed out, as there was never any question as to the
existence of the discrepancy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This
brings us to the second question: Whether a discre­pancy in the number of votes
between the municipal treasurer's copy of the election return which the
canvassing board had before it and the NP and LP copies of the same return as
well as the tally sheet, can be the basis of a judicial recount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since 1959 the rule has been that to justify
a recount the discrepancy must be between-one copy of the election return and
another copy or authentic-copy of the same return.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Now, these copies are those
-pres­cribed in section 150 of the Election Code to be distributed as fol­lows:
one copy to be placed in the box for valid ballots, a second to be delivered to
the municipal treasurer, a third to be sent to the provincial treasurer and a
fourth to be forwarded to the Commission on Elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For sometime now the COMELEC has required
boards of inspectors to prepare additional copies of the election return: one
to be given to the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party, another to the
Liberal Party, and a third to be sent as advance copy to the municipal
treasurer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any discrepancy resulting
from a different number of votes recorded in any of these extra copies of the
election return cannot serve the purpose of a judicial recount, because section
163, in authorizing such action, must necessa­rily be taken to refer only to
those copies required in section 150 to be prepared.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Moreover,
as this Court explained in <span class="SpellE"><u>Calo</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Enage</span>:</u></span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></u></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"[W]ere the copy furnished to a
political party con­sidered a basis for an action under section 163, untold
opportunities would be afforded a candidate to tamper with the contents of his
party's copy and, on the basis of the artificial discrepancy created between
his copy and that of the provincial treasu­rer, demand a recount of the votes
and thus delay or even prevent the proclamation of his opponent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not to inveigh against either the
validity of the extra copies of the election returns or the wis­dom of the
resolution of the COMELEC requiring their preparation.... On the contrary,
additional copies in the hands of the major political parties may have the
general salutary effect of discouraging attempts to tamper with the copies
required by the Code owing to the greater probability of detection of
irregularities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The point is simply that
the ex­tra copies cannot serve as a legal basis for comparison with any of
those prescribed by the Code for the purpose of a judicial recount."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As the
conflict here is between the entry in the municipal treasurer's copy of the
return, on the one hand, and that in the NP and LP copies of the same return as
well as in the tally sheet, on the other, judicial recount is improper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, this case comes within the ambit of
the rule in <span class="SpellE"><u>Calo</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Enage</span></u>
and <span class="SpellE"><u>Acuña</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Golez</span></u>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> both of which involved a
variance between the pro­vincial treasurer's copy and that given to the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party, and, <span class="SpellE"><u>Lawsin</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Escalona</span></u>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> which involved a
discrepancy bet­ween a copy of the election return and the tally sheet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In all these cases judicial recount was held
improper.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the
light of settled jurisprudence the order of recount made in this case cannot be
viewed other than as in excess of the authority conferred on the respondent
judge by section 163 of the Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
view of this conclusion we find it unnecessary to pass on the petitioner's
claim that he should have been allowed to introduce the provincial treasurer's
copy of the return in or­der to show that the municipal treasurer's copy is
correct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">ACCORDINGLY</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, the order of the
respondent judge for a recount of the votes cast in precinct 18 of <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte is
set aside, and the municipal board of canvassers is directed to reconvene and
proceed without delay with the canvass of the votes, using in connection
therewith the municipal treasu­rer's copy of the election return from precinct
18, and thereafter to forthwith proclaim the winner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against the private res­pondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
