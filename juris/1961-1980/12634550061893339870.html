seeks a review on certiorari of a decision of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts are set forth in the decision of
said Court, from which we quote:</p>

<blockquote>"<st1:place><st1:placename>Defendant-appellant</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> of Naga is a municipal
corporation existing and operating under and by virtue of its charter, Republic
Act No. 305 which took effect on <st1:date year="1948" day="18" month="6">June
 18, 1948</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Plaintiff-appellee San Miguel Brewery, Inc. is a private
corporation duly organized under the laws of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>

<blockquote>"On October 15, 1954, the municipal board of Naga City passed
Ordinance No. 141 which pro­vided, among other things, to wit:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"'Section 1.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- There shall be levied and collected from
all breweries, distil­leries, bottling houses, toyo factories and other
establishments whose business in­cludes the corking and capping of bottles,
operating in the City of Naga, in addition to the municipal license tax imposed
by existing laws, <u>a municipal tax of 1/48 of a centavo for every bottle</u>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1959" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1959</st1:date>,

city, municipality or municipal district; to regulate and impose reasonable
fees for services rendered in connection with any business, profession or
occupation being conducted within the city, municipality or municipal district
and otherwise to levy for public purposes, just and uniform taxes, licenses or
fees; x x x.'</p>

<blockquote>"Pursuant to this provision of the Local Autonomy Act, the
municipal board of <st1:place><st1:placename>Naga</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
passed Ordinance No. 234 which took effect on <st1:date year="1961" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1961</st1:date>, imposing taxes on the business of
plaintiff as manufacturer of aerated water - for each corking machine with a
capacity of 16,000 bottles or more a day (Sec. 4).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff-appellee since then has been paying
to defendant-appellant an annual tax of P2<span class="GramE">,300.00</span> on

being doubly taxed:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One under Ordinance
No. 141 and the other under Ordinance No. 234.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1961" day="4" month="8">August 4, 1961</st1:date>,
plaintiff-appellee lodged the instant complaint in the Court of First Instance
of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It sought to annul Ordinance
No. 141, s. 1954; demanded the refund of the taxes with in­terests which it
paid as well as those other amounts that plaintiff-appellee may be compelled to
pay to defendant-appellant Naga City under the said ordi­nance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The City of Naga, through counsel, answered interposing at
the same time affirmative and special defenses - that the venue was improperly
laid; that the plaintiff was guilty of laches; and that the ordi­nance in
question is valid, it having been enacted and passed well within the statutory
powers, granted to and inherent in defendant municipal corporation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After trial, the lower court rendered judgment in favor of
the plaintiff-appellee (1) declaring Ordinance No. 141, series of 1954, not
applicable to the plaintiff, (2) ordering the defendant to refund to the
plaintiff the amount of P2,892.57 paid under protest with legal interest from
August 9, 1961, the date of filing of the complaint until fully paid, and any
other subsequent amount or amounts similarly paid by the defendant with legal
interest from date of payment also until duly paid, and (3) to pay the costs.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In due course, the Court of Appeals rendered its appealed
decision annulling Ordinance No. 141, upon the authority of Me­dina v. City of <span style="">Baguio</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">; </span>declaring that, although the taxes
paid by the plaintiff, under said Ordinance, from October 1954 to June 1961, in
the aggregate sum of P64,281.95, had been "im­properly collected",
the refund thereof was not in order, plaintiff having failed to prove that its
payment had been made under protest, and that, having established that the sum
of P2,892.57, collected from July to December 1961 had, however, been paid
under protest, plaintiff was entitled to recover the same; and, accordingly,
affirming the decision of the trial court, in all other respects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this petition for review on certiorari
filed by the defendant City of <st1:city><st1:place>Naga</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The latter maintains that Ordinance No. 141 is sanctioned by
section 15 (kk) of Republic Act No. 305 - which is the charter of the City of
Naga - vesting in its municipal board the authority to "<u>regulate</u>
any other business or occupation not specifically mentioned in the preceding
paragraphs, and to impose a l<u>icense fee</u> upon all persons engaged in the
same or who enjoy privileges in the city.” Said authority to
"regulate" and "to impose a li­cense fee" involves,
however, the grant of <u>police power</u>, which is the authority to enact
rules and regulations for the promotion of the general welfare.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Such authority is irrelevant to the ordinance under consideration, which is an
exercise of the power of <u>taxation</u>, the purpose of which is to raise
funds for the general operation of the government<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and is distinct and separate from the police power, which, in turn, does not
and can not possibly permit the enactment of said ordinance.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant insists that the approval of Republic Act No. 2264,
otherwise known as the Local Autonomy Act, authorizing cities to exercise,
subject to specific limitations, the power of taxation in general, including
the imposition of a "percentage tax on sales" and "taxes on
articles subject to specific tax, except gasoline, under the provisions of the
national internal revenue code,"<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
had validated Ordinance No. 141.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
legality thereof is dependent, however, upon defendant's powers <u>at the time
of its enactment</u>, on <st1:date year="1954" day="15" month="10">October 15,
 1954</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, it
is clear that - under both its charter and Commonwealth Act No. 472, and as we
held, under similar conditions, in <st1:city><st1:place>Medina</st1:place></st1:city>
v. City of <st1:city><st1:place>Baguio</st1:place></st1:city>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
- de­fendant then had no authority to impose a tax on specific articles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The subsequent approval of Republic Act No.
2264, on <st1:date year="1959" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1959</st1:date>, did
not remove the infirmity of origin of the ordinance in question, because none
of the provisions of said Act suggests the intent to give thereto either a
curative nature or retroactive effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case of <st1:city><st1:place>Bacolod</st1:place></st1:city>

cited by the <span class="GramE">defendant,</span> refers to an ordinance which
became effective on <st1:date year="1959" day="1" month="7"><u>July 1, 1959</u></st1:date>,
or <u>subsequently</u> to the approval of Republic Act No. 2264.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was precisely the reason why we refused
to apply, in said case, the doctrine laid down in <st1:city><st1:place>Medina</st1:place></st1:city>
v. City of <st1:city><st1:place>Baguio</st1:place></st1:city>, reiterated in
