</blockquote>
<p align="CENTER">XI</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>That as a result of the denial of the claim of
petitioner Lorenzo Lim as a citizen of the Philippines, respondent
Associate Commissioner de la Rosa ordered the respondent Palattao,

</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="CENTER">XIII</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>That under the Alien Reg. Act 1900 it is the duty of

</blockquote>
<p align="CENTER">XIV</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>That petitioner Lorenzo Lim has never been
registered as a Chinese in the Bureau of Immigration, as is also the
case of the other petitioner Juana Alvarez since the marriage of herein
petitioners sometimes in January, 1952." (pp. 91-95, record)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After hearing, the Court rendered judgment holding "that the spouses
Lorenzo Lim and Juana Alvarez Lim are Filipino citizens either by
reason of Lorenzo Lira's illegitimacy, or, granting that the parents of
Lorenzo him were legally married, by Lorenzo Lim's mother reversion to
Philippine citizenship when his father died," and enjoying permanently
the respondents from requiring the petitioners' registration as aliens.
</p>
<p>From the judgment thus rendered the respondents have appealed to
this Court; and the trial Court ordered that the record of the case be
certified and transmitted to this Court.</p>
<p>  The appellants claim that the trial Court committed the following errors:</p>
<ol type="I"><li>The lower Court erred in finding that the
petitioner-appellee is the illegitimate son of Lam Hing and Mora Alsia
and consequently, he follows the citizenship of his mother.<br>
  </li><li>
The lower Court erred in finding that Tinder this present petition
filed by the petitioner-appellee the citizenship of the latter could be
determined.<br>
  </li><li> The lower Court erred in granting the
petition of the petitioners-appellees permanently enjoining the
respondents appellants from requiring them to register as aliens. </li></ol>
<p> What would be the remedy of a citizen or an inhabitant of the
country claiming to be a citizen thereof, who is being required or
compelled to register as alien by administrative officers of the
Government, who relying upon ruling or opinions of superior
administrative officers, are in turn complying with their duty? If the
person claiming" to be a citizen of the country who is being required
or compelled to register as alien, can show, establish, or prove that
he is such citizen, the remedy of injunction to prevent the officers
from requiring or compelling him to register as alien is certainly the
proper and adequate remedy to protect his right. </p>
<p>The trial Court states that—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>x x x, the petitioner presented documentary evidence
to which the Solicitor made no objection. The evidence presented shows,
that Lorenzo Lim was born on January 26, 1905, in Tulay, Jolo, Sulu,
being the illegitimate son of Lam Hing. The parents of petitioner,
Lorenzo Lim are Lam Hing, Chinese citizen and Mora Alsia a Filipino
citizen whose parents were Abdul Hussin and Mora Tamsila both
Filipinos. Lam Hing died in 1907 while Mora Alsia died in 1908. The
parents of Lam Hing during their life time were never married.
Petitioner Lorenzo Lim was Sever registered with the Bureau of
Immigration as an alien and in all his transactions with the
government, he has been known to be a Filipino citizen. Furthermore the
evidence shows that Lorenzo Lim and Juana Alvarez Lim were legally
married. With the evidence presented, the Court believes that the
spouses Lorenao Lim and Juana Alvarez Lim are Filipino citizens either;
by reason of Lorenzo Lim's illegitimacy, or granting that the parents
of Lorenzo Lim were legally married by Lorenzo Lim's mother reversion
to Philippine citizenship when his father died.</p>
  <p>Inasmuch as
there was no marriage between the parents of petitioner, Lorenzo Lim,
he is a Filipino citizen since he follows the citizenship of his mother
Mora Alsia from birth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These findings are supported by the documents and answers of
witnesses to interrogatories presented as evidence without objection.</p>
<p>As stipulated by the parties, on 18 July 1941 after the passage of
Com. Act No. 625 on 7 June 1941, petitioner Lorenzo Lim elected
Filipino citizenship (Annex C); in 1928, 1931f 1934 and 1955 elections,
petitioner Lorenzo Lim was a registered voter; in 1957 petitioner
Lorenzo Lim <u>alias</u> Lam Shun Hock applied for a passport and.
based on a memorandum by the Citizenship Committee of the Department
for Foreign Affairs he was issued Filipino Passport No. 3590; in the
same year the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga City granting a
petition for a change of name stated that petitioner Lorenzo Lim is a
Filipino citizen; the petitioner as well as his wife Juana Alvarez Lim
have never been registered as aliens; and the certificate of
registration of business name of the petitioner Lorenzo Lim recites
that he is a Filipino citizen. All these go to strengthen the finding
of the trial court that the petitioner Lorenzo Lim is such a citizen.</p>
<p>The opinions of the Department of Justice referred to do not have a
conclusive character or effect as they are based on findings that the
evidence then submitted was incompetent and the petitioner's statement
was unsupported and hence insufficient to warrant a conclusion that the
petitioner is a Filipino citizen.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, without special pronouncement as to costs.</p>
<p><i>Bengzon,  C.J., Bautista Angelo, Paredes, Dizon, Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.</i>, concur.<br>
<i>Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes J. B. L., </i> and <i>Barrera, JJ., </i>took no part.</p></div>
