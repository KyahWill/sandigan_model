Cadastral Case No. 67 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> a verified "Petition for <u>Continuation</u>
of Cadastral Proceedings" (Underline supplied), alleging, substantially,
that he was the owner of a of land covered by Plan Psu-66102 approved by the
Director of Lands on November 15, 1929, having acquired it from previous owner,
Pedro Padilla, who subsequently allowed to be subdivided into 30 cadastral lots
with an aggregate identical to that of the land described in the aforesaid
plan; that he had sufficient evidence to prove title thereto and, on the
strength of said allegations, prayed <u>for the lifting the order of general
default</u> entered in said Cadastral Case No. 67, and that, after proper
proceedings, decision be rendered adjudicating aforesaid lots in his favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 16 of the same year, Judge <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span>
R. Cuevas, then presiding the lower court, rendered judgment adjudicating a
number of lots in favor of <span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Reano</span>, among them being Lots 1896, 1913 and 1914 of the
Cadastral Survey of Sta. Rosa, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On June 6,
1968, alleging that, pursuant to said decision, the decree of registration as
well as the corresponding original certificates of title No. 3187 (for Cadastral
Lot No. 1896); No. 3178 (for Id. Lot No. 1913), and No. 3176 (for Id. Lot No.
1914) had been issued in his name, said respondent filed an ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion with the lower court praying for the issuance
of a writ of possession directing any of the law to place him in physical
possession of the covered by said titles.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This petition was heard and subsequently granted ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only when the writ of possession
issued on the 11th of the same month was served upon petitioners that they
learned of the proceedings instituted by <span class="SpellE">Reano</span> and discovered
that Cadastral Lots Nos. 1896, 1913 and 1914 - which were already covered by
Ori­ginal Certificate of Title No. P-1870 issued since <st1:date year="1956" day="18" month="8"><u>August 18, 1956</u></st1:date> in the name of their
predecessor in interest, Simeon Gutierrez - were among those adjudicated to <span class="SpellE">Reano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
they filed with the lower court a verified motion to set aside the writ of
possession, but the same was denied by the respondent judge in his order of <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their motion for reconsideration filed
thereafter having been likewise denied by His Honor in an order of October 29
of the same year, petitioners filed the present petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> praying:</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That a writ of <i style="">certiorari</i> be issued directing the respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> to certify to
this Honorable Court a transcript of the proceedings in Cadastral Case No. 67,
L.R.C. Cadastral Record No. 1556, Lots Nos. 1896, 1914 and 1913, Director of
Lands versus <span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Reano</span>,
et al., claimants;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That after the corresponding hearing of the
parties herein, a final judgment be entered annulling the writs of possession
and the orders of <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1968</st1:date>
and <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1968</st1:date>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That pending the final hearing and
determination of these proceedings, an order of preliminary injunction be
issued directing the respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> to refrain and desist, until further orders from
this Court, from enforcing the writs of possession, and declaring the said
orders and writs, null, and void; and,</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That petitioners recover their costs.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his answer to the petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> the private respondent, after making denials of the
material averments of the petition, alleged by way of affirmative
defenses:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that <i style="">certiorari</i> is not the proper remedy; that the decision rendered in
his favor on November 16, 1966 in Cadastral Case No. 67 was based upon an in <span class="SpellE">macion</span> <span class="SpellE">possessoria</span>, a declaration
of ownership, Plan Psu-66102 approved by the Director of Lands and Cadastral
Survey Plan Psu-66102; that cadastral lots 1896, 1913 and 1914 were privately
owned even before Original Certificate of Title No. P-1870 was issued as a
result of administrative proceedings; that this being so, the Government no
right to dispose of the lands covered by the same; that the writs of possession
complained of were merely incidental to the execution of the final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment rendered in his favor; that the orders
complained of having become <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, the same could
no longer be assailed in <i style="">certiorari</i>
proceedings.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;"><u><span style="font-weight: normal;">G. R. No. L-29866<o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with G. R. L-29866 it appears that, in accordance
with Homestead Patent No. D-995 previously issued by the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
under the provisions of Commonwealth Act 141, Original Certificate of Title No.
P-275 was issued on <st1:date year="1948" day="24" month="7"><u>July 24, 1948</u></st1:date>
in the name of Mariano Juan, covering Lot No. 1863 of the Cadastral Survey of
Sta. Rosa, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> with
an area of 83, 135 square meters.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mariano Juan died in the year 1965 and the petitioners in the case are
his legitimate children.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">On <u>May 16, 1966</u>, or eighteen years after
the issuance of Original Certificate of Title No.</span> P-275, private
respondent <span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Reano</span>
filed a "Petition for <u>Continuation</u> of Cadastral Proceedings"
in Cadastral Case No. 67 praying for the <u>setting aside of the order of
general default </u>entered in said proceeding and for the registration in his
name of several parcels of land situated in Sta. Rosa, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, among them being Lot No. 1863 of the Cadastral
Survey of said municipality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November
16 of the same year the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, acting as a cadastral court, rendered a
decision adjudicating to respondent <span class="SpellE">Reano</span> the lots
included in his application, including Lot No. 1863.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, alleging that the decision
rendered in favor had become <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and that
Original Certificate of Title No. 0-3176 covering <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
1863 had been issued in his name, <span class="SpellE">Reano</span> filed an ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion for the issuance of a writ of possession
directing any peace officer to place him in possession of several lots, among
them the aforesaid Lot No. 1863.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
an ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> hearing, respondent judge granted said
motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 3, 1968, having become aware of the situation above
described, petitioners filed a motion praying for setting aside of the order
for the issuance of the writ of possession mentioned above, but the respondent
judge denied it on October 4 of the same year.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then on October 11 petitioners filed another motion for reconsideration
alleging that the title issued in favor of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Reano</span> was null and void and, therefore, should be
cancelled, of that the writ of possession mentioned heretofore should likewise
set aside, but this motion met the same fate by order of the respondent judge
of October 29, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter the <span class="SpellE">Juans</span> filed the Petition for <i style="">Certiorari</i> (L-29866) now before <span class="GramE">Us</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer thereto filed by the private
respondent alleges substantially the same defenses inter posed in his answer in
L-29792.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following are, <span class="GramE">We</span> believe, pertinent
and relevant considerations in deciding the two cases before Us.</p>

<p class="NUM">(1) Pursuant to <st1:city><st1:place>Homestead</st1:place></st1:city>
Patent No. V-31853 granted on <st1:date year="1954" day="28" month="7"><u>July
 28, 1954</u></st1:date><u>, </u>Original Certificate of Title No. P-1870 was
issued in the name of Simeon Gutierrez on <u>August 18, 1956</u>, the same
covering Lots Nos. 1, 2 and 3 of Plan H-105846 which, beyond question,
correspond to Lots 1896, 1914 and 1913 of the Cadastral Survey of Sta. Rosa, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">As official duty is presumed to have been duly performed and the
Homestead Patent and Original Certi­ficate of Title abovementioned are entitled
to full credit in the absence of clear proof that they were issued illegally or
through fraud, it can be safely said that prior to the issuance of the
aforesaid Homestead Patent, Simeon Gutierrez had filed the corresponding
homestead application; that, after the necessary survey had been made and
proper notice was served, the required investigation was conducted by the
State; that applicant Gutierrez was found to have been in possession of the
property applied for and to have made thereon the required cultivation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Gutierrez had really been in possession
of said land from the time of the filing of his homestead application, and that
his successors in interest had continued such possession and are still enjoying
the same, is further demonstrated by these facts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>firstly, respondent <span class="SpellE">Reano</span>
had to file a petition for the issuance of a writ of possession to oust them
and, in turn, to obtain p, session of Lots 1896, 1940 and 1913; secondly, on
May 16, 1966, <span class="SpellE">Reano</span> filed in Cadastral Case No. 67 a
"Petition for Continuation of Cadastral Proceedings" and for the
setting aside of the order of <u>general default</u> already entered therein;
all of which necessarily means that Pedro Padilla, his alleged predecessor in
interest, <u>had not claimed</u> Lots 1914 and 1913 when the proceedings were
started.</p>

<p class="NUM">(2) It was only on Nay 16, 1966 or more than ten years after the
issuance of the Homestead Patent in favor of Simeon Gutierrez, and nearly ten
years after the issuance of Original Certificate of Title No. P-1870 that
private respondent <span class="SpellE">Reano</span> filed a petition to register
in his name the same cadastral lots.</p>

<p class="NUM">(3) In the case of G. R. L-29866, Homestead Patent No. <span class="GramE">D-995 and Original Certificate of Title No.</span> P-275 - both
covering Lot No. 1863 of the Cadastral Survey of Sta. Rosa, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> - were issued on the same date - <st1:date year="1948" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1948</st1:date> - in the name of
Mariano Juan.</p>

<p class="BODY">As in the case of the lots involved in L-29792, it must likewise
be presumed that prior to July 24, 1948 Mariano Juan had been in possession of
and had been cultivating Lot 1863, and that it was only after adequate
investigations had been made by the Bureau of Lands that the Homestead Patent
in his favor was issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was only on May 16, 1966, or eighteen full years after the
issuance of the Homestead Patent and Original Certificate of Title already
mentioned, that <span class="SpellE">Reano</span> filed a petition for the
continuation of the proper cadastral proceedings so that he could claim several
lots, among them Lot 1863 of the Cadastral Survey of Sta. Rosa, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further proof of the fact that Mariano Juan and, after his death,
his heirs have been and still are in possession of Lot 1863 is the fact that <span class="SpellE">Reano's</span> alleged pre­decessor in interest did not file his
answer or claim to Lot 1863 at the start of the cadastral proceedings and was
therefore included in the order of general default issued therein, and he (<span class="SpellE">Reano</span>) had to file on June 6, 1968 an ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion for the issuance of a writ of possession under
which he could eject the <span class="SpellE">Juans</span> from Lot 1863 and, in
turn obtain possession thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue arising from the above facts may be briefly stated as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">May a parcel of land already titled for more than ten years in
the name of a party by virtue of a Homestead Patent issued by the Government in
the ordinary course of administrative proceedings, be registered again in the
name of another party as a result of subsequent cadastral proceedings?</p>

<p class="BODY">The answer, <span class="GramE">We</span> believe, must be in the
negative.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Lukban</span>,
et al., Vol. 48, Phil. p. 973, We held that land granted by the Government to a
private individual who applied for it as a homestead, is considered no longer <span class="SpellE">registerable</span> within the meaning of the Land Registration
Act after the issuance of the homestead patent and the original certificate of
title issued in accordance therewith.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Pamintuan</span> vs. San Agustin et al., 43
Phil. 558, well as in El <span class="SpellE">Hogar</span> Filipino vs. <span class="SpellE">Olviga</span>, 60 Phil. p. 17, We likewise held that in a
cadastral proceeding the Court has no jurisdiction to decree again the
registration of land already decreed and registered in an earlier registration
case, and that the second decree entered for the same land is null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, considering that the petitioners in both cases before
Us and their predecessors had been in possession of the land, first as
homesteaders and later, as absolute owners, for more than ten years before
respondent <span class="SpellE">Reano</span> filed his application for
registration; that, as a result of the proceedings had in connection with their
Homestead application, the homestead patent original certificates of title
mentioned heretofore were issued in their name, no further argument is needed
to that said petitioners and their predecessors had acquire title to the land
by prescription.</p>

<p class="BODY">It being clear from the foregoing that the registration decreed
in the name of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Reano</span> of Lots 1896,
1914, 1913 and 1863 of the Cadastral Survey of Sta. Rosa, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> is null and void, the certificate of title
covering the same issued in his name must also be deemed null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this the inevitable con elusion is that
he had no right to the issuance of the writs of possession complained of.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Reano</span> contends, however,
that certiorari is not the proper remedy available to the petitioners the two
cases before <span class="GramE">Us</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This We find to be untenable is view of the fact that, as shown in the
foregoing discussion the judgment rendered in his favor, the decree of
registration entered and the certificates of title issued in name covering the
properties in question were all void, other contention that the titles he had
secured were base on an <span class="SpellE">Informacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Possessoria</span> does not change the situation in his favor
because the issuance of one such instrument does not, by itself alone, actually
remove the land to which it refers from the public domain.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writs of certiorari prayed for in the
above-entitled cases are granted and, as a consequence, the writs of possession
issued by the respondent judge Cadastral Case No. 67, GLRO Record No. 1556 in
relation to Lots Nos. 1896, 1914, 1913 and 1863 of the Cadastral of Sta. Rosa, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, are hereby set aside
and rendered of no legal effect whatsoever.<span style="">&nbsp;
