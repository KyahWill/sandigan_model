<blockquote>"That in the commission of the said offense, the said accused
committed a grave abuse of confidence, he being then employed as a salesman of
the said Phoenix Mfg. and Merchandising Corporation, at the time, and as such,
had free access to the place where the property stolen were kept.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Contrary to law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In due course, the trial court rendered a decision finding that:</p>

<blockquote>"During the period between October, 1963 and February, 1964,
the defendant was a commission salesman of the Phoenix Manufacturing &amp;
Merchan­dising Corporation with office at <st1:address><st1:street><span class="SpellE">Dasmariñas</span> Street</st1:street>, <st1:city>Manila</st1:city></st1:address>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had no fixed salary, but he received a
commission of 10% on the selling price of the articles he sold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Phoenix Manufacturing &amp; Merchandis­ing
Corporation was engaged in the sale and distribu­tion of typewriters and adding
machines, manual and electrical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
procedure followed by the corporation was for the commission agent to contact
the prospec­tive buyer and if he finds one, the commission agent reports to the
corporation and a delivery receipt is made out in favor of the prospective
customer indi­cating in the delivery receipt the name of the com­mission agent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The machine is then delivered by an employee
of the corporation accompanied by the com­mission agent to the prospective
customer for the purpose of trial for a period of not more than three days,
extendible upon request of the commission agent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">that during the period from October, 1963
to January, 1964, said corporation delivered the machines enumerated in the
information, with a total value of P13,390.00, to prospective customers of ap­pellant;
and that:"</p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> Without authority from the Phoenix Manufacturing <span style="">&amp; </span>Merchandising Corporation, the
defendant withdrew and pulled out these machines from the respective
prospective customers who had decided not to buy them, and instead of return­ing
the said machines to the Phoenix Manufacturing and Merchandising Corporation,
the accused pawned them with various pawn shops including the <span class="SpellE">Agencia</span> de <span class="SpellE">Empenos</span> de <span class="SpellE">Tambunting</span>, Inc. , Merced Hernan­dez, Agencies de <span class="SpellE">Empeños</span> de Vicente Lao, R. <span class="SpellE">Pilares</span>
Pawnshop, and R. Aguirre Pawnshop, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No<span style="">t </span>having returned the
machines to the Phoenix Manufacturing &amp; Merchandising Corporation, the
attention of the accused was called by the company, and the accused promised to
return the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The manager of the
company be­came suspicious, and he wrote to one of the cus­tomers, the A-1
Adjustment Agency, inquiring about the machines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The corporation received the answer, Exhibit
D, dated March 4, 1964, informing the Phoenix Manufacturing &amp; Merchan­dising
Corporation that of the 5 machines that were delivered to it for demonstration,
only two were in their possession, the rest having been returned to the accused
Denny Chan or <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maglaya</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon check-up of the records of the accused,
it was found out that several machines had been delivered under the name of the
defen­dant and had not been returned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The matter was reported to the Manila Police Department in the letter
dated <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1965</st1:date> and now
marked Exhi­bit B, enumerating the machines which were miss­ing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused was arrested by the police and
his statement was taken in writing, now marked Exhibit A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted that he had taken the machines
enumerated in Exhibit B and covered by the delivery receipts, Exhibits C, C-1
to C-12; and that he had pawned them with various pawn­shops; and he
surrendered to the police 6 pawnshop tickets now marked Exhibits G, H, I, J, K
and L. Seven other machines were covered by pawnshop tickets, but all the 13
machines des­cribed in the delivery receipts, Exhibits C to C-12 were recovered
by the police and returned to the Phoenix Manufacturing &amp; Merchandising
Corpora­tion, as evidenced by the receipts Exhibits E and F.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The accused admitted having received these office machines
and pawned them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified fur­ther
that he had done this in the past, but without the knowledge of the corporation
whenever he need­ed money because his wife and children were sick, but he
redeemed them when he had money and re­turned them to the corporation; that he
had in­formed Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Fuster</span> and the manager of the cor­poration
that he had pawned these machines, and they told him not to do it again.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Neither Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Fuster</span> or the manager
of the corporation could relieve the accused from crimi­nal liability.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As commission agent, it was the duty of the
accused when he withdrew or pulled out thos<span style="">e </span>machines from the customers to return them to the Phoenix
Manufacturing &amp; Merchandising Cor­poration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In pawning the machines without the authority of the corporation, he had
acted in breach of the trust reposed upon him by the cor­poration and this
constitutes the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>. "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Premised upon the foregoing facts, the trial court found
appellant guilty of <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span>, under "Art.
308, par. (1) of the Re­vised Penal Code", and sentenced him to an
indeterminate pen­alty ranging from six (6) months of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span>
<u>mayor</u> to five (5) years, five (5) months and eleven (11) days of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correc­cional</u></span>,
as well as to pay the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this
appeal, upon the ground that he cannot be convicted of <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span><u>
</u>under the alle­gations of the aforementioned information charging him with
qualified theft.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, We note that, although convicting ap­pellant
of <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span>, the provision cited in the decision
appealed from is Art. 308, paragraph one (1), of the Revised Penal Code, which
defines the crime of theft, and that the maximum penalty meted out is, either
that prescribed in subdivision 2 of Art. 309 of the same Code, which refers to
theft of property worth more than P6,000 but not exceeding P12,000, or that
provided for in the first paragraph of Art. 315 of said Code, for the crime of <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span>, when the damage caused is over P12,000 but
does not exceed P22,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would seem,
however, that His Honor, the trial Judge had applied the latter provision,
because of the char­acterization, made in said decision, of the crime committed
by the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although both parties argue in their respective briefs on whether
the crime of <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span> is included in that of
qualified theft alleged in the information filed in this case, We deem it unne­cessary
to pass upon such question, for, under the facts proven, appellant is guilty of
the crime of theft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that the
machines specified in the information were delivered to him by <span style="">his </span>prospective customers, but the
physical possession thus secured by him did not vest in him the juridical
possession necessary for the crime of <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, he had no authority from his em­ployer,
the owner of said machines, to retrieve the same from said prospective
customers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He evidently had misled them
into believing that in retaking said machines he was acting on behalf of his
employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From a legal viewpoint, he
had, therefore, taken and carried away the machines without the knowledge and
consent of the owner thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having
concededly performed these acts with intent of gain, and caused damage and
prejudice to said owner, appellant is clearly guilty of the crime of theft.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. De Vera<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>,
We held that one who, having secured possession of a gold bar from its owner
under the pre­text that he (the former) would have it examined by a silversmith
and then return it to said owner, but, instead disappeared with the gold bar,
was guilty of theft, not of <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quoting with ap­proval, from <span class="SpellE">Viada</span>, the eminent commentator on the Spanish Penal Code,
the following passage, involving a situation which is quite analogous to the
one at bar:</p>

<blockquote>"Is the shepherd, who takes away and converts to his own use
several heads of the cattle under his care, guilty of the crime of <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span>, within case No. 5 of article 548, or of
theft, defined and punished in article 533, No. 2, of the Code?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The Supreme Court has decided that <u>it
was this latter</u> and more serious crime that was committed:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Considering that the crime of theft is
committed when one, with intent of gain, and without using violence or intimi­dation
against persons, or force upon things, takes away personal property of another
without the owner's consent; and in the present case Manuel Diaz <span class="SpellE">Castilla</span> undoubtedly committed the crime defined, for, with
intent of gain, he took away two bucks and a female goat, against the will of
his master, the owner of the said cattle, which were under his care as
shepherd:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Con­sidering that, in holding
that the crime committed was that of theft and not of <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span>,
as claimed by the appellant, ignorant of the true elements which consti­tute
the latter crime, the lower court did not commit any error of law, nor violate
any legal provision, as contended by defendant's counsel in support of this
appeal. ' (Decision rendered June 23, 1886, published in the Gazette of
September 16, p. 189.)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">We added in our decision in the De Vera
case:</p>

<blockquote>"In the above cited case, did the shepherd re­ceive the cattle
which were under his care?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-
Undoubtedly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were the cattle voluntarily
delivered by the owner to the shepherd?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- It is to be presumed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did the
shep­herd have the consent of the owner when he took away some of the cattle
and converted them to his own use?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- No.
In this case of the shepherd, as in the example given, the crime committed was
that of theft, notwithstandin<span style="">g </span>the fact that the thing misappropriated had been deli­vered
voluntarily by the owner to the supposed thief, who disposed of it without the
owner's consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this is so because <u>the
delivery of the cattle to the shepherd does not have the effect of transferring
the juridical possession of, or title to, the cattle thus delivered</u>, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>. "<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine laid down in the De Vera case was applied in People
v. <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> <a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> and in
People v. Isaac <a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a> involving, in the first case, a
bank teller who misappropriated money held by him as such, and, in the second,
the temporary driver of a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> engaged in public
service <a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a>, who disposed of it with intent of gain and without
the consent of its owner, upon the theory that the bank teller had the money on
behalf of the bank, which was its juridical possessor, and that the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> was in the juridical possession of its owner,
although physically held by said temporary driver.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although appellant had taken advantage of his position in
committing the crime aforementioned, We do not believe he had acted with grave
abuse of confidence and can be convicted of qua­lified theft, because his
employer had never given him the posses­sion of the machines involved in the
present case or allowed him to take hold of them, and it does not appear that
the former had any especial confidence in him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the delivery of the machines to the prospective customers was
entrusted, not to appellant, but to another employee.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as the aggregate value of the machines stolen by
appellant herein is P13,390.00, the crime committed falls under Art. 308, in
relation to the first subdivision of Art. 309 of the Revised Penal Code, which
prescribes the penalty of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u>
in its minimum and medium periods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
modifying circumstance having attended the commission of the offense, said
penalty should be meted out in its medium period, or from 7 years, 4 months and
1 day to 8 years and 8 months of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty imposed in the decision appealed
from is below this range.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, with the modification that appellant should be
sentenced to an indeterminate penalty ranging from 2 years, 4 months and 1 day
of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>
to 7 years, 4 months and 1 day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u>,
the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, in<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>other respects, with costs against him.</p>
