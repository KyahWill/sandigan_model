				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Respondents Tomas <span class="SpellE">Narbasa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tambac</span> <span class="SpellE">Alindo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Borres</span> stand indicted
before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del
Norte, as principals, in five (5) separate cases, four for murder and one for
frustrated murder, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:</p>

<blockquote>Criminal Case 1246 -
murder of <span class="SpellE">Neceforo</span> Mendoza; </blockquote>

<blockquote>Criminal Case 1247 -
murder of <span class="SpellE">Epifania</span> Mendoza; </blockquote>

<blockquote>Criminal Case 1248 -

<blockquote>Criminal Case 1249 -
murder of <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> Mendoza; and </blockquote>

<blockquote>Criminal Case 1250 -
murder of Marcelo Mendoza.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The five <span class="SpellE">informations</span> were planted upon
facts gathered by the prosecuting attorney from his investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, the truth of these facts is yet to
be tested in the crucible of a full-dress trial on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">The indictments are bottomed upon the following alleged pivotal
facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">On the night of <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="7">July 29,
 1965</st1:date>, the occupants of the home of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
Mendoza and <span class="SpellE">Valeriana</span> <span class="SpellE">Bontilao</span>
de Mendoza in <span class="SpellE">Puga</span>-an, City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Iligan</span></st1:place></st1:city>, were asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then that <span style="">guns (rifle, </span>caliber 22) and <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">paliuntod</span></u></span><u><span style=""> </span></u>(home-made gun) were fired in
rapid succession <span style="">from </span>outside
the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
Mendoza fell dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
defendants below destroyed the door of the house, entered therein, and let
loose several shots killing <span class="SpellE">Neceforo</span> Mendoza, <span class="SpellE">Epifania</span> Mendoza and Marcelo Mendoza - all minor children
of the couple - and wounding <span class="SpellE">Valeriana</span> <span class="SpellE">Bontilao</span> de Mendoza.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two of the three defendants in the five criminal cases here­tofore
listed - Tomas <span class="SpellE">Narbasa</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tambac</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alindo</span> - moved for a consolidation thereof "into
one (1) criminal case." Their plea is that "said cases arose out of
the same incident and motivated by one impulse."</p>

<p class="BODY">Giving the nod to defendants' claim, respondent Judge, in an
order dated May 13, 1966, directed the City Fiscal to unify all the five
criminal cases, and to file one single information in Case 1246.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also ordered that the other four cases,
Nos. 1247, 1248, 1249 and 1250 "be dropped from the docket."</p>

<p class="BODY">The City Fiscal balked at the foregoing order, sought
reconsideration thereof, upon the ground that "more than one gun was used,
more than one shot was fired and more than one victim was killed." The
defense opposed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1966</st1:date>,
respondent Judge denied the motion to reconsider.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He took the position that the acts complained
of "stemmed out of a series of continuing acts on the part of the accused,
not by different and separate sets of shots, moved by one impulse and should
therefore be treated as one crime <span class="SpellE">tho</span> the series of
shots killed more than one victim"; and that only one information for
multiple murder should be filed, to "obviate the necessity of trying five
cases instead of one."</p>

<p class="BODY">Primarily to annul respondent Judge's orders of May 13, 1966 and
May 31, 1966, as having been issued without or in excess of jurisdiction and/or
with grave abuse of discretion, the People came to this Court on certiorari
with a prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction, and for other <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court, on <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="7">July 1,
 1966</st1:date>, issued the cease-and-desist order prayed for.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question here presented, simply is this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should there be one information, either for
the complex crime of murder and frustrated murder or for the complex crime of
robbery with multiple homicide and frustrated homicide?<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Or, should the five indictments remain <span style="">as </span>they
are?</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The case before us calls into question the applicability of
Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 48. <u>Penalty</u> <u>for</u> <u>complex</u> <u>crimes</u>.
- When a single act constitutes two or more grave or <span style="">less </span>grave felonies, or when an offense is a necessary means for
committing the other, the penalty for the most serious crime shall be imposed,
the same to be applied in its maximum period."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Read as it should be, Article 48 provides for two classes of
crimes where a single penalty is to be imposed: first, where a single act
constitutes two or more grave or less grave felonies (<span class="SpellE"><u>delito</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>compuesto</u></span>); and, second, when an offense is a
necessary means for <span style="">committing </span>the other (<span class="SpellE"><u>delito</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>complejo</u></span>).<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><i><u><o:p></o:p></u></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Best exemplified <span style="">by </span>the
first of the two cases is where one shot from a gun results in the death of two
or more persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jurisprudence teaches
that, in this factual setting, the complex crime defined in the first part of <span style="">Article 48 </span>finds application.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">A similar </span>rule obtains where one
stabbed another and the weapon pierced the latter's body through and through
and wounded another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first died
instantaneously; the second, seven days later.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court convicted the assailant of double murder.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
So where a person plants a bomb in an airplane and the bomb explodes, with the
result that a number of persons are killed, that single act again produces a
complex crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A different rule governs where separate and distinct acts result
in a number killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Deeply rooted is the
doctrine that when various victims expire from separate shots, such acts
constitute separate and distinct crimes.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, where the six defendants, with others (armed with pistols, carbines and
also a submachine gun and <span class="SpellE">Garand</span> rifles), fired
volleys into a house killing eleven and wounding several others, each of the
said accused is "guilty of as many crimes of murder as there were deaths
(eleven)."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Again, eleven persons were indicted for quadruple murder - with the use of
bolos, a pistol, a barbed arrow and a piece of bamboo - of a man, his
common-law- wife, and their two children in cold blood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused were found guilty by the trial
court of such offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, in
reversing this ruling below, held that <span style="">“[t]he </span>four victims were not <span style="">killed </span>by a
single act but by various acts committed on different occasions and by
different parties”; that such acts "may not be regarded as constituting
one single crime"; and that "[t]hey should be held <span style="">as </span>separate
and distinct crimes."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
And a third.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the commencement
exercises of an elementary school, "a shot suddenly rang out"
followed by <span style="">a
"series </span>of shots" - from a pistol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two persons lay dead and a third seriously
wounded but who later on also died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Court there ruled that there were "three distinct and separate
murders" committed by appellant Juan <span class="SpellE">Mones</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
And finally, in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Gatbunton</span>, L-2435, <st1:date year="1950" day="10" month="5">May 10, 1950</st1:date>, the spouses Mariano
Sebastian and Maxima <span class="SpellE">Capule</span> - who were asleep - were
killed by one burst of machinegun fire; and then, by a second burst of
machinegun fire, two of the couple's children - also asleep - were killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused, Tomas <span class="SpellE">Gatbunton</span>,
was found guilty by the trial court of quadruple murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal, this Court declared that
"appellant must be declared guilty of four murders."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The present case is to be differentiated from People vs. <span class="SpellE">Lawas</span>, L-7618-20, <st1:date year="1955" day="30" month="6">June
 30, 1955</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, on a single
occasion, about fifty <span class="SpellE">Maranaos</span> were killed by a group
of home guards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was held that there
was only one complex crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that
case, however, there was no conspiracy to perpetrate the killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, defendants performed
several acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> charge conspiracy amongst them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to state, the act of one is the act
of all.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Not material here, therefore, is the finding in <span class="SpellE"><u>Lawas</u></span>
that "it is impossible to ascertain the individual deaths caused by each and
everyone" of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to
be borne in mind, at this point, that to apply the first half of Article 48,
heretofore quoted, there must be singularity of criminal <u>act</u>;
singularity of criminal <u>impulse</u> is <u>not</u> written into the law.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Judge reasons out in his order of <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1966</st1:date> that consolidation of
the five cases into one would have the salutary effect of obviating the
necessity of trying five cases instead of one.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To save time, indeed, is laudable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, the statute confers upon the trial judge the power to try
these cases jointly, such that the fear entertained by respondent Judge could
easily be remedied.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the facts and the law, we hold that the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City correctly presented the five separate <span class="SpellE">informations</span> - four for murder and one for frustrated
murder.</p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">2. We have </span>not
overlooked the suggestion in the record that, because of an affidavit of one of
<span style="">the witnesses, </span>possibility
exists that the real intent of the culprits <span style="">was </span>to commit robbery, and that the acts constituting murders
and frustrated murder complained of were committed in pursuance thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If true, this would bring the case within the
coverage of the second portion of Article 48, which treats as a complex crime a
case where an offense is a necessary means for committing the other.</p>

<p class="BODY">A rule of presumption long familiar, however, is that official
duty has been regularly performed.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
If the Fiscal has not seen fit to give weight to said affidavit wherein it is
alleged that certain personal properties (transistor radio and money) were
taken away by the culprits after the shooting, we are not to jettison the
prosecutor's opinion thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Fiscal
could have had reasons for his act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
one thing, there is the grave problem of proving the elements of that offense -
robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For another, the act could have
been but a blind to cover up the real intent to kill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appropriately to be noted here <span style="">is </span>that <u>all</u> the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> charged evident premeditation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With <span class="SpellE">ponderables</span>
and imponderables, we are reluctant to hazard a guess as to the reasons for the
<span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are not now to say that, on this point, the Fiscal has abused his
discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A prosecuting attorney, by
the nature of his office, is under no compulsion to file a particular criminal
information where he <span style="">is </span>not
convinced that he has evidence to prop up the averments thereof, or that the
evidence at hand points to a different conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not to discount the possibility of the
commission of abuses on the part of the prosecutor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we must have to recognize that a
prosecuting attorney should not be unduly compelled to work against his
conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of doubt, we should
give him the benefit thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A contrary
rule may result in our courts being unnecessarily swamped with unmeritorious
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse still, a criminal suspect's
right to due process - the sporting idea of fair play - may be transgressed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it <span style="">is,
</span>that in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Sope</span>, 75 Phil. 810, 815,
this Court made the pronouncement that "[<span class="SpellE">i</span>]t is
very logical that the prosecuting attorney, being the one charged with the
prosecution of offenses, should determine the information to be filed and
cannot be controlled by the offended party."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3. The impact of respondent Judge's orders is that his judgment is
to be substituted for that of the prosecutor's on the matter of what crime is
to be filed in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question of
instituting a criminal charge is one addressed to the sound dis­cretion of the
investigating Fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The information he
lodges in court must have to be supported by facts brought about by an inquiry
made by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It stands to reason then to
say that in a clash of views between the judge who did not investigate and the
fiscal who did, or between the fiscal and the offended party or the defendant,
those of the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> should normally prevail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this regard, he cannot ordinarily be
subject to dictation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not to be
understood as saying that criminal prosecution may not be blocked in exceptional
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A relief in equity "may be
availed of to stop a purported enforcement of a criminal law where it is
necessary (a) for the orderly administration of justice; (b) to prevent the use
of the strong arm of the law in an oppressive and vindictive manner; (c) to
avoid multiplicity of actions; (d) to afford adequate protection to
constitutional rights; and (e) in proper cases, because the statute relied upon
is unconstitutional or was 'held invalid'."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Nothing in the record would as much as intimate that the present case fits into
any of the situations just recited.</p>

<p class="BODY">And at this distance and in the absence of any compelling fact or
circumstance, we are loathe to tag the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span>
City with abuse of discretion in filing separate cases for murder and frustrated
murder, instead of a single case for the complex crime of robbery with homicide
and frustrated homicide under the provisions of Article 294 (1) of the Revised
Penal Code or, for that matter, for multiple murder and frustrated murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We state </span>that, here, the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>
discretion should not be controlled.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the record as it stands, the writ of certiorari prayed for
is hereby granted; the orders of respondent Judge of May 13, 1966 and May 31,
1966 are hereby set aside and declared null and void, and, in consequence, the
writ of preliminary injunction heretofore issued is made permanent insofar as
it stops enforcement of the said orders; and the respondent Judge, or whoever
takes his place, is hereby directed to reinstate Criminal Cases 1246, 1247,
1248, 1249 and 1250 <span style="">as </span>they
were commenced, and to take steps towards the final determination thereof.</p>
