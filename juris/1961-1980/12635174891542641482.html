<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1963</st1:date>
the plaintiff filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Manila for
the recovery of a sum of money against the defendants <span class="SpellE">Diestro</span>
Logging Development Corporation and <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span>
Insurance and Surety Company, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
the defendants had filed their respective answers, the case was submitted for
decision on the following stipulation of facts:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on or about the 23rd day of January, 1963
in the City of Manila, Philippines, the plaintiff and the defendant <span class="SpellE">Diestro</span> entered into a Sales Agreement, copy of which is
attached as Annex <span style="">A </span>to
complaint, wherein the former sold to the latter the motor vehicles described
in said Sales Agreement (Annex A to complaint), for a total price of P32,000.00
payable within Thirty (30) days from January 23, 1963, in accordance with paragraph
1 (a) of the Sales Agreement (Annex A to complaint) but which period, by mutual
consent between the parties, was extended by fifteen (15) days or a total of
forty-five (45) days from January 23, 1963.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That to guarantee the payment of the purchase
price of the said motor vehicles amounting to P32,000.00 within the stipulated
period of forty-five (45) days, DIESTRO agreed to give to the plaintiff a
Surety Bond, which Surety Bond was issued by CONSOLACION as per copy attached
as Annex B to complaint;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on January 29, 1963, <span style="">simul</span>taneous with the <span style="">issuance </span>of the Surety Bond (Annex B
to complaint), and to secure cross-claimant from any <span style="">loss </span>that may attached from <span style="">said bond, </span>defendant DIESTRO EXECUTED in favor of CONSOLACION an
Indemnity Agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A true copy of the
Indemnity Agreement is attached as <span style="">Annex
</span>1 to defendant's (CONSOLACION) <span style="">Answer;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That under the said Indemnity Agreement (Annex
1 to defendant's answer), cross-defendant DIESTRO <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, <span style="">agreed
to the </span>following stipulations:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">To </span>indemnify
<span style="">cross-claimant </span><span style="">from </span><span style="">any </span>loss or damage <span style="">that
it may </span>suffer <span style="">or </span>cause to
<span style="">be paid </span><span style="">by virtue </span>of <span style="">the issuance
of the </span>Surety <span style="">Bond, </span><span style="">(Annex B to complaint), with interest thereon
</span>at the <span style="">rate of </span>One <span style="">per cent </span>(1%) per <span style="">month to be liquidated </span>monthly and <span style="">to </span>be <span style="">added to the principal to </span>earn <span style="">the same rate of interest until fully paid;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To pay 20% of the total amount due as and for
attorney's fees;</p>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the motor vehicles itemized in the
Sales Agreement (Annex A to <span style="">the
complaint) </span>were received in good condition by defendant DIESTRO as shown
in the Delivery Receipt No. 8050 dated <st1:date year="1963" day="6" month="2">February
 6, 1963</st1:date>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the sum of P32,000.00 representing the
purchase price of the motor vehicles sold by the plaintiff to the <span style="">defendant DIESTRO </span>as stipulated in the
Sales Agreement (Annex A to complaint) remains unpaid notwithstanding repeated
verbal and written demands from the plaintiff;</blockquote>

<blockquote>7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That on the 14th, 27th <span style="">and 31st day </span>of May, <span style="">1963, CONSOLACION was notified by </span>the
plaintiff that <span style="">DIESTRO refused and
failed, </span>to pay the said sum of P32,000.00 <span style="">guaranteed </span>by CONSOLACION Surety Bond (Annex B to complaint) and
in said notification, plaintiff demanded from <span style="">CONSOLACION </span>as Surety the payment of the unpaid obligations of
DIESTRO, but CONSOLACION did not pay, having been advised by DIESTRO that the
trucks subject of the Sales Agreement (Annex A to <span style="">complaint) were received </span>not in good condition as stipulated;</blockquote>

<blockquote>8.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That in accordance with the Surety Bond
(Annex B to complaint), the <span style="">liability </span>of
defendant DIESTRO and CONSOLAC<span style="">ION to </span>plaintiff
is joint and <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>, the latter's liability
however, being limited to P32,000.00, the amount of the bond;</blockquote>

<blockquote>9.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That plaintiff is entitled to <span style="">the payment </span><span style="">of interest </span>on the unpaid obligation <span style="">with </span>reasonable attorney's fees.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On October 5, 1964 the lower court rendered judgment ordering the
defendants "to pay, jointly and severally, the sum of P32,000.00 to the
plaintiff, with interest thereon at the legal rate from January 23, 1963 until
the said amount is fully paid, plus a sum equivalent to 25% of the unpaid
indebtedness as and for attorney's fees, and the costs hereof" Not
satisfied with the decision, the defendant <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span>
Insurance and Surety Company, Inc. moved to reconsider, praying that the
attorney's fees and interest be charged against the defendant <span class="SpellE">Diestro</span> Logging Development Corporation alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In denying the motion, the trial court in its
order of <st1:date year="1964" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1964</st1:date>
said:</p>

<blockquote>"Acting upon the motion for reconsideration of the judgment
rendered by this Court filed by the <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span>
Insurance and Surety Co., Inc. on the ground that under its contract with
defendant <span class="SpellE">Diestro</span> Logging Development Corporation it
is not liable for attorney's fees, the Court finds that the liability for
attorney's fees of a surety is based not on its contract with the defendant above-mentioned,
but as a consequence of its refusal to pay its obligation notwithstanding
repeated demands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the said surety
company paid the obligation upon demand, there is no question that it could not
have been made to pay for attorney's fees, because such is not included in its
contract with the Defendant <span class="SpellE">Diestro</span> Logging
Development Corporation, but after its refusal and the filing of the action as
a result of the said refusal, it is but natural that it should also pay the
attorney's fees, because the filing of this action is the result of its refusal
to pay its obligation under the surety bond."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The defendant surety
interposed this appeal, assigning as sole error the lower court's finding that
it was liable for the payment of attorney's fees in favor of the plaintiff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant contends that although the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
right to the payment of reasonable attorney's fees was stipulated, the
liability <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> pertained only to <span style="">the </span>principal, the <span class="SpellE">Diestro</span>
Logging Development Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two
grounds are relied upon by the appellant, namely: (1) the payment of attorney's
fees by the appellant would be in excess of its liability under the surety
bond; and (2) it was not at fault in not paying the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
upon the latter's extra-judicial demands.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of the first ground, the appellant cites the terms of
the surety bond as well as paragraph <span style="">8 </span>of
the stipulation of facts, which states:</p>

<blockquote>“8.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That in accordance with the Surety Bond
(Annex "B" to complaint), the liability of defendant DIESTRO and <span style="">CONSOLACION </span>to plaintiff is joint and <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>, the latter's liability, however, being limited to
P32,000.00, the amount of the bond;"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Explaining the second
ground, the appellant avers that its refusal to pay the sum of P32,000.00 upon
demand was based upon the fact, admitted in </span>paragraph <span style="">7 of the stipulation, that it had </span>been
<span style="">advised by its principal "That the
trucks subject of the Sales Agreement </span>(Annex <span style="">"A" to complaint) were received not in good
condition..." The appellant points out that under the circumstances it
would have been imprudent to comply with the extrajudicial demands, since if it
paid the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and the information should turn out
to be true, its principal could validly refuse reimbursement of the amount thus
paid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
disputes the appellant's stand and insists that under the stipulation of facts
the appellant is liable for attorney's fees, citing paragraph 9 which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That plaintiff is entitled to the payment of
interest on the unpaid obligation with reasonable attorney's fees."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> maintains that the
stipulation in paragraph (9) supersedes the one in paragraph <span style="">8, </span>and that the latter would govern
only if the appellant had paid the <span style="">obligation
upon extra-judicial demand, but not when the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
was constrained to bring an action in court to enforce its rights under the
surety bond.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant should be
sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stipulation of facts
should be so construed as to give effect to all its provisions if the same can
fairly and reasonably </span><span style="">be </span><span style="">done.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Conformably thereto, paragraphs </span><span style="">8 </span><span style="">and 9 must be
reconciled rather than construed in such a way that </span><span style="">one </span><span style="">would nullify the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
while paragraph 9 recognizes the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> right to
reasonable attorney's fees, such right may be enforced only against the <span class="SpellE">Diestro</span> Logging Development Corporation, thereby giving
effect at </span>the same time to paragraph <span style="">8, </span>which limits the appellant’s liability to the amount of the
bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the more reasonable
interpretation, considering that the appellant was not at fault when it refused
to pay the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> upon demand because of the advice
given by its principal that the trucks were not received in good condition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With regard to paragraphs
5 and 7, the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> claim that the latter
nullified the former is unjustified, because there is no conflict between
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said stipulations simply mean
that the <span class="SpellE">Diestro</span> Logging Development Corporation did
receive the trucks in good condition, but nevertheless advised the appellant to
the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is all the more
reason to hold that if the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was constrained
to go to court to enforce its rights, the principal debtor </span><span style="">was alone </span><span style="">to </span>blame, and <span style="">therefore </span><span style="">should be the one to pay the attorney's fees
awarded on that ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trial court declared
that the appellant's </span>liability for attorney's fees is not based on
contract, <span style="">but on its refusal to pay its
obligation notwithstanding repeated demands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Disregarding - for purposes of </span>testing <span style="">the correctness of the judgment upon the basis thus </span>stated - <span style="">the </span>stipulation <span style="">limiting the </span>appellant's <span style="">liability </span>to the amount of P32,000.00
fixed in the surety bond, we now consider Article 2208 of the Civil Code, which
enumerates the <span style="">instances </span>where
attorney's fees may be recovered in the absence of agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are eleven (11) such instances, of
which only the fifth and <span style="">the last </span>could
have any relevancy here, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"(5)
where the defendant acted in gross and evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy
the plaintiff's plainly valid, just and demandable claim;" and "(11)
in any other case <span style="">where the court </span>deems
it just and equitable that attorney's fees...should <span style="">be </span>recovered." Number 5 is at once ruled out in the case of
the appellant, for there is neither allegation nor proof that it refused, in
gross and evident bad faith, to comply with the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
extra-judicial demands for payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
does appear, and in fact is stipulated, is that the appellant "did not
pay, having been advised by DIESTRO that the trucks subject of the sales
agreement were received not in good condition." It must be remembered that
the appellant was merely a surety, had no knowledge of the condition in which
those trucks were delivered to its principal, and therefore could only rely
upon the information the latter supplied, which information, if true, would
have been a partial defense in the action, at least to reduce the liability of
both defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the
information turned out to be untrue is of no consequence insofar as the
appellant's position is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
development came out only in the stipulation of facts, whereupon, the action
for collection having already been filed, the parties, submitted the case for
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, the
judgment for attorney's fees against the appellant is not even justified under
paragraph (11) of Article 2208 of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would in effect be imposing a penalty on
the right to litigate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See <span class="SpellE">Koster</span> Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Zulueta</span>, G. R.
No. L-9305, 99 Phil. 945, 951.)</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Wherefore</b>, the decision is modified by eliminating the
award of attorney's fees against the defendant-appellant.</p>
