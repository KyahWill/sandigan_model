scene of the crime (p. 90, t. s. n., <span class="SpellE">Acance</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of the investigation conducted

officers were busy interrogating people to get a lead into the cause or motive
of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Corporal <span class="SpellE">Borje</span> made a sketch of the premises of the murder scene (p.

Corporal Emilio <span class="SpellE">Borje</span> relative to the killing of her
husband by Peralta, which however, varied in some material respect from her
previous statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to her
second statement, when Peralta assaulted her husband, she was asleep and was
only awakened by the shouts of her daughter Mary Lou; that the two of them,
mother and daughter, witnessed Peralta's brutal slaying of her deceased husband

</span>The Court however denied the Motion </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">(p. </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">9, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The case was finally set for hearing at which the prosecution presented
its principal witness, <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> de Peralta, who by
then was already serving sentence in <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, after pleading guilty to the crime of murder of
which he was charged (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 3, pp. 179- 183, rec.).</span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">“At the trial of the case, Peralta testified that
the appellant was his paramour, that earlier in the afternoon of that fatal
day, she invited him to a tryst at her house during the night, as her husband, <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> <span class="SpellE">Aglibut</span> was to go
fishing in the river </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">(pp. </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">5, 12-13, <span class="SpellE">Altuna</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Peralta, he waited under a logo

house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about </span></span><st1:time minute="0" hour="8"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">8 o'clock</span></span></st1:time><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> that night, he saw the deceased passed by, on his way to the river,
carrying a kettle in his hand </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">(p. </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">12, t. s. n., idem).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This made
him believe that the latter would be out fishing the whole night (p. 15, t. s.
n., idem.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon being assured that the
deceased had already gone, he went upstairs into the latter's house where he
found the appellant al<span style="">ready </span>waiting
for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They made love to each other
and finally succumbed to the urge of the flesh </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">(p. </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">6, t. s. n., <span class="SpellE">Altuna</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Em­boldened by the thought that the deceased
would be out the whole night, Peralta stayed longer in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He and the appellant sat by the door of the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> and continued their amorous acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While they were thus lost in the <span class="SpellE">ecstacy</span> of their sinful love, the deceased arrived and
surprised them in a compromising situation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This provoked the anger of the deceased who, according</span></span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to Peralta, began beating his wife with a
club he was then carry<span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">ing </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">(pp. </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">7, 10, 21-22, 23, 28, t. s. n., <span class="SpellE">Altuna</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appellant <span style="">in </span>desperation got
hold of a bolo <span class="SpellE">stucked</span> in the nearby wall and with it
struck the deceased several times </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">(pp. </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">8, 28, idem).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the deceased
continued beating the appellant, the latter called upon Peralta for aid </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">(pp. </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">8, 22, t. s. n., idem).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Peralta came to the succor of the appellant,
unsheathed his bolo and began hack­ing the deceased left and right </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">(pp. </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">8, 23, t. s. n., <span class="SpellE">Altuna</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased floundered with the force of the
joint assault on his per­son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bleeding
and helpless, he scampered down the stairs towards the gate evidently to
escape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant how ever followed and
con­tinued hacking him </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">(p. </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">25, t. s. n. idem), until he fell by the gate of the fence.</span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After due trial, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, presided by His
Honor, Judge <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>,
thus summarized its findings from the evidence of record:</p>

<blockquote>"The evidence on record, therefore, has fully established the
following facts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the deceased <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> <span class="SpellE">Aglibut</span> and the accused
Dolores <span class="SpellE">Aglibut</span>, were legally married; that in the
evening of November 22, 1961, while the late <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span>
was out fishing, his wife, herein accused had a tryst in the conjugal home with
<span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> de Peralta, who was her para­mour; that
when the late <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> returned, he found his wife
together with Peralta in a provocative situation, and he was roused to anger;
that the accused then took hold of a bolo and used it against her husband, who
defended himself bare handed; that at that instance, <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span>
de Peralta made common cause with the accused and attacked the late <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> from behind with a bolo; and, that as a result of
said attack, the late <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> <span class="SpellE">Aglibut</span>
sustained a total of 16 wounds on different parts of the body, which injuries
caused his instantaneous death."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It therefore rendered the following judgment against the accused:</p>

<blockquote>“IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Court finds the accused Dolores <span class="SpellE">Aglibut</span> guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
parricide, as defined and penalized under Art.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>246 of the Revised Penal Code, and, in the absence of any modifying
circumstances, hereby sentences the said accused:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, with its accessory penalties, to indemnify
the heirs of the deceased offended party, <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> <span class="SpellE">Aglibut</span>, in the sum of Six Thousand Pesos (P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>), without however, sub­sidiary imprisonment in case

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">The principal error assigned by the accused on
appeal is that the trial court should not have found that she actively
participated in the killing of her husband in accordance with the prosecution’s
evidence, but that it should have sustained her defense that her paramour, <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> de Peralta, alone perpetrated the killing.</span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The issue thus raised is essentially one of fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did the trial court err in giving faith and
credence to the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> de Peralta,
the prosecution's principal witness, who himself had confessed to helping the
accused in the killing and had pleaded guilty to the crime of murdering the
victim, for which he had been separately charged and was already serving
sentence in <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span>, as against the versions of
the accused and her young daughter which the court found to be untenable?</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">The doctrine is well settled that in the absence of
any plain error or misapprehension or disregard of certain facts and cir­cumstances
of substance and value by the trial court in weighing the conflict in the
testimonies of the witnesses, and accepting the version of the prosecution, and
rejecting that of the defense or of some other special or compelling reason,
this Court will not on appeal disturb the findings and conclusions of the trial
court which has from its vantage point observed the demeanor and attitude of
the witnesses.</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> Here, the trial court's judgment is fully supported by the evidence

<p class="BODY">Dr. <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span>, testifying on the

declared they were <u>bolo</u> wounds; that two of the serious wounds on the
head, wound no. 1 which fractured the skull and wound no. 6 on the right side
of the face, extending from the mouth to the neck and severing the carotid
artery and the jugular vein, were dealt with such great force that they could
not have been inflict­ed by a person of small build like the accused but by
"a strong fellow" and that by the location and direction of said
wounds, as well as wound no. 3 which fractured the mastoid bone behind the
right ear, the assailant must have been behind the victim when he inflicted
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to wounds nos. 11 to 16,
inflicted on the right elbow and hand, as well as on some fingers of both
hands, the doctor declared that they were light blows and could have been
inflicted even by a person of small build, such as a woman; and that judging
from the location of said injuries, as well as wound no. 8 on the right
shoulder, they were frontally inflicted and said injuries could have been
sustained while the victim had his arms raised in the act of defending himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The nature and extent of the injuries
sustained by the victim support the trial court's conclusion "that there
were at least two assailants, one of whom was a well-built person who dealt the
heavy blows from behind the victim, and the other, a person of small build who
dealt the light blows while facing the victim."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The two assailants, as testified by Peralta, were <span class="GramE">himself</span>
and the <span style="">accused, </span>with the
accused being the first to <u>bolo</u> the unfortunate victim, while he <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">boloed</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>the victim three times and left at
her order while she continued <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">boloing</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>him.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
That Peralta and the accused were present at the scene of the crime and at the
time of its commission is not disputed.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused-appellant
would discredit Peralta's testimony by questioning why Peralta did not
implicate the accused when he was being investigated by the police authorities
imme­diately after the commission of the crime and on the succeeding days,
notwithstanding that the accused and her daughter, <span class="SpellE">Marilou</span>,
pointed to him, as the sole perpetrator of the killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Peralta's simple explanation for this was
that the accused had so ordered him, telling him "Do not declare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I shall take care of everything." and he
had to obey what she told him.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Three days after the killing, however, apparently overcome by repentance, Peralta
did give on <st1:date year="1961" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1961</st1:date>,
his statement to the Chief of Police of his town, which he subscribed and swore
to before the justice of the peace on <st1:date year="1961" day="27" month="11">November
 27, 1961</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stricken by a guilty conscience, he pleaded
guilty to the separate information for murder against him upon his arraignment
on <st1:date year="1961" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1961</st1:date> and
was duly sentenced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was represented
in the case by the same counsel for the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
The <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> contention that when he pleaded guilty
to the murder of the victim, "he never made any manifestation that he and
defendant-appellant committed the crime",<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
is not borne out by Peralta's repeated assertions on cross-examination by the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> counsel (and his own counsel in the murder case)
that "At that time I pleaded guilty, I declared we were two accused then,
sir" and 'What I have said before is 'Yes, I am going to plead guilty now
but I was not all alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were two.’”<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Peralta's statements are supported by the record, for on November 27, 1961, the
Chief of Police had filed with the Municipal Court the separate criminal
complaint for parricide against the accused on the strength of Peralta's
statement, and the justice of the peace was to conduct the preliminary
investigation and remand the case on May 25, 1962 to the Court of First
Instance for trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">When Peralta testified for the prosecution on <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1963</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="7">July 18, 1963</st1:date>, he was already serving
his sentence at the Na­tional penitentiary in <span class="SpellE">Muntinglupa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had been meted a relative­ly light penalty
of six years and one day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u>
to twelve years and one day of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>, in view of the
apprecia­tion of several mitigating circumstances in his favor.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
He had no motive -- and none has been offered by the accused -- to assault and
kill the victim, except that as confessed to by him, that the victim had
unexpectedly returned and found him and the accused at their tryst.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No plausible reason is given -- and none <span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">has been advanced by the accused -- as to why Peralta, unless </span></span>he
was telling the truth to expiate his dark deed and do justice to the victim,
would now testify falsely against his very paramour, the accused, for whose
love he had killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony bore
no rancor against the accused and he even tried to mitigate her guilt by
claiming that the victim, upon his finding them together, had immediately
assaulted the accused with a club, kicked her and threatened to kill her
--which the trial court, however, disbelieved, as there were no visible signs
of injuries or of the "terrible beating" on the body of the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="NUM"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The version of the accused and her young daughter, <span class="SpellE">Marilou</span> <span class="SpellE">Aglibut</span>, that Peralta
alone, for no apparent motive, assaulted and killed the victim, was correctly
held to be untenable by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case of the accused, the trial court found that her actions
before and immediately after the killing, belie her claim of innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the undisputed presence of Peralta at
her conjugal home that evening, the trial Court observed that "according
to Peralta, late in the afternoon of that day, the accused invited him to a
tryst at her house that evening saying that her husband will be away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the accused denied having extended such
invitation, however, she failed to advance any explanation why Peralta was at
the conjugal home that evening, considering that, according to her own
testimony, Peralta came to the house only on the occasions when her husband was
present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither can she <span class="GramE">now deny</span> nor profess ignorance about Peralta’s intentions
towards her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her testimony, she
admitted that two weeks before the fatal incident, Peralta told her about his
passionate love for her and that, he would have succeeded in having intercourse
with her were it not for his 'stupidity' in proposing in the presence of her
children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, she was also
in love with Peralta, and would have yielded her body to him on that occasion
were it not because of her children's presence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is reasonable to infer, therefore, that the two must have thought of
waiting for another opportune time when they would give vent to their
unrequited love, and that day came on the night of </span></span><st1:date year="1961" day="22" month="11"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Novem</span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">ber 22, 1961</span></span></st1:date><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, when she learned that her husband was to go fishing."</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">As to her actions during the killing, the trial Court
likewise correctly found them to be unworthy of credence:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“According to the accused, when she was
awakened by her daughter </span></span><span class="SpellE"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">Marilou</span></span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">that evening, she immediately screamed for help and then saw Peralta in
the act of <span class="SpellE">boloing</span> her husband; that Peralta then
approached her and told her not to scream under pain of bodily harm; and that,
immediately afterwards, she and her said daughter jumped out of the window and
proceeded to her father's house </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">nearby.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">Ordinarily, a person does not scream without
knowing the reason <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, it is rather strange that Peralta, who
was <span class="SpellE">bolo­ing</span> the unfortunate husband, could have
found time to approach the accused and only to warn her not to scream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, if that was true, it is again strange
why Peralta permitted the accused to flee unscathed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Moreoever</span>, the act
of the accused in abandoning her </span></span>husband who was in distress, as
well as her children of tender ages, is quite unnatural.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ordinarily, a person placed in the same
situation as the accused, will find no sacrifice is too great that he would not
do <span style="">if </span>only to protect or defend
from danger a relative or even a stranger.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Incredible still that the accused and her daughter <span class="SpellE">Marilou</span>
could have jumped out of the window of their house and remained unscathed,
considering their weak physiques.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has
also been noted, that after the accused had allegedly awak­ened her father and
related to him the incident that occurred in her house, the latter instructed
the accused t o return to her house while, <span class="GramE">he</span> went to
notify the barrio-lieutenant about it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If that is true, then it is reasonable to conclude that when the accused
left her house, she already knew that her husband was beyond help; and that her
purpose in going to her father's house was merely to tell him about her husband's
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, if it is true that the
accused left her house because of fear of Peralta, then the only logical
explanation as to why she was able to return accompanied only by a small
daughter is, that she knew beforehand that her husband was already dead, and
that Peralta was no longer there.“<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

This claim admits her participation in the crime, but would exculpate her on
the basis of Peralta's testimony that the victim, upon finding him together
with the accused, attacked her with a club, kicked her and threatened to kill
her (supra, page 9), whereas according to the rejected defense version, the
accused was soundly asleep at the time and Peralta alone and without any motive
killed her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts as found
by the trial court and herein affirmed show none of the elements justifying the
claim of self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased was
unarmed and had not committed any act of aggression against the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She certainly would have sustained some
visible signs of injuries on her person, were this so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such injuries were shown to the trial
Court nor did the accused complain of any injuries when she executed her statement
the day following the killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor could
she claim lack of sufficient provocation, assuming that her deceased husband
assaulted her upon finding her in a tryst with her paramour at their very home.<span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
