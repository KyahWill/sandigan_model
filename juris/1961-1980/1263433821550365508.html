impugning the order of respondent court of August 16, 1976 removing petitioner
as judicial administrator in Special Proceeding No. 1986, Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Branch II, the Intestate Estate of <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> y <span class="SpellE">Bangoy</span>, and the order denying reconsideration thereof.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">According to the allegations of the petition filed below, <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> y <span class="SpellE">Bangoy</span> died on September 1, 1975 in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
City; he was a bachelor without descendants or ascendants, whether legitimate
or otherwise, apparently, without any forced heir; he left personal and real
properties worth about One Million (P1,000,000) Pesos; and he died intestate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition prayed for the issuance of
letters of administration to the Clerk of Court, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span>
A. <span class="SpellE">Unson</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due notice and hearing, respondent judge selected and
appointed petitioner from among several nominees of the parties, as the
judicial administrator of the estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span>, herein
private respondent, claiming to be the nearest <span style="">of kin of the deceased, moved for <span class="GramE">reconsideration</span>,
but His Honor denied said motion holding <u>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></u>
that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> upon
its finding that, of all the would be administrators herein recommended, <span class="SpellE">Facundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> appears to be the
most qualified and suitable in that he not only enjoyed the confidence of the
decedent, but, also because up to the death of the latter, he appeared to have
been managing and overseeing the affairs of the estate and therefore is in a
position to better handle the preservation of the entire estate for the
estate." (Annex ‘B’, Order, March 8, 1976)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Corresponding
letters of administration were accordingly issued to petitioner on </span><st1:date year="1976" day="15" month="3"><span style="">March
 15, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An attempt of private respondent to appeal
from said appointment was later withdrawn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Because certain
properties happened to be in the possession of herein private respondent,
petitioner moved for delivery thereof to him but this motion was denied by the
vacation judge then acting in place of herein respondent judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, respondent <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> must have submitted some kind of inventory at
least of the properties in his possession, for on </span><st1:date year="1976" day="31" month="5"><span style="">May 31, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondent judge issued the following
order:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The inventory submitted by <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> shows that a promissory note was executed by <span class="SpellE">Facundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> on <st1:date year="1973" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1973</st1:date> with the information
that there is no record of payment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW WHEREOF, <span class="SpellE">Facundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> is hereby directed to appear before this Court on <st1:date year="1976" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1976</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30 A.M.</st1:time> to explain and produce receipts of payment of
said promissory note if there is any in his possession.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span> <span class="GramE">(Annex
"H", p. 36, Record.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Then
on </span><st1:date year="1976" day="14" month="6"><span style="">June 14, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">,
His Honor issued another order, which is self-explanatory, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"This refers to the Order of the Court dated May 31, 1976,
requiring <span class="SpellE">Facundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span>
to appear, and explain or produce receipts of payment for the promissory note
in the amount of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> which he executed in favor
of the late <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span>
on August 18, 1973, which appeared in the reports submitted by <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> per Order of this
Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the hearing, <span class="SpellE">Facundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> admitted that he signed the promissory note
(Exhibit 'C' – Motion-<span class="SpellE">Facundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span>)
after the execution of the Deed of Sale (Exhibit ‘A’ – Motion-<span class="SpellE">Facundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span>) of 2 motor
vehicles in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Facundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> further admitted
that he was not able to pay the installments in the manner set forth in the
promissory note but he was able to pay it all.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When asked to produce any receipt of the payments he made, <span class="SpellE">Facundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> claimed that he
did not get any receipt, because he and the late <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> are like brothers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this is so, then why did the late <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> require him to sign
a promissory note?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Again, if the claim of <span class="SpellE">Facundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> is true since the Deed of Sale stated that the
consideration was already paid, why did not the late <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span>
return the promissory note to him, gratis <span class="GramE">et</span> amore, or
after he (<span class="SpellE">Facundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span>),
had fully paid the same.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the face of the record, the explanation of <span class="SpellE">Facundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> does not merit
any serious consideration.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, <span class="SpellE">Facundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> is hereby directed to pay the intestate estate of <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> the sum of Ten
Thousand (P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) Pesos within a period of sixty
(60) days from receipt of this order.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span> <span class="GramE">(Annex
"I", pp. 37-38, Record.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner asked for reconsideration <span style="">of</span> the foregoing order, explaining that he had already paid the
amount in question but since he "was precluded from testifying"
thereon under the prohibition against testimony of survivors, he proposed that
he be allowed to pay the same in monthly installments of P500.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this motion, respondent countered with a
motion asking that petitioner "be removed or allowed to resign"
because his failure to pay "may be considered as evidence of abuse of
trust and confidence".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Annex K of
petition.) Petitioner filed a rejoinder, Annex L of the petition, contending
that there was no legal ground for his removal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Resolving the incident, His Honor relieved petitioner as judicial
administrator reasoning out thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The deceased <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> as the preliminary record of the case will show,
left a considerable estate, consisting principally of income-producing urban
and agricultural lands, with some personal properties.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In considering the appointment of a judicial administrator,
this Court took into account that the said person must be a man of utmost
integrity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Primarily because of the full
trust and confidence that the deceased had apparently shown on the face of the
Special Power of Attorney dated <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="8">August
 15, 1963</st1:date> to <span class="SpellE">Facundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span>
and of the Affidavit dated <st1:date year="1974" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1974</st1:date>,
he was appointed by this Court as judicial administrator.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is sad to state that administrator <span class="SpellE">Facundo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> did not measure up to the standard of
integrity and character the Court required and expected of him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Due to the sizeable and valuable estate with considerable
income, the judicial administrator must have a character to resist temptation
for personal gain which is open to him in such a position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He must therefore be, 'like <span class="SpellE">Ceasar's</span> Wife above suspicion'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"His explanation stated in the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
motion for reconsideration that he 'never denied his obligation under the
promissory note but claimed payment', is a posture, under the circumstances
shown during the hearing, that does not speak well of the character expected of
a judicial administrator.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thus, under the said circumstances as shown during the
hearing, administrator <span class="SpellE">Facundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span>
appears to be unsuitable for the position as judicial administrator and his
continuance in the position would work to the disadvantage of the said
estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coupled with his account with
the estate in the amount of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, his relief
from the position is necessary." <span class="GramE">(Annex "N",
pp. 47-48, Record.)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is the position of petitioner that in so relieving him of his
position as judicial administrator, respondent acted in grave abuse of
discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He points out that it was
actually he who revealed the existence of the promissory note—and this
allegation is not denied by respondents—and that if his claim that he has
already paid the amount in question has not convinced the court, it cannot be
said that it is so entirely and totally incredible that it could be considered
as justifying His Honor's conclusion that petitioner has not lived or measured
up to the standard of integrity and character of a judicial administrator.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, respondent posits that petitioner, not being
in any way related to the deceased, was appointed merely in the exercise of the
court's discretion and cannot therefore claim any "proprietary and/or
pecuniary right to insist in administering the properties now under <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">legis</span></u>."
In other words, the point raised is that respondent judge should also have wide
discretion in removing him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before passing on such conflicting claims of the parties, it may
be mentioned here that in a motion dated <st1:date year="1979" day="10" month="5">May 10, 1979</st1:date>, private respondent prays that he "be
allowed to file a motion with the probate court for removal of <span class="SpellE">Facundo</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> as adminis­trator
on grounds different from the ground upon which he was relieved by the probate
court." It is alleged in said motion that:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 10pt 0in;">"III</p>

<blockquote>"Private respondent <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> would like to file a motion with the Probate Court
for removal of <span class="SpellE">Facundo</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span>
as administrator for acts committed prior and subsequent to his relief as
administrator by the Probate Court, grounds different from the ground upon
which he was removed by the Probate Court, hoping that with two cases pending
against him, the termination of one will bring about his early removal as
administrator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But because of the
temporary restraining order issued by this Honorable Court enjoining the respondent
Judge from further proceeding with Special Case No. 1986, leave of this
Honorable Court is necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The

<p class="BODY">The Court is of the considered view that if the foregoing
allegations are sufficiently substantiated, after appropriate proceedings, the
removal of petitioner would be legally justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, rather than insist on the ground
relied upon by His Honor in his order under review, which to Us appears to be
quite flimsy, considering that the mere fact that an administrator happens to
owe money to the decedent is not in itself a ground for his removal, and in
this case the evidence does not seem indubitable that petitioner's claim of
payment was made in bad faith or in an obvious attempt to defraud the
estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be fairer for all
concerned for respondents to proceed against petitioner on the basis of the
above-quoted charges against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
this connection, it is to be noted that in the considerations of His Honor's
order of <st1:date year="1976" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1976</st1:date> hereinabove
earlier quoted, it is not definite that petitioner's explanation was malicious
and inherently unfounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event,
the petitioner has not refused to pay; he only asked for some liberality so he
could pay in installments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, such
proposal could not have converted him into a debtor in bad faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The point of integrity raised by respondent
court appears a little harsh.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise
stated, <span class="GramE">We</span> find the ground for which petitioner has
been removed to be rather precipitate.<span style="">&nbsp;

abuse of discretion and should be set aside.</p>
