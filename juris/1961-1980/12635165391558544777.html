which provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"To help raise funds for the Philippine Tuberculosis Society,
the Director of Posts shall or­der for the period from August nineteen to
Septem­ber thirty every year the printing and issue of semi-postal stamps of
different denominations with face value showing the regular postage charge plus
the additional amount of five centavos for the said pur­pose, and during the
said period, no mail matter shall be accepted in the mails unless it bears such
semi-postal stamps:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided,</u>
That no such addi­tional charge of five centavos shall be imposed on
newspapers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The additional proceeds
realized from the sale of the semi-postal stamps shall constitute a special
fund and be deposited with the National Treasury to be expended by the
Philippine Tubercu­losis Society in carrying out its noble work to pre­vent and
eradicate tuberculosis."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Postmaster General, in implementation of the law,
thereafter issued four (4) administrative orders numbered 3 (<st1:date year="1958" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1958</st1:date>), 7 (<st1:date year="1958" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1958</st1:date>), 9 (<st1:date year="1958" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1958</st1:date>), and 10 (<st1:date year="1960" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1960</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these administrative orders were issued
with the approval of the respondent Secretary of Public Works and Com­munications.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent portions of Adm. Order 3 read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Such semi-postal stamps could not be made available during
the period from August 19 to <st1:date year="1957" day="30" month="9">September
 30, 1957</st1:date>, for lack of time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, two denominations of such stamps, one at '5 + 5' cen­tavos and
another at '10 + 5' centavos, will soon be released for use by the public on
their mails to be posted during the same period starting with the year 1958.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"During the period from August 19 to September 30 each year
starting in 1958, no mail matter of whatever class, and whether domestic or foreign,
posted at any Philippine Post Office and addressed for delivery in this country
or abroad, shall be accepted for mailing unless it bears at least one such semi-postal
stamp showing the additional value of five centavos intended for the Philippine
Tuberculosis Society.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the case of second-class mails and mails prepaid by means
of mail permits or impressions of postage meters, each piece of such mail shall
bear at least one such semi-postal stamp if posted during the period above
stated starting with the year 1958, in addition to being charged the usual
postage prescribed by existing regulations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case of business reply envelopes and cards mailed during said
period, such stamp should be collected from the addressees at the time of
delivery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mails entitled to franking
privilege like those from the office of the President, members of Congress, and
other offices to which such privilege has been granted, shall each also bear
one such semi-postal stamp if posted during the said period.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Mails posted during the said period starting in 1958, which
are found in street or post-office mail boxes without the required semi-postal
stamp, shall be returned to the sender, if known, with a no­tation calling for
the affixing of such stamp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
sender, is unknown, the mail matter shall be treated as <span class="SpellE">nonmailable</span>
and forwarded to the Dead Letter Of­fice for proper disposition."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Adm. Order 7, amending the fifth paragraph of Adm. Order 3, reads
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In the case of the following categories of mail matter and
mails entitled to franking privi­lege which are not exempted from the payment
of the five centavos intended for the Philippine Tuberculosis society, such
extra charge may be collec­ted in cash, for which official receipt (General
Form No. 13, A) shall be issued, instead of affix­ing the semi-postal stamp in
the manner hereinafter indicated:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"'1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Second-class mails</u>. - Aside from the
postage at the second-class rate, the extra charge of five centavos for the
Philippine Tuberculosis Society shall be collected on each separately-addressed
piece of second class mail matter, and the total sum thus collected shall be
entered in the same official receipt to be issued for the postage at the
second-class rate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In making such entry,
the total number of pieces of second-class mail posted shall be stated,
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Total charge for TB Fund on 100
pieces. . P5.00.' The extra charge shall be entered separate from the postage
in both of the official receipt and the Record of Collec­tions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"'2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>First-class and third-class mail per­mits</u>.
- Mails to be posted without postage affixed under permits issued by this
Bureau shall each be charged the usual postage, in addition to the five centavo

</span>The total extra charge thus received shall be entered in the same
official receipt to be issued for the postage collected, as in sub-paragraph 1.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"'3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Metered mails</u>. - For each piece of mail
matter impressed by postage meter under metered mail permit issued by this
Bureau, the extra charge of five centavos for said society shall be collected

manner indicated in subparagraph 1.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"'4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Business reply cards and envelopes</u>. -
Upon delivery of business reply cards and enve­lopes to holders of business
reply permits, the five-centavo charge intended for said society shall be
collected in cash on each reply card or enve­lope delivered, in addition to the
required postage which may also be paid in cash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An official receipt shall be issued for the
total postage and total extra charge received, in the manner shown in
subparagraph 1.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"'5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Mails entitled to franking privilege</u>. -
Government agencies, officials, and other persons entitled to the franking
privilege under existing laws may pay in cash such extra charge intended for
said society, <span class="SpellE">insteads</span> of affixing the semi-postal
stamps to their mails, provided that such mails are presented at the
post-office window, where the five-centavo extra charge for said society shall
be collected on each piece of such mail matter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In such case, an official receipt shall be issued for the total sum thus
collected, in the manner stated in subparagraph 1.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"'Mails under permits, metered mails and franked mails not
presented at the post-office win­dow shall be affixed with the necessary
semi-postal stamps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If found in mail
boxes without such stamps, they shall be treated in the same way as herein
provided for other mails.'"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Adm. Order 9, amending Adm. Order 3, as amended, exempts
"Government and its Agencies and Instrumentalities Per­forming
Governmental Functions." Adm. Order 10, amending Adm. Order 3, as amended,
exempts "copies of periodical publications received for mailing under any
class of mail matter, in­cluding newspapers and magazines admitted as
second-class mail."</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>The FACTS</u>. On <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="9">September
 15, 1963</st1:date> the petitioner Benjamin P. Gomez mailed a letter at the
post office in <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Pam­panga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because
this letter, addressed to a certain Agustin <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> of
<st1:street><st1:address>1014 <span class="SpellE">Dagohoy</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>,
<span class="SpellE">Singalong</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
did not bear the special anti-TB stamp required by the statute, it was returned
to the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of this development, the petitioner brought this suit for
declaratory relief in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>,
to test the constitutionality of the statute, as well as the implementing
administrative orders issued, contending that it violates the equal protection
clause of the Constitution as well as the rule of uniformity and equality of
taxation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court declared the
statute and the orders unconstitutional; hence this appeal by the respondent
pos­tal authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the reasons set out in this opinion, the judgment appealed
from must be reversed.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<p class="BODY">Before reaching the merits, we deem it necessary to dispose of
the respondents' contention that declaratory relief is unavail­ing because this
suit was filed after the petitioner had committed a breach of the statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While conceding that the mailing by the
petitio­ner of a letter without the additional anti-TB stamp was a violation of
Republic Act 1635, as amended, the trial court nevertheless re­fused to dismiss
the action on the ground that under section 6 of Rule 64 of the Rules of Court,
"If before the final termination of the case a breach or violation of . .
. a statute . . . should take place, the action may thereupon be converted into
an ordinary action."</p>

<p class="BODY">The prime specification of an action for declaratory relief is
that it must be brought "before breach or violation" of the statute
has been committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rule 64, section 1
so provides.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 6 of the same rule,
which allows the court to treat an action for decla­ratory relief as an
ordinary action, applies only if the breach or violation occurs after the
filing of the action but before the termination thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, if, as the trial court itself admitted, there had been a
breach of the statute before the filing of this action, then indeed the remedy
of declaratory relief cannot be availed of, much less can the suit be converted
into an ordinary action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is there merit in the petitioner's argument that the mailing
of the letter in question did not constitute a breach of the statute because
the statute appears to be addressed only to postal authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statute, it is true, in terms provides
that "no mail matter shall be accepted in the mails unless it bears such
semi-postal stamps." it does not follow, however, that only postal
authorities can be guilty of violating it by accepting mails with­out the
payment of the anti-TB stamp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
obvious that they can be guilty of violating the statute only if there are
people who use the mails without paying for the additional anti-TB stamp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just as in bribery the mere offer constitutes
a breach of the law, so in the matter of the anti-TB stamp the mere attempt to
use the mails without the stamp constitutes a violation of the statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not required that the mail be accepted
by postal authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That re­quirement
is relevant only for the purpose of fixing the liability of postal officials.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, we are of the view that the petitioner's choice of
remedy is correct because this suit was filed not only with res­pect to the
letter which he mailed on September 15, 1963, but also with regard to any other
mail that he might send in the future.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, in his complaint, the petitioner prayed that due course be given
to "other mails without the semi-postal stamps which he may deliver for
mailing . . . if any, during the period covered by Republic Act 1635, as
amended, as well as other mails hereafter to be sent by or to other mailers
which bear the required postage, without collection of additional charge of
five centavos prescribed by the said Republic Act." As one whose mail was
returned, the petitioner is certainly interested in a ruling on the validity of
the statute requir­ing the use of additional stamps.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now consider the constitutional objections raised against the
statute and the implementing orders.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->It is said that the statute is <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the equal protec­tion clause of the
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More specifically the
claim is made that it constitutes mail users into a class for the purpose of
the tax while leaving untaxed the rest of the population and that even among
postal patrons the statute discriminatorily grants exemption to newspapers
while Administrative Order 9 of the respondent Postmaster General grants a
similar exemption to offices performing governmental functions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The five centavo charge levied by Republic Act 1635, as amended,
is in the nature of an excise tax, laid upon the exercise of a privilege,
namely, the privilege of using the mails.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As such the objections <span class="SpellE">levelled</span> against it
must be viewed in the light of ap­plicable principles of taxation.</p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, it is settled that the legislature has the in­herent
power to select the subjects of taxation and to grant exemptions.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
This power has aptly been described as "of wide range and
flexibility."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, it is said that in the field of taxation, more than in other areas, the
legislature possesses the greatest freedom in classification.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The reason for this is that traditionally, classi­fication has been a device
for fitting tax programs to local needs and usages in order to achieve an
equitable distribution of the tax burden.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That legislative classifications must be reasonable is of course <span class="SpellE">undenied</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But what
the petitioner asserts is that statutory classification of mail users must bear
some reasonable relation­ship to the end sought to be attained, and that absent
such relation­ship the selection of mail users is constitutionally
impermissible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is altogether a
different proposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As explained in <u>Commonwealth
v. Life Assurance Co.</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"While the principle that there must
be a reason­able relationship between classification made by the legislation
and its purpose is undoubtedly true in some contexts, it has no application to
a mea­sure whose sole purpose is to raise revenue. . .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So long as the classification imposed is
based upon some standard capable of reasonable comprehension, be that standard
passed upon ability to produce revenue or some other legitimate distribution,
equal protection of the law has been afforded.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>See Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. v. Bowers, supra 338 <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>

<p class="BODY">We are not wont to invalidate legislation on equal protec­tion
grounds except by the clearest demonstration that it sanctions invidious
discrimination, which is all that the Constitution forbids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The remedy for unwise legislation must be
sought in the legisla­ture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, the
classification of mail users is not without any rea­son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is based on ability to pay, let alone the
enjoyment of a pri­vilege, and on administrative convenience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the allocation of the tax burden, Congress
must have concluded that the contribu­tion to the anti-TB fund can best be
assured by those who can af­ford the use of the mails.</p>

<p class="BODY">The classification is likewise based on considerations of
administrative convenience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is
now a settled principle of law that "considerations of practical
administrative convenience and cost in the administration of tax laws afford
adequate grounds for imposing a tax on a well recognized and defined
class."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case of the anti-TB stamp, undoubtedly, the single most im­portant and
influential, consideration that led the legislature to se­lect mail users as
subjects of the tax is the relative ease and con­venience of collecting the tax
through the post offices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The small
amount of five centavos does not justify the great expense and in­convenience
of collecting through the regular means of collection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, by placing the duty of
collection on postal autho­rities the tax was made almost self-enforcing, with
as little cost and as little inconvenience as possible.</p>

<p class="BODY">And then of course it is not accurate to say that the statute
constituted mail users into a class.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mail users were already a class by themselves even before the enactment
of the statute and all that the legislature did was merely to select their
class.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Le­gislation is essentially
empiric and Republic Act 1635, as amended, no more than reflects a distinction
that exists in fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Mr. Justice
Frankfurter said, "to recognize differences that exist in fact is living
law; to disregard [them] and concentrate on some abstract identities is
lifeless logic."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Granted the power to select the subject of taxation, the State's
power to grant exemption must likewise be conceded as a necessary
corollary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tax exemptions are too common
in the law; they have never been thought of as raising issues under the equal
protection clause.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus erroneous for the trial court to hold that because
certain mail users are exempted from the levy the law and admi­nistrative
officials have sanctioned an invidious discrimination of­fensive to the
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The application of the
lower court's theory would require all mail users to be taxed, a conclusion
that is hardly tenable in the light of differences in status of mail
users.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution does not require
this kind of equality.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the United States Supreme Court has said, the legislature may
withhold the burden of the tax in order to foster what it conceives to be a
beneficent enterprise.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
This is the case of newspapers which, under the amendment introduced by
Republic Act 2631, are exempt from the payment of the additional stamp.</p>

<p class="BODY">As for the Government and its instrumentalities, their exemption
rests on the State's sovereign immunity from taxation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The State cannot be taxed without its consent
and such consent, being in derogation as its sovereignty, is to be strictly
construed.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Administrative Order 9 of the respondent Postmaster General, which lists the
various offices and instrumentalities of the Govern­ment exempt from the
payment of the anti-TB stamp, is but a restatement of this well-known principle
of constitutional law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court likewise held the law invalid on the ground that
it singles out tuberculosis to the exclusion of other diseases, which, it is
said, are equally a menace to public health.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But it is never a requirement of equal protection that all evils of the
same genus be eradicated or none at all.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
As this Court has had occasion to say, "if the law presumably hits the
evil where it is most felt, it is not to be overthrown because there are other
instances to which it might have been applied."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner further
argues that the tax in question is invalid, first, because it is not levied for
a public purpose as no special benefits accrue to mail users as taxpayers, and
second, because it violates the rule of uniformity in taxation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The eradication of a dreaded disease is a public purpose, but if
by public purpose the petitioner means benefit to a taxpayer as a return for
what he pays, then it is sufficient answer to say that the only benefit to
which the taxpayer is constitutionally enti­tled is that derived from his
enjoyment of the privileges of living in an organized society, established and
safeguarded by the devotion of taxes to public purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any other view would preclude the levying of
taxes except as they are used to compensate for the burden on those who pay
them and would involve the abandonment of the most fundamental principle of
government - that it exists primarily to provide for the common good.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is the rule of uniformity and equality of taxation in­fringed
by the imposition of a flat rate rather than a grated tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A tax need not be measured by the weight of
the mail or the extent of the service rendered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have said that considerations of administrative convenience and cost
afford an adequate ground for classification.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The same considerations may induce the legisla­ture to impose a flat tax
which in effect is a charge for the tran­saction, operating equally on all
persons with the class regardless of the amount involved.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
As Mr. Justice Holmes said in sustain­ing the validity of a stamp act which
imposed a flat rate of two cents on every $100 face value of stock transferred,</p>

<blockquote>"One of the stocks was worth $30.75 a
share of the face value of $100, the other $172.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inequality of the tax, so far as actual
values are concerned, is manifest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But,
here again equality in this sense has to yield to practical considerations and
usage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There must be a fixed and
indisputable mode of ascertaining a stamp tax.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In another sense, more­over, there is equality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the taxes on two sales are equal, the
same number of shares is sold in each case; that is to say, the same privi­lege
is used to the same extent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Valuation is
not the only thing to be considered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
was pointed out by the court of appeals, the familiar stamp tax of 2 cents on
checks, irrespective of income or earning capacity, and many others, illustrate
the necessity and practice of sometimes substituting count for weight. . .

<p class="BODY">According to the trial court, the money raised from the sales of
the anti-TB stamps is spent for the benefit of the Philippine Tuberculosis
Society, a private organization, without appro­priation by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as the Solicitor General points out, the
Society is not really the beneficiary but only the agency through which the
State acts in carrying out what is essentially a public function.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The money is treated as a special fund and as
such need not be appropriated by law.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the claim is made that the statute is
so broadly drawn that to execute it the respondents had to issue administrative
orders far beyond their powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
this is one of the grounds on which the lower court invalidated Republic Act
1631, as amended, namely, that it constitutes an undue delegation of legislative
power.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Administrative Order 3, as amended by Administrative Orders 7 and
10, provides that for certain classes of mail mat­ters (such as mail permits,
metered mails, business reply cards, etc.), the five-centavo charge may be paid
in cash instead of the purchase of the anti-TB stamp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It further states that mails deposited during
the period August 19 to September 30 of each year in mail boxes without the
stamp should be returned to the sender, if known, otherwise they should be
treated as <span class="SpellE">nonmailable</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the law does not expressly authorize the collection
of five centavos except through the sale of anti-TB stamps, but such authority
may be implied in so far as it may be necessary to prevent a failure of the
undertaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The authority given to the
Postmaster General to raise funds through the mails must be liberally
construed, consistent with the principle that where the end is required the
appropriate means are given.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The anti-TB stamp is a distinctive stamp which shows on its face
not only the amount of the additional charge but also that of the regular
postage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of business reply
cards, for instance, it is obvious that to require mailers to affix the anti-TB
stamp on their cards would be to make then pay much more be­cause the cards
likewise bear the amount of the regular postage.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is likewise true that the statute does not provide for the
disposition of mails which do not bear the anti-TB stamp, but a declaration
therein that "no mail matter shall be accepted in the mails unless it
bears such semi-postal stamp" is a declaration that such mail matter is <span class="SpellE">nonmailable</span> within the meaning of section 1952 of the
Administrative Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Administrative
Order 7 of the Postmaster General is but a restatement of the law for the
guidance of postal officials and employees.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As for Administra­tive Order 9, we have already said that in listing the
offices and entities of the Government exempt from the payment of the stamp,
the respondent Postmaster General merely observed an esta­blished principle,
namely, that the Government is exempt from taxation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> is reversed,
and the complaint is dismissed, without pronouncement as to costs.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FERNANDO, <i>J</i>.:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I join fully the rest of my colleagues in the decision upholding
Republic Act No. 1635 as amended by Republic Act No. 2631 and the majority
opinion expounded with Justice Castro's usual vigor and lucidity subject to one
qualification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With all due recognition
of its inherently persuasive character, it would seem to me that the same
result could be achieved if reliance be had on police power rather than the
attribute of taxation, as the constitutional basis for the challenged
legislation.</p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>For me, the statute in question is an exercise of the regu­latory
power connected with the performance of the public service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I refer of course to the government postal
function, one of respecta­ble and ancient lineage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The United States Constitution of 1787 vests
in the federal government acting through Congress the power to establish post
offices.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The first act providing for the organization of government departments in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
approved <st1:date year="1901" day="6" month="9">Sept. 6, 1901</st1:date>,
provided for the Bureau of Post Offices in the Department of Commerce and
Police.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Its creation is thus a manifestation of one of the many services in which the
government may engage for public convenience and public interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the case, it seems that any
legislation that in effect would require increase cost, of postage is well
within the discretionary authority of the government.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may not be acting in a proprietary capacity but in fixing the
fees that it collects for the use of the mails, the broad discretion that it
enjoys is undeniable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that sense, the
principle announced in Esteban v. <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
in an opinion by our Chief Justice, while not precisely controlling furnishes
for me more than ample support for the validity of the challenged legislation. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Certain exactions, imposable under an authority other than police
power, are not subject, however, to qualification as to the amount chargeable, <span style="">unless the Constitution or the pertinent laws
provide otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, the
rates of taxes, whether national or municipal, need not be reasonable, in the
absence of such constitutional or statutory limitation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, when a municipal corporation fixes
the fees for the use of its properties, such as public markets, it does not
wield the police power, or even the power of taxation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither does it assert governmental
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It exercises merely a
proprietary function.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, like any
private owner, it is - in the absence of the aforementioned limitation, which
does not exist in the Charter of <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span> City
(Republic Act No. 526) - free to charge such sums as it may deem best,
regardless of the reasonableness of the amount fixed, for the prospective
lessees are free to enter into the corresponding contract of lease, if they are
agreeable to the terms thereof, or, otherwise, not enter into such
contract."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would appear likewise
that an expression of one's personal views both as to the <u>attitude</u> and <u>awareness</u>
that must be displayed by inferior tribunals when the "delicate and awesome"
power of passing on the validity of statute would not be in­appropriate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The Constitution is the supreme law,
and statutes are written and enforced in submission to its commands."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
It is likewise common place in constitutional law that a party adversely
affected could, again to quote from <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span>,
"invoke, when constitutional immunities are threatened, the judgment of
the courts."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Since the power of
judicial review flows logically from the judicial function of ascertaining the
facts and applying the law and since obviously the Constitution is the highest
law before which statutes must bend, then inferior tribunals can, in the dis­charge
of their judicial functions, nullify legislative acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, in clear cases, such is
not only their power but their duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the language of the present Chief Justice:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"In fact, whenever the conflicting claims of the parties to a
litigation, cannot properly be settled without inquiring into the validity of
an act of Congress or of either House thereof the courts have, not only
jurisdiction to pass upon said issue, but, also, the <u>duty</u> to do so, <u>which
cannot be evaded</u> without violating the fundamental law and paving the way
to its eventual destruction."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Nonetheless, the
admonition of Cooley, specially addressed to inferior tribunals, must ever kept
in mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It must be evident to any one that the
power to declare a legislative enact­ment void is one which the judge,
conscious of the fallibility of the human judgment, will shrink from exercising
in any case where he can conscientiously and with due regard to duty and
official oath decline the responsibility."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There must be a caveat
however to the above Cooley pronouncement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such should not be the <span style="">case, </span>to
paraphrase Freund, when the challenged legislation imperils freedom of the mind
and of the person, for given such an undesirable situation, "it is freedom
that commands a momentum of respect." Here then, fidelity to the great
ideal of liberty enshrined in the Constitution may require the judiciary to
take an uncompromising and militant stand. As phrased by us in a recent
decision, "if the liberty involved were freedom of the mind or the person,
the standard for its validity of governmental acts is much more rigorous and
exacting."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">So much
for the appropriate judicial <u>attitude</u>.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Now on the question of <u>awareness</u> of the controlling
constitutional doctrines.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is nothing I can
add to the enlightening discussion of the equal protection aspect as found in
the majority opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may not be
amiss to recall to mind, however, the language of Justice Laurel in the leading
case of People v, Vera,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">to the effect that the basic individual right of equal protection
"is a restraint on all the three grand departments of our government and
on the subordinate instrumentalities and subdivisions thereof, and on many
constitutional powers, like the police power, taxation and eminent
domain."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Nonetheless, no jurist was more care­ful in
avoiding the dire consequences to what the legislative body might have deemed
necessary to promote the ends of public welfare if <span style="">the equal protection </span>guaranty were made to constitute an
insurmountable obstacle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A similar sense of
realism was invariably displayed by Justice Frankfurter, as is quite evident
from the various citations from his pen found in the majority opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For him, it would be a misreading of the
equal protection clause to ignore actual conditions and settled practices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not for him the at times academic and sterile
approach to constitutional problems of this sort.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"It would be a narrow conception of jurisprudence to confine the
notion of 'laws' to what is found written on the statute books, and to
disregard the gloss which life has written upon it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Settled state practice cannot supplant
constitutional guaranties, but it can establish what <span class="GramE">is state
law</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Equal Protection Clause
did not write an empty formalism into the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Deeply embedded traditional ways of carrying
out state policy, such as those of which petitioner <span class="GramE">complains</span>
are often tougher and truer law then the dead words of the written text."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> This too, from the same distinguished
jurist:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The Constitution does not
require things which are different in fact or opinion to be treated in law as
though they were the same."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Now, as
to non-delegation.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be admitted that the problem of
non-delegation of legislative power at times occasions difficulties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its strict view has been announced by Justice
Laurel in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> case in People </span><span style="">v. </span><span style="">Vera in this language.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In testing whether a
statute constitutes an undue delegation of legislative power nor not, it is
usual to inquire whether the statute was complete in all its terms and
provisions when it left the hands of the legislature so that nothing was left
to the judgment of any other appointee or delegate of the legislature. * * *.
In United States </span><span style="">v. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ang</span></span><span style=""> Tang Ho * * *, this court adhered to the
foregoing rule </span><span style="">it </span><span style="">held an act of the legislature void in so far
as it undertook to authorize the Governor-General, in his discretion, to issue
a proclamation fixing the price of rice and to make the sale of it in violation
of the proclamation a crime."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Only recently, the
present Chief Justice reaffirmed the above view in <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>
v. Auditor General,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <span class="GramE">specially</span> where the
dele­gation deals not with an administrative function but one essentially and
eminently legislative in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
could properly be stigmatized though, to quote Justice <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span>,
is delegation of authority that is "unconfined and vagrant, one not
canalized within banks which keep it froth overflowing."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This is not the situation as it presents itself to us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was delegated was power not legislative
in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice Laurel himself, in
a later case, People v. Rosenthal,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
admitted that within certain limits, there being a need for coping with the
more intricate problem of society, the principle of "subordinate
legislation" has been accepted, not only in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
but, in practically all modern govern­ments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This view was reiterated by him in a 1940 decision, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
Transportation Co., Inc. v. Public Service Com­mission.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Accordingly, with the
growing complexity of modern life, the multiplication of the subjects of govern­mental
<span class="GramE">regulation,</span> and the increased difficulty of
administering the laws, there is a constantly growing tendency toward the
delegation of greater powers by the legislature, and toward the approval of the
practice by the courts."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the above views of eminent jurists, authori­tative
in character, of both the equal protection clause and the non-delegation
principle, it is apparent how far the lower court departed from the path of
constitutional orthodoxy in nullifying Republic Act No. 1635 as amended.
Fortunately, the Matter has been set right with the reversal of its decision,
the opinion of the Court, manifesting its fealty to constitutional law
precepts, which have been reiterated time and time again and for the soundest
of reasons.</p>
