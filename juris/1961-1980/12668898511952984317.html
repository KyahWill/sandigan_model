<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appeal by petitioners Enrique 
<span class="SpellE">Sison</span> and Pablo L. Santos, Jr. as Acting Municipal 
Mayor and as Acting Chief of Police, respectively, of <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, from the decision 
of the Court of First Instance of said province in Civil Case No. 3303, 
"dismissing the petition for injunction; declaring the removal of respondent 
<span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale</span> as 
Acting Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, on June 30, 1957, as illegal, as well as the 
appointment in his stead of petitioner Pablo L. Santos, Jr.; and ordering the 
reinstatement of <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale</span> as Acting Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, effective June 30, 
1957 with the incident of payment of back salaries by the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellants filed this action for 
injunction, with a prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction, on September 8, 
1958 against <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> Juan <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span>, Executive Secretary, <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Lugay</span>, Provincial Governor of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale</span>, relieved Acting Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, to restrain them 
from compelling appellant Enrique M. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> to 
reinstate <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale</span> as Acting Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, and from filing 
charges, administrative or otherwise, against said appellant for 
insubordination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The facts, which are not 
disputed, are as follows: On January 1, 1953, Enrique <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>, then Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, appointed <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale</span>, a veteran and non-civil service eligible, as 
Acting Chief of Police of said municipality, with a salary of P1,080.00 per 
annum (Exhibit A), and reappointed him on April 1, 1955 (Exhibit 1-A). On June 
29, 1957, Mayor <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> recalled and cancelled <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale's</span> appointment as Acting Chief of Police effective 
4:00 o'clock in the afternoon (Exhibit B) and at the same time designated 
Patrolman Pablo L. Santos, Jr., likewise a veteran and <span class="GramE">non-civil</span> service eligible, in his 
place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On June 29, 1957, <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale</span> sought the opinion of the Commissioner of Civil 
Service on the legality of the recall and cancellation of his appointment, which 
query was indorsed by the Commissioner to Mayor <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>, 
for comment. On October 22, 1957, the Mayor commented that since <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale</span> was appointed by him in acting and temporary 
capacity and was found to be inefficient and incompetent in discharging his 
official duties and lie taw l081 his confidence and trust in him, it was best 
for the inters of the service that his appointment be recalled. <span class="GramE">(pp. 3-4 record on appeal).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On July 9, 1957, <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale</span> likewise wrote the President asking for his 
reinstatement and for the investigation of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>. The Executive Secretary, on July 19, 1957, referred 
the request to Governor <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lugay</span> of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> for investigation 
and appropriate action (Exhibits 5 and 5-A).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On January 8 and 27, 1958, the 
Provincial Board of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> conducted an investigation, 
and both Mayor <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale</span> testified before the Secretary of the Board. Upon 
termination of the investigation, the Board rendered its decision declaring the 
separation of <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale</span> to be illegal, and recommended 
to the Office of the President his immediate reinstatement. <span class="GramE">(Exhibits 6, 6-A and 6-B).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">By way of 6th <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> dated April 28, 1958, the Executive Secretary 
directed the Governor of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> to request Mayor <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> to reinstate <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale</span> 
immediately as the latter's relief by Pablo Santos, Jr., a non-civil service 
eligible and veteran, was illegal under Republic Act No. 65, as amended, and 
advising the Mayor to conduct administrative proceedings against <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale</span> under Republic Act No. 557. Mayor <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> refused to reinstate <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale</span>; instead, on May 26, 1958 he wrote the President, 
thru the Provincial Governor of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, asking for the 
reconsideration of the order of reinstatement. This was denied on June 12, 1958 
by the Executive Secretary who reiterated his <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> dated April'28, 1958, directing immediate 
reinstatement of <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale</span>. (Exhibits D, E and F). 
<span class="SpellE">Inspite</span> of a letter of the Provincial Governor 
threatening to charge him with insubordination should he fail to comply with the 
order of reinstatement, Mayor <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> failed and refused 
to reinstate <span class="SpellE">lacanlale</span>. (Exhibits F, F-l, H and 1), 
and later filed this action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On September 13, 1958, the 
Provincial Governor of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> filed his opposition to 
the petition for writ of preliminary injunction, while <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale</span> filed his answer on September 23 wherein, aside 
from adopting <u>in <span class="SpellE">toto</span></u> the opposition of the 
Governor, claimed moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees amounting to 
P11<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>. The Executive Secretary's answer averred 
that the appointment of petitioner Santos, Jr. was void <span class="SpellE">ab</span> <span class="SpellE">initio</span>, and by way of 
affirmative and special defense invoked the provisions of Republic Act No. 65, 
as amended by Republic Act Nos. 154 and 1363 which gives preference and security 
to veterans, and Provincial Circular (Unnumbered) dated April 3, 1954 relative 
to the removal and suspension of subordinate officials in the local governments. 
On October 4, 1958, the Executive Secretary also filed his opposition to the 
issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On October 20, 1958, upon 
appellants' filing a bond of P500.00, the lower court issued a writ of 
preliminary injunction restraining <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> from 
compelling Mayor <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> to reinstate <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale</span> as Acting Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, and from filing 
administrative charges against him (<span class="SpellE">Sison</span>) for 
insubordination, but on- March 21, I960, after hearing the parties, said Court 
rendered the appealed judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On April 7, 1960 appellants moved 
for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence consisting of the 
passing by Santos, Jr. on January 16, 1959 of the civil service examination for 
patrolman given on October 27, 1956 with a rating of 73.33% (Exhibit N) and his 
reappointment as Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, at the rate of P1<span class="GramE">,320.00</span>, 
promoted to P1,440.00 per annum on January 17 and July 1, 1959, respectively 
(Exhibits O and S). These appointments were eventually authorized as temporary 
by the Commissioner of Civil Service "without prejudice to the outcome of the 
decision in the Civil Case No. 3303 for injunction" and approved on 
</span><st1:date month="9" day="1" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 1, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> by 
Assistant Executive Secretary Enrique C. <span class="SpellE">Quema</span> 
(Exhibits 16, 17, N, O, P, Q and R). On </span><st1:date month="4" day="29" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 29, 
1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the 
Court reconsidered its decision and granted the new trial. Appellants adduced 
their newly discovered evidence, but the Court, considering it not sufficient to 
alter the result, rendered judgment reiterating its original 
decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="12" day="22" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 22, 
1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
lower Court issued a writ of execution of the judgment, <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">lite</span></u>, which 
was stayed on </span><st1:date month="1" day="3" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 3, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> upon 
appellants filing a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond in the amount of 
P7<span class="GramE">,766.66</span>. An additional bond of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> was posted on </span><st1:date month="8" day="24" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 24, 
1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The main point to be determined 
now is whether <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale's</span> removal as acting Chief of 
Police of <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, by 
Mayor Enrique <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> was legal or 
not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellants contend that, since 
<span class="SpellE">Lacanlale's</span> appointment was only in an acting 
capacity, the same could be terminated at the pleasure of the appointing power 
(the Mayor) on such grounds as loss of confidence or incompetence and 
inefficiency.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Section 1 of Republic Act No. 
1363 enacted on </span><st1:date month="6" day="18" year="1955"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 18, 
1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
provides for the preference to be given to veterans in the matter of appointment 
to positions in the government, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Section 
1.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> The policy 
of the Government is to give preference, other considerations being 
approximately equal, to persons who are veterans under section four of this 
Act."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Section 2 penalizes the violation 
of the provisions of the Act, while Section 4 defines the term "veterans". 
Section 5 provides that in order to enable a veteran to obtain preference, it 
must be shown that he has approximately the same qualifications as other 
applicants, and further states that it is not intended that a veteran shall have 
priority over civil service <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span>, unless he 
himself is of the same or higher civil service 
eligibility.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The replacement on June 29, 1957 
of <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale</span>, a 
non-eligible but veteran, by Pablo Santos, Jr., likewise a veteran and 
non-eligible is unlawful! because the former, although appointed in an acting 
capacity, was entitled, by reason of the preference established by the law in 
force at the time of his appointment (Republic Act No. 65, as amended by 
Republic Act No. 154), to keep his position until the availability of a civil 
service eligible was duly certified by the Commissioner of Civil Service. If the 
preference accorded to a veteran were to be confined to appointment and 
promotion and does not give him the right to keep the position he is holding 
until the availability of a civil service eligible is certified by the 
Commissioner of Civil Service, then a veteran would be in no better situation 
than a non-eligible and non-veteran—which should not be the case. His 
appointment may be cancelled and he" may be removed by competent authority, only 
for cause, as when the Commissioner of Civil Service makes such 
certification.2<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the recent case of Gonzales 
vs. <span class="SpellE">Aldana</span>, et al., 107 Phil, 754, interpreting 
Republic Act 1363, <span class="GramE">We</span> said in 
part:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"* * *. In other words, the 
Government takes the position that in getting appointments to the positions 
occupied by petitioners, they could invoke the provisions of Republic Act No. 
1363, for being veterans, but after the appointment, said law ceases to give 
them preference and protection.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We are unable to agree to the 
above proposition. Section 1 of the Act aforementioned speaks of preference in 
general and although the other sections, such as. Sections 2 and 5, speak of 
appointments, our impression is that the preference contemplated by the law is 
not only an appointment whereby a veteran is accepted in the service of the 
Government but also his enjoyment of the benefits, rights and emoluments 
accruing from stud appointment. It would certainly be unjust as well as 
illogical if after appointing a non-veteran to a Government position today, he 
may be replaced and dismissed tomorrow, when there are non-veterans occupying 
other and similar positions <span class="GramE">who</span> could and should be 
replaced first. In the present case, petitioners are veterans occupying similar 
positions with five other non-veterans. The seven of them are non-civil service 
<span class="SpellE">eligibles</span>. As already stated, the petitioners have 
approximately the same qualifications as the other five, at least the two next 
preceding them in the objective ranking. Consequently, the preference accorded 
to veterans is still applicable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">* * *. All their wish and desire 
is that they be allowed to retain their positions and continue serving the 
Government. By interpreting the Jaw in this manner, namely, giving preference to 
a veteran, not only in the appointment hut also in keeping the position to which 
he is appointed, we would be following and implementing the intention of the 
Legislature. As the lower court, citing Section 1 of Republic Act No, 1363 
rather vehemently observed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">'The <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> provisions of law should be given full force and 
effect. The intention of the framers of the law to reward those who have risked 
their lives and sacrificed much in order that we could be freed from Japanese 
domination should not be implemented with empty promises and hollow gestures. We 
should give what is due the veterans as contemplate<span class="GramE">)I</span> 
by law. <span class="GramE">For that is the only way we could repay and show our 
gratitude to the heroes of the last world 
war.’"</span><o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As stated heretofore, the 
Provincial Board of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, as directed by the then 
Executive Secretary, conducted an Investigation. Its finding was that <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the 35 listed unsolved crimes during <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale's</span> incumbency as Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Bamban</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> 
Mayor <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> filed no case, administrative or 
otherwise, against him under Republic Act No. 557 (Exhibits 6, 6-A, and 6-B). 
The charge of inefficiency and incompetence as justification for his summary 
removal is, therefore, clearly unfounded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellants' contention in their 
third assignment of error that the subsequent reappointment of Pablo Santos, Jr. 
on January 17, 1959 after he had passed and qualified in the civil service 
examination for patrolman on January 16, 1950 was lawful and had the effect of 
validating, retroactively, the unlawful removal of <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale</span> is without merit. The latter's Reparation from the 
service being illegal, Santos, Jr. could not have validly replaced him as acting 
Chief of Police in 1957 or 1959, because, by legal fiction, when an employee is 
suspended or dismissed without complying with the procedural requirements of 
Republic Act No. 557, his position is deemed to have never been legally 
vacated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Neither can the 
eligibility acquired by Santos, Jr., nor his temporary reappointment approved on 
January 17, 1959 by the Executive Secretary and the Commissioner of Civil 
Service subject to the result of the present case cure the invalidity or 
illegality of <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale's</span> removal 
or</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> validate 
Santos' appointment in his instead. The <span class="SpellE">former's</span> 
replacement by an eligible must be made by competent authority and only after 
the Commissioner of Civil Service has certified that there is such an eligible 
available.(3)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The case of 
<span class="SpellE">Booc</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>, Jr. (G. R. 
No.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> L-14810, 
May 31, 1961) cited by appellants in their brief is not applicable to the 
present because the facts involved therein are different from those of the 
latter. <span class="SpellE">Booc</span> was a laborer who, unlike <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale</span>, did not enjoy preference as a veteran. <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale's</span> appointment was in the nature of one to List 
until he was replaced by an eligible certified by the Commissioner of Civil 
Service, whereas that of <span class="SpellE">Booc</span> was subject to the 
condition that his employment would cease automatically at a given period. <span class="SpellE">Booc</span> was properly charged administratively, investigated and 
found guilty of dishonesty and serious misconduct in office, while <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale</span> was investigated but 
exonerated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">For the same reason, the case of 
<span class="SpellE">Manigbas</span> vs. do Guzman et al., 94 Phil. 245 cited by 
appellants is not applicable, the peace officer involved therein not being a 
veteran.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellants likewise claim that 
the lower court erred in ordering not only <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale's</span> 
reinstatement but also the payment of his back salaries as Chief of Police of 
<span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, it appearing 
that said municipality was not <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> in this case. 
This contention is without merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is already settled in this 
jurisdiction that an illegal removal of a public official does not render his 
position vacant (Fernandez et al., vs. <span class="SpellE">Cuneta</span> et al. 
80 Phil., 427.) No. Inasmuch as, for all legal intents and purposes, <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale</span> is deemed to have continued in office even after 
his illegal removal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, his right to draw the 
corresponding salary can not be questioned. Payment of back salaries is merely 
incidental to, and follows reinstatement. <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Batungbakal</span> vs. National Development Company et al., 98 
Phil., 182; Off.</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>., 2290, June 1953; Tan vs. 
Jimenez, 107 Phil. 17).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">That the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> was not by name 
<span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> in this case does not affect <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale's</span> right to the payment of back salaries, as <span class="GramE">We</span> have already ruled in several cases. <span class="GramE">(

<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The necessity of making the City 
a respondent herein is based upon its right to defend itself, as demanded by the 
requirements of due process. However, these requirements have been substantially 
complied with in, the case at bar. The parties herein have handled the case, and 
the same was heard and decided in. the lower court, as if the City had been 
named respondent in the pleadings. The officer required by taw, 'to cause to be 
defended all suits against the City, namely, its Mayor, (Sec. 8, Commonwealth 
Act No. 58), is respondent in his official capacity. The officer charged with 
the duty to represent the City in all civil cases wherein the City * * is a 
party'—to wit, its city attorney (Sec. 17, Commonwealth Act No. 58)—counsel for 
respondents herein. In addition thereto, the auditor, the treasurer, and even 
the municipal board of the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, are parties 
respondents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">There is no reason to believe 
that these officers and the City Mayor would have exerted greater effort, than 
those already displayed by them in protecting the interests of the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, it is only logical to expect that, having been 
individually named as respondents, said officers, must have taken as much 
concern, if not more, in warding off petitioner's claim. Under the foregoing 
circumstances, we would be subordinating the substance to the form if the action 
for mandamus—insofar as the claim for back salaries is concerned—were cither 
dismissed, or remanded to the lower court, for the corresponding amendment of 
the pleading and a repetition of the proceedings held for the last five (5) 
years, in older to reach the same decision rendered by the lower court and the 
panic conclusions set forth in this decision, as regards the substantive rights 
of the parties. It is our considered opinion, therefore, that the ends of 
justice and equity would, be served best if the inclusion of the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, as one of the respondents herein were considered a 
mere formality and deemed affected, as if a formal amendment of the pleadings 
had been made."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On November 19, 1964, there was 
filed in this case a motion alleging that on the 4th of said month, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lacanlale</span> was murdered in his hometown of <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>, and that at the time of his demise, he left as 
heirs, his widow, Lolita <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span>, and his children named 
Juan, Arturo, Abel, Jessie, Ruth, Elisa, and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>, and it was prayed therein that said heirs be 
substituted in place of said deceased. We find this motion to be well founded, 
and said heirs are hereby substituted in his place. However, to avoid any 
possible question as to whether they are the only heirs entitled to inherit from 
the deceased, payment of the back salaries provided for in the appealed decision 
should be made only to the judicial administrator of his estate duly appointed 
by a competent court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Wherefore, the appealed decision 
being in accordance with law and the evidence, the same is affirmed, with the 
sole modification indicated in the preceding paragraph.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
