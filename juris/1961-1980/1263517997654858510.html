				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In the decision now sought to be reviewed the Court of Appeals
made the following statement of the case:</p>

<blockquote>"On October 14, 1959, the spouses Miguel R. <span class="SpellE">Socco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pura</span> Verona sold to the
spouses <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Salvadora</span>
Garcia a three-story house and lot, situated on Pennsylvania, <span class="SpellE">Malate</span>, Manila, for the price consisting partly in money,
P38<span class="GramE">,016.57</span>, and partly in another thing, the
assumption by the vendees of the vendors' mortgage debt of P20,074.13 to the
Development Bank of the Philippines (Exhibit A).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vendees retained P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
of the money to answer for the fulfillment of the vendors' obligation to pay
the registration fee, real estate taxes, documentary stamps and <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> fee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
the vendors had fulfilled said obligation, they demanded from the vendees
payment of said amount of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> but the vendees
failed or refused to comply with the demand.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The vendees did not immediately assume the vendors’' mortgage
debt of P20<span class="GramE">,074.13</span> to the Development Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, on <st1:date year="1959" day="13" month="11">November 13, 1959</st1:date>, the Bank <span class="SpellE"><span style="">forclosed</span></span><span style=""> the mortgage and acquired the mortgaged
property at </span>a public auction on <st1:date year="1959" day="17" month="11">November
 17, 1959</st1:date>. About one year later, on <st1:date year="1960" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1960</st1:date>, the spouses Garcia acquired the
property by conditional sale from the Development Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(Exhibit 11).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1960" day="13" month="4">April 13, 1960</st1:date>,
the spouses <span class="SpellE">Socco</span>, as plaintiffs, brought this action
against the spouses Garcia for rescission of the contract of sale for failure
on the part of the vendees to perform what was incumbent upon them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court rendered judgment dismissing
the complaint and ordering the plaintiffs to pay the defendants the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as attorney's fee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From this judg­ment, plaintiffs appealed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the foregoing statement the Court of Appeals reversed the
decision of the trial court in favor of <span style="">the
defendants and rendered its own judgment, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“. . .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>decreeing the <span class="SpellE">rescision</span> of the contract of sale with assumption of
mortgage dated October 14, 1959 and ordering the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
to return to the appellants the three-story house and lot object of the
contract together with its civil fruits from date of the contract until its
return, and ordering the appellants to return to the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
the sum of P36<span class="GramE">,016.57</span>, with legal interest at 6% per
annum <span style="">from said date until its
return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
are also ordered to pay the appellants the sum of P15<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
as moral damages, and the sum of P33,000.00 as counsel fee.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Costs against the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
in both instances.</span></p>

<blockquote>"After this judgment has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
the lower court shall determine from the evidence to be submitted by the
parties the amount of civil fruits which the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
are ordered by this judgment to return to the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amount so deter­mined shall be included
in the writ of execution.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">REVERSED, NEW </span>JUDGMENT
<span style="">RENDERED."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Five errors are
attributed by the petitioner to the appellate court, of which we consider the
first one to be decisive, namely, that the "decision </span>is <span style="">premised on a flagrant misapprehension of
facts overwhelmingly and irrefutably established in the trial court."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The findings directly impugned on this ground
are: (1) that the vendees (petitioners herein) retained P2,000.00 of the money
(the part of the purchase price payable </span>in <span style="">cash, amounting to P38,016.57) to answer for the fulfillment of the
vendors' obligation to pay the registration fee, real estate taxes, documentary
stamps and <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> fee, and refused to pay the said
amount to the vendors (respondents herein); and (2) that the vendees did not
immediately assume the </span>vendors' <span style="">mortgage
debt of P20,074.13 to the Development Bank of the Philippines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The preliminary question
which poses itself in connection with this first assignment of error is whether
this Court may make its own findings of fact independently of those made by the
Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The general </span>rule
is <span style="">that the appellate court's findings
are conclusive, </span>but this rule is not without some recognized exceptions,
<span style="">such as:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(1) When the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on
speculations, surmises or conjectures; (2) when the inference is manifestly
mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) when there is a grave abuse of discre­tion;
(4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) when the find­ings
of fact are conflicting; (6) when the Court of Appeals, in making its findings,
went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions
of both appellant and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Roque</span>

<p class="BODY">Several circumstances compelled us to go into the record of this
case in order to find out whether or not it falls within the exceptions above
stated: first, the findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of
the trial court; second, said findings are in the nature of conclusions,
without citation of the speci­fic evidences on which they are based; and third,
the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the peti­tioners' main and
reply briefs, with the corresponding references to the record, are not disputed
by the respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These facts are
necessary for a clear under­standing and proper resolution of the issue of
rescission in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the sale of the property in question to the petitioners on
<st1:date year="1959" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1959</st1:date>, the same
had been mortgaged by the respondents twice - first to the Development Bank of
the Philippines (DBP) and second to the General Financing Corporation. On <st1:date year="1959" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1959</st1:date> the DBP, through its
legal department, started extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So did the General Financing Corpora­tion on <st1:date year="1959" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The negotiations concerning the sale of the
property to the petitioners were handled by the brokerage firm of <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span> &amp; Co., who had advertised the same in the
"Manila Times."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the deed
of sale was executed in their favor on <st1:date year="1959" day="14" month="10">October
 14, 1959</st1:date> the peti­tioners were aware of the existence of the
mortgages, but <span style="">not of the fact that the
one in favor of the DBP was already under foreclosure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were dealing with the real estate
department of that office, which evidently was not coordinating its activities
with the legal depart­ment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The price of the sale was
P65<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of
this amount petitioner <span class="SpellE">Salvadora</span> Garcia paid P18<span class="GramE">,766.80</span> to the second mortgagee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The then outstanding loan obliga­tion with
the DBP was P27<span class="GramE">,085.56</span>, and to update the same <span class="SpellE">Salvadora</span> Garcia paid, on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="16" month="10"><span style="">October 16, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, two </span>sums <span style="">in the name of respondent Miguel <span class="SpellE">Socco</span> - one
of P6,912.21 for the accumulated arrears in his amortizations and the other,
P99.32, as further adjustment of the account.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These payments brought down the mortgage obligation to P20<span class="GramE">,074.13</span>, which the petitioners assumed under the terms of
the deed of sale of </span><st1:date year="1959" day="14" month="10"><span style="">October 14, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, aside from the cash consideration of
P38,016.57 expressly stated on the same instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The breakdown of the price, as made by the
parties before the deed was released to the vendees on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="16" month="10"><span style="">October
 16, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, is as
follows, as set forth in the petitioners brief without any contradiction on the
part of the respondents:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Subtracting this total amount of P52<span class="GramE">,852.46</span>
from <span style="">the purchase price of P65,000.00,
the balance was P12,147.54.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This balance
was admittedly paid to the vendors, as respondent Miguel <span class="SpellE">Socco</span>
stipulated with them in open court at the trial, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Atty. Garcia: The amount of P12<span class="GramE">,147.54</span>
was received by Mr. <span class="SpellE">Socco</span> himself after we have
computed all that we have paid in his favor and this is the balance due them.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Atty. <span class="SpellE">Socco</span>: Admitted, sir."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As far as the real estate department of the DBP was concerned,
everything was apparently in order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
mortgage account had been updated and the mortgaged property had been sold,
with the buyers assuming the mortgage indebtedness, although the formal
approval of the sale by the said depart­ment did not come until later, that is,
on <st1:date year="1960" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1960</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile the legal department of the DBP, un­informed of the
developments aforesaid, proceeded with the extrajudicial foreclosure it had
started since <st1:date year="1959" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1959</st1:date>,
and on <st1:date year="1959" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1959</st1:date>
caused the property to be sold at public auction and bought it as the highest
bidder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sale was registered and the
title to the property was subsequently transferred in the name of the DBP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Soccos</span> were
notified of the sale, but of course took no steps to redeem, having already
conveyed the property to the peti­tioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter's justifiable grievance, <span class="SpellE">undenied</span>
by the respondents, is that they were not apprised of the fact that the
property was under foreclosure even while they were buying it and making the
mortgage account up-to-date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
foreclosure could indeed have been avoided if only the respondents had informed
them about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, after the
discovery of the rather anomalous situation which had arisen by virtue of the
assumption, on one hand, of the mortgage by the <span class="SpellE">Garcias</span>,
and, on the other hand, the foreclosure of the same mortgage as against the <span class="SpellE">Soccos</span> and the consequent public sale of the property to
the DBP, the Latter, as a practical solution, executed <span style="">a </span>deed of con­ditional sale in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Garcias</span>,
with the DBP retaining ownership of the property until full payment of the
selling price.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The background facts
having been disposed of </span>the first question is: Did the vendees retain P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> of the consideration of the sale to them by the <span class="SpellE">Soccos</span>, as stated by the Court of Appeals?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The payments made on account of the said sale
are itemized hereinabove, showing that this particular sum of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> was paid by check (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C)
<span class="GramE">to</span> <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span> &amp; Co., on <st1:date year="1959" day="16" month="10">October 16, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">is </span>not denied by the respondents; but it
seems that their contention is that the payment should have been made to them
directly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>
facts, however, support the validity of such payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span>
&amp; Co<span class="GramE">.,</span> was the respondents' agent who handled the
transaction for them, and to whom in fact all the checks drawn by the
petitioners were delivered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Secondly, the very deed of sale with assumption of mortgage (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> A) <span class="GramE">recites</span> that the
vendors "hereby acknowledge and confess to have received from the vendees
the sum of 38,016.57," which according to the computation made by both
parties included the sum of P2,000.00. Thirdly, Atty. Mariano <span class="SpellE">Agoncillo</span>, testi­fying for the respondents, said that it
was he who prepared the deed of sale and that he did not release it to the
vendees "until the full amount due Mr. <span class="SpellE">Socco</span> was
paid."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, one of the facts
proposed for stipulation by the petitioners and admitted by the respondents is
"that the amount of P12<span class="GramE">,147.54</span> was received by
Mr. <span class="SpellE">Socco</span> himself <u>after we have computed all what
we have paid in his favor and that is the balance due him</u>."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is quite clear that the conclusion arrived at by the appellate
court with respect to the particular item of P2,000.00 is not only without <span style="">basis </span>but
contrary to the indubitable evidence in this case - evidence which the
respondents have not even cared to refute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the cir­cumstances no reliance can be placed on the general rule
that findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are conclu­sive and may no longer
be reviewed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The second ground on
which the Court of Appeals ordered the rescission of the sale is that the
petitioners failed to assume the mortgage in favor of the DBP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are at a loss to see how such a conclusion
was arrived at.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deed of sale itself
recites that the petitioners assumed "the obligation of paying the
Development Bank of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> the balance of P20<span class="GramE">,074.13</span>.
. . <span class="GramE">as</span> if they were the original
mortgagors."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said balance was
determined after the petitioners had updated the respondents' mortgage
obligation by delivering two checks in payment - one for P6<span class="GramE">,912.21</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. </span>3) <span style="">and
the other for </span>P99.32 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 4).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact was even stipulated by the parties
at the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There could hardly have
been any more effective act of compliance by the petitioners with their
obligation to assume the respondents' mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The payments were accepted by the mortgagee, although its formal
approval of the sale and of the transfer of the mortgage did not come until
later, <span style="">as </span>evidenced
by the letter of the Manager of the Real Estate Department of the DBP to
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Salvadora</span> Garcia, dated <st1:date year="1960" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
10).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents argue that if the petitioners had assumed the
mortgage it would not have been foreclosed and the property would not have been
sold at public auction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The simple
answer to this argument is that the respondents had ceased to have any interest
in the said property; that they had already transferred it and had received all
that was due them by virtue of such transfer; and that if the mortgage was
foreclosed it was not the respondents but the petitioners who were prejudiced,
since they had to recog­nize the <span class="SpellE">DBP's</span> title by
virtue of the foreclosure sale, contenting themselves with a subsequent
conditional sale in their favor.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But the respondents say
that the sale caused damage to their good name, for which they claimed and were
awarded </span>by the Court of Appeals moral damages in the sum of P15<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and attorney's fees in the sum of P3,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this point the said court entirely
overlooked the fact that the fore­closure proceeding started months before the
property was even offered to the petitioners and that the respondents did not
inform them about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed there was no
reason to foreclose at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It came
about simply because the fore­closure was being handled by the legal department
of the DBP while the sale with assumption of mortgage was being handled by the
real estate department; and neither department, incredible as it may seem, <span style="">was </span>privy to what the other was
doing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such was the communication-gap
between the two <span style="">that </span>notwithstanding
the foreclosure sale on <st1:date year="1959" day="17" month="11">November 17,
 1959</st1:date>, whereby the DBP became the owner of the property, it still
approved the assumption of mortgage by the petitioners on <st1:date year="1960" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In any event the confusion cannot be attributed to them: it was in their
interest to prevent the same, and they would surely have done so if the
respondents had only informed them of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
the foreclosure pro­ceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
no failure on their part to fulfill their obligation to the petitioners, and no
ground to rescind the contract between them.</p>
