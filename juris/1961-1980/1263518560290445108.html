				[ Adm. Case No. 927, September 28, 1970</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE COMPLAINT FOR DISBARMENT OF ATTORNEY
POTENCIANO A. PALANCA, WILLIAM C. PFLEIDER, COMPLAINANT, VS.
POTENCIANO A. PALANCA, RESPONDENT.
<br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>RUIZ CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The respondent Atty. <span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> was for some­time the legal counsel of the
complainant William <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the complainant, he retained the
legal services of <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> from January 1966, whereas
the latter insists that the attorney-client relationship between them began as
early as in 1960.</p>

<p class="BODY">At all events, the relations between the two must have at­tained
such a high level of mutual trust that on <st1:date year="1968" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1968</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span> and
his wife leased to <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> a 1,328-hectare
agricultural land in <span class="SpellE">Hinobaan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental, known as the Hacienda Asia, for a period of ten years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their contract, the parties agreed, among
others, that a specified portion of the lease ren­tals would be paid to <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span>, and the remainder would be delivered by <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> to <span class="SpellE">Pfleider's</span> listed
creditors.</p>

<p class="BODY">The arrangement worked smoothly until <st1:date year="1969" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1969</st1:date> when the rupture came with the
filing by <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span> of a civil suit (civil case 9187
of the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental) against <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> for rescission of the contract of lease on the
ground of alleged default in the payment of rentals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his answer to the complaint, <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> averred full satisfaction of his rental
liabilities, and therefore contended that the lease should continue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also charged that he had already been
dispossessed of the <u>hacienda</u> by <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span> and
the latter's goons at gunpoint and consequently had suffered tremendous
financial losses.</p>

<p class="BODY">With this history in perspective, we shall now consider the
administrative charges of gross misconduct in office brought by <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span> against <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The indictment consists of four counts.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><u>First count</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In regard to a criminal case for <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span> filed in December 1965 by one Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Matiao</span> against <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span>, the latter instructed <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>
to offer in settlement the sum of P10<span class="GramE">,000</span>, payable in
installments, to <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Matiao</span>
for the dismissal of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
sometime, <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> reported to <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span>
that the offer had been rejected.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Finally, in October 1969, <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> supposedly
in­formed <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span> that he had succeeded in negotiating
the dismissal of the <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span> case by leaving
the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,000</span> with the <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span>
City Court where the action was then pending.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sometime in Decem­ber 1969, however, <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span>
was the object of a warrant of arrest in connection with the same <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span> case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It turned out, charged the complainant <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span>,
that <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> had not deposited the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,000</span> with the <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> City
Court, let alone communicated to <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Matiao</span> his earlier offer of settlement.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have closely examined all the pleadings filed by the parties
in this case and the annexes thereto, and it is our view that the first charge
is devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of his
claim of alleged assurance made by <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> that the <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span> case had al­ready been terminated, <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span> relies on certain letters written to him by <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our own
reading of these letters, however, belies his claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They contain nothing which might reasonably
in­duce the complainant to believe that the criminal action against him had
been finally settled by his attorney.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the contrary, the letters merely report a continuing attempt on the part of <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> to secure a fair bargain for <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The letter-report of <st1:date year="1969" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1969</st1:date>, invoked by the complainant,
states in no uncertain terms that "I am bargaining this [referring to the <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> case] even for P8<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
and I think they will agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'll
finalize this and pay <span class="SpellE">Tingyan</span> on Tuesday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have already left in <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span>
P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to show them the color of our money and I
will bring the balance when I go there Tuesday."</p>

<p class="BODY">Nothing in the above letter indicates that <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>
had depo­sited the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,000</span> with the <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> City Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What he did state is that he had left that sum in that City to enable
their adversaries to see "the color of our money." In this
connection, the veracity of the certification by <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span>
T. <span class="SpellE">Hilay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> branch
manager of RCPI, that he (<span class="SpellE">Hilay</span>) had been holding the
sum of P5<span class="GramE">,000</span> during the early part of October in
trust for <span class="SpellE">Pflei­der</span> and his lawyer, has not been
assailed by <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">If <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span> was the object of a warrant
of arrest in Decem­ber 1969, no substantial blame can be laid at the door of
the res­pondent <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> inasmuch as the latter's
services were implicitly terminated by <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span> when
the latter sued his lawyer in October of the same year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the object of the suit is the
rescission of the contract of lease between the parties, the conflict of
interest which pits one against the other became incompatible with that mu­tual
confidence and trust essential to every lawyer-client relation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span>
fails to dispute <span class="SpellE">Palanca's</span> claim that on <st1:date year="1969" day="26" month="10">Octo­ber 26, 1969</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span> refused to acknowledge receipt of a certain letter
and several motions for withdrawal, including <span class="SpellE">Palanca's</span>
withdrawal as counsel in the <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span> case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><u>Second count</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> had
fraudulently charged the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,000</span> (which he
supposedly had left with the City Court in <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span>)
to his rental account with <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span> as part payment
of the lease rentals of the Hacienda Asia.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE"><u>Third count</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same statement of account, <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> falsely represented having paid, for the account of
<span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span>, one Samuel <span class="SpellE">Guintos</span>
the sum of P866.50 when the latter would swear that he had received only the
sum of P86.50.</p>

<p class="BODY">These two charges are anchored upon the same "Statement of
Disbursements" submitted by <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> to <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is our
view that this statement is but a memorandum or report of the ex­penses which <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> considered as chargeable to the account of <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By its
very tentative nature, it is subject to the exami­nation and subsequent
approval or disapproval of <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span>, any and every
error which it contains may be brought to the atten­tion of <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>
for rectification or adjustment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Viewed
in relation to the contract of lease between <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>, this "state­ment" is but one
aspect of the <span class="SpellE">prestation</span> required of <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> by the contract.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whatever breach he might have committed in regard to this <span class="SpellE">prestation</span> would be but a civil or contractual wrong which
does not affect his office as a member of the Bar.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><u>Final count</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is charged that the list of creditors
which <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span> had "confidentially"
supplied <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> for the purpose of carrying out the
terms of payment contained in the lease contract was disclosed by <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>, in violation of their lawyer-client re­lation, to
parties whose interests are adverse to those of <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span> himself, however, states
"in the execution of the terms of the aforesaid lease contract between the
parties, complainant furnished respondent with a confidential list of his
creditors." This should indicate that <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span>
delivered the list of his creditors to <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> not
because of the professional relation then existing between them, but on account
of the lease agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A violation
therefore of the confidence that accompanied the delivery of that list would
partake more of a private and civil wrong than of a breach of the fidelity
owing from a lawyer to his client.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span> fails to controvert <span class="SpellE">Palanca's</span> claim that there is no such thing as a
"confidential" list of creditors and that the list of creditors
referred to by <span class="SpellE">Pfleider</span> is the same list which forms
part of the pleadings in civil case 9187 (the action for rescission of the
lease contract) now pending between the complain­ant and the respondent lawyer,
and therefore is embraced within the category of public records open to the
perusal of persons pro­perly interested therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, we are satisfied, and we so hold, that nothing in <span class="SpellE">Pfleider's</span> written complaint for disbarment against <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> and in his reply to <span class="SpellE">Palanca's</span>
answer supports a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> finding of such misconduct in
office by <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> as would warrant further
proceedings in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the complaint is hereby dismissed.</p>
