				<H3>AUGUSTO R. VILLAROSA, PROTESTANT AND APPELLANT, VS. ROMEO G. GUANZON, PROTESTEE AND APPELLEE.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Romeo Guanzon and Augusto Villarosa were registered candidates for the office 
of vice mayor of Bacolod City in the general elections held on November 10, 
1959. Guanzon was the standard bearer of the Nacionalista Party while Villarosa 
ran under the Liberal Party. Having been adjudicated 9,678 votes by the Board of 
canvassers, Guanzon was proclaimed elected with a plurality of 516 votes over 
his next rival Villarosa, who obtained 9,162 votes. In due time, Villarosa filed 
a protest before the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental.<p></p>
<p>After trial, the court rejected 586 ballots cast in several precincts on the 
ground that they were cast against the law. Of these ballots 469 were cast in 
favor of Guanzon, 67 were cast for candidate Ramos, 5 were cast for Villarosa, 
and 45 were left blank for the office of the vice mayor, so that deducting 469 
from the total of 9,678 cast for Guanzon it would leave 9,209 votes. Inasmuch as 
protestant Villarosa obtained only 9,162 votes, his opponent Guanzon would still 
obtain a majority of 47 votes over him. Hence the court dismissed the 
protest.</p>
<p>Protestant Villarosa took the present appeal directly to this Court for, as 
he states in his brief, he will only raise questions of law.</p>
<p>It appears that in precinct No. 55, aside from 20 ballots which the court 
<em>a quo</em> found to be null and void for having been written by one hand, 
there are 127 ballots which it declared in its decision to be marked. However, 
in spite of its finding that said ballots were marked, the court <em>a quo</em> 
did not reject them as illegal but counted them in favor of protestee. It is 
contended that if these ballots were rejected, as the court <em>a quo</em> 
should have, protestee would have obtained only 9,082 votes against 9,157 votes 
of protestant, with the result that the latter should have been declared as the 
winning candidate for vice mayor with a plurality of 75 votes. The failure of 
the court <em>a quo </em>to reject said 127 ballots is now assigned by 
protestant in this appeal as the main error committed by the court. The 
<em>rationale</em> of the court <em>a quo</em> in not rejecting the 127 ballots 
in question is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * The Court, however, found that of the 169 disputed ballots, there were 
127 ballots that were found marked, namely: Exhibits 'H-101' to 'H-110' were 
marked by the characteristic name 'Quimson SOF'; Exhibits 'H-44' to 'H-53' were 
marked by the name 'Tañada LOR'; Exhibits 'H-80' to 'H-92', by the name 'Lopez 
FER'; Exhibits 'H-93' to 'H-99', by 'Pajo Juan'; Exhibits 'H-26' to 'H-34', by 
'Cuenco MAR'; Exhibits 'H-15' to 'H-16' and 'H-20' to 'H-25', by 'Gatuslao Val'; 
Exhibits 'H-5' to 'H-14', by 'Gustilo AR'; Exhibits 'H' to 'H-4' and 'H-133', by 
'Jocson NAR'; Exhibits 'H-60' to 'H-79', by "Cordova TEO'; Exhibits 'H-161' to 
'H-167', by 'Guanzon ROM'; Exhibits 'H-111' to 'H-123' &amp; 'H-137', by 'AL 
Soto', Exhibits 'H-35' to 'H-43', by 'Gaston BEN'; Exhibits 'H-54' to 'H-60' 
&amp; 'H-130', by 'Cuadra FER'; Exhibits 'H-17' to 'H-19' &amp; 'H-151', by 
'Misa RAM'; Exhibits 'H-135' to 'H-140', by Coscolluela, Jr.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>"With respect to marked ballots the Court believes that, 'The independence of 
the voters in the exercise of their right to vote would be violated if "marked 
ballots" were not disallowed for some unscrupulous persons taking advantage of 
their influence or political prestige may require of the voters the placing of a 
distinguished mark on their ballot, in consideration of some promise, reward or 
other valuable consideration and to which the voters would have no escape 
because of the distinguishing marks required of them.' (P. 167, Martin, Revised 
Election Code) In the case of Valenzuela vs. Carlos, 42 Phil. 428, the appellate 
Court, however, said 'In discounting marked ballots, great care should be used 
in rejecting them. It should be borne in mind that election laws are designed to 
effectuate the will of the electorate. So only in an unmistakable case where the 
ballot appeared so marked should it be rejected.' And finally in the case of 
Alihan vs. Arambulo, CA-G. R. No. 18799-R, April 28, 1958, the Court of Appeals 
held, 'The markings clearly intended to annul the ballots bearing them. All the 
ballots representing one hundred and twenty two (122) votes, <em>for justice' 
sake</em> should not be invalidated. If for mercenary motive a voter agrees to 
mark his ballot, it is to show the fulfillment of his promise and not to destroy 
his ballot.' Altho this Court believes that when a voter sells his vote for a 
mess of pottage, his right to vote is forfeited, the appellate Court has spoken. 
It handed down the foregoing ruling, for justice' sake. Indeed, if a grafter or 
a crook who is slick enough to evade conviction is allowed to vote, there is no 
reason why a mercenary voter deserves the rejection of his marked 
ballot."</p></blockquote>
<p>Protestant now contends that in view of the finding of the court <em>a 
quo</em> that the 127 ballots in question are <em>marked</em> it erred in not 
invalidating them and in counting them instead in favor of protestee. He argues 
that the authorities relied upon by the court <em>a quo</em> to support its 
ruling that said ballots should not be rejected even if they were found to be 
marked, are inapplicable, because the facts found therein are at variance with 
those obtaining in the instant case. Thus, he contends, in the case of 
Valenzuela vs. Carlos,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the appellate 
court counted the disputed ballots because they merely contained <em>accidental 
or unintentional</em> strokes, flourishes, stains or erasures, which were 
rendered to be not sufficient to impart into them the attribute of marked 
ballots, whereas in the case of Alihan vs. Arambulo,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the alleged marks appearing on the questioned 
ballots were found to have been placed thereon after they had been deposited in 
the ballot box by persons other than the voters themselves, and so the Court of 
Appeals ruled that "for justice' sake they should not be invalidated." On the 
other hand, it is contended that the alleged distinguishing marks appearing on 
the 127 disputed ballots in this case were written by the voters themselves for 
purposes of identification.</p>
<p>There is no merit in the contention that the 127 disputed ballots were found 
by the court <i>a quo</i> to be marked because the voters themselves placed 
thereon some distinguishing marks for purposes of identification. No such thing 
appears in the decision. On the contrary, it can be gleaned therefrom that 
protestant has not presented any evidence <i>aliunde</i> to show that the 
writing of the so-called abbreviated Christian names was used as a means of 
identification. And it can also be gleaned that the court <i>a quo</i> 
disregarded the so-called marks because it does not appear clear that they were 
placed there to identify the ballots, and to support this view, it quoted the 
following ruling in the Valenzuela case, <i>supra</i>: "In discounting marked 
ballots, great care should be used in rejecting them. It should be borne in mind 
that election laws are designed to effectuate the will of the electorate. So 
only in unmistakable case where the ballot appeared so marked should it be 
rejected."</p>
<p>The question that now arises is: Are the disputed ballots really marked that 
they should be invalidated?</p>
<p>Let us elaborate. It appears that the so-called distinguishing marks are 
surnames of candidates acccompanied by the first syllable of the correct 
Christian names of said candidates. Thus, in Exhibits "H-101" to "H-110", the 
name "Quimson SOF" appears. This refers to senatorial candidate Sofronio 
Quimson. In Exhibits "H-44' to "H-53", the name "Tañada LOR" appears. This 
refers to candidate Lorenzo Tañada. In the other ballots, the name "Lopez Fer" 
was intended for candidate Fernando Lopez; "Pajo Juan" for candidate Juan Pajo; 
"Cuenco Mar" for candidate Mariano Cuenco; "Gatuslao Val" for candidate 
Valeriano Gatuslao; "Gustilo Ar" for candidate Armando Gustilo; "Jocson Nar" for 
candidate Narciso Jocson; "Cordova Teo" for candidate Teofisto Cordova; "Guanzon 
Rom" for candidate Romeo Guanzon"Al Soto" for candidate Alfredo Soto; "Gaston 
Ben" for candidate Benjamin Gaston; "Cuadra Fer" candidate Fernando Cuadra; 
"Misa Ram" for candidate Ramon Misa; and "Coscolluela Jr." for candidate 
Ildefonso Coscolluela, Jr.</p>
<p>The circumstance that several voters belonging to the same precinct appear to 
have written the names of particular candidates in an identical manner may 
appear suspicious or may indicate that there had been a preconceived plan on 
their part to write said names in that manner to enable them to identify the 
voters, but the showing of such circumstance <em>based on what is written on the 
ballots alone</em> cannot justify such inference in the absence of evidence 
<em>aliunde</em> clearly showing that such was the plan or intention. The reason 
is obvious: an identification mark cannot be presumed but must be established by 
clear evidence (Jaucian vs. Callos, 104 Phil., 603; 55 Off. Gaz. 10394). This is 
especially so where our Election Law allows a candidate to be voted on by 
writing either his name in full, or only the Christian name, or the only surname 
(paragraph 1, section 149); or the surname accompanied by the initial of the 
Christian name, or the Christian name accompanied by the initial of the surname 
(paragraph c, section 149); or the Christian name or surname accompanied by the 
nickname of the candidate (paragraph 9, section 149). And more important still 
is the provision that "<em>Unless it should clearly appear that they have been 
deliberately put by the voter to serve as identification marks,</em> commas, 
dots, lines, or hyphens between the name and surname of a candidate, or in other 
parts of the ballot, traces of the letters 't', 'j', and other similar ones, 
<i>the</i> <em>first letters or syllables of names which the voter does not 
continue, * * * shall be considered innocent and shall not invalidate the 
ballot</em>" (paragraph 18, section 149; italics supplied). Finally, it is well 
settled in this jurisdiction that, in the absence of positive proof to the 
contrary, the words or signs appearing on the ballot similar to those above 
enumerated are presumed to have been placed thereon accidentally.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p>
<p>There being no evidence <em>aliunde</em> presented in this case to show that 
the writing of the first syllables of the Christian names of candidates 
accompanying the surname in the 127 disputed ballots was part of a scheme agreed 
upon by the voters to identify their ballots, the same cannot be considered 
sufficient to invalidate the ballots as marked. The lower court, therefore, 
committed no error in admitting them and in counting them as valid votes in 
favor of protestee.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from insofar as it concerns appellee, is 
affirmed. The election of protestee as vice mayor of the City of Bacolod is 
confirmed. Costs against protestant.</p> <em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera,
