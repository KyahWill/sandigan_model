				<BR><STRONG>MAKALINTAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition to prohibit respondent Judge of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> from further pro­ceeding
against petitioners in special civil case No. 59 of said Court and to set aside
the writ of preliminary injunction issued therein on <st1:date year="1959" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1959</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present petition had its origin in a simple criminal
complaint for the offense of "Illegal Possession of Firearm" filed
against <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> Campo and <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Baclayo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
complaint alleged that the offense was com­mitted in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Cadena</span> de <span class="SpellE">Amor</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case, docketed as criminal case No. 354,
was filed by <span class="SpellE">Gaudioso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gacus</span>,
act­ing Chief of Police, and a warrant of arrest was forthwith issued by the
Municipal Court of the same municipality, presided by Demosthenes <span class="SpellE">Mediante</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mediante</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pasenio</span> (Chief of
Police) are the petitioners herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently Campo, one of the two accused, after moving for the
postponement of the hearing and without first raising before the municipal
court the question of its jurisdiction in the case, filed directly in
respondent Court, together with 29 other persons, a petition for
"Prohibition, Injunction and Damages with Preliminary Injunction."
The petitioners' prayer reads thus:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"WHEREFORE, </span>it
is respectfully prayed:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(a) That pending the final deter­mination of this action an
ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> writ of preliminary injunction be issued -
(1) <u>restraining and prohibiting the respondents Justice of the Peace and
Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Oriental</u>, as well <span style="">as </span>respondents
<span class="SpellE">Legutom</span> and Fernandez <u>from con­tinuing with the
proceeding in Criminal Case No. 354</u> (People v. <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>
Campo et al) of the Justice of the peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental; (2) restraining and pro­hibiting
the respondents Chief of Police, <span class="SpellE">Legutum</span>, Fernandez,
Cervantes their agents representatives subordinates, servants, or any other
person acting in their behalf from prosecuting or proceeding (sic) peti­tioners
or instituting criminal complaints with the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental for
acts done by petitioners within the territory of Carmen, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>
or within any part of the parcels of land described in paragraph 2 <span style="">of </span>this petition; (3) restraining and
prohibiting the respondent Justice of the Peace from entertaining complaints
and issue (sic) warrants of arrest against petitioners for acts done in Carmen,
<span class="SpellE">Agu­san</span> or any part of the parcels of land described
in paragraph 2 of this peti­tion; (4) <u>restraining and prohibiting
respondents, their attorneys, agents, representatives, servants, bodyguards,
laborers, tenants, drivers, and any other<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>person acting in their behalf from in­timidating, coercing, threatening,

petitioners</u>; (5) restraining and <span style="">prohibiting
respondents, their attorneys, agents, representatives, servants, bodyguards,

in paragraph 2</u> of this petition and <u>from molesting the harvest of
petitioners products in the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>said parcels
of land</u>; restraining and prohibiting respondents, their attorneys, agents,
representatives, servants, body­guards, laborers, tenants, drivers, and any
other person acting in their behalf <u>from getting or harvesting any
products<span style="">&nbsp; </span>from the lands of petitioners</u>,
which are described in paragraph 2 of this petition x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the resolution of <st1:date year="1959" day="22" month="1">January
 22, 1959</st1:date> respondent Judge denied the motions to dismiss filed by
herein peti­tioners and ruled that the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> had jurisdiction to issue the writ of preliminary
injunction prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the said resolution is hereunder
quoted:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the motions to dismiss are hereby denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let a writ of preli­minary injunction issue,
restraining and prohibiting the respondents, their ser­vants, bodyguards,
attorneys and other persons in their behalf to desist from threatening,
coercing and harassing the petitioners or otherwise disturbing and molesting
them in their peaceful posses­sion of the parcels of land described in
paragraph 2 of the petition, and restraining and prohibiting the respondents,
their attorneys, agents, repre­sentatives, servants and other persons in their
aid from harvesting and carrying away the corn and other products in the lands
in question, upon the previous filing of the bond with sufficient sure­ties in
the sum of P3,000.00 subject to the approval by this Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners filed the instant proceeding, with the following
prayer: "(a) To prohibit the Respondent Judge from requiring the
petitioners to enter into trial in said special civil <span style="">case </span>No. 59 of the Court; (b) To pro­hibit and restrain the
respondent Judge from further proceeding in the said Special Civil Case No. 59
against the petitioners; and (c) For such other remedies as may be just and
equitable in the premises."</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the writ of preliminary injunction issued by
respondent Judge, petitioners ask that it be set aside so that the prosecution
of criminal case No. 354 <span style="">may </span>continue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no need to do this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said writ does not enjoin the criminal
prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is evident upon <span style="">a </span>simple examination of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the lower court's resolution, which
granted only the prayers numbered 4 and 5 in the petition and not the prayer to
abate temporarily the criminal action.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the main petition before us, which seeks to
prohibit respondent Judge from further proceeding against petitioners in
special civil case No. 59, the same should be granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint for illegal possession of
firearm filed against <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> Campo in the Municipal
Court of <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental</st1:placename></st1:place>,
recites that the offense was committed in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Cadena</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Amor</span> of the said municipality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the recital that defines the jurisdiction
of the said court, of which petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mediante</span> is
the Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Court, in taking
cognizance of special civil case No. 59 insofar as Campo is concerned, stated
that the <u>land in controversy</u> pertains to the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Agusan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reference is to certain civil disputes
involving the harvest of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> from certain lands
claimed by the peti­tioners below on the one hand, and by the respondents
therein, named Antonio Cervantes and Jesus Cervantes, on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed in the petition in special civil <span style="">case </span>No. 59 there is no allegation
that the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Cadena</span> de <span class="SpellE">Amor</span>,
the supposed <span class="SpellE">situs</span> of the crime of illegal pos­session
of firearm allegedly committed by <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> Campo is
not within the jurisdiction of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The allegation is rather that the warrant of
arrest was served on him at his residence and that he then remonstrated that
the municipal Judge of <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> who issued the
warrant had no jurisdiction in the place where he was "harvesting" <span class="SpellE">palay</span> and where he was "residing," since it was
within the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Agusan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whichever court has jurisdiction in that
place is of no importance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vital
point is the allegation of the <span class="SpellE">situs</span> of the offense
in the information, and the question of jurisdiction in the light of such
allegation must be passed upon and decided in the first instance by the
Municipal Court itself in the criminal case before it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the petition below, insofar as it seeks to prohibit the
Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> from proceeding in the
criminal case, should have been filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental, which has appellate and supervisory
jurisdiction over all municipal courts in said province, and not in the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The actuation of respondent Judge, as against
herein peti­tioners, is officious and unwarranted and constitutes an undue
arrogation of such supervisory power which does not belong to it at all.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ prayed for is <span class="GramE">granted,</span>
and respondent Judge is prohibited and enjoined from further proceeding against
herein petitioners in special case No. 59.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
