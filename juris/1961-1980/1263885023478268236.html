<p>Said decision was modified by the resolution promulgated on January 
26, 1965, which held "that defendant-appellee is not entitled to recover
 any amount for moral and exemplary damages, as well as the amount of 
P2,805.95, from the third-party defendant."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
</p><p>On March 4, 1958, Edith Perez de Tagle-Marcelo instituted against Maria Locsin <em>Vda. de</em>
 Araneta Civil Case No. Q-2869 in the Court of First Instance of Rizal 
at Quezon City for accounting of the harvest on a parcel of land located
 in Bago, Occidental Negros and for recovery of actual and moral 
damages, as well as attorney's fees and expenses of litigation.
</p><p>The complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> stated
 that the plaintiff is the owner of a parcel of land together with all 
the improvements thereon, situated in the Municipality of Bago, Province
 of Negros Occidental, identified as Lot No. 850 of the Cadastral Survey
 of Bago, with an area of 1,066,475 square meters, more or less, having 
acquired the same by purchase on or about February 6, 1957 of the former
 owner's rights and interest thereon; that sometime in June of 1957, the
 defendant Maria Locsin Vda. de Araneta, knowing full well that 
plaintiff was already the owner of the aforesaid parcel of land and 
acting in gross and evident bad faith and in utter disregard of 
plaintiff's rights in the premises, worked and cultivated and/or caused 
to be worked and cultivated and subsequently planted to rice the 
aforesaid parcel of land, without obtaining plaintiff's previous 
consent; that during the months of December 1957 and January 1958, 
defendant, likewise without obtaining plaintiff's previous consent and 
without even informing plaintiff, and acting again in gross and evident 
bad faith and in complete disregard of plaintiff's rights, harvested 
and/or caused to be harvested and appropriated as her own all the 
produce of the aforesaid parcel of land; that in December 1957, upon 
receiving information that defendant had worked and cultivated the 
aforesaid land, sown thereon and was gathering the products therefrom, 
the plaintiff demanded an accounting and delivery of the harvest to her,
 which amounted to about 1,400 cavanes of palay, at a value of P12.00 
per cavan or a total of P16,800.00; that defendant ignored plaintiff's 
demands and up to that date had refused to deliver the harvest and/or 
render an accounting to the plaintiff; that on account of defendant's 
acts as aforestated, the plaintiff sustained moral damages in the sum of
 P50,000.00; that in order to avoid this action, plaintiff sent an 
attorney-in-fact to Bago, Negros Occidental, for the purpose of 
demanding an accounting from defendant and when the latter refused to 
deal with him, plaintiff herself went to Bago for the same purpose, all 
of which efforts at amicable settlement were rebuffed by the defendant; 
that incidental to these efforts at settlement, the plaintiff incurred 
actual damages by way of transportation to and from Bago and living 
expenses thereat of herself and her attorney-in-fact in the total amount
 of P2,000.00; and that for the institution of this action, the 
plaintiff agreed to pay her counsel a fee of P5,000.00, and plaintiff 
also incurred an additional expense of P60.00 for the filing of this 
complaint.
</p><p>In her amended answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated June 17, 1958, the defendant alleged that Lot No. 850 of the Cadastral Survey of Bago, Negros Occidental (<em>hacienda</em>)
 was the absolute property of one Felix Gonzales who had mortgaged the 
same to the Philippine National Bank as well as to the Rehabilitation 
Finance Corporation; that the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation 
subsequently foreclosed the mortgage and acquired the <em>hacienda</em> 
in ownership as a result of the foreclosure of the mortgage inasmuch as 
no redemption of the land was made; that defendant was the lessee of the
 aforesaid <em>hacienda</em> from Gonzales in a stipulated annual rental
 of P3,000.00; that as such lessee, she planted, cultivated and raised 
the corresponding <em>palay</em> crop on the <em>hacienda</em>; that defendant had never dealt with anybody else concerning the <em>hacienda</em>
 except with Gonzales or his wife, as lessors; that to accommodate them,
 the defendant signed on March 3, 1956 a joint and several promissory 
note for P5,000.00 with these lessors in favor of the Philippine 
National Bank; that the Philippine National Bank attempted to withhold 
P3,000.00 out of the P75,000,00 time loan subsequently extended by the 
said bank to the defendant; that the money to be withheld was to be 
applied to the P5,000.00 joint and several promissory note executed by 
the defendant with these lessors should the latter not pay the 
obligation within the time or extension allowed by the bank; and that 
the defendant was in possession of the property as lessee of Gonzales 
from the crop year 1955-56 and the lease was renewed for the 1957-58 
crop year on the request of the lessors.  The defendant interposed a 
counterclaim against the plaintiff for moral and exemplary damages as 
well as attorney's fees.
</p><p>The defendant, Maria Locsin <em>Vda. de</em> Araneta, filed 
against Felix Gonzales a third party complaint dated June 17, 1958, 
which alleged that the third-party defendant was formerly the owner of 
Lot No. 850 of the Cadastral Survey of Bago, Negros Occidental, formerly
 covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-2955 of the land records
 of Negros Occidental, issued by the Register of Deeds on May 6, 1948 in
 the name of said third-party defendant; that Lot No. 850 of Bago (<em>hacienda</em>) is suitable for the production of <em>palay</em>,
 and for the crop years 1955-56 and 1956-57, the third-party defendant 
leased the same to the third-party plaintiff who accepted the possession
 thereof in lease, on a stipulated rental of P3,000.00 per crop year; 
that after the expiration of the 1956-57 crop year, the third-party 
plaintiff wanted to return the <em>hacienda</em> to the third-party 
defendant, and in this manner terminate the lease, but the third-party 
defendant earnestly urged and begged the third-party plaintiff to 
continue the lease thereof at the same rate of rental as the previous 
crop years and the third-party plaintiff agreed and continued as lessee 
thereof for the 1957-58 crop year, it being understood that the rental 
would be payable at the end of the 1957-58 crop year should the 
third-party defendant not have any accounts with the third-party 
plaintiff; that on March 3, 1956, the third-party defendant and his wife
 applied for a loan in the sum of P5,000.00 from the Philippine National
 Bank, Manila; that on the earnest request and solicitation of the 
third-party defendant, the third-party plaintiff became a co-maker on 
the corresponding promissory note for P5,000.00 in favor of said bank 
which granted the said loan to third-party defendant and his wife, only 
upon the third-party plaintiff's signing and binding herself as joint 
solidary co-maker of the corresponding promissory note for P5,000.00; 
that the third-party defendant and his wife received the proceeds of the
 aforesaid loan of P5,000.00 from the Philippine National Bank; that the
 loan matured on July 17, 1956, but notwithstanding several demands on 
and extensions granted by the Philippine National Bank to the 
third-party defendant and his wife, they did not pay the principal and 
interests of the said loan; that according to the last demand letter of 
the said bank dated May 5, 1958, the loan amounted to P5,720.00 
including interests as of said date; that on November 19, 1957, the 
Philippine National Bank, Bacolod Branch, granted and approved a time 
loan in the amount of P75,000.00 in favor of the third-party plaintiff 
who had a hard time obtaining a release by said bank of the full amount 
of said loan because the Philippine National Bank wanted to withhold 
P3,000.00, equivalent to the rentals for the hacienda corresponding to 
the 1957-58 crop year; that it was after repeated and sincere 
representations effected by the third-party plaintiff with the 
Philippine National Bank, Bacolod Branch, that the full amount of the 
loan was released; that meantime, the abovementioned <em>hacienda</em> 
was mortgaged by the third-party defendant to the Rehabilitation Finance
 Corporation and by reason of the non-payment of the RFC Loan, the RFC 
foreclosed the mortgage and on January 30, 1957 acquired at 
extra-judicial foreclosure sale the said property subject to a one-year 
right of redemption; that by reason of the filing by the original 
plaintiff Marcelo, in collusion with the third-party defendant, of this 
action, the third-party plaintiff has suffered mental anguish, serious 
anxiety, loss of sleep, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral 
shock and social humiliations which should be compensated by the 
third-party defendant, jointly and severally with the original plaintiff
 Marcelo, in the total amount of P50,000.00 by way of moral damages; 
that because of the institution of this malicious and unfounded action, 
springing from the conspiracy and collusion between the original 
plaintiff Marcelo and the third-party defendant, exemplary damages in 
the sum of P25,000.00, in addition to the moral damages, should likewise
 be imposed jointly and severally against the third-party defendant 
Gonzales and original plaintiff Marcelo, in favor of the third-party 
plaintiff, by way of example or correction for the public good; that due
 to the institution of this action, the third-party plaintiff has had to
 incur expenses to protect her interest, obtaining the services of 
counsel in the sum of P5,000.00 to protect, preserve and enforce her 
rights, which attorney's fees should likewise be borne or otherwise paid
 for jointly and severally by third-party defendant and original 
plaintiff Marcelo, who had demonstrated gross and evident bad faith, 
particularly there scheme at the utilization of judicial processes as an
 instrument or weapon for the perpetration of a fraud.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
</p><p>The third-party defendant, Felix Gonzales, alleged as affirmative
 defenses that the third party complaint is improper because the same 
does not arise out of the transaction or occurrence subject of the 
plaintiff's complaint, which is an ordinary action for accounting 
instituted by the landlord's successor-in-interest against one who was 
admittedly a tenant; that the third party complaint is also improper in 
so far as it assails the validity of the transfer of rights made by the 
third-party defendant in favor of the plaintiff over the <em>hacienda</em>
 in question for the reason that a person who is not a party to the 
contract and who is not principally or subsidiarily bound thereby has no
 capacity to challenge the legality of the same; and that the 
third-party plaintiff is not entitled to the relief prayed for in her 
third party complaint for the reason that the same is a false and sham 
pleading.  The third-party defendant interposed a counterclaim for 
damages and attorney's fees.  As alternative counterclaim, the 
third-party defendant asked that the third-party plaintiff be ordered to
 pay the stipulated rent corresponding to the crop year 1957-58.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
</p><p>The trial court rendered its decision dated August 31, 1959, the dispositive part of which reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"WHEREFORE, the court renders judgment, one in favor of the defendant, Maria Locsin <em>Vda. de</em>
 Araneta, and against the plaintiff, Edith Perez de Tagle-Marcelo, and 
the third-party-defendant, Felix M. Gonzales, by dismissing both the 
complaint as well as the counterclaim of the third-party-defendant, 
against the third-party-plaintiff, for said defendant, Mrs. Araneta to 
recover the sum of P10,000.00 with legal rate of interest against the 
plaintiff and the third-party-defendant, jointly and severally, for both
 moral and exemplary damages, plus P5,000.00 as attorney's fees, with 
costs against plaintiff and third-party defendant. </p>

<p>The plaintiff and third-party defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals where the action was docketed as CA-G.R. No. 26659-R.
</p><p>From the amended decision of the Court of Appeals, Maria Locsin <em>Vda. de</em> Araneta appealed to this Court assigning the following errors:
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">"I </p>

 ARANETA MORAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, IT HAVING EXPRESSLY AND DEFINITELY
 FOUND THAT SAID THIRD-PARTY DEFENDANT WAS GUILTY OF FRAUD AND BAD FAITH
 VIS A VIS SAID THIRD-PARTY PLAINTIFF."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The facts, as found by the Court of Appeals, are:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"The facts of this case as established by the documentary evidence 
on record are as follows:  Lot No. 850 of the Cadastral Survey of Bago, 
Negros Occidental, with Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-2955 in the 
name of Felix Gonzales, was leased by the latter in favor of Maria 
Locsin <em>Vda. de</em> Araneta for a period of three years covering the
 agricultural years 1955-56, 1956-57 and 1957-58 at an annual rental of 
P3,000.00 payable in advance.  The lessee paid the rentals for the first
 two crop years (Exhibits 1, 1-A, 1-B-Araneta). </p>
  <p>At the time, the land was mortgaged in favor of the now defunct 
Rehabilitation Finance Corporation as security for a loan of P29,031.67 
obtained by Gonzales in 1951.
  </p>
  <p>On March 3, 1956, Gonzales obtained a loan of P5,000.00 from the 
Philippine National Bank for which Mrs. Araneta signed the promissory 
note as an accommodation co-maker.
  </p>
  <p>On October 26, 1956, Mrs. Araneta received a notice of garnishment issued in Civil Case No. 1912 (<em>Felix Gonzales vs. Bibiana Infante, et al., CFI, Negros Occidental</em>),
 advising her that judgment was rendered in said case against Gonzales 
for the sum of P27,050.56 and enjoining her not to deliver, transfer or 
otherwise dispose of the rents payable by her to said Gonzales (Exhibits
 D and D-1).
  </p>
  <p>On January 30, 1957, the mortgage on the land in question was 
foreclosed extra-judicially and was sold at public auction, wherein the 
Rehabilitation Finance Corporation was the purchaser and the certificate
 of sale was correspondingly issued in favor of said Corporation, 
subject to mortgagor Gonzales' right of redemption in one year, to 
expire on January 3, 1958.
  </p>
  <p>On February 6, 1957, Gonzales executed a deed of assignment 
whereby, in consideration of the sum of P5,000.00, he transferred his 
right of redemption over the property in favor of plaintiff Edith Perez 
de Tagle-Marcelo (Exhibit A).
  </p>
  <p>In January, 1958, Mrs. Marcelo, on the strength of the deed of 
assignment, paid the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation the amount of 
P3,605.76 as 'deposit to repurchase the property' and in a letter to the
 Corporation requested that she be allowed to pay the consideration of 
the sale on a ten percent down payment and the balance on a ten-year 
annual amortization plan, which offer was accepted by the Board of 
Governors of the Corporation in its Resolution No. 1520, adopted on 
February 19, 1958 (Exhibits M, N, N-1, O, P).  Pursuant to said 
Resolution, a deed of conditional sale of the property was executed on 
December 17, 1958, in favor of Mrs. Marcelo, although the title thereto,
 Transfer Certificate of Title No. 22914 issued upon the consolidation 
of title, remained in the name of the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation
 'as security for the payment of the price, advances and interest.' 
(Exhibit E).
  </p>
  <p>In the meantime, on December 27, 1957, Mrs. Marcelo wrote Mrs. 
Araneta her first letter, which was followed by several others, 
informing the latter of the assignment in her favor of Gonzales' right 
of redemption over the property and demanding that she (Mrs. Araneta) 
pay her the P3,000.00 rental for the crop year 1957-58 (Exhibits E, F, 
G, J).
  </p>
  <p>On March 4, 1958, Mrs. Marcelo instituted the instant action 
against Mrs. Araneta for 'an accounting of the harvest gathered by her 
from the land, damages and attorney's fees.'
  </p>
  <p>Mrs. Araneta impleaded Gonzales as third-party defendant and 
demanded moral and exemplary damages from said third-party defendant and
 the plaintiff.  She alleged in her answer and in her third-party 
complaint that said parties acted in collusion in executing the deed of 
assignment, Exhibit A, which is void for being fictitious and in fraud 
of creditors and was executed particularly to enable Gonzales to collect
 from defendant the rental for the crop year 1957-58 without his paying 
first his indebtedness to the Philippine National Bank in the amount of 
P5,000.00 which matured on July 17, 1956, and for which she (Mrs. 
Araneta) may have to pay as accommodation co-maker, since Gonzales was 
then already insolvent.  Mrs. Araneta, in fact paid said loan on August 
1, 1958, when the amount of P5,805.95, representing the principal and 
the interests on said loan, was deducted from her own loan from the 
Philippine National Bank in the amount of P75,000.00, which payment was 
one of the conditions for the approval thereof."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The contention of the petitioner that the Court of Appeals erred in 
eliminating from its original decision the award of P2,805.95 against 
the third-party defendant, Felix Gonzales, in favor of said petitioner, 
Maria Locsin <em>Vda. de</em> Araneta, is not meritorious.
</p><p>It is a fact that the petitioner co-signed with the third-party 
defendant, Felix Gonzales, a promissory note for P5,000.00 in favor of 
the Philippine National Bank.  Felix Gonzales received the full amount 
of P5,000.00.  He failed to pay said amount.  The total amount of 
P5,805.95 consisting of the principal and accrued interest was deducted 
by the Philippine National Bank from the proceeds of the loan of 
P75,000.00 obtained from said bank by the petitioner.  After deducting 
the amount of P3,000.00 due from the petitioner as rental for the 
agricultural year 1957-58, there remained the amount of P2,805.95 which 
the Court of Appeals in its original decision ordered Felix Gonzales to 
pay to the petitioner.  The only reason why the Court of Appeals 
eliminated the payment of this amount in its resolution promulgated on 
January 26, 1965 is that the petitioner did not appeal from the judgment
 of the trial court which failed to order the third-party defendant to 
reimburse her the amount of P2,805.95.
</p><p>It is true that the petitioner did not appeal from the decision 
of the trial court.  Hence she may not now ask that Felix Gonzales be 
ordered to pay her the sum of P2,805.95.  It is to be noted, however, 
that the trial court awarded the petitioner the amount of P10,000.00 as 
moral and exemplary damages.  We maintain the said award of P10,000.00 
in so far as Felix Gonzales is concerned.
</p><p>The Court of Appeals found that Felix Gonzales, the third-party defendant, now private respondent, was guilty of fraud because:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"On the other hand, the bad faith of the third-party defendant is 
patent.  His corresponding liability for damages and attorney's fees is,
 therefore, clear (Article 2220 and Art. 2203, par. 11).  He was in 
admitted financial straits when he transferred his right of redemption 
for a valuable consideration, thereby placing said right beyond the 
reach of his creditors.  His loan with the Philippine National Bank, for
 which defendant had signed as accommodation co-maker, had matured on 
July 17, 1956 and remained unpaid when he made the assignment.  Gonzales
 knew that the Bank would demand payment from defendant as such 
accommodation co-maker.  He should have taken the necessary steps to 
compensate such payment with the rental due from defendant by so 
informing the assignee.  Had he clearly given such information to the 
assignee as well as the fact that his lease agreement with the defendant
 included the crop year 1957-58, plaintiff would have no basis or reason
 to bring the instant suit against defendant.  But he did not, and 
plaintiff should not be penalized thereby."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The petitioner had done Felix Gonzales a favor by co-signing with him
 the promissory note in favor of the Philippine National Bank.  The 
petitioner was prejudiced by the failure of Felix Gonzales to pay the 
amount of P5,000.00.  Indeed, the amount of P5,805.95 was deducted from 
the proceeds of the loan granted by the Philippines National Bank to the
 petitioner.  The act of Felix Gonzales in assigning to Edith Perez de 
Tagle-Marcelo his right to redeem the land mortgaged to the 
Rehabilitation Finance Corporation constituted a wanton disregard of the
 rights of the petitioner.  Under the circumstances, Felix Gonzales 
should be made to pay to the petitioner moral and exemplary damages in 
the amount of P10,000.00 and the amount of P5,000.00 as attorney's fees.
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the decision of the Court of Appeals 
as modified by the resolution promulgated on January 26, 1965 is hereby 
modified and judgment is rendered ordering the private respondent, Felix
 Gonzales, to pay the petitioner the amount of P10,000.00 as moral and 
exemplary damages and the sum of P5,000.00 as attorney's fees, with 
costs against the said private respondent.
