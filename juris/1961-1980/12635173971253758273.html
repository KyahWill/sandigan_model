lower court, then presided by Judge, now Justice <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Solidum</span> of the Court of Appeals, dismissing a
petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> filed by the
Elite Shirt Factory, Inc., now appellant, is one that this Court will pass upon
for the first time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Does the exclusive
juris­diction conferred on a court of first instance over admiralty and
maritime cases include the suit where the shipper files a claim against the
carrier, the goods having been landed, stored in its bodega but subsequently
burned, no delivery having been made to the consignee as a result?<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The lower court answered in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It dismissed the petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>
filed against respondent Judge W. L. <span class="SpellE">Cornejo</span> of the City
Court of Manila who, after deciding in favor of petitioner which sought to
recover damages in the amount of P2,124.00 resulting from the cargo being
burned, refused to grant the motion for execution and in addition, set aside
its original decision, the ground for such dis­missal being the lack of
jurisdiction of respondent Judge, the matter falling within the exclusive
admiralty and maritime juris­diction of a court of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this appeal.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the conclusion reached by the
lower court, and we affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the brief for appellant Elite Shirt Factory, Inc.,
it delivered to respondent <span class="SpellE">Campania</span> <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> on <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="11">November
 29, 1963</st1:date> for shipment to designated consignees several cartons of
merchandise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While such cargo was stored
in the bodega of re­spondent <span class="SpellE">Campania</span> <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> at <span class="SpellE">Pulupandan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, and before they could be delivered to
the consignees, a fire broke out, as a result of which appellant allegedly
suffered damages in the amount of P2<span class="GramE">,124.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The brief for appellant continues:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"On <st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1964</st1:date>, therefore, petitioner-appellant filed with
the City Court of Manila a complaint against <span class="SpellE">Campania</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> for the reimbursement of said amount of P2<span class="GramE">,124.00</span> as actual damages.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A motion to dismiss said complaint was filed by <span class="SpellE">Campania</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> on the ground that the city court does not
have jurisdiction over said case, the same being in the nature of maritime and
admiralty, and within the jurisdiction of courts of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said motion to dismiss was denied by the city
court for lack of merit, after which <span class="SpellE">Campania</span> <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> filed an answer to the complaint <span class="SpellE">impleading</span> respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Philippine Steam Navigation Co., Inc., as third party defendant on the ground,
among others, that the fire which gutted the warehouse of <span class="SpellE">Campania</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> and destroyed the goods stored therein
started from the section occupied by the third-party defendant and caused by
the latter's negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Philippine Stem Navigation Co., Inc. filed its
answer to the third-party complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the scheduled hearing of the complaint and third-party complaint, respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Philippine Steam Naviga­tion Co., Inc., failed to
appear by reason of which an ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> judgment was
rendered against it and respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Campania</span> <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> agreed to pay
the petitioner-appellant the sum of P2,124.00 plus interest thereon at the
legal rate so a judgment by consent was rendered against it."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon petition of the Philippine Steam Navi­gation Co., Inc. to set aside such
judgment on the ground that its failure to appear on the date of the hearing
was due to an excusable neglect, respondent Judge set aside the decision
rendered by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily, a motion
for execution of such decision filed by appellant was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">After an unsuccessful motion for reconsideration, a petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> with preliminary injunction
was filed by appellant with the Court of First Instance of Manila, <span class="GramE">then</span> presided by now Justice <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Solidum</span>, against respondent Judge and respondents <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Compania</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> and
the Philippine Steam Navigation Co., <span style="">Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In its answer to such petition,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Compania</span> <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span>
in­voked the question of jurisdiction alleging that the matter was with­in the
exclusive admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the court of first instance in
accordance with the Judiciary Act, respondent Judge therefore being without
power in the premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a defense
found favor with the lower court which in the decision, now on appeal, of <st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1966</st1:date> dismissed the petition
as in its view the respondent Judge lacked jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the appealed decision would put it:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"As regards the conten­tion of the
petitioner that the liability of the carrier, <span class="SpellE">Compania</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maritima</span>, from the time the shipment was deposited in
its ware­house in <span class="SpellE">Pulupandan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental, was no longer as a common carrier but as a depositary, is not well
taken for the reason that the warehouse in which the cargo was deposited at the
time it was burned was owned by the carrier, <span class="SpellE">Compania</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maritima</span>, itself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Hence, the ruling in the cases of <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span>
&amp; Co., <span style="">Inc. </span>vs. Delgado
Bros., G. R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-13116, </span><st1:date year="1960" day="28" month="4"><span class="GramE">April 28, <span style="">1960</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="">, </span>and Delgado Bros. vs. Home Insurance <span style="">Company, G. R. No.</span></span><span style="">
L-15567, March, </span>1961, cited by the petitioner, to the effect that from
the moment the goods are discharged in the port of destination, the liability
of the same receiving the goods and keeping them until they are delivered to
their designated consignees is that merely of a depositary, is not applicable
to the present case for the simple reason that in those two cases, the
shipments were delivered by the carrier to the <span style="">Customs </span><span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service, the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator of the Port of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the ruling in said cases insofar as it
states that the liability of the carrier ceases upon the discharge of the goods
in the port of destination is correct, the same cannot be correctly applied to
the present case inasmuch as the goods in question were delivered not to
another party but to the warehouse in <span class="SpellE">Pulupandan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, owned by the carrier, <span class="SpellE">Compania</span> <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span>, which
undertook the delivery of said goods to the corresponding consignees by virtue
of a maritime contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
the said cargo was burned before the <span class="SpellE">Compania</span> <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span>, could comply with its maritime obligation to
deliver the same to the consignees."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner is of a different mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would, in this appeal, maintain the view
which did not find favor with the lower court that respondent Judge had
jurisdiction, the goods having been discharged in the port of destination, the
liability of the one in which they were kept being merely that of a
depositary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is how it would develop
such a contention in its brief:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"That is why if the goods were lost, burned or damaged after they
were discharged at the port of destination and while they were at the warehouse
of the defendant and the latter is sued for the loss damage of the goods, then
he is sued in his capacity as a [depositary] and not that of a ship owner or as
a common carrier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If that is so, then the
one keeping the goods is not engaged in maritime proper and therefore subject
to the jurisdiction of the city court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The act of keeping the goods for safekeeping until they are delivered to
the consignee is merely incidental to the business or trade of navigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So where the defendant is primarily sued for
its liability as a [depositary] of the goods and not as <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span>
or as a common carrier, as in the instant case, whatever issue relative to
maritime is merely incidental to the main issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well-settled that in cases where the
goods were burned, lost or damaged while in store before they are delivered to
the consignees, then ordinary courts have jurisdiction."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus evident that the question presented, as set forth at
the opening of this decision, is novel in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The argument advanced by petitioner is not
utterly devoid of plausi­bility but is not sufficiently persuasive to call for
a reversal of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decisive
consideration is that the admiralty jurisdiction as decided by us in a leading
case, International Harvester Co. v. <st1:country-region><st1:place>Aragon</st1:place></st1:country-region>,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
extends over all maritime con­tracts in whatever form entered into, whether
executed or still to be performed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
long as the subject matter thereof is maritime service <span style="">or a </span>maritime transaction, then it is embraced within such a
concept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When, as in this case, the
proceeding in effect is one for a breach of a contract of shipment, the juris­diction
of the court of first instance under the specific provision of the Judiciary
Act is undeniable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The view cannot be
accepted, as petitioner would insist both here and in the lower court, that the
obligation of respondent <span class="SpellE">Campania</span> <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span>
from the contract entered into by it with the petitioner had ceased the moment
the goods were discharged in the port of destination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was still under duty to deliver the same
to the consignees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Until there <span class="GramE">be</span> compliance therewith, it cannot be said that the contract
of <span class="SpellE">affreightment</span> was at an end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That remained the basis of whatever
liability, a point not passed upon in this proceeding, would attach to
respondent <span class="SpellE">Compania</span> <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is why it would not be in consonance
with the settled law if under the above specific facts the matter would not be
considered as falling with in the admiralty jurisdiction of a court of first
instance.</p>
