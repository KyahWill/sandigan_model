planting of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> situated at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Banaba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, and thereby prayed for a change of the system from

with the Court of Agrarian Relations, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, a motion for the issuance of an interlocutory order
to restrain defendants from dispossessing them of the landholdings in question,
alleging that defendants are imposing unilaterally a change on the terms and conditions
of their long standing agreement and agrarian relationship over the
landholdings in question which act tends to eject them in their landholdings
through employment of threat, intimidation and actual force and thereby
prevented them from cultivating their farm this agricultural year, 1973-1974.</p>
