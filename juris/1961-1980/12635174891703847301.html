				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Before this Court for
resolution is respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> supplementary
second motion for reconsideration dated </span><st1:date year="1968" day="27" month="6"><span style="">June </span><span style="">27, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It may be recalled that
the instant proceeding started when the Solicitor General, in behalf of the
Republic of the Philippines, filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila on
March 7, 1961 a petition for denaturalization of respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
who had taken his oath </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">allegiance as a Filipino citizen on December </span>29,
1958 <span style="">pursuant to the </span><span style="">decision </span><span style="">of the said court dated October 31, 1956, granting his petition for
naturalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>One of the
grounds alleged by the Solicitor General was that respondent had obtained his
certificate of naturalization fraudulently by stating in his application that
he was a resident of Manila when actually he was residing at No. 28, 12th
Street (Broadway), <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In essence this ground questioned the
jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of Manila in the naturalization
proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another ground was that
respondent had been guilty of tax evasion and habitual concealment of his
taxable income.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petition for
denaturalization was denied </span>by the Court of First Instance, and
petitioner appealed to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1966</st1:date> this Court reversed the
said decision and ordered respondent's certificate of naturalization
revoked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon motion for reconsideration
this Court, in its resolution dated May 4, 1968, found that in the light of a
memorandum submitted by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to the Solicitor
General and presented to this Court in connection with said motion, "the
second charge of <span class="SpellE">underdeclarations</span> of his (respondent's)
income has not been clearly established, and therefore, his denaturalization
cannot be predicated upon said charge." However, by a divided vote of five
to four, with one abstention, this Court denied the motion for reconsideration
on the ground that respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
naturalization had been illegally obtained because his application <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> failed to state one of his places of residence,
namely, No. 28 12th street (Broadway), <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City,
contrary to the requirements of Section 7 of the Naturalization <span style="">Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It
is this resolution of denial promulgated <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="5">May
 4, 1968</st1:date>, reiterated in another resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1968</st1:date>, which in effect is the subject of
respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> supplementary second motion for
reconsideration of <st1:date year="1968" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his motion respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> raises a constitutional question and claims that
to denaturalize him for violation of section 7 of the Naturalization Law would
be a denial of due process inasmuch as the petition for that purpose filed in
the Court of First Instance did not allege such ground, but rather that he had
no residence </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the City of Manila at all, his residence
being in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, at the address aforementioned,
at the time of his application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, his position is that since the petition for </span><span style="">denaturalization was based on </span>non-compliance
with sec<span style="">tion </span><span style="">8 </span><span style="">of the Naturalization Law, according to which an application for
naturalization must be filed in the </span><span style="">Court of First Instance of the place of the applicant's residence for
at least one year preceding the filing of such application, and since the
charge of non-compliance was not true, he having been found to be really a
resident of Manila, precisely at the address stated by him, he should not be
denaturalized on another ground neither alleged nor the subject of evidence at
the trial, namely, failure to state any other places of residence, past and
present, as required by Section 7.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Required to comment on
the point thus raised by respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, the
Solicitor General expressed his concurrence from the standpoint of the due
process clause of the Constitution, and submitted respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> supplementary second motion for reconsideration
to the sound discretion of this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1968" day="15" month="11"><span style="">November
 15, 1968</span></st1:date><span style=""> this Court
issued the following resolution:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In L-19829 (Republic of the Philippines vs. Francisco Co <span class="SpellE">Keng</span>), acting on the supplementary second motion for
reconsideration of respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> dated June 27,
1968 and on the Solicitor General's answer thereto dated October 4, 1968;
considering the argument of said respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
concurred in by the Solicitor-General, that to denaturalize him for lack of
compliance with Section 7 of the Naturalization Law would constitute a denial
of due process, since the petition for that purpose is based solely on Section
8 of the same law; considering further that the purpose of Section 7, which
requires that an application for naturalization must state the present and
former places of residence of the applicant to enable the public and the investigating
agencies of the government to gather all information available as to the
conduct of an applicant and thus determine whether his behavior at all times
has been irreproachable as required by law; and considering finally that the
said purpose of the law would be sub served in this case by affording the
Solicitor General opportunity to make the necessary <span style="">investigation on the point and submit his findings to the court, with
notice to and hearing of the respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>as </span>alternatively prayed for in the
aforesaid supplementary second motion for reconsideration, this case is
remanded to the Court of origin, with instructions to the Solicitor General to
make the necessary investigation regarding the conduct and behavior of said
respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, particularly in the vicinity of No. 28, 12th street, Broadway, before and
after the grant of citizenship to him on December 29, 1958, and in the event
such investigation should yield derogatory information which would render him
unfit for citizenship, to file the corresponding amended petition for
denaturalization on that ground, otherwise to file with this Court, within a
reasonable time, a manifestation that no such information is available, so that
the proper action may be taken."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1968</st1:date>
the Solicitor General filed a Manifestation as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The undersigned Solicitor General hereby respectfully
manifests that he has complied with the resolution of this Honorable Court of
November 15, 1968 in this case in the following manner:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly after being notified of said resolution,
a panel composed of Assistant Solicitor General Isidro <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>,

Quiroz, Salvador Jacob and Adolfo Diaz, the panel in the Office of the
Solicitor General to which the <span class="SpellE">Cokeng</span> case was
assigned under the particular care of Solicitor <span class="SpellE">Sumilang</span>
Bernardo, was instructed to set the investigation of the moral character and
conduct of respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> required by this
Honorable Court with notice to said party and to have said notice published in
a newspaper of general circulation;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Letters were also addressed to the National
Bureau of Investigation and the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City requesting investigation of the same matter;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meanwhile, information was secured as
to who have been residing in the neighborhood of 28 12th Street, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City during the material time involved <span style="">in this </span>case and from whom the
investigating panel could make inquiries about the said moral character and
conduct of respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and three persons who
could serve the purpose were requested to make affidavits <span style="">and </span>to testify at the hearing for
which they were duly served with subpoena;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The above-mentioned panel set the hearing on <st1:date year="1968" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1968</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning and actually held
it as scheduled;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notice of hearing was actually published
in the Philippines Herald on December 8, 10 and 11, 1968;</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At said hearing, the <span style="">respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> </span>presented
clearances from the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>
office, Office of the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City,
Court of First Instance, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Branch and the
National Bureau of <span style="">In</span>vestigation;</blockquote>

<blockquote>7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the following prominent <span style="">persons </span>testified at said hearing in
answer to the subpoena served on each of them: Atty. <span class="GramE"><span style="">Rosario </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>L</span>. <span class="SpellE">Planas</span>, of

<span style="">Philippine </span>National Bank, <span style="">Mr. Carlos <span class="SpellE">Sobreviñas</span>
of No. 3 </span>Eight Street, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City;</blockquote>

<blockquote>8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The report of the panel to the undersigned
Solicitor General shows that no one has appeared with derogatory information

<blockquote>9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That subsequent to the hearing, the

which is hereto attached as Annex B;</blockquote>

<blockquote>10.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also subsequent to the hearing, the
undersigned received a handwritten letter from Mayor Norberto <span class="SpellE">Amoranto</span> of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
  City</st1:place></st1:city> pertinent to the matter under inquiry, which
letter is attached hereto as Annex C of this manifestation;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">11.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
all the foregoing, it </span>appears that no derogatory information against the
respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> during the period of his
residence or stay, material to this case, at <span style="">No. 28 12th Street, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City is available;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the above manifestation is respectfully submitted to
this Honorable Court for its consideration in relation to the resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1968</st1:date>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In view of the </span><span style="">foregoing report of the Solicitor General it
has become unnecessary to remand this case to the court of origin for the
purpose contemplated in the resolution of this Court of November 15, 1968,
namely, for the Solicitor General to file the corresponding amended petition
for naturalization against </span><span style="">respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in </span><span style="">the
event the investigation regarding his conduct and behavior in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, before and after the grant of citizenship to
him on December 29, 1958, should yield derogatory information which would
render him unfit for citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
reason behind the requirement in Section 7 of the Naturalization Law concerning
the inclusion of an applicant's present and former places of residence in his
petition for naturalization has been satisfied in this particular case, and
consequently the filing of an amended petition for denaturalization expressly
alleging failure to comply with such requirement would serve no practical
purpose, nor may the Solicitor </span><span style="">General
</span><span style="">be expected to file such
petition after the investigation conducted by him had yielded negative results.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">Wherefore</span></b><span style=""> respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee’s</span>
supplementary second motion for reconsideration is granted; the decision </span>of
this Court of July 20, 1966, and the resolution of May 4, 1968 insofar as it
denies respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> first motion for
reconsideration, and the resolution of June 25, 1968, denying his second motion
for reconsideration, are set aside; and the judgment of the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
