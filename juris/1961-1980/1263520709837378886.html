				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In Criminal Case No.</span> CCC-VI-58(70) of
the Circuit Criminal Court for the 6th Judicial District (Manila), entitled <span style="">"People of the Philippines vs. Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> </span>y <span class="SpellE">Canda</span>, et
al.," wherein the four accused were charged with the offense of attempted
robbery with homicide, a judgment of acquittal was rendered by the trial Judge,
Hon. Manuel R. <span class="SpellE">Pamaran</span>, on May 6, 1970.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim of the <span style="">alleged </span>offense was <span style="">one
Eden <span class="SpellE">Zabala</span> y Lopez, whose </span>widow, Thelma <span class="SpellE">Zabala</span>, sent a letter to the Secretary of Justice on <span style="">May </span>28,
1970, <span style="">complaining </span>against the
decision of Judge <span class="SpellE">Pamaran</span> as a "miscarriage <span style="">of </span>justice" <span style="">and </span>making reference to the <span style="">fact </span>that she and another person
testified <span style="">at the trial </span>as
eye-witnesses to the commission of the crime, whose testimony, she implied, was
sufficient to sustain a verdict of conviction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span style="">letter-complaint
was endorsed </span><span style="">by the
Undersecretary of Justice to this Court on February 15, 1971 for its "con­sideration
and appropriate action;" and on the <span style="">following </span>March 12 this Court issued </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">resolution requiring the complainant to
verify her complaint and the respondent Judge to file an answer <span style="">thereto.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
April 26, </span><span style="">1971 the complainant,
through counsel, filed a sworn petition containing the following allegations:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on <st1:date year="1969" day="30" month="12">30 December 1969</st1:date>, the late husband of the petitioner,
Eden <span class="SpellE">Zabala</span>, was ruthlessly shot and killed in her
presence by <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> de Leon, Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Quiambao</span>, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span> and Pat.
Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> of the Manila Police Department;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the four persons above-named were
indicted before the Circuit Criminal Court of Manila for attempted robbery with
homicide in Criminal Case No. CCC-VI-58 entitled "People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span>, et al<span class="GramE">.;</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the Presiding Judge who tried Criminal
Case No. CCC-VI-58 was the herein respondent;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the prosecution submitted abundant
documentary and testimonial proofs to establish beyond reasonable doubt the
crime for which the four accused were charged in the information;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> the
tide of evidence tending to establish the guilt of <span style="">said </span>accused, the herein respondent,
oblivious of his sworn duty to uphold the law and to give justice to all <span style="">those who come to his court in search
thereof, rendered </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">decision on 6 May </span>1970 acquitting the four accused and even
ascribing aggression on the part of the petitioner’s husband;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That whereas the respondent <span style="">is </span>clothed with discretion in the assessment of the evidence and
in the evaluation of the testimonies of those who appear and testify before
him, the respondent gravely abused and misused his discretion in rendering <span style="">a </span>decision
favorable to the accused in Criminal Case No. CCC-VI-58, the <span style="">grounds relied on being speculative,
imaginary and not susceptible of proof;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">That</span> the petitioner
adopts as part hereof her sworn complaint to the Department of Justice dated <st1:date year="1970" day="27" month="5">27 May 1970</st1:date>, copy of which is here
attached as Annex "A" hereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, after hearing, it is most respectfully prayed of
this Honorable Court that the respondent <span style="">be
dealt with according to the gravity of the acts herein complained of."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge filed <span style="">his
</span>answer on <st1:date year="1971" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1971</st1:date>,
denying the imputation of grave abuse of discretion and justifying the decision
he rendered in the criminal case by reference to the analysis he made therein
of the evidence presented by both the prosecution and the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A copy of <span style="">the </span>entire decision, consisting of twenty-eight typewritten
pages, as well as copies of the documentary records of the case, including
reports of the police investigation, laboratory findings (ballistic and
paraffin tests) and post-mortem findings of the Manila Police Medico-Legal
Division, were likewise submitted by the respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present <span style="">administrative
</span>case does not call for <span style="">a </span><span style="">review
of </span>that decisions, except insofar as its text and the considerations
articulated by the respondent with respect to the evidence before him may yield
some <u><span style="">prima</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>facie</u> semblance of merit in
the complaint so <span style="">as </span>to justify <span style="">a </span>formal investigation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mere errors in the appreciation of such evidence, unless so gross and
patent as to produce an inference of ignorance or bad faith, or that the Judge
knowingly rendered an unjust decision, are irrelevant and immaterial in an
administrative proceeding against him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No one, called upon to try the facts or interpret the law in the process
of administering justice, can be infallible in his judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that is expected of him is that he <span class="GramE">follow</span> the rules prescribed to ensure a fair and impartial
hearing, assess the different factors that emerge <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
and bear on the issues presented, and on the basis of the conclusions he finds
established, with only his conscience and knowledge of the law to guide him,
adjudicate the case accordingly.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The decision rendered by
respondent Judge now subject of the complaint adheres faithfully to </span>these
norms of judicial duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It </span>contains a painstaking review of
the record, analyzes the significance of each item of evidence, and <span style="">where </span>there <span style="">is </span>conflict in the declarations of
witnesses, <span class="GramE">evaluates</span> them both subjectively and
against the background of related physical facts that by their nature can
hardly be disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reading the decision,
a reasonable man, endowed or not with legal training and courtroom experience, <span style="">could hardly say he would have arrived </span><span style="">a </span>different
verdict.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complainant ascribes no undue motivation to the respondent,
and stresses only one point in her complaint, namely, that the evidence for the
prosecution established the guilt of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This particular factual issue appears
extensively discussed in the decision; the reasons for not accepting the
veracity of the complainant's testimony and that of the other alleged
eye-witness are explained; and if in the mind of the respondent the evidence
for the defense was entitled to more weight and credence he cannot be held to
account administratively for the result of his ratiocination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For <span style="">that
</span><span style="">is </span><span style="">the
very essence of judicial inquiry; otherwise the burdens of judicial office </span>would
be intolerable.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">Wherefore</span></b><span style="">, there being no sufficient basis </span>to
warrant further proceeding, the complaint is hereby dismissed.</p>
