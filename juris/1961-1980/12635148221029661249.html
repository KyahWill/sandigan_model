				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The present action started on <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff American Insurance Co<span class="GramE">.,</span> filed the
complaint in the City Court of Manila against defendants Manila Port Service
and Manila Railroad Co., as <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alleged therein, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
were the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff is a foreign corporation licensed to do business in
this country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On or about <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1962</st1:date> the SS
"TUNGUS" discharged one thousand three hundred and thirty four
(1,334) cartons composition cock rods, under bill of lading No. 3, unto
defendants, custody and control, complete and in good order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shipment, valued at P28,888.80, was
imported by and consigned to the order of <span class="SpellE">Sociedade</span> <span class="SpellE">Corticeira</span> <span class="SpellE">Concorco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lda</span>., notify San Miguel Brewery, Inc., Manila, Philippines,
and insured with plaintiff, against loss and damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this cargo was delivered by defendants to
the consignee with losses and damages amounting to P4<span class="GramE">,054.20</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Claim <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> was made on defendants,
who refused to pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As insurer,
plaintiff in due course paid P4<span class="GramE">,054.20</span> to the
consignee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span>,
plaintiff filed the present suit, since defendants continued their refusal to
pay the claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">After defendants answered and the parties submitted evidence, the
City Court decided in plaintiff's favor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendants thereupon appealed to the Court of First Instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the case <span class="GramE">proceeded</span> <u>de</u> <u>novo</u>
in the Court of First Instance, pre-trial was held on <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not being finished then, pre-trial was
continued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on <st1:date year="1967" day="11" month="1">January 11, 1967</st1:date>, when the case was again called
for pre-trial, plaintiff's counsel and plaintiff’s representative appeared but
neither defendants' counsel nor defendants' representative was present.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff's counsel then moved to dismiss the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the several postponements asked
by the <span class="GramE">defendants,</span> and their absence that morning, the
court granted plaintiff's motion, dismissed the appeal and ordered the case
remanded to the lower court for execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ten minutes later, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> appeared and manifested that he received a telegram
from defendants' counsel (Atty. <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> <span class="SpellE">Gepiga</span>), asking him to appear in his behalf that morning to
ask for postponement of the case in view of said counsel's having been called
to the province due to the illness of his mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> orally
moved for reconsideration of the dismissal order but was given leave to file it
in writing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant thereto, said
motion for reconsideration was filed in writing on <st1:date year="1967" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was denied on <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="1">January 14,
 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration of said denial was filed by
defendants' counsel. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The same was
likewise denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, hence, defendants'
present appeal from the dismissal of its appeal in the Court of First Instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">The point at issue has already been ruled upon by <span class="GramE">Us</span> in Home Insurance Co. v. United States Lines, Co.,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a>
wherein We held that under the Revised Rules of Court pre-trial is mandatory
and the parties as well as their counsel are required to appear during the
pre-trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And there <span class="GramE">We</span>
stressed that Section 2, Rule 20 provides that “a party who fails to appear at
a pre-trial conference may be non-suited or considered as in default."</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, both defendants and defendants' counsel failed to
appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although another lawyer
appeared, ten minutes after the pre-trial was called and the dismissal order
issued, to ask for postponement of said pre-trial on behalf of defendants'
counsel, the court did not err in denying the same, not only because it was
late but also because of its finding that defendants had already asked several
postponements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, defendants
themselves, or their representative, did not appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A finding of failure to prosecute their
appeal was therefore in order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And,
applying Section 9 of Rule 40, Rules of Court:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"If the appeal is withdrawn, or dismissed for failure to prosecute,
the judgment shall be deemed revived and shall forthwith be remanded to the
municipal or city court for execution.”</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed order of dismissal is
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
