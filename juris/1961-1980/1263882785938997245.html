				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In these two cases decided jointly as involving a common issue of
law, the Court annuls respondent commission's decisions and reinstates the
referees' awards of disability compensation in favor of petitioners-claimants
on the fundamental ground of the commission's lack of jurisdiction and
authority to set aside an award that had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> for failure to appeal the same within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>L-43112</u>, the referee after hearing, rendered the
decision dated September 3, 1974 granting petitioner-claimant Pedro <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span> the sum of P6,000.00 as disability compensation
benefits (for <span class="SpellE">arteriosclerotic</span> heart disease
aggravated by the nature of his employment as mail carrier from 1946 to 1972)
and P346.70 as reimbursement of medical expenses duly supported by receipts,
and ordering respondent Republic (Bureau of Posts) to pay P300. -attorney's
fees to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Latosa</span>
and P61. -administrative fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copy of
the decision was admittedly received by respondent Republic through the office
of the Solicitor General on <st1:date year="1974" day="4" month="9">September
 4, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
belatedly filed only on <st1:date year="1974" day="24" month="9">September 24,
 1974</st1:date> (five [5] days beyond the 15-day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period to take an appeal) its motion to set aside the decision which was
correctly denied by the referee in an order dated <st1:date year="1975" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1975</st1:date> on the ground that "the decision
has already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>." The
commission nevertheless ordered the elevation of the record on <st1:date year="1976" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1976</st1:date> (notwithstanding that
no petition for relief had been timely filed or granted) and issued its
decision dated <st1:date year="1976" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1976</st1:date>
ordering the claim "dismissed for lack of merit."</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>L-43307</u>, the referee after hearing, rendered the
decision dated October 27, 1975 granting petitioner-claimant <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Regala</span> the sum of
P6,000.00 as disability compensation benefits (for PTB and bleeding ulcer
incurred in the course of his employment since 1973 as laborer involving
strenuous work and carrying heavy construction materials) and ordering
respondent Republic (Bureau of Agricultural Extension) to pay P300. -attorney's
fees to his counsel of record Atty. <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> C. Lopez
and P61.-administrative fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copy of
the decision was received by respondent Republic through the office of the
Solicitor General on <st1:date year="1975" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent belatedly filed only on December
15, 1975 (42 days after notice of the decision or 27 days beyond the 15-day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period to take an appeal) its Motion to Elevate
Records (without serving petitioner a copy).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The commission nevertheless ordered the elevation of the records on <st1:date year="1976" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1976</st1:date> (notwithstanding
that no motion for relief had been timely filed or granted) and issued its
decision of <st1:date year="1976" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1976</st1:date>
ordering the claim "dismissed for lack of merit."</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitions must be granted, since respondent commission no
longer had authority and jurisdiction to set aside the referees' decisions that
had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> for failure to
take an appeal within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Vitug</u></span><u> vs. Republic</u><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
we once again reaffirmed our ruling in <u>Ramos vs. Republic</u><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
that "(the) basic rule of finality of judgments is applicable
indiscriminately to one and all and regardless of whether respondent employer
be a public or private employer, since the rule is grounded on fundamental
considerations of public policy and sound practice that at risk of occasional
error, the judgment of courts and award of quasi-judicial agencies must become
final at some definite date fixed by law."</p>

<p class="BODY">We stressed therein once again that "(I)t is of course
beyond question that the perfection of an appeal <u>within</u> the statutory or
<span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period is <u>mandatory</u> and <u>jurisdictional</u>
and that failure to so perfect an appeal renders final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
the questioned decision and deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction to
entertain the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lapse of the
appeal period deprives the courts of jurisdiction to alter the final
judgment."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
An exception to this basic rule is where there is a timely petition for relief
from judgment within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period (within
30 days from knowledge/notice of the decision-award and within 3 months from
entry thereof in workmen's compensation cases<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>),
but as already stated hereinabove, no petitions for relief from judgment had
been timely filed or granted in the cases at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, judgment is hereby rendered setting aside the
decisions of respondent commission and reinstating the referees' decisions in
favor of petitioners-claimants Pedro <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Regala</span> with the sole
modification that the attorneys' fees are increased to Six hundred (P600. 00)
pesos by virtue of the services rendered in this appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>
