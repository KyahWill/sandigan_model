				<BR><STRONG>MAKALINTAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appellant Universal Insurance and Indemnity Company went to the
Court of First Instance of Manila on <span style="">a </span><span style="">petition
for prohibition (Civil Case No. 59607) to stop the respondent Judge, the late
Hon. Roman <span class="SpellE">Cansino</span>, Jr., presiding Branch VIII, City
Court of Manila, from further taking cognizance of Civil Case No. 111904
insofar as </span>said petitioner, one of the defendants therein, was
concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">Civil Case No. 111904 is entitled "Age Construction <st1:place>Co.</st1:place>,
Inc., Plaintiff, vs. Beatriz <span class="SpellE">Tengsico</span> and Husband,
and Universal Insurance and Indemnity Company, Defendants."</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent facts are as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Age Construction Co., Inc. - hereinafter
referred to as the respondent company - is a domestic corporation engaged in
the construction business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1962</st1:date> it entered into a
written contract with Beatriz <span class="SpellE">Tengsico</span>, <span style="">leasing to the latter several units of
construction equipment, one of which was a vibrator stipulated to be worth not
less than P500.00, at a monthly rental in the same amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lease contract was executed in the City
of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> and provided that the equipment subject
thereof was to be used on a construction project of the lessee and returned to
the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> upon termina­tion of the lease in the same
good running condition as when it was received.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lessee also undertook to insure the equipment against loss, damage
or destruction, the corresponding insurance policy to be issued in favor of the
lesson.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1962</st1:date>
the policy was issued by the petitioner, with the respondent company appearing
as the assured and with the place of execution indicated <span style="">as </span>follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"IN WITNESS WHEREOF, <span style="">a </span>duly authorized officer of the
(insurance) company has set his hand here­under in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <st1:place><st1:city><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span></st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Philippines</st1:country-region></st1:place>,
this 26th day of January 1962."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In due time the
construction project of the lessee was finished and the respondent company
asked for the </span>return of the leased equipment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vibrator, however,<span style=""> </span>was not returned, the lessee alleging that it had been lost and
that she had a certificate of loss in her posses­sion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the respondent company filed Civil Case
No. 111904 in the City Court of Manila against Beatriz <span class="SpellE">Tengsico</span>
and her husband for the recovery of the value of the vibrator and actual
damages equivalent to the monthly rentals, as well as for moral and exemplary
damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The date of the filing of the
complaint does not appear in the record before us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What does appear is that an amended complaint
dated October 2, 1964 was subsequently filed pursuant to an order of the respondent
Judge, <span class="SpellE">impleading</span> the herein petitioner as
alternative party defendant in view of the allegation of the <span class="SpellE">Tengsicos</span> in their answer to the original complaint that
the vibrator had been insured with the petitioner and that the same had been
lost in their posses­sion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The allegation in the amended complaint with respect to the new
defendant, petitioner herein, is that sometime in December 1962 the plaintiff
verbally requested the said defendant to pay the insurance value of the
vibrator and followed such verbal request with a formal letter of demand on <st1:date year="1964" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1964</st1:date>, but that the
demand was not complied with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
specific prayer against the same defendant is for judgment in the alternative
to be rendered against it for the payment of the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
which is the aggregate insured value of the three items of equipment covered by
the insurance policy.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1964</st1:date>
the petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint insofar as it
was concerned on the grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that
venue was improperly laid; (2) that the complaint failed to state <span style="">a </span>cause of action; and (3) that the
plaintiff's claim set forth in the complaint had been waived or abandoned and
had already prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The motion was denied; the petitioner moved
to reconsider but was turned down; and the case was set for <span style="">trial on </span></span><st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="1"><span style="">January 26, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition for prohibition, Case No. 59607, was thereupon
commenced in the Court of First Instance of Manila seeking to stop the
respondent Judge from further proceeding with Civil Case No. 111904, and
alleging that the denial by him of the petitioner's motion to dismiss was
without or in excess of jurisdiction and <span style="">a
</span>grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1965</st1:date>
the Court of First Instance rendered judgment sustaining the order of the
respondent Judge and dismissing the petition for prohibition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence this appeal.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue raised before <span class="GramE">Us</span> <span style="">is </span>whether
or not venue was properly laid in Civil Case No. <span style="">111904 </span><span style="">as </span>against
the herein petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be
stated that the original complaint filed by the respondent company in the City
Court of Manila was against the <span class="SpellE">Tengsicos</span> alone for
the recovery of the value of the vibrator which had been leased to Beatriz <span class="SpellE">Tengsico</span> and which they failed to return upon the
termination of the lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, the action was predicated on the lease contract, for breach of a stipu­lation
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <span style="">action </span>could be tried and proceed to judgment without bringing
in the petitioner as defendant, the latter not being a party to the said
contract, and its liability, if any, being based on the insurance policy it had
issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the prayer in the
amended complaint is merely to hold it alternatively responsible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is clear, </span>therefore, that the petitioner <span style="">is </span>not an
indispensable party in the action filed against the original defendants, since
without its <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> <span style="">a final </span>determination of said <span style="">action could be obtained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">If anything the
petitioner was only a proper or necessary party within the meaning of Section 8
of Rule 3, which provides as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 8.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Joinder</span> of proper
parties<span class="GramE">.-</span> When persons who are not indispensable but
who ought to be parties if complete relief <span style="">is </span>to be accorded as between those
already parties have not been made parties and <span style="">are subject to the jurisdiction of the court </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">to both service of process and venue, the
court shall order them sum­moned to appear in the action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the court may, in its discretion, proceed
in the action without making such per­sons parties, and the judgment rendered
therein shall be without prejudice to the rights of such persons."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted that under the foregoing rule the <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of proper parties, that is, of persons who are not
indispensable but who ought to be parties if complete <span style="">relief </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">to </span>be afforded
as between those already parties, requires that they be subject to the
jurisdiction of the court as to both service of process and venue.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case there is no agreement in the insurance policy
issued by the petitioner as to where an action for recovery thereon should be
filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequent­ly, Rule 4, Section
1(b), subparagraph 2, should govern, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"All other civil actions (i.e., actions other than forcible entry
and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>) in inferior courts should be
brought:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>if there is no such agreement,
in the place of execution of the contract sued upon as appears there
from."</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">The place of execution is clear enough
on the face of the policy:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it was <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any evidence to show otherwise would be
immaterial, since the purpose of the rule is to avoid further inquiry outside
that which appears on the document itself as the place of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further­more, to permit such inquiry would be
to assume that the contract does not show where it was executed, in which case
subparagraph 3 of the same Rule 4 would be applicable, to the effect that
action should be brought "in the municipali­ty where the defendant or any
of the defendants resides or may be served with summons." In this case it
is alleged in the amended complaint that "the Universal Insurance and
Indemnity Company, Inc. is a corporation organized under the laws of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
with postal address at <st1:place><st1:placename>Insular</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Life</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>, <st1:address><st1:street>Ayala
  Avenue</st1:street>, <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:city></st1:address>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>," and it was in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
that it was served with summons.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">In the case of Enriquez v. <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>, 84 Phil. 674, this Court held that prohibition is
the proper remedy against a Judge who proceeds "in defiance of the Rules
of Court by refusing to dismiss an action which could not be maintained in his
court" on the ground of improper venue.</p>

<p class="BODY" style=""><b>Wherefore</b>, the judgment appealed
from is hereby reversed and the writ prayed for <span style="">is </span>ordered issued, pro­hibiting whoever is the successor of the
respondent Judge, Hon. Roman <span class="SpellE">Cansino</span>, Jr., now
deceased, from further proceeding in <span style="">Civil
Case No. 111904 of </span>the City Court of Manila insofar as the petitioner,
defendant therein, <span style="">is </span>concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against the private
respondent.</span></p>
