</span><span style="">on certiorari of a <span style="">decision </span>of the </span><span style="">Court </span><span style="">of Industrial Relations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The material facts are
not disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 4, 1959
petitioner United Seamen's Union of the Philippines (hereinafter referred to as
USUP) presented a set of <span style="">demands to
respondent <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span>
Association (hereinafter </span>referred to as <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span>)
representing respondent shipping companies, for <span style="">union </span>recognition, union <span style="">security,
</span>standardization of wages and other benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">In
its </span>answer, the <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span> invited <span class="SpellE">USUP's</span> attention to the <span style="">existence </span>of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">collective bargaining agreement with the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> <span style="">Marine </span>Association
(hereinafter referred to as Association), to which <span style="">all the crewmen of their launches belonged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span>
were bound by said collective bargaining agreement until the end of that year
(1959), it suggested that USUP first take the necessary steps to be certified
as the collective bargaining agent of the employees before they could negotiate
in connection with its proposals.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However,
even before receiving the <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span>' answer to its
set of demands, USUP had filed with Regional Office No. </span><span style="">8 </span><span style="">of the Department
of Labor of </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Davao</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> a notice of strike
against all the individual <span class="SpellE">shipowners</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chief of the Labor Operations Section of
the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Regional Office requested USUP and the <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span> to a conference with a view to settling the
conflict.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1959" day="20" month="8"><span style="">August 20, 1959</span></st1:date><span style=""> the USUP, the <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span>
and the Association reached an agreement and executed the following covenant:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We, the undersigned representatives of the
United Seamen's Union of the Philippines (USUP) hereby withdraw the notice to
strike against any and all members of the group known as the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span> Association that
we filed on or about August 6, 1959;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“B.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We, the USUP, further under­take to preserve
and observe the status quo with reference to the normal and original operation
practices of loading, unloading, departures, manning and the performance of any
and/or all jobs in­cident to the businesses of the members of the said <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span>' Association here in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
City and in the <span class="SpellE">outports</span> of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
province which are their ports of call or may travel to and conduct their
businesses;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“C. We, the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Marine Association, hereby undertake to cooperate
with the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span>'
Association and the USUP in the observation and preservation of such practices
and conduct of the <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span>' businesses, and in
view of this covenant will withdraw our complaint against the USUP, its
officers, agents and other representatives which is now Civil Case No. 3106
before Branch I of the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Court of First Instance;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“D. That the USUP
hereby announces and binds itself that it will respect the contract between the
<span class="SpellE">Davao</span> <span class="SpellE">Shipowner's</span> Association
and the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Marine Associa­tion until its expiry
date and will not in any manner cause the same to be impaired or disturbed, but
will file a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations for certifica­tion
election to determine the issue of union representation of the <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span>' workers, and if we, the USUP, will be the one
certified, we will commence to bargain with <span class="SpellE">Shipowner's</span>
Association after the said contract shall be expired;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"E.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We, the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> <span class="SpellE">Shipowner's</span> Association gladly give our conformity to the
agreement of both parties to observe and preserve the status quo on the above
mentioned contract's opera­tion and the commitment of the USUP to have the CIR
determine the issue of union representation."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As stipulated, USUP filed
with the Court of Indus­trial Relations a petition for certification election
to determine the sole collective bargaining representative of </span><span style="">all the workers and
employees of respondent shipping companies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Meanwhile, subsequent to
the covenant of August 20, the respondent shipping companies separately served
notices of termination of service upon sixty-four (64) em­ployees, effective </span><st1:date year="1959" day="31" month="12"><span style="">December
 31, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, for
reasons ranging from stoppage of operations due to the death of a partner to
business losses and reversals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Because of these notices
of termination of service upon USUP members (who, admittedly, were also members
of the Association), USUP reported the matter to Regional Of­fice No. 8 of the
Department of Labor in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City and requested at
the same time the assistance of said office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Regional Office thereupon called the parties to a con­ference, but
apparently it did not do much good, for in <span style="">a </span></span><span style="">letter dated December 29, 1959 USUP formally notified the Regional
Office, Department of Labor, the City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>,
the Chief of Police, the Philippine Constabulary, the Bureau of Customs and the
general public that they would declare a strike on January 1, 1960.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On February 11, 1960 the
respondent shipping companies filed <span style="">a </span>petition
for a writ of injunction (Case No. 3-INJ-DB) with the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>,
alleging that a res­training order was necessary 'to forestall substantial and
irreparable damage to petitioners' (now respondents') properties and public
weal," citing specific acts of coercion, violence and illegal picketing
being committed by </span><span style="">defendants (now petitioners).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
February 24, 1960 USUP filed an unfair labor practice case against herein
respondents (Case No. 49-ULP-DB), alleging that "while its petition for
certifica­tion election is still pending consideration before this Honorable
Court, respondents herein by their respective officers interfered with and have
been interfering with their employees' guaranteed right to self-organization
and discriminated and have been discriminating against their respective
employees, who are members of the com­plainant, in regard to hire or tenure of
office or con­dition of employment in order to deter organizational activity
amongst employees, to induce those already organized to drop from the rank,
disrupt union morale and ultimately to break up the complainant union x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The unfair labor case was apparently
predicated upon the dismissal of the USUP members from employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition then proceeded to enumerate the
various acts of respondents which were claimed to be violations of section
4(a), sub-sections (1), (2) and (4) of Republic Act 875.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After
the respondent companies had filed their respective answers, the petition for
injunction filed by the <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span> and the unfair
labor case filed by the USUP were heard and tried jointly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1960" day="31" month="10"><span style="">October
 31, 1960</span></st1:date><span style=""> the court <u>a</u> </span><u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">issued the appealed order, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"FOR ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the USUP complaint for
unfair labor prac­tice (Case No. 49-ULP-DB) dated February 24, 1960, against
the respondent <span class="SpellE">Ship­owners</span> is hereby DISMISSED, while
on the other hand, respondents' claim for moral damages are also dismissed for
want of jurisdiction together with other compen­satory <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>
for lack of sufficient sub­stantial proof thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the strike <span style="">declared on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="31" month="12"><span style="">December 31, 1959</span></st1:date><span style=""> is held illegal and unjustified, dismissal of all
the active participants thereof is hereby decreed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">consequence
thereof, permanent injunction is hereby granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For its implementation, respondent USUP,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
principal question to be determined, reso­lution of which will actually dispose
of the other in­cidental issues presented is:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Did the Court of Industrial Relations gravely abuse its discretion, as
claimed, in declaring the strike staged by the members of the USUP unjustified
and illegal?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
lower Court found that the strike staged by the USUP and the subsequent unfair
practice case it filed </span><span style="">against the respondent companies were the
culmination of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">series of drastic moves designed to compel respondents to recognize USUP </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">the employees'
collective bargaining agent to the exclusion of the Association with whom the <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span> had an existing collective bargaining
agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, they were the
direct offshoot of a losing effort to have the USUP recognized as the sole
collective bargaining agent of the employees, an effort which suffered legal
infirmities from its inception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A number
of circums­tances strongly support this finding:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">First,
it must be noted that USUP filed its Notice of Strike even before it received
the <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span>' answer to its set of demands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems that regardless of whether the <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span> would be willing to negotiate with USUP or not,
USUP was already predisposed to go on with the strike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There could only be one reason for USUP to
anticipate the <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span>' negative stand:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>USUP was aware of the existence of a valid
collective bargaining agreement between the <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span>
and the Association which would operate </span><span style="">as a </span><span style="">legal bar for the <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span>
to entertain <span class="SpellE">USUP's</span> demands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Knowing as it did that its demands could not
be entertained by the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Shipowners</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> USUP at that early stage could not have had any legitimate
excuse for seeking recognition as the sole collective bargaining agent of the
employees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Second,
in open contravention of the August 20 covenant, USUP completely disturbed and
impaired the <u>status</u> <u>quo</u> by going on strike pending resolution of
its </span><span style="">petition for </span><span style="">certification
election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <u>status</u> <u>quo</u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">referred expressly "to the normal and original operating
practices of loading, unloading departures, manning, and the performance of any
and/or all jobs incident to the businesses of the members of the said <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span> Association." By striking, USUP had
impaired or disturbed the existing collective bargaining agreement between the <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span> and the Association which recognized "the
right of the Employer to hire, promote and transfer and for legal cause
suspend, lay-off or discharge employees subject to the right of the union
(referring to the Association) to notification and to ask reconsideration of
any action of the Employer in the premises." It should be remembered in
this connection that those who took part in the strike and picketing were also
members of the Asso­ciation and hence were bound by the collective bargaining
agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In seeking to justify their
action, USUP asserts that the strike it staged was a matter of
"self-defense" and/or "union survival", claiming that the
respondent ship­ping companies were the first to violate the covenant to
preserve and observe the <u>status</u> <u>quo</u> by a concerted action in
sending out notices of dismissal or separation, all effective December 31, 1959
to the 64 USUP members.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It
is at least doubtful that the <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span> could have
violated the covenant of August 20 for the simple reason that it was <span class="GramE">not an active nor</span> a principal party thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u></span><span style=""> observed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Perusal of the covenant of August 20, 1959 evidently shows
that the fulfill­ment of all the commitments and faithful observance of all the
terms thereof fall upon the United Seamen's Union of the Philippines (USUP) and
the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Marine Association, who are the active and
principal parties thereto x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span>
Association never made any specific and categorical commitment ex­cept to, in
the language of the covenant, 'gladly give our conformity to the agree­ment of
both parties to observe and pre­serve the status quo on the above-mentioned
contract's operation and the commitment of the USUP to have the CIR determine
the issue of union representation'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
effect, the covenant <span style="">is </span>bilateral
and not tripar­tite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It imposes no
definite binding ob­ligation to the <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The burden lies heavily upon the USUP x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Even assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that the shipping companies were also bound
by the covenant, still the termination of services of the affected employees
could not be considered a violation of the covenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sustained by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>,
in specific cases, was the companies' contention that the dismissals made were
predicated on legitimate reasons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
hearing and receiving the exhaustive testimony and evidence of both sides, the
lower court ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Re:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ANGTIONG SONS</blockquote>

<blockquote>It <span style="">is </span>completely
established by the evidence that, with the exception of the crewmen of the
vessel MERCURY who received their termination notices on <st1:date year="1959" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1959</st1:date> due to sustained losses <span class="GramE">in the</span> opera­ting of the same, no tying up of the other
vessels nor dismissal of their respective crews were effected by respondent <span class="SpellE">Antiong</span> Sons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
respect to the MERCURY, it is very evident from the termination notice that it
was directed to the individual crewmen of the same, as members of the
(Association) and at the bottom thereof, it is noted that copies of the same
have been furnished the president of the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Marine
Association and the Department of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact and in law, therefore the laying off was directed to the crew­men
of MERCURY as members of the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Marine Association
and not <span style="">as </span>unionists of the
(USUP).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Association was the one
vitally affected for the mass laying-off of said crewmen with the substantial
reduction of its membership and the <span style="">respective collection of check-off dues, it should
have been the militant com­plaining party, had it been convinced that the total
laying-off of its members in the MERCURY was anti-union, unreasonable and
unjustified under the circumstances.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The decommissioning of the MERCURY followed by the announcement of
its sale and finally its disposal by purchase, fully negate complainant's
charge of unfair labor practice against respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can be cons­trued <span style="">as a legitimate </span>exercise of its rights and prerogative under the
'Management of Labor Force' provision of the collective bargaining agreement
dated <st1:date year="1957" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1957</st1:date>
between the <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span> and the Association providing
as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The operation and direction of working forces and the manage­ment
of the business shall be vested exclusively in the EMPLOYER, including the
right to hire, promote, and transfer and for legal cause, to suspend, lay-off
or discharge employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <st1:place>UNION</st1:place>
shall be notified in case of suspension, lay-off, or discharge of any of its
members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should the <st1:place>UNION</st1:place>
consider the suspension, lay-off or discharge un­lawful, it may seek
reconsideration <span style="">from the </span><span style="">EMPLOYER </span><span style="">and should the
latter maintain its stand, the matter maybe taken up with the court so vested
with jurisdiction to set­tle the <span class="GramE">controversy.</span>'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>PREMISES CONSIDERED<span class="GramE">,</span> complainant's
particular charges of unfair labor practice against <span class="SpellE">Antiong</span>
Sons are hereby dismissed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With
respect to Southern Navigation Company, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">found </span><span style="">that the strike declared against it was a
sympathy strike; that the crew and officers of the </span><span style="">EMPRESS OF DAVAO </span><span style="">and the ANHAI were
given termination notices because the company was dissolved after the death of
one of its principal partners; and that the cessation of the operation of the
two vessels was not motivated by any anti-union feeling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As in the <span class="SpellE">Angtiong</span>
case, the notice of termination was addressed not to the USUP but to the
Association, by virtue of the collective bargaining agreement with it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As
to </span><span style="">Vicente </span><span style="">Yu </span><span style="">Water Transportation, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
observed that "the contents of said </span><span style="">termination notices clearly state that the
planned cessation of operation (of the M/L WATSON and M/L RIZAL) x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span style="">are (sic) but temporary in character, aside
from the fact that said notices were addressed to all the crewmen and officers <span style="">as </span>members of the Association and not
of USUP." Accordingly, the same conclusion <span style="">as in </span>the above stated cases was reached.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With
respect to Joyce Enterprises, <span class="SpellE">Anglionto</span> </span><span style="">Sons &amp; Co., Garcia Water Transportation
and Garcia Navi­gation, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> correctly analyzed the
situation, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"If it was really true that respondents had any abiding
hostility against the USUP or any intention to bust the same by dismis­sing or
locking-out their respective personnel who joined said union, investiga­tion
should have been done after USUP sent its demand letter on August 4, 1959
manifesting its majority representation and requesting for recognition and
bargaining rights to negotiate for its items of demand contained therein, or
after it filed its Notice of Strike with the Regional Office of the Department
of Labor in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> on August 6, 1959, or, by natural
reaction the <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span> should have dismissed all
Association members (who were also USUP members) who refused to work on their
vessels from August 13, 1959, through the instigation of USUP, which was
charged of contempt of court for violating the Injunction order dated August
16, 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was the most oppor­tune
moment for the <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span> to rightly charge
Association members of violations violating their contractual duties and
obligations under the Collective Bargaining Agreement of <st1:date year="1957" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1957</st1:date> and of dismissing them without
notice and without recourse in the exercise of its managerial powers and pre­rogatives
under said contract and under the <span style="">law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In spite of such affront and clear
violation of their rights, none such reta­liatory acts were done by any of the
respon­dent <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
find no urgent reason to take issue with the conclusions reached by the court <u>a</u>
</span><u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style="">, </span><span style="">considering that petitioner does not now
question the veracity of the facts on which the conclusions are based.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Third,
the existence of a collective bargaining agreement should have been sufficient
to deter USUP from acts tending to force the issue of union recogni­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent provisions of said agreement
read:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"VI - GRIEVANCE AND HEARING COMMITTEE</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A 'Grievance Committee' shall be created, composed of three
(3) members of the UNION, one of wham shall be in the service of the EMPLOYER,
the names of whom shall be furnished to the said employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All <span class="GramE">grievance</span> of
UNION members in the ser­vice of the EMPLOYER shall be coursed through the
aforementioned grievance committee, which shall take up the same with a
'Hearing Committee' composed of three members to be chosen by the EMPLOYER.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Any grievance or dispute which can­not be settled by a
conference of both grievance and hearing <span class="GramE">committees,</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
employees concerned who after all were bound by the collective bargaining
agreement, as members of the Association, totally disregarded the procedure
laid down therein by immediately going on strike without coursing their

for the gulf and coastal towns of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
