				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Finding that only legal issues are involved in the instant case, the &nbsp;Court of Appeals certified the same to this Court for disposition. <p>Gilbert R. Brehm is an &nbsp;American citizen, serving &nbsp;the U.S. Navy with temporary assignment at Subic &nbsp;Bay. &nbsp;On October 9, 1958, he married Ester Mira, a Filipina citizen, who had &nbsp; a daughter Elizabeth, by another man, also &nbsp;of the &nbsp;American &nbsp;navy, who &nbsp;left the &nbsp;country &nbsp;in &nbsp;1952, and never &nbsp;heard from since then. &nbsp;After &nbsp;the &nbsp; marriage, the couple established residence at &nbsp;Intramuros, Manila, and the minor Elizabeth had always been under their care and support of Brehm.</p> <p>On January 28, 1959, the spouses &nbsp;filed a Joint Petition with the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court for the adoption of the minor Elizabeth, claiming that they have mutually given &nbsp; their consent to the &nbsp;adoption, not only &nbsp;to promote her best &nbsp;interest and &nbsp;well-being, but also to give her a legitimate status. &nbsp;They prayed that after the proper proceedings, &nbsp;judgment be entered, freeing the child Elizabeth Mira from &nbsp;all legal obligations of obedience and maintenance with respect &nbsp;to &nbsp;her natural father, and &nbsp;be, for all legal intents and purposes, &nbsp;the child of the petitioners, with all the rights &nbsp;pertinent thereto. </p> <p>An opposition to the petition with respect &nbsp;to &nbsp;Gilbert R. Brehm was registered by the Republic of the Philippines, it appearing that Brehm testified that his residence in the Philippines &nbsp;was merely &nbsp;temporary &nbsp;same being effective only for purposes of his tour of duty with the Navy, thus disqualifying him from making an adoption &nbsp;(Art. 335 [4], New Civil &nbsp;Code; &nbsp;Sec. 2, Rule 100, Rules of Court), and that being a non-resident alien, the Court has no jurisdiction over him.</p> <p>A reply to the opposition was presented by petitioners. They claim &nbsp;that Art335 does not apply in &nbsp;the case, reasoning out that it covers only adoptions for the purpose of establishing &nbsp;a relationship of paternity and filiation, where none &nbsp;existed, but &nbsp;not where &nbsp;the &nbsp;adopting parents are not total strangers to said child; that there is already a relation between the child and Brehm, created by affinity and that Art. 338 of the New Civil Code, &nbsp;expressly authorizes the adoption of a &nbsp;step-child by a step-father, in which category petitioner Brehm falls. &nbsp;Petitioners contend that the records show their residence in Manila, for while Brehm works at Subic, he always goes home to Manila, during week ends and manifested that he intends to reside in the Philippines &nbsp;permanently, after his tour &nbsp;of duty with the U.S. Naval &nbsp;Forces.</p> <p>The Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court &nbsp;rendered the pertinent portions of which read— </p> <blockquote> <p>" * * &nbsp;Since residence &nbsp;is principally a matter of &nbsp;intention, the Court is of the opinion &nbsp;that notwithstanding &nbsp;the &nbsp;nature &nbsp;of &nbsp;petitioner Gilbert &nbsp;R. &nbsp;Brehm's &nbsp;coming to the &nbsp;Philippines, his subsequent acts, coupled with his declared intention of permanently &nbsp;residing herein, &nbsp;have cured the legal defect on the point of &nbsp;residence.</p> <p>Finally, we &nbsp;must consider the status of the minor Elizabeth &nbsp;Mira whose welfare deserves paramount consideration. &nbsp;Being a natural child of the petitioning wife, it cannot be in conscience be expected that when petitioners married, the mother would reduce her responsibility &nbsp;and &nbsp;her affection toward her child. * * *</p> <p> Wherefore, finding that the principal allegations of the petitioners are true, it &nbsp;is hereby &nbsp;adjudged that henceforth the minor Elizabeth is freed from all obligations of obedience &nbsp; and maintenance &nbsp;with respect &nbsp;to her natural &nbsp;father, and &nbsp;is, to all legal intents and &nbsp;purposes, the child of the petitioners Gilbert R. &nbsp;Brehm and Ester Mira Brehm, &nbsp;said minor's surname being changed from 'Mira &nbsp;to 'Mira Brehm."</p> </blockquote> <p>The &nbsp;Solicitor General took exception from the judgment, claiming that it was error for the Court in &nbsp;adjudging the minor &nbsp;Elizabeth Mira the adopted child of petitioner &nbsp;Gilbert R. Brehm. &nbsp;The appeal, &nbsp;however, did &nbsp;not assail the right of petitioner Ester Mira Brehm, the natural mother of the &nbsp;minor, to adopt her.</p> <p>There is no &nbsp;question that petitioner Gilbert R. Brehm &nbsp;is a non-resident alien. &nbsp;&nbsp;By his own testimony, he supplied the &nbsp;conclusive &nbsp;proof of his &nbsp;status here, &nbsp;and &nbsp;no amount of reasoning will overcome the same. &nbsp;For this reason, he is not &nbsp;qualified to &nbsp;adopt. &nbsp;&nbsp;On this very point, we have recently &nbsp;declared— </p> <blockquote> <p>"The &nbsp;only issue in this &nbsp;appeal is &nbsp;whether or not being permanent residents in &nbsp;the Philippines, petitioners are qualified to adopt Baby Rose. &nbsp;Article &nbsp;335 of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Civil &nbsp;Code &nbsp;of the Philippines, provides that—</p> <p style="text-align: center;">* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p> <p>The following cannot adopt:<br>(4) Non-resident aliens</p> <p>This &nbsp;legal provision &nbsp;is too clear to &nbsp;require interpretation. &nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how much &nbsp;we may sympathize with the plight of Baby Rose and with the good intentions of &nbsp;petitioners herein, the law leaves us no &nbsp;choice but &nbsp;to apply its explicit terms, which unqualifiedly deny to petitioners the power to &nbsp;adopt anybody in the Philippines (Ellis and Ellis <span style="font-style: italic;">vs. </span>Republic, L-16922, &nbsp;April 30, 1963). </p> </blockquote> <p>Prior to the above decision, We have also denied petitions to adopt by persons similarly &nbsp;situated as petitioner Brehm. Thus, &nbsp;in the case of Caraballo <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> &nbsp;Republic, G. R. No. L-15080, April &nbsp;25, &nbsp;1962, giving &nbsp;some reasons &nbsp;why non- resident aliens are disqualified &nbsp;to &nbsp;adopt, We said— </p> <blockquote> <p>" * * . Looking after the &nbsp;welfare of &nbsp;a minor to &nbsp;be adopted, the law has surrounded him with safeguard to achieve and insure such welfare. &nbsp;It &nbsp;cannot &nbsp;be &nbsp;gainsaid &nbsp;that &nbsp;an &nbsp;adopted minor may &nbsp;be removed from the country by the adopter, who is not a &nbsp;resident of the Philippines, and placed beyond the &nbsp;reach and protection &nbsp;of the country of his birth." &nbsp;&nbsp;(See also &nbsp;S/Sgt. &nbsp;Katancik, <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Republic G.R. &nbsp;No. L-15472, &nbsp;June 20, 1962).</p> </blockquote> <p>This notwithstanding, petitioners press the argument that Brehm being now the step-father &nbsp;of the minor, &nbsp;he is qualified to adopt, in &nbsp;virtue of the provisions of par. 3, Art. 338, Civil Code, which states—</p> <blockquote> <p>"The following may &nbsp;be adopted:</p> <p>(1) &nbsp;The natural child, &nbsp;by the &nbsp;natural father</p> <p>(2) Other legitimate &nbsp;children, by the father or mother</p> <p>(3) A <i>step-child by the step-father or step-mother."</i></p> </blockquote> <p>We should construe, however, &nbsp;Article 338 &nbsp;in connection with Article 335. &nbsp;Art. &nbsp;335 &nbsp;clearly states &nbsp;that "The fol- lowing cannot adopt: &nbsp;* * * (4). Non-resident aliens". &nbsp;&nbsp; It is, therefore, mandatory, because it contains &nbsp;words &nbsp;of positive prohibition and is couched in the negative terms importing that the act required shall not &nbsp;be done &nbsp;other- wise &nbsp;than &nbsp;designated (50 Am. Jur. &nbsp;51). &nbsp;&nbsp;On &nbsp;the &nbsp;other hand, &nbsp;Art. &nbsp;338, &nbsp;provides "the following may be adopted: (3) a &nbsp;step-child, by the step-father or &nbsp;step-mother", which is merely directory, &nbsp;and &nbsp;which can only be given operation &nbsp;if the same &nbsp;does &nbsp;not &nbsp;&nbsp;conflict with the mandatory provisions &nbsp;of Art. &nbsp;335. &nbsp;Moreover, &nbsp;as &nbsp;heretofore &nbsp;been shown, &nbsp;it is Article 385 &nbsp;that confers jurisdiction to &nbsp;be court over the case, and before &nbsp;Article 338 may or can be availed of, such &nbsp;jurisdiction &nbsp;must first be established. We ruled out the adoption of a step-child by a step-father, when the latter has a legitimate child &nbsp;of his own &nbsp;(Ball <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Rep., 94 Phil., 106 50 Off. Gaz. p. 145; and McGee <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Rep., 94 Phil., 820).</p> <p>In view thereof, the decision &nbsp;appealed &nbsp;from, in so far as it affects the petitioner Gilbert R. Brehm, &nbsp;is hereby reversed, and his &nbsp;petition to adopt the &nbsp;child Elizabeth Mira, denied. &nbsp;Without costs.</p> <p><i>Bengzon, &nbsp;C. &nbsp;J., Padilla, Bautista &nbsp;Angelo, &nbsp;Concepcion, Barrera, Dizon, Regala</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.</i>&nbsp;concur.</p></div>
