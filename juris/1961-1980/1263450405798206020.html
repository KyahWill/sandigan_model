The said period was further suspended for thirty (30) days from October 23, 1974, pending completion of the agreement between the parties, which suspension was finally extended for twenty (20) days from November 22, 1974, by resolution dated November 25, 1974.<br><br>On December 4, 1974, or within the twenty-day extension period last granted by the resolution of November 25, 1974, both parties filed a motion dated December 3, 1974, submitting to this Court an agreement dated November 29, 1974, for the amicable settlement of this case (<i>Central Bank of the Philippines vs. Court of Appeals,</i> G.R.
