				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Hoilo declaring that 
the parcels of land in litigation are property of intervenor Jacoba Marbebe.
<p>This action was instituted by Ricardo, Patrocinia, Patria, Faustino, Leonor, 
Eamona, Asuncion, Emiliana, Arsenio and Felipe, all surnamed Lacerna, for the 
recovery of three parcels of unregistered lands, situated in the municipality of 
Maasin, Iloilo, and more specifically described in the complaint, upon the 
ground that said lands belonged to the deceased Juan Marbebe, and that his 
cousins, plaintiffs herein, are his sole heirs.</p>
<p>In her answer, defendant Agatona Vda. de Corcino alleged, <i>inter alia</i>, 
that Juan Marbebe might still be alive.; that she held the disputed lands, under 
a power of attorney executed by Juan Marbebe; and that, if he has died, she is 
entitled to succeed him in the same manner as plaintiffs herein, she being 
related to him in the same'manner as plaintiffs are.</p>
<p>With the court's permission, Jacoba Marbebe filed an answer in intervention 
alleging that she is a half sister of Juan Marbebe who died intestate, leaving 
neither ascendants nor descendants, and that, as his half sister, she is 
entitled, by succession, to the properties in dispute.</p>
<p>After due trial, the court rendered judgment for the intervenor. Hence, this 
appeal by the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>The lower court found, and appellants do not question, that the lands 
described in the complaint belonged originally to Bonifacia Lacerna. Upon her 
death in 1932, they passed, by succession, to her only son, Juan Marbebe who 
was, subsequently, taken to Culion, where he died intestate, single and without 
issue, on February 21, 1943. The question for determination is: Who shall 
succeed him?</p>
<p>It appears that his mother, Bonifacia Lacerna, had two (2) brothers, Catalino 
Lacerna and Marcelo Lacerna, and a sister, Agatona Paurillo Vda. de Corcino, the 
defendant herein; that Catalino Lacerna died in 1950 and was survived by his 
children, plaintiffs Ricardo, Patrocinia and Patria, all surnamed Lacerna; and 
that Marcelo Lacerna, who died in 1953, was survived by his children, the other 
plaintiffs herein, namely, Ramona, Faustino, Leonor, Asuncion, Emiliana, Arsenio 
and Felipe, all surnamed Lacerna. Upon the other hand, intervenor Jacoba Marbebe 
is a daughter, by first marriage, of Valentin Marbebe, husband of Bonifacia 
Lacerna and father of Juan Marbebe, who, accordingly, is a half brother of said 
intervenor.</p>
<p>With this factual background, the issue is narrowed down to whether Jacobo 
Marbebe, as half sister of Juan Marbebe, on his father's side, is hia sole heir, 
as held by his Honor, the Trial Judge, or whether plaintiffs herein, as first 
cousins of Juan Marbebe, on his mother side, have a better right to succeed him, 
to the exclusion of Jacoba Marbebe, as plaintiffs-appellants maintain.</p>
<p>The latter's pretense is based upon the theory that, pursuant to Article 891 
of the Civil Code of the Philippines, establishing what is known as "reserva 
troncal", the properties in dispute should pass to the heirs of the deceased 
within the third degree, <i>who belong to the line from which said properties 
came</i>, and that since the same were inherited by Juan Marbebe from his 
mother, they should go to his nearest relative' within the third degree <i>on 
the maternal line</i>, to which plaintiffs belong, not to intervenor, Jacoba 
Marbebe, despite the greater proximity of her relationship to the deceased, for 
she belongs to the <i>paternal line</i>.</p>
<p>Jacoba Marbebe contends, however, and the lower court held, that brothers and 
sisters exclude all other collateral relatives in the order of intestate 
succession, and that, as Juan Marbebe's half-sister, she has, accordingly, a 
better right than plaintiffs herein to inherit his properties.</p>
<p>The main flaw in appellants' theory is that it assumes that said properties 
are subject to the "reserva troncal", which is not a fact, for Article 891 of 
the Civil Code of the Philippines, provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The <i>ascendant</i> who inherits from his descendant any property which the 
latter may have acquired by gratuitous title from another ascendant, or a 
brother or sister, is obliged to reserve such property as he may have acquired 
by operation of law for the benefit of relatives who are within the third degree 
and who belong to the line from which said property came. " (Italics 
supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>This article applies only to properties inherited, under the conditions 
therein set forth, <i>by an ascendant from a descendant</i>, and this is not the 
case before us, for the lands in dispute were inherited <i>by a descendant</i>, 
Juan Marbebe, <i>from an ascendant</i>, his mother, Bonifacia Lacerna. Said 
legal provision is, therefore, not in point, and the transmission of the 
aforementioned lands, by inheritance, was properly determined by his Honor, the 
Trial Judge, in accordance with the order prescribed for intestate succession, 
particularly Article 1003 to 1009 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, pursuant 
to which a sister, even if only a half-sister, in the absence of other sisters 
or brothers, or of children of brothers or sisters, excludes all other 
collateral relatives, regardless of whether or not the latter belong to the line 
from which the property of the deceased came.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against 
plaintiffs-appellants. It is so ordered.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista 
Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes,</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.,</em> 
concur.</div>
