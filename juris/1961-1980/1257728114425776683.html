				<H3>MADRIGAL SHIPPING CO., PETITIONER, VS. MONICA MELAD, FRANCISCA SICCUAN, JUANA SICCUAN, BARBARA TULIAO, PLACIDA DE LA CRUZ, APARRI PILOT'S ASSOCIATION AND WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>REGALA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The S.S. "Cetus" was owned and operated by petitioner Madrigal Shipping Co., 
Inc. On November 25, 1955, it left the port of Aparri for Manila. However, after 
sailing five miles, the officers of the ship decided to return to the port of 
Aparri for repair of its rudder. For this purpose, the Captain sent Jua Siong 
Kong Ho, Inc., the ship's agent in Aparri, a telegram with instruction to 
"PLEASE ADVISE PILOT WILL ENTER AGAIN FOR RUDDER REPAIR."</p>
<p>Accordingly, the agent informed the Aparri Pilots' Association of the 
contents of the telegram and, forthwith, Primitivo Siccuan, chief pilot, and 
Francisco Ricerra, Ricerra; district pilot, of pilots association, made 
arrangements with Filoteo Siccuah and Domingo Batta to take them by&nbsp; boat to 
the ship in distress. </p>
<p>The party reached the ship about past 12 midnight of Novemoer 25. Primitivo 
Siccuan, Francisco Ricerra and Filoteo Siccuan boarded the ship while Domingo 
Batta remained on the boat. At about 2:30 a.m., November 26, the ship sank on 
account of heavy waves. The boat was also lost. Among those who perished in the 
tragedy were Primitivo Siccuan, Francisco Ricerra, Filoteo Siccuan and Domingo 
Batta. </p>
<p>In due time, four claims were filed in the Workmen's Compensation Commission 
against petitioner. Upon the creation by Reorganization Plan 20~A of. Regional 
Offices in the Department of Labor, these cases were transferred to Regional 
Office No. 2, which, after hearing, made an award ordering petitioner to pay the 
claimants the following : </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. To the heirs and dependents of decedent FRANCISCO RICERRA, the sum of 
FOUR THOUSAND PESOS (P4,000,00), the maximum amount allowed by law, which should 
be divided among them; .</p>
<p>"2. To the heirs and dependents of decedent FILOTEO SICCUAN, the sum of 
FOUR THOUSAND PESOS (P4,000.00), the maximum amount allowed by law, which 
should be divided among them; </p>
<p>"3. To the heirs and dependents of decedent PRIMITIVO SICCUAN, the sum FOUR THOUSAND PESOS (P4,000.00), the maximum amount allowed by law, which should bo 
divided among them; <br></p>
<p>"4. To the widow and dependent of decedent DOMINGO BATTA, the sum of ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PESOS AND TWELVE CENTAVOS (P1,725.12), 
which includes burial expenses. </p>
<p>"5. To this office, the sum of One Hundred Forty-One Pesos Only (P141.00), 
pursuant to Section 55 of said Act." </p></blockquote>
<p>This award was affirmed by Associate Commissioner Jose Sanchez and later by 
the Workmen's, Compensation Commission sitting <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc. </span>Hence, this petition for 
review, petitioner contending in seven assignments of errors: </p>
<p>1. That the hearing officer of Regional Office No. 2 had no jurisdiction to 
decide these cases; </p>
<p>2. That there was no employer-employee relationship between it (petitioner) 
and the persons for whose death these claims were filed; and </p>
<p>3. That some of the respondents were not the depend­ents of Primitivo Siccuan 
and Domingo Batta, as the term dependents is used in the law. </p>
<p>With regard to the first point, petitioner argues that Reorganization Plan 
20-A, which confers jurisdiction to hear workmen's compensation claims on 
Regional Offices of the Department of Labor, is unconstitutional. </p>
<p>The contention is without merit. As this Court held in San Miguel Brewery, 
Inc. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Sobremesana, et al., G.R. No. L-18730, September 16, 1961, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Petitioner argues incorrectly that our previous rulings (Corominas <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Labor 
Standards Commission, G.R. No. L-14837, and related cases decided June 20, 1961) 
held null and void Reorganization Plan 20-A in so far as it vests the Regional 
Offices of the Department of Labor with original and exclusive jurisdiction to 
try and decide labor claims <span style="font-style: italic;">including worhnen's compensation claims. </span>This Court 
never ruled that the Regional Offices have no authority to pass upon workmen's 
compensation claims under Plan 20-A; on the contrary, in our decisions in the 
ease of Miller <span style="font-style: italic;">vs. </span>Mardo, G. R. No. L-15138, and related cases, promulgated on 
July 31, 1961, we said:</p>
<p>"On the basis of the foregoing consideration, we hold and declare that 
Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, insofar as it confers judicial power to the 
Regional Offices over cases other than those falling under the Workmen's 
Compensation Law, is invalid and of no effect. (Italics supplied) </p>
<p>"The reason for the ruling is that, as pointed out. in the same cases, the 
consideration and adjudication of claims under the Work­men's Compensation Law 
was already being exercised by the Department of Labor's Compensation Commission 
even prior to its reorganization under Plan 20-A. In conferring initial power to 
hear and decide such claims upon the hearing officers of the Department's 
Regional Offices, section 25 of Plan 20-A was merely reallocating powers already 
possessed by the Department, and was in conformity with the authority granted by 
section 6 of Republic Act 997 aa amended by Republic Act No. 1241. There was in 
the particular case no assumption of powers not previously vested in the 
Department, and, therefore, no transgression of the reorganizational authority 
and purposes of the enabling laws."</p></blockquote>
<p>This ruling was reiterated in later cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <br></p><p>Anent the second point, Section 2 of the 
Workmen's Compensation Law (Act No. 3428, as amended) provides: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When an employee suffers personal injury from any accident arising out of 
and in the course of his employment, or contracts tuberculosis or other illness 
dicectly caused by such employment, or either aggravated by or the result of 
the nature of such employment, his employer shall pay compensation in the sums 
and to the person hereinafter specified. * * *." </p></blockquote>
<p>As may be noted from the above-quoted provision, the existence of 
employer-employee relationship is the jurisdictional foundation for recovery 
under the law. (Asia Steel Corp. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> 
Workmen's Compensation Commission, et al., G. R. No. L-7638, June 27, 1955). 
Hence, the question is: Was there such a relationship between petitioner, on 
the one hand, and Primitivo Siccuan, Francisco Ricerra, Filoteo Siccuan and 
Domingo Batta, on the other? Petitioner contends that there was none for the 
following reasons: </p>
<p>1. Because its pilotage contract was with the Aparri Pilots' Association 
and.not with the members thereof; </p>
<p>2. Because the salaries of the pilots were paid not by petitioner but by the 
association; </p>
<p>3. Because petitioner had no control over the action of the chief pilot and 
district pilot; and </p>
<p>4. Because the services of Filoteo Siccuan and Domingo Batta were contracted 
by the pilots' association and not by the petitioner. </p>
<p>Petitioner's claim lacks merit. As pointed out by the Workmen's Compensation 
Commission, Primitivo Siccuan and Francisco Ricerra were members of the Aparri 
Pilots' Association not its employees. While it is true that their salaries were 
paid by the association, yet it is equally true that the same were taken out of 
the pilotage fees paid by the vessels. The pilots' association cannot be 
con­sidered an independent contractor so as to free the petitioner from the 
liability of an employer because it appears to have neither capital nor money to 
pay its employees nor does it appear to have filed a bond.. (Madrigal Shipping 
Co., Inc. vs. Workmen's Compensation Com­mission, et al., G. R. No. L-17395, 
June 29, 1962; Caro vs. Rilloraza, et al., 102 Phil., 61.)</p>
<p>The claim that petitioner had no right of control over the work of the pilots 
is based on Customs Administrative Order No. 26 (Nov. 28, 1946) which provides 
as follows: </p>
<p>"Par. XLIII. A pilot shall be held responsible for the direction of a vessel 
from the time he assumes control thereof until he leaves it anchored free from 
shoal; <em>Provided,</em> <em>That his responsibility shall cease at the moment 
the master neglects or refuses to carry his instruction" </em>(Italic ours)</p>
<p>Petitioner misreads the provision in question, for while it says that a pilot 
is responsible for the direction of the vessel from the moment he assumes 
control of the same, the provision nevertheless makes the conduct of the pilot 
subject to approval by the master of the vessel. That is why it relieves the 
pilot of responsibility if his action is disapproved by the master of the 
vessel.</p>
<p>Besides, as the Commission held Customs Administrative Order No. 69 (Oct 1, 
1948), likewise invoked by petitioner, shows that coast pilots are employed by 
the vessels needing their services. Thus, it provides:<br>
</p><blockquote>"Any vessel <em>employing</em>, a coast pilot between pilotage 
districts shall pay the prescribed compulsory or optional pilotage fee lo the 
pilots' association within whose jurisdictional waters any part of said 
service may be rendered and any vessel <span style="font-style: italic;">employing</span> a district pilot from one 
pilotage district to another in addition to the payment provided for in 
paragraph II, shall pay to the association in the district or in which such 
vessel is piloted, the compulsory pilot­age fee provided for said district." 
(Italics ours) </blockquote>
<p>In some respects, this case. is similar to the case of Martha Lumber Mill, 
Inc. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Lagradante, et al., 99 Phil. 434; 52 Off.. Gaz., No. 9, 4230. In the 
latter case, the deceased was appointed by the Department of Agriculture and 
Natural Resources pursuant to the following provisions of Forestry 
Administrative Order No. 11 (Sept. 11, 1934) : <br>
</p><blockquote>"34(s) Within thirty (30) days from the date of the issuance of a 
license, and after the terms and conditions of said license had been duly 
accepted in their entirety by the license concerned, at least one concession 
guard, if so required in the license, shall be employed by said licenses. The 
name and address of the concession guard so employed shall be reported to the 
local forest office under whose jurisdiction the license area falls. The 
concession guard, whose salary will be paid him directly by the licensee, 
<em>shall from time to time, report to the herein mentioned forest officer for 
instruction regarding his duties and obligations</em> to patrol and cooperate 
with the government in the protection of the area of the licensee employing him" 
</blockquote>
<p>His appointment by the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources and his 
being under the supervision and control of that department notwithstanding, this 
Court held the Concession guard to be an employee of licensee. <br></p><p>Petitioner also 
argues that, even assuming that Primitivo Siccuan and Francisco Ricerra were its 
employees within the purview of the law, yet the same cannot be said of Filoteo 
Siccuan and Domingo Batta, sounder and carsman, respectively, because these two 
were employed not by petitioner but by the pilots' association. But it is a 
fact that the services of the two were needed so that the pilots could be 
taken to the S.S. "Cetus." It is well settled that a person who is asked for 
help in an emergency which threatens the employer's interests becomes an 
employee under an implied, contract of hire. (I Larson, Workmen's Compensation 
Law, sec. 47.42 (c) 699; I Schneider, Workmen's Compensation Text, sec. 234, 
627) Here, as stated in the beginning, the S.S. "Cetus" had to return to port 
for a needed repair of ite rudder. Losing no time, the pilots engaged the 
services of Filoteo Siccuan and Domingo Batta to take them to the ship in 
trouble. It is under these circumstances that We held the sounder and the 
oarsman to be employees of the petitioner.<br></p>
<p>Viewing from another point the relationship of the petitioner with the 
victims, We hold that even granting that the Aparri Pilots' Association was an 
independent contractor and that the deceased were its employees, still the 
result would be the same. Section 39 of the Work­men's Compensation Act provides 
in part: <br><br>"In this Act, unless the context indicates otherwise, the 
definition of various words used therein shall be as follows: <br><br>(a) 
'Employer' includes every person or association of persons, incorporated or not, 
public or private, and the legal representative of the deceased employer. It 
includes the owner or lessee of a factory or establishment or place of work at 
any other person who is virtually the owner or manager of the business carried 
on in the establishment or place of work <span style="font-style: italic;">but who, for the reason that there is 
an independent contractor in the same, or for any other reason, is not the direct 
employer of laborers employed there.</span><br><br>(b) 'Laborer' is used as a synonym 
of 'Employee' and means every person who has entered the employment of, or 
works under a service or apprenticeship contract for an employer. It does not 
include a person whose employment is purely casual and is not for the purposes 
of the occupation or business of the employer. Any refeience to a laborer 
injured shall, in case he dies, include a ref­erence to the person dependent on 
him, as defined in this Act, if the context so requires, or, if the employee is 
a minor or incapacitated, to his guardian ot nearest of kin. * * 
*"<br><br>Construing this provision, We held in De los Santos <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Javier, 58 
Phil., 82; that although the owner of the factory is not the direct employer of 
the laborers employed therein because there is an independent contractor in the 
factor, the owner of the factory is nevertheless to be considered for the 
purposes of the law as the employer of the laborers working under the 
independent contractor, as long as the work is for the purposes of the business 
of the owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Certainly, the 
pilotage of the ship so that it could enter poit for necessary repair was in the 
usual course of the business of the petitioner in the same way that the repair 
of the window railing of a building intended for rent (Caro vs. Rilloraza, et 
al., 102 Phil., 61) and the construction of a mezzanine floor of a hotel 
(Shellborne Hotel <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> de Leon, G. R. No. L-9149, May 31, 1957) have been 
held for the purpose of the owner's business.<br><br>Our conclusion upon this 
point is in accord with the doctrine that the Workmen's. Compensation Law should 
be construed fairly, reasonably, or liberally in favor of and for the benefit of 
employees and their dependents and all doubt as to right of compensation 
resolved in their favor and all presumption indulged in their favor. (Caro vs. 
Rilloraza, et al., 102, Phil., 61; Francisco <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Consing, 63 Phil., 354)</p>
<p>And now We come to the last point. It is contended that the claimants of 
Primitivo Siccuan, who are his children, have all reached the age of 18 and 
therefore cannot be considered dependents under Section 9. But We find that the 
Commission modified the decision of the hearing officer and instead gave the 
award to Primitivo Siccuan's grandchildren to whom the Commission directed the 
amount of P4,0000.00, to be divided equally. The Commission's finding that the 
grandchildren were dependent on Primitivo Siccuan is one of fact which We will 
not review unless shown to be without support in evidence.<br><br>Petitioner 
does not explain in what way proof of respondent Placida de la Cruz' marriage to 
Domingo Batta is not satisfactory. The same goes with respect to the claim that 
there is no evidence as to the amount of wages of the deceased. Hence We shall 
not pass upon these points. <br><br>Wherefore, the decision of the Workmen's 
Compensation Commission is affirmed, with costs against 
petitioner.<br><br><em>Bengzon, C. J, Padilla, Bautista Angela, Concepcion, 
Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, </em>and<em> Makalintal, JJ.,
