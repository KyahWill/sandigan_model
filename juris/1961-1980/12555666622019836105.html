				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental, in its Civil Case No. 
1701, had rendered, on 30 July 1955, judgment in favor of Emigdio C. Serna, 
party plaintiff, and against defendants Gonzalo del Rosario, Eleuterio Aguirre, 
and Philippine Engineering Corporation, sentencing the latter as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"Wherefore, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the 
defendants to pay to the plaintiff the amount of totalling P6,657.35 including 
P16.00 his unpaid traveling expenses, moral damages in the amount of P3,000.00 
and attorney's fees in the amount of P2,000.00 plus interest of 6% from the date 
the complaint was filed until the full amount of the judgment is satisfied, and 
to pay the costs." (Petition Annex D, p. 5)</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon appeal by the defendants, the Court of Appeals, in case CA-No. 16617-R, 
by decision promulgated 13 April 1950, affirmed <i>in toto</i> the judgment of 
said Court of First Instance. The award having become final, the records were 
remanded to the court below for execution. A writ of execution was issued by the 
clerk of the court of origin forâ€”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The total amount of P6,637.35 plus P16.00 plus P3,000.00 as moral damages, 
and the further sum of P2,000.00 as attorney's fees with 6% per annum interest 
on the principal of P6,637.35 from the date of the filing of the complaint on 
October 28, 1954 up to the present."</p></blockquote>
<p>Defendants moved for amendment of this writ of execution on the ground that 
the same was not in conformity with the judgment in that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The principal sum of P6,637.35 already included the traveling 
expenses, damages, and attorney's fees;</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The interest of 6% should not be computed on the damages and 
attorney's fees; and</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) The interest should be deemed due only from the date of the 
amended complaint, not from that of the original pleading.</p></blockquote>
<p>After hearing, the Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental allowed the 
First amendment sought, but denied the two others. Reconsideration having been 
refused, defendants resorted to this Court, petitioning for <em>certiorari 
</em>on the ground of abuse of discretion in the refusal to exclude interest on 
the damages and counsel fees, and in computing it from the date of the original 
complaint instead of the amended one.</p>
<p>We find the petition untenable. The rule is firmly established that as 
between the same parties, on the same subject matter and causes of action, a 
final valid judgment is conclusive not only on the issues actually determined by 
the decision, but on all issues that could have been raised and litigated in the 
anterior suit (PNB vs. Barretto, 52 Phil. 818, 824; San Diego vs. Cardona, 70 
Phil. 281; Miranda vs. Tiangco, 96 Phil., 526). The petitioners herein 
(originally defendants in the preceding action) felt rightly aggrieved by the 
allowance of interest on the moral damages and attorneys' fees made by the 
Misamis Court of First Instance in its Civil Case No. 1701; but the proper 
remedy was to ask for the amendment of the judgment in the manner now urged, and 
in case of refusal, to appeal the issue to the higher courts. The defendants 
below failed to make use of this remedy, and instead allowed the decision to 
become final and executory. It is now too late for them to seek a modification 
of the judgment at its execution stage.</p>
<p>The <em>res judicata</em> rule likewise bars the second claim of petitioner 
that interest be computed from the filing of the amended complaint, since the 
final decision specifically declares the complaint of October 28, 1954 to be the 
start of the running of interest. In addition, the records show that the amended 
complaint merely amplified the items of damage asked by plaintiff, and did not 
introduce any new cause of action, so that the amended claim relates back to the 
original (Guazo vs. Ramirez, 32 Phil. 492). Hence, interest should properly 
start from the filing of the original pleading.</p>
<p>We may further note that by their previous appeals and motions, the 
petitioners have managed to'stave off the payment of a claim that was due since 
1955 to respondent herein, whose wife, in addition, appears to have been 
desperately ill. We can not, in all equity, say now that the decision of the 
Court of First Instance was in abuse of discretion.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the petition is dismissed, with costs against petitioners.</p> <em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, 
Paredes, Dizon, Regala, </em>and <em>Makalintal JJ., </em>concur.</div>
