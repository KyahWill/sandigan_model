				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a proceeding for the correction of certain alleged errors in 
petitioners' entries of birth. The petition alleges in substance that the 
petitioners, Lily, William, Sober, Manuel, Mercy, Alven, Eve and Joy, all 
surnamed Bantoto Coo, are minor children of Coo Ak <i>alias</i> Coo Siong Chi, a 
Chinese citizen, single, and Bernardina Bantoto, a Filipina, single; that said 
petitioners were all born in the province of Negros Oriental, the first, in 
Siaton and the rest in Dumaguete, out of the union without benefit of marriage 
between said Coo Ak <i>alias</i> Coo Siong Chi and Bernardina Bantoto who were 
both single and without any impediment to get married at the time of the 
former's conceptions and births; that notwithstanding these facts, in the 
respective entries of their births there have been committed errors as regards, 
among others, their civil status and citizenship, as well as the civil status 
and citizenship of their natural parents, which should be corrected.
<p>Hearing on the petition was ordered published in a newspaper of general 
circulation in the: province and notice thereof was served on the Solicitor 
General, the City Attorney of Dumaguete City, and the Civil Registrars of Siaton 
and Dumaguete City. Under date of April 6, 1956, the Provincial Fiscal of Negros 
Oriental appeared, and in the name of the Republic of the Philippines opposed 
the petition, on the ground that the corrections of the alleged mistakes in 
petitioners' entries of birth herein sought cannot be ordered in this proceeding 
for they are not clerical in nature but affect the civil status and citizenship 
of the petitioners, whose corrections could only be effected under proper 
proceedings. After trial, the lower court issued an order granting the petition. 
From this order, the oppositor, Republic of the Philippines appealed.</p>
<p>The evidence shows that the petitioners, Lily, William, Sober, Manuel, Mercy, 
Alvin, Eve and Joy, all surnamed Bantoto Coo, were the illegitimate children of 
Coo Ak <i>alias</i> Coo Siong Chi, a Chinese citizen, and Bernardina Bantoto, a 
Filipina, who since the year 1934 had been living together as husband and wife 
without the benefit of marriage in the province of Negros Oriental. Lily was 
born in Siaton, Negros Oriental, on February 20, 1937, and the registry of her 
birth in the local civil register shows that her name is Lily Bantoto, and that 
she is the daughter of Bernardina Bantoto (Exhibit B); William was born on March 
12, 1939 in Dumaguete, Negros Oriental, and his certificate of birth shows that 
he is a legitimate child of Juan Koo, Chinese, married, and Benardina Bantoto, 
Filipina, married (Exhibit C); Sober was born in Dumaguete, Negros Oriental, on 
December 18, 1940, and her birth certificate shows that she is of Chinese 
citizenship, a legitimate child of Juan Co, Chinese, married, and Bernardina 
Bantoto, Filipina, married (Exhibit D); Manuel was born in Dumaguete, Negros 
Oriental, and his certificate of birth shows that he is a legitimate child of 
Juan Co, Chinese, and Benardina Bantoto, Filipina (Exhibit E); Mercy was born in 
Dumaguete, Negros Oriental, on August 6, 1945, and her certificate of birth 
shows that she is of Chinese nationality and an illegitimate child of Coo Ak, 
Chinese, single, and Benardina Bantoto, Filipina, single (Exhibit F); Alven was 
born in Dumaguete, Negros Oriental, on April 18, 1948, and his certificate of 
birth shows that he is of Chinese nationality and a legitimate child of Coo 
Siong Chi, Chinese, married, and Bernardina Bantoto, Chinese, married (Exhibit 
G); Eve was born in Dumaguete, Negros Oriental, on November 30, 1950, and her 
certificate of birth shows that she is a legitimate child of Coo Ak, Chinese, 
married, and Bernardina Bantoto, Filipina, married (Exhibit H); and Joy was born 
in Dumaguete, Negros Oriental, on September 12, 1952, and her certificate of 
birth shows that she is of Filipino nationality, and an illegitimate child of 
Coo Ak, a Chinese citizen, single, and Bernardina Bantoto, single, a Filipina 
(Exhibit J).</p>
<p>The main question for determination in this appeal is whether or not in a 
proceeding brought under the provisions of Article 412 of the new Civil Code, 
corrections that may affect the civil status of a person, or his nationality or 
citizenship, may be made in the entry of birth of said person in the 
corresponding civil register.</p>
<p>Defining the scope of the proceeding contemplated in Article 412 of the new 
Civil Code, this Court, in two recent decisions (Ty Kong Tin <i>vs</i>. Republic 
of the Philippines, 94 Phil., 321; 50 Off. Gaz., 1077 and Ansaldo <i>vs</i>. 
Republic of the Philippines, 102 Phil., 1046), held that the proceeding 
contemplated in said article is summary in nature and merely embraces 
corrections of mistakes that are clerical in nature and does not include such 
controversial issues as those that may affect the civil status or the 
nationality or citizenship of a person. In the Ty Kong Tin case (<i>supra</i>), 
it was held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After a mature deliberation, the opinion was reached that what was 
contemplated therein are mere corrections of mistakes that are clerical in 
nature and not those that may affect the civil status or the nationality or 
citizenship of the person involved. If the purpose of the petition is merely to 
correct a clerical error then the court may issue an order in order that the 
error or mistake may be corrected. If it refers to a substantial change, which 
affects the status or citizenship of a party, the matter should be threshed out 
in a proper action depending upon the nature of the issue involved. Such action 
can be found at random in our substantive and remedial laws the implementation 
of which will naturally depend upon the factors and circumstances that might 
arise affecting the interested parties. This opinion is predicated upon the 
theory that the procedure contemplated in article 412 is summary in nature which 
cannot cover cases involving controversial issues."</p></blockquote>
<p>and in the Ansaldo case (<i>supra</i>), the Court said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For the information of the parties concerned, and for the guidance of the 
public in general, we may venture the opinion that the clerical errors which 
might be corrected through judicial sanction under Article 412 of the New Civil 
Code, would be those harmless and innocuous changes, such as, correction of a 
name that is clearly misspelled, occupation of the parents, etc.; but for 
changes involving the civil status of the parents, their nationality or 
citizenship, these are grave and important matters which may have a bearing and 
effect on the citizenship and nationality not only of said parents, but of the 
offsprings, and to seek said changes, it is necessary to file a proper suit 
wherein not only the State, but also all parties concerned and affected should 
be made parties defendants or respondents, and evidence should be submitted, 
either to support the allegations of the petition or complaint, or also to 
disprove the same so that any order or decision in the case may be made with due 
process of law and on the basis of facts proven. Then and only then may the 
change or changes be made in the entry in a civil register that will affect or 
even determine conclusively the citizenship or nationality of a person therein 
involved."</p></blockquote>
<p>The instant case is governed by the above rule. The mistakes in the entries 
in the civil registers, whose correction is sought by the petitioners and which 
was ordered by the trial court, do not merely embrace clerical errors but 
involve controversial matters that concern the citizenship and civil status not 
only of the petitioners but also of their parents. It is true that the evidence 
shows that the petitioners were all born in the province of Negros Oriental, and 
that they were the illegitimate children of Coo Ak <i>alias</i> Coo Siong Chi, a 
Chinese citizen, and Bernardina Bantoto, a Filipino citizen, who were both 
single at the time of their conceptions and births, from which it may be 
presumed that mistakes concerning their nationality and civil status as well as 
the civil status and nationality of their parents have been made in the entries 
of their respective births in the local civil registers. These, however, are 
controversial matters which should be threshed out in appropriate actions. They 
cannot be threshed out in the instant proceeding which is summary in nature, a 
condition which was not changed by the fact that the hearing of the petition was 
published and notice thereof was served on the State.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order appealed from is reversed, and another is hereby entered 
dismissing the instant proceeding, without any special pronouncement as to 
costs.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, 
Reyes, J.B.L., Paredes, Dizon,</i> and <i>De Leon, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
