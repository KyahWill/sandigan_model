of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>, in its Criminal Case No. 4577, convicting
them of three (3) murders, qualified by abuse of superior strength, committed
in the persons of the brothers Elias, <span class="SpellE">Renerio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Galicano</span> <span class="SpellE">Espenilla</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In each case, the Court sentenced all the accused-appellants to
life imprisonment (<u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u>), with
all accessory penalties prescribed by law, except as to appellant Juan <span class="SpellE">Bartolay</span> whom the Court gave the benefit of the mitigating
circumstance of voluntary surrender, and imposed only a minimum of 10 years and
1 day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u> mayor</u> and a maximum of
20 years of <u>reclusion temporal</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;

victims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case against <span class="SpellE">Supremo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolay</span>, also accused

<p class="BODY">Juan <span class="SpellE">Bartolay's</span> statement laid the
blame on his brother <span class="SpellE">Supremo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolay</span>
(Exhibit Folder, page 3) and the latter confessed to the killing of the <span class="SpellE">Espenilla</span> brothers in the statement Exhibit "2"
(Exhibit Folder, page 10).</p>

<p class="BODY">The version of the prosecution as to the circumstances
surrounding the fight that ensued following the drinking spree and culminating
in the triple-death tragedy varies from that presented by the defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to <span class="SpellE">Urcosino</span> <span class="SpellE">Baconawa</span>, the lone eyewitness for the pro­secution who testified
on said circumstances, the three <span class="SpellE">Espenilla</span> brothers
arrived at Juan <span class="SpellE">Barlolay's</span> house at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="14">2:30 p.m.</st1:time> and were given food and drinks
(tuba).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Galicano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Espenilla</span> burst into song and when he finished Carlos
<span class="SpellE">Pejo</span> challenged Elias <span class="SpellE">Espenilla</span>,
asking "Are you the brave one?" Elias gave a negative answer and went
down the house; but he was met by Carlos <span class="SpellE">Pejo</span>, who
stabbed Elias on the left breast with a dagger (Exhibit "C").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, the five <span class="SpellE">Bartolays</span>,
bearing clubs, with <span class="SpellE">Periolo</span> <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>,
armed with a bolo, simultaneously fell upon Elias and attacked him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On seeing this, Elias' brothers, <span class="SpellE">Renerio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Galicano</span> <span class="SpellE">Espenilla</span>, went to his aid, but the five <span class="SpellE">Bartolays</span>, with <span class="SpellE">Pejo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>, pounced together upon <span class="SpellE">Renerio</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Galicano</span> and killed them (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
<st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="9">7 September 1964</st1:date>, pages
15-19).</p>

<p class="BODY">Juan <span class="SpellE">Bartolay</span> and his brother in law,
Carlos <span class="SpellE">Pejo</span>, testified that during the baptismal
party, Juan was passing tuba around to the guests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Elias <span class="SpellE">Espenilla</span>
objected to Carlos <span class="SpellE">Pejo</span> (who cooked the food)
drinking ahead of <span class="SpellE">Periolo</span> <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>,
but disregarding the objection, Carlos drank the tuba anyway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Forthwith, Elias boxed Carlos in the
face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the latter, he was
first challenged by Elias, who asked Carlos if Carlos was the brave one from <span class="SpellE">Bagacay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Carlos
denied it, his face was struck by Elias.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Juan tried to pacify them, and made the two shake hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Elias then pressed hard the hand of Carlos,
and when the latter protested he was boxed a second time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Carlos jumped out of a window; but <span class="SpellE">Renerio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Galicano</span> <span class="SpellE">Espenilla</span> went down and struck the fugitive, causing him to
fall un­conscious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Juan followed and
stabbed Elias a number of times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
Elias' two brothers tried to retaliate, they were hacked by <span class="SpellE">Supremo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bartolay</span>, while Carlos <span class="SpellE">Pejo</span>
struck <span class="SpellE">Renerio</span> <span class="SpellE">Espenilla</span>
with a piece of wood (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., 10 May 1968, pages
39-43; 22 May 1968, pages 4-15).</p>

<p class="BODY">Juan <span class="SpellE">Bartolay</span> further testified that
the prosecution's lone eyewitness <span class="SpellE">Baconawa</span> had run
away when Juan stabbed Elias <span class="SpellE">Espenilla</span>; that Jesus, <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolay</span> had not attended the baptismal party, and that the
brothers <span class="SpellE">Espenilla</span> were known trouble makers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These as­sertions appear <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The brothers Jesus, <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolay</span> all denied
attending Juan's baptismal party, having stayed at their respective dwellings
some six (6) kilometers away from <span class="SpellE">Cametobetohan</span> (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="5">22 May
 1968</st1:date>, pages 15-18; 18-25; 26-31).</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with counsel <u>de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span></u>
that it was error for the lower court to have accepted unqualifiedly the
version of the lone eyewitness for the prosecution, <span class="SpellE">Urcosino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Baconawa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
declaration that Carlos <span class="SpellE">Pejo</span> insultingly challenged
Elias <span class="SpellE">Espenilla</span> appears contrary to the customary
hospitality of Filipinos:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the <span class="SpellE">Espenilla</span> brothers had been invited, not by the <span class="SpellE">Bartolays</span> but by the baptismal sponsor, <span class="SpellE">Justina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Almeñana</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pejo</span> had no
reason to provoke a guest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
regard, the defense version of the challenge incident appears more
probable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Baconawa's</span>
assertion that all seven (7) accused jointly attacked and slew the three <span class="SpellE">Espenilla</span> brothers is not credible, and is seriously
infirmed by the autopsy findings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Baconawa</span> declared that <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> and Jesus <span class="SpellE">Bartolay</span>
were armed with clubs; hence they could not have contributed to the death of
Elias <span class="SpellE">Espenilla</span> who died of stab and incised wounds,
without suffering any contusions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, <span class="SpellE">Renerio</span> <span class="SpellE">Espenilla</span>,
who suffered only one contusion in the temple, besides stab wounds, could not
have been set upon and hit by the three <span class="SpellE">Bartolays</span> who
were armed with clubs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At most, one of
these three could have hit <span class="SpellE">Renerio</span>, but the evidence
fails to disclose who of the three hit him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant Carlos <span class="SpellE">Pejo</span> also admitted that he
clubbed <span class="SpellE">Renerio</span> (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="5">22 May 1968</st1:date>, page 8).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, <span class="SpellE">Galicano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Espenilla's</span> corpse exhibited only two contusions, one
in the head and one in the chest, so that, at the most only two (assuming one blow
for each assailant) could have caused the contused injuries, but again the
record is blank to which the three <span class="SpellE">Bartolay’s</span>
above-named could have been the culprit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <u>alibis</u> of Jesus, <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolay</span> are
supported by the testimony of Juan <span class="SpellE">Bartolay</span> that the
said three of his brothers had not been at his house on the fatal day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While weak in themselves, yet when coupled
with the improbabilities and uncertainties of the prosecution evidence and the
absence of adequate roof of conspiracy, the <u>alibis</u> suffice to raise
reasonable doubts as to the responsibility of the three above-named
appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In People vs. <span class="SpellE">Fraga</span>, G.R. No. L-12005, 31 August 1960, 109 Phil. 241, it
was held that "(t)he rule that alibi must be satisfactorily proven was
never intended to change the burden of proof of criminal cases; otherwise, we
will see the absurdity of an accused being put in a more difficult position
where the prosecution's evidence is vague and weak than where it is
strong."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Excluding Jesus, <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolay</span>, there remain
the appellants Juan <span class="SpellE">Bartolay</span> and Carlos <span class="SpellE">Pejo</span> (besides <span class="SpellE">Supremo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolay</span>, who died before the trial ended, and <span class="SpellE">Periolo</span> <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>, who withdrew
his appeal).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Juan admitted having
stabbed Elias <span class="SpellE">Espenilla</span> repeatedly; while Carlos
testified that he did hit <span class="SpellE">Renerio</span> <span class="SpellE">Espenilla</span>
with a club and later <span class="SpellE">Supremo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolay</span>
stabbed <span class="SpellE">Renerio</span> also (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
<st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="5">22 May 1968</st1:date>, page 8).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether they also participated in attacking
the other victim (<span class="SpellE">Galicano</span> <span class="SpellE">Espenilla</span>)
remains unclear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Galicano</span>
could well have fallen victim to the other assailants not before Us now (<span class="SpellE">Supremo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Periolo</span> <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Baconawa</span>
may have witnessed the combat between the accused and the deceased, the
confusion and excitement made his identification of the assailants of each of
the <span class="SpellE">Espenilla</span> brothers unreliable, as has been
previously shown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Baconawa</span>
certainly did not witness the entire episode, for, as he declared in his
affidavit to the police (Criminal Case Record Wrapper, page 3), "while
there was a commotion, I ran away because I was afraid"; and to the
question as to how he was able to know that the three victims were killed, he
answered, "At about 6:00 o'clock in the afternoon <u>I was informed by
other people"</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the strength of the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Baconawa</span>,
the trial court found each and every one of the accused to have conspired to
kill the three <span class="SpellE">Espenilla</span> brothers, and found them
guilty of three murders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having found <span class="SpellE">Baconawa's</span> testimony (that all the seven original accused
attacked jointly the victims) unreliable because such testimony appears con­trary
to the physical facts, revealed by the autopsy, We find the alleged conspiracy
unacceptable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has held, in
consonance with the Supreme Court of Spain, that to establish common
responsibility "it is not sufficient that the attack be joint and
simultaneous; it is necessary that the assailants be animated by one and the
same purpose", and that a conspiracy must be shown to exist as clearly and
convincingly as the crime itself.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, the fracas arose spontaneously, the details are confused
and the parti­cipation of each assailant uncertain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Juan <span class="SpellE">Bartolay</span>, by
his own admission, repeatedly stabbed Elias <span class="SpellE">Espenilla</span>
and the injuries received by the latter are consistent with his having been
attacked by Juan alone; nor is there adequate and clear evidence that Juan
attacked any of the other victims.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, Carlos <span class="SpellE">Pejo</span>, upon recovering from
the blow received from Elias <span class="SpellE">Espenilla</span>, admitted
striking and felling down Elias' brother, <span class="SpellE">Renerio</span>,
whom <span class="SpellE">Supremo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolay</span>
stabbed later on. Dr. <span class="SpellE">Claro</span> <span class="SpellE">Caluya</span>,
Jr., who conducted the autopsy, found that <span class="SpellE">Renerio</span>
died of cerebral hemorrhage (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1965" day="10" month="2">10 February 1965</st1:date>, page 5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not shown that Carlos turned on any of
the other <span class="SpellE">Espenillas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the absence of clear proof, We must give Juan and Carlos the benefit
of reasonable doubt, and hold them individually responsible for the injuries
inflicted by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conse­quently, the
allegation of their taking advantage of superior strength is not warranted, and
in the absence of any other qualifying circums­tance, each can only be held
guilty of one homicide, with the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For both gave themselves up to the Acting
Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">Magdaraog</span>, of <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:place>, as certi­fied by the
latter on the back of the warrant of arrest (Record, page 8).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision under review is hereby modified in
part and reversed in part, as follows:</p>
