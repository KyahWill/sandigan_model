				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal on certiorari from a decision of the Court of Appeals
reversing that of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental and sentencing petitioners, <span class="SpellE">Constantina</span>
and Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Agraviador</span>, to pay to respondents, <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> <span class="SpellE">Peñalosa</span> and her
husband <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> <span class="SpellE">Galo</span>, the
sum of P2<span class="GramE">,676.87</span>, and the costs.<span style=""> </span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> <span class="SpellE">Peñalosa</span> had worked as house­maid of the <span class="SpellE">Agraviadors</span>, in a hotel operated by the latter in <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Car­los</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, from
<st1:date year="1949" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1949</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1954" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1954</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span>
complained to the Chief of Police of said city about certain sums of money
allegedly due to her from the <span class="SpellE">Agraviadors</span>, for
personal Services rendered to the latter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Chief of Police referred her to the Constabulary unit stationed in
the locality, where Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span>
advised her to see the public defender at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
which she did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having, however, failed
to secure any action from the public defender, she wired then President <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>, who, thereupon, sent <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
a hearing officer of the Bureau of Labor Standards to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia's</span>
complaint, said officer rendered, on <st1:date year="1959" day="10" month="1">January
 10, 1959</st1:date>, a decision in her favor and against the <span class="SpellE">Agraviadors</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
latter appealed to the Labor Standards Commission, which, on <st1:date year="1960" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1960</st1:date>, affirmed said de­cision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On further appeal taken by the <span class="SpellE">Agraviadors</span> to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, in which the case was docketed as Civil
Case No. 5722 thereof, said court dismissed the case, on July 14, 1961, upon
the ground that the Labor Standards Commission had no jurisdiction over its
subject-matter, the same being merely a monetary claim.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, on September 6, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span>
and her husband commenced Civil Case No. 6286 of the same court against the <span class="SpellE">Agra­viadors</span>, to recover P1<span class="GramE">,150</span> as
alleged accrued salaries, P2,425 for services said to have been rendered in
excess of eight (8) hours a day, and P251.87 for work done on Sundays, aside
from moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorneys fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In due course, said court rendered
judgment dismissing the complaint therein, upon the ground that <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> had failed to substantiate her claim for com­pensation
and that the same is barred by the statute of limitations of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal taken by <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> and her husband,
the Court of Appeals sustained the finding of the lower court as regards the
fail­ure of <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> to establish the alleged
non-payment of her regular monthly salary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said appellate court, however, reversed the deci­sion of the lower court
insofar as the claim for overtime pay and for work done on Sundays, for which
it rendered judgment in the aggregate sum of P2,676.87, in addition to the
costs, as pointed out at the beginning of this decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the present petition for review on
certiorari by the <span class="SpellE">Agraviadors</span>, who maintain: (1) that
there is no evidence that <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> had ever demanded
payment of compensation for work done in excess of eight (8) hours a day and on
Sundays; (2) that her claim for such compensation is barred by the statute of limitations;
and (3) that, in awarding the aforemen­tioned compensation, the Court of
Appeals had passed upon an issue neither raised nor argued in <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia's</span> brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first assignment of error is based upon the theory that <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> had merely testified to having demanded payment
of her wages, from which the <span class="SpellE">Agraviadors</span> deduce that
she had made no demand for payment either for overtime or for work done on Sun­days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This theory assumes that, in using the term
"wages'', <span class="SpellE">Eus­taquia</span> meant no more than her fixed
regular monthly compensation, and did not include the remuneration for work
performed in excess of eight (8) hours and during Sundays: This assumption is
untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a housemaid, with a
limited schooling, <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> evidently un­derstood
the word "wages" as embracing every amount due to her for services
rendered to the <span class="SpellE">Agraviadors</span>, without distinction bet­ween
regular work not exceeding eight (8) hours and that per formed either in excess
of that period and/or during Sundays.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second assignment of error stresses the fact that more that
six (6) years had <span class="SpellE">elasped</span>, from <st1:date year="1954" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1954</st1:date>, when <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia's</span>
services to the <span class="SpellE">Agraviadors</span> ended, to <st1:date year="1961" day="6" month="9">September 6, 1961</st1:date>, when the present
action was commenced in the Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted, however, that in
September 1954, <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> went to the Chief of Police
of San Carlos and complained about the alleged non-payment by the <span class="SpellE">Agraviadors</span> of the compensation due to her (<span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span>); that the Chief of Police advised her to go to
the Constabulary, a Sergeant of which counseled her to see the public defender;
and that, having merited no attention from the latter official, she wired then
President <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>, who, forth­with, sent to <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City a hearing officer, who heard <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia's</span> complaint and, on January 12, 1959, rendered
the corresponding decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> filed
her claim with the De­partment of Labor<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> on <st1:date year="1956" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1956</st1:date>, or less than one (1) year and eleven (11)
months since the termination of <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia's</span> ser­vices.
<span style="">&nbsp;</span>Although said proceedings came to an end
on <st1:date year="1961" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1961</st1:date>, when the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental
dismissed Civil Case No. 5722 thereof, for lack of jurisdiction of the Labor
Standards Commission to hear and decide <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia's</span>
claim, the filing thereof had the effect of tolling the running of the period
of prescription.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a>
Accordingly, when the present action was com­menced on <st1:date year="1961" day="6" month="9">September 6, 1961</st1:date>, or less than two (2) months
after the dismissal of said Civil Case No. 5722, the period of six (6) years
prescribed in Art. 1145 of the Civil Code, for the prescrip­tion of such claim,
had not expired as yet.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that, pursuant to Sec. 7-A of Commonwealth Act No.
444, as amended by Republic Act No. 1993, claims for over­time and/or for work
done on Sundays prescribe three (3) years from the accrual of the cause of
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear, how­ever, that <span class="SpellE">Eustaquias</span>' claim had been filed before the expira­tion of the
said period, computed from <st1:date year="1954" day="10" month="9">September
 10, 1954</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over,
although said claim includes compensation for work done since <st1:date year="1949" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1949</st1:date>, the statute of
limitations did not begin to run until <st1:date year="1954" day="10" month="9">September
 10, 1954</st1:date>, when the <span class="SpellE">Agraviadors</span> rejected <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia's</span> s demand for payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although she had made similar demands prior
thereto, the <span class="SpellE">Agraviadors</span> did not turn down said
demands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They merely told her that they
would keep the money in trust for her, so that she may have a substantial
savings at the conclusion of her employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then, again, said Sec. 7-A of Commonwealth Act No. 444 was inserted therein
by Republic Act No. 1993, which took effect upon its approval on <st1:date year="1957" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1957</st1:date>, when <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia's</span> claim was already pending before the hearing
officer adverted to above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to
the proviso contained in the aforementioned Section 7-A, "actions already
commenced before the effective date" of said Republic Act No. 1993,
"shall not be affected by the period" therein "prescribed."</p>

<p class="BODY">The last assignment of error is merely a consequence of those
already disposed of and, hence, no further discussion is ne­cessary.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals should be,
as it is hereby affirmed, with costs against <span class="SpellE">Constantina</span>
and Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Agraviador</span>.</p>
