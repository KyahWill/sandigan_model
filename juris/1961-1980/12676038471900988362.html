<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Dalmacio</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="SpellE">Anns</span> 
filed on August 3, 1957 before the Justice of the Pence Court of <span class="SpellE">Zablan</span>, Mt. Province a complaint for forcible entry against 
Bruno Garcia praying that the latter be ordered to deliver to the former the 
possession of the land in litigation. Defendant, in his answer, averred that the 
properly allegedly owned by the plaintiff is within the parcel of land handed 
down to him by his father as his inheritance and that since then he has been in 
possession thereof and has never been molested nor dispossessed by 
anyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The justice of the peace 
dismissed the case holding that the defendant is the one entitled to the 
possession of the land. On appeal, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> reached practically the same conclusion. It dismissed 
the complaint on the ground that plaintiff has failed to identify the land which 
he claims to have been dispossessed by defendant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The case went to the Court of 
Appeals, but this time this Court found that the complaint is meritorious. It 
ordered defendant to restore to plaintiff the possession of the land and to pay 
him P500.00 as attorney's fees. The case is now before us on a petition for 
review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The court <i>a quo</i>, after an 
examination of the evidence, concluded that plaintiff has not been able to 
identify the land which lie claims to have been dispossessed by defendant for, 
according to the court, even his own witness Rosita <span class="SpellE">Gayo</span> gave as a description of the land sold by her father 
one consisting of 10 hectares instead of only 4 which is the one allegedly sold 
by her father to the plaintiff, while, on the other hand, the preponderance of 
evidence shows that defendant is the owner of the land and h one entitled to its 
possession. Consequently, on the s of this finding, the court dismissed the 
complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Court of Appeals, however, 
reached a different contusion. Thus, it found that the plaintiff is the 
rightful, sole and absolute owner since time immemorial of the parcel of land 
described in the complaint; that plaintiff bought 4 of the 10 hectares of the 
land from one Pablo <span class="SpellE">Galbo</span> in 1945 which he occupied 
and expanded by including the 6 hectares he acquired through a patent 
application; and that in May, 1957, defendant entered the land, had the same 
surveyed over his protest, fenced it and turned loose his <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> thereon. And considering that defendant did not deny 
these facts but limited himself to proving his title to the land by identifying 
the tax declarations covering the same, the Court of Appeals reached the 
conclusion that plaintiff was in actual possession of the land of which he was 
dispossessed by defendant by having it surveyed and 
possessed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We agree with the Court of 
Appeals that in an action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> the only issue 
involved is one of possession <i>de facto</i> the purpose of which is merely to 
protect the owner from any physical encroachment from without. The title of the 
land or its ownership is not involved, for if a person is in actual possession 
thereof he is entitled to be maintained and respected in it even against the 
owner himself. The main thing to be proven is prior possession and if same is 
lost through force, stealth or violence, it behooves the court to restore it 
regardless of its title or ownership (Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, 
Vol. 2, 1957 ed., p. 289). In this sense, we find incorrect the procedure 
adopted by the court <i>a quo</i> wherein, to determine the right to possession, 
it resorted to an analysis of the evidence regarding its title or ownership, and 
when it found that the plaintiff failed to establish his ownership it dismissed 
his complaint. Such finding is not necessary. What is important is to find out 
who the actual possessor is and if his possession hart been disturbed. <span class="GramE">This the</span> Court of Appeals did, which finding we cannot now 
look into.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: Verdana;">Wherefore</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision appealed from is 
affirmed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
