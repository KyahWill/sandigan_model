				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for certiorari to review the decision of the
Court of Appeals (4th Division) promulgated on June 9, 1971, affirming the
amended decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>
City the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the Court hereby
adjudicates the parcel of land described in Plan Psu-18949 situated in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Silang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, in favor of the applicants (<span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Belamide</span>, of legal age, Filipino, married to <span class="SpellE">Patrocinio</span> de Castro, and resident of <span class="SpellE">Silang</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>; Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Belamide</span>,

Filipino, married to <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Menchavez</span>,
and resident of <span class="SpellE">Silang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>)
and the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> (<span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span>
Montoya, Gregorio Montoya and Francisco Montoya, Filipinos, of legal age,
married and residents of <span class="SpellE">Silang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>)
in the following proportions:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"Three-fourths (3/4) undivided share belongs to the
applicants, and one-fourth (1/4) undivided share belongs to the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Once this decision becomes final, let the corresponding
decree of registra­tion be issued upon proof that the corresponding estate and
inheritance taxes have been paid, or certificate of tax exemption has been
issued."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners herein were the applicants for the registration of
the parcel of land involved in this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The private respondents were the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
allowed on Motion for a New Trial, to file an opposition even after a decision
has already been rendered by then Judge Felix V. <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>,
after hearing, following the issuance of a general default order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pars. 1-3, Petition).</p>

<p class="BODY">From the amended decision rendered after the new trial, both
parties appealed to the Court of Appeals which found the essential facts as
narrated in the deci­sion appealed thereto as duly established by the evidence,
and quoted the same approvingly as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The next question that presents itself is when and by whom
was the land in question acquired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> allege that the acquisition was made during the
first marriage of <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> Montoya to Martin Montoya,
whereas the applicants maintain that such land was acquired during the marriage
(second marriage) of <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> Montoya to Jose <span class="SpellE">Velardo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both
contentions are not supported by any document.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the fact that Susana <span class="SpellE">Velardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Belamide</span> sold a portion of the land in question (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 6) to the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Silang</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> (for widening of the street) on May 1933
without the intervention of, or opposition from, <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span>
Montoya who died on December 2, 1955 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 3),
coupled with the fact that Susana <span class="SpellE">Velardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Belamide</span> has possession of the property since the death of
her mother (<span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> Montoya) in 1931 after she sold
the same to the herein applicants on July 20, 1951 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
B), convince the Court that said property was acquired during the <span class="SpellE">coverture</span> of Jose <span class="SpellE">Velardo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> Montoya.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, upon the death of Jose <span class="SpellE">Velardo</span>
in 1888, the one-half (1/2) undivided portion of the property passed by
inheritance to Susana <span class="SpellE">Velardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Belamide</span>
and the other one-half (1/2) undivided portion went to <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span>
Montoya as her share of the conjugal estate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the death of the latter on February 28,1931, her undivided one-half
(1/2) share of the property should be divided equally between Susana <span class="SpellE">Velardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Belamide</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> Montoya, that is, each is entitled to one-fourth
(1/4) undivided share.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, Susana <span class="SpellE">Velardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Belamide's</span> share is three-fourths
(3/4) while <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> Montoya's share passed by
inheritance to his children, the herein <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, the sale made by Susana <span class="SpellE">Velardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Belamide</span> in favor of the
applicants (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B) is null and void only with
respect to the one-fourth (1/4) undivided portion of the property (the share of
the herein <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>) who did not consent to the
sale)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As earlier stated, the Court of Appeals affirmed the amended
decision of the Court of First Instance, this time rendered by Hon. Jose P.
Alejandro, and denied a Motion for Reconsideration filed by the petitioners
herein on June 29, 1971 (Annex E to Petition), as well as a Motion for a New
Trial (Annex F to Petition).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ground
for the Motion for New Trial was that Exhibit 8 of the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
(private respondents herein) which was allegedly relied upon by both the Court
of First Instance and the Court of Appeals is a falsified document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As recited in the petition, par. 12 thereof
(p. 8, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>), the falsification consists of the
following:</p>

<blockquote>"According to the official records of the Civil Registrar of <span class="SpellE">Silang</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
the name of the father of <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> Montoya in the
marriage column is in <u>blank</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
according to Exhibit 8, the name of the father of <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span>
Montoya is <u>Martin Montoya</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
while the official record of the civil registrar shows that <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>'
father, <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span>, had an unknown father, thru
falsification, <span class="SpellE">Hilarion's</span> father was <u>made</u> to
appear in <u>Exhibit 8</u> as <u>Martin Montoya</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter falsely became husband of <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> Montoya, thereby enabling private respondents to
inherit 1/4 of the land in dispute from <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span>
Montoya."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is the denial of the Motion for New Trial by the Court of
Appeals which petitioners allege to be in grave abuse of discretion, and their
allegation that the Court of First Instance, as a land registration court, has
no jurisdiction to declare who are the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span>
Montoya and partition the property by adjudicating 1/4 pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span>
to private respondents as children of <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span>
Montoya, allegedly an unacknowledged natural child of <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span>
Montoya, and that as a consequence, the Court of Appeals, likewise, is without
jurisdiction, or acted in grave abuse of discretion, in affirming the decision
of the lower court, that petitioners came to this Court with the present
petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">1. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>There can be no grave
abuse of discretion by the Court of Appeals in denying petitioners' Motion for
New Trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The document alleged to be
falsified (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 8) was presented in the trial in the
lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners should have
attacked the same as falsified with competent evidence, which could have been
presented, if they had exercised due diligence in obtaining said evidence,
which is Annex "A"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
to the Motion for New Trial (Annex F to Petition).<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It is, therefore, not a newly discovered evidence that could justify a new
trial (Rule 37 [1-b], Rules of Court).</p>

<p class="BODY">The new evidence would neither change the result as found by the
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It might prove that <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> Montoya was registered at birth without his father
having been given, but from the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Belamide</span>, one of the applicants (now petitioners), <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> Montoya was married twice, although he did not know
the first husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, in the
opposition of private respondents (pp. 30-31, Record on Appeal)<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>,
it is there alleged that the land originally belonged to <u>the spouses Martin
Montoya and <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> Montoya</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This allegation was never contradicted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The document sought to be presented by
petitioners, as stated in their Motion for New Trial in the Court of Appeals, cannot
effectively destroy this allegation, first, because the marriage between Martin
Montoya and <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> Montoya could have taken place
after the birth of <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> Montoya who was thus
legitimized, and second, Martin Montoya and <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span>
Montoya evidently lived together as husband and wife, and are, therefore,
presumed to have been legally married (Section 5, par. [bb] Rule 131, Rules of
Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court held that a man and a
woman who are living under the same roof are presumed to be legitimate spouses (<span class="SpellE">Que</span> Quay vs. Collector of Customs, 33 Phil. 128), and in
the instant case, no less than one of the herein petitioners, <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Belamide</span>, testified
that <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> Montoya married twice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records suggest no other husband by the
first marriage than Martin Montoya, who then could have been the father of <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> Montoya who, undisputedly, is the son of <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> Montoya.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the law and the evidence showing with reasonable sufficiency
that <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> Montoya from whom private respondents
would derive hereditary rights over the land in question, is the legitimate son
of <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> Montoya, the adjudication of said land by
the lower court, as specified in its decision, is in accordance with law.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. The jurisdiction of the lower court as a land registration
court to adjudicate the land for purposes of registration cannot, as
petitioners try to do, be questioned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The applicants and <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> both claim
rights to the land by virtue of their relationship to the original owner, the
late <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> Montoya.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court is thus necessarily impelled to determine the truth of their
alleged relationship, and on the basis thereof, to adjudicate the land to them
as the law has prescribed to be their <span class="SpellE">successional</span>
rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law does not require the
heirs to go to the probate court first before applying for the registration of
the land, for a declaration of <span class="SpellE">heirship</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would be a very cumbersome procedure,
unnecessarily expensive and unreasonably inconvenient, clearly averse to the
rule against multiplicity of suits.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, petitioners should not now be heard to complain
after they have themselves gone to the lower court to have their title to the
land registered in their names without having had a previous declaration of
their <span class="SpellE">heirship</span> by the probate court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In filing their opposition to the application,
private respondents merely went to the same court invoking its jurisdiction in
exactly the same fashion as did the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect, there was unanimity among the
parties in consenting to, or acquiescing in, the exercise of the jurisdiction
of the land registration court, no matter whether same is a limited one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this premise, and with the full
opportunity given both parties to air their sides with the presentation of all
evidence as they may desire in support thereof, as fully as could be done in
the ordinary court with general jurisdiction, the decision of the lower court,
sitting as a land court, supported as it is with suf­ficient evidence, may no
longer be questioned on jurisdictional grounds.<span style="">&nbsp;
