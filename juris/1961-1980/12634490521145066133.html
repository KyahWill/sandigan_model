				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First <span style="">Instance </span>of Manila, dated <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1963</st1:date>, denying the appellant
Tan Chua<span style="">'</span>s petition for
naturalization.</p>

<p class="BODY">Tan Chua <u><span style="">alias</span></u><span style=""> </span>Carlos <span class="SpellE">Cua</span>,
on <st1:date year="1959" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1959</st1:date>, filed
a petition for naturalization w<span style="">it</span>h
the CFI of Manila (CC 42059).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October
15, 1960, after due hearing, the court rendered judgment, declaring that he
possesses all the qualifications required by law, and none of the
disqualifications, to become a Filipino citizen, and, consequently granted the
petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1962</st1:date>
the petitioner filed a motion to set his case for final hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On June 10 1963 the Solicitor General filed
an opposition seeking dismissal of the petition on the grounds that (1) the
court has no jurisdiction over the case as the petition omitted to mention the
previous addresses of the petitioner, in violation of section 7 of Commonwealth
Act 473, as amended; and (2) that the petitioner has not conducted himself in a
proper and irreproachable manner during his residence in the Philippines, as he
had assumed and used an <u>alias</u>, Carlos <span class="SpellE">Cua</span>,
without judicial authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court,
in its subsequent order of October 29, 1963, denied the petition, upon the
grounds relied upon by the Solicitor General, and upon the additional grounds
that (1) the petitioner “committed numerous errors both in the writing of
English sentences and in <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span> translation”; and
(2) he operated a travel agency from 1956 to January, 1958 without authority to
do so, in violation of section 6 of Republic Act 1478 as amended by Republic
Act 2627.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His motion for reconsideration
of the order of dismissal was also denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">The vital issue posed in this appeal is whether the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> erred in denying the petition for naturalization.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is well-settled that a court, at the hearing on a motion
to take oath, is not limited to inquiring whether a petitioner for
naturalization (1) has left the Philippines for abroad; (2) has dedicated himself
continuously to a lawful calling or profession; (3) has not been convicted of
any offense or violation of Government promulgated rules; and (4) has not
committed any act prejudicial to the interests of the nation or contrary to any
Government announced policies (sec. 1, R.A. 530).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the contrary, it may inquire into <span style="">"<u>any</u> <u>question</u></span><span style=""> </span>affecting the qualifications of the
applicant" (Lim <span class="SpellE">Hok</span> <span class="SpellE">Albano</span>,
etc. vs. Republic, L-10912, Oct. 31, 1958, and the cases therein cited; <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> Guan vs. Republic
L-15691, March 27, 1961).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is
likewise settled that the Government is not <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
to question a petitioner's qualifications even after his petition for
naturalization has been granted, for unlike final decisions in actions and
other court proceedings, a decision or order granting citizenship to an
applicant does not really become <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, and, a
naturalization proceeding not being a judicial adversary proceeding, the
decision therein is not <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">judicata</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>as to <u><span style="">an</span></u><u><span style="">y</span></u><span style=""> <u>matter</u> </span>which would support a
judgment canceling the certificate of naturalization (Republic vs. Go Bon Lee,
L-11499, April 29, 1961).</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that the appellant stated in his petition for
naturalization only his last place of residence - 757 <span class="SpellE">Ongpin</span>
St., Sta. Cruz, Manila, but failed to state his former places of residence,
namely, <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span> St., <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>,
Manila, 1936-1937; <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. <span class="SpellE">Cristo</span>
St., <span class="SpellE">Binondo</span>, Manila, 1937-1945; <span class="SpellE">Clavel</span>
St., <span class="SpellE">Binondo</span>, Manila, 1945-1948; 51 <span class="SpellE">Soler</span> St. Sta. Cruz, Manila, 1948-1954; 843 San Fernando
St., Manila, 6 <span class="SpellE">Oriente</span> St., <span class="SpellE">Binondo</span>,
Manila, 1954-1955; and 534 <span class="SpellE">Ongpin</span> St., <span class="SpellE">Binondo</span>, Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
failure to state his previous places of residence in his petition for
naturalization is in violation of section 7 of Commonwealth Act 473, a fatal
defect that warrants the dismissal of his petition (Yap vs. Republic, L-19832,
August 23, 1966, and the cases therein cited).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such omission moreover amounts to "falsifying the truth, indicating
lack of good moral character which disqualifies him from admission to
Philippine citizenship" (<span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Tai vs. Republic,
L-19418, December 23, 1964).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact
that at the hearing held on September 26, 1960, in his application for
clearances to the different investigative agencies before his original petition
was heard, and to the same agencies before his petition to take his oath of
allegiance was heard, he stated his said former addresses, did not thereby cure
this defect (Lo vs. Republic, L-15919, <span style="">May
</span><span style="">19,1961; Qua vs. Republic,
L-19834, October 27, 1964; Kao </span><span class="SpellE">Heng</span> etc. vs.
Republic, L-21079, February 28,1966; Yap vs. Re­public, <u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The record likewise shows that the appellant used the <u>alias</u>
"Carlos <span class="SpellE">Cua</span>" without judicial authority, in
violation of <span style="">section </span>1 of
Commonwealth Act 142, which provides that "Except as <span style="">a </span>pseudonym for literary purposes, <span style="">no person shall use </span>any name different
from the one with which he was christened or by which he has been known since
childhood, or such substitute name as may have been authorized by a competent
court," as well as section 2 of the same Act which requires a person
"desiring to use an alias or aliases" "to obtain judicial authority"
<span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
use of said <u><span style="">alias</span></u><span style=""> </span>without judicial authority
"hardly speaks well <span style="">of his
(petitioner'</span>s)<span style=""> </span>character
or his fitness to become a Fili­pino citizen" (<span class="SpellE">Cosme</span>
Go <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> Ana @ Ana vs. <span style="">Republic, L-19833, August 31, 1966), </span>indicates that he has not
conducted himself properly, and disqualifies him to acquire Philippine
citizenship (Lim Bun vs. Republic, L-12822, April 26, 1961).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the order appealed from is affirmed, at petitioner-appellant's
cost.</p>
