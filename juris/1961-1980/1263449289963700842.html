				[ Adm. Case No. 516, August 30, 1967</h4>
				<H3>TRANQUILINO O. CALO, JR., PETITIONER,
VS. ESTEBAN DEGAMO, RESPONDENT.

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Respondent Esteban <span class="SpellE">Degamo</span> has moved
this Court to reconsider the sanction of disbarment meted to him by our
decision of <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1967</st1:date>,
which in his submission is excessively severe.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the new facts disclosed in the verified motion of
respondent, that upon his sworn application to become Chief of Police of
Carmen, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> (in which he failed to disclose the <span class="SpellE">penÂ­dency</span> of charges against him) he was appointed as such
Chief of Police on January 17, 1959, at a monthly salary of P95.00, and served
only until May 17, 1959; that subsequently said respondent was elected Mayor of
Carmen and served as such from 1960 to 1964; that thereafter he was appointed
and acted as Election Registrar during 1965; that there is no evidence that he
has not served honestly and efficiently the various offices that he has held,
or that any complaint has been made against his official actuations, we are
inclined to agree that the original sanction of disbarment appears too
harsh.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A suspension of three years would
seem adequate to the merits of the case and as a warning to other members of
the bar (<span class="SpellE">Macale</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Gan</span>, 93
Phil. 292).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision heretofore rendered is modified in
the sense that the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion thereof is
hereby amended to read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"For the foregoing reasons, respondent Esteban <span class="SpellE">Degamo</span> is hereby suspended from the practice of the
profession of law for the period of three (3) years from the date of this
decision."</blockquote>
