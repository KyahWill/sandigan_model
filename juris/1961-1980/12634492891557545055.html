their by-products, and to act as agent, broker or commission merchant of the

<p class="BODY">An unhappy chain of events conspired to deter NACOCO from
fulfilling these contracts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nature
supervened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four devastating typhoons
visited the Philippines:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the first in
October, the second and third in November, and the fourth in December, 1947.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coconut trees throughout the country suffered

a problem.</p>

completed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant Moll took her oath
on that date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A meeting was then
held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>
made a full disclosure of the situation, apprised the board of the impending
heavy losses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No action was taken on the
contracts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did the board vote
thereon at the meeting of January 7, 1948 following.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, on <st1:date year="1948" day="11" month="1">January 11, 1948</st1:date>, President <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
made a statement that the NACOCO head did his best to avert the losses,
emphasized that government concerns faced the same risks that confronted
private companies, that NACOCO was recouping its losses, and that <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> was to remain in his post.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not long there­after, that is, on <st1:date year="1948" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1948</st1:date>, the board met again
with <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bocar</span>, Garcia

by NACOCO, P539,000.00; Franklin Baker Corporation, P78,210.00; Spencer <span class="SpellE">Kellog</span> &amp; Sons, P159,040.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">But one buyer, Louis Dreyfus &amp; Co.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Overseas) Ltd., did in fact sue before the
Court of First Instance of Manila, upon claims as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the undelivered copra under the July 30
contract (Civil Case 4459), P287,028.00; for the balance on the August 14
contract (Civil Case 4398), P75,098.63; for that per the September 12 contract
reduced to judgment (Civil Case 4322, appealed to this Court in L-2829),
P447,908.40.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These cases culminated in
an out-of-court amicable settlement - when the <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>
management was already out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
corporation <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> paid Dreyfus P567,024.52 representing
70% of the total claims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With particular
reference to the Dreyfus claims, NACOCO put up the defenses that: (1) the
contracts were void because Louis Dreyfus &amp; Co.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Overseas) Ltd. did not have license to do
business here; and (2) failure to deliver was due to <u>force</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>majeure</u></span>, the typhoons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To project the utter unreasonableness of this
compromise, we reproduce <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>haec</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>verba</u></span> this finding below:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> However,
in similar cases brought by the same claimant [Louis Dreyfus &amp; Co.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Overseas) Ltd.] against Santiago <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span> for non-delivery of copra also involving a claim of

proportion, the claim of Dreyfus against NACOCO should have been compromised

Board of Liquidators? <u>This</u> <u>is</u> <u>just</u> <u>a</u> <u>sample</u> <u>to</u>

<p class="BODY">All the settlements sum up to P1,343,274.52.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this suit started in February, 1949, NACOCO seeks to recover
the above sum of P1,343,274.52 from general manager and board chairman <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>, and directors
Juan <span class="SpellE">Bocar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span> Garcia

with negligence under Article 1902 of the old Civil Code (now Article 2176, new
Civil Code); and defendant board members, including <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>,
with bad faith and/or breach of trust for having approved the contracts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fifth amended complaint, on which this
case was tried, was filed on <st1:date year="1959" day="2" month="7">July 2,

the action upon defenses herein­after in this opinion to be discussed.</p>

without costs as well as defendants' counterclaims, except that plaintiff was
ordered to pay the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> the sum of P2,601.94 for unpaid salaries and cash
deposit due the deceased <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> from NACOCO.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff's brief did not question the judgment on <span class="SpellE">Kalaw's</span> counterclaim for the sum of P2,601.94.</p>

<p class="BODY">Right at the outset, two preliminary questions raised before, but
adversely decided by, the court below, arrest our attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal, defendants renew their bid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, upon established jurisprudence that
an appellate court may base its decision of <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>
of the judgment below on a point or points ignored by the trial court or in
which said court was in error.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">1. First of the threshold questions is that advanced by
defendants that plaintiff Board of Liquidators has lost its legal personality
to continue with this suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accepted in this jurisdiction are three methods by which a
corporation may wind up its affairs:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
under Section 3, Rule 104, of the Rules of Court [which superseded Section 66
of the Corporation Law]<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
whereby, upon voluntary dissolution of a corporation, the court may direct
"such disposition of its assets as justice requires, and may appoint a
receiver to collect such assets and pay the debts of the corporation;" (2)
under Section 77 of the Corporation Law, whereby a corporation whose corporate
existence is terminated, "shall nevertheless be continued as a body
corporate for three years after the time when it would have been so dissolved,
for the purpose of prosecuting and defending suits by or against it and of
enabling it gradually to settle and close its affairs, to dispose of and convey
its property and to divide its capital stock, but not for the purpose of
continuing the business for which it was established"; and (3) under
Section 78 of the Corporation Law, by virtue of which the corporation, within
the three-year period just mentioned, "is authorized and empowered to
convey all of its property to trustees for the benefit of members,
stockholders, creditors, and others interested."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is defendants' pose that their case comes within the coverage
of the second method.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They reason out
that suit was commenced in February, 1949; that by Executive Order 372, dated
November 24, 1950, NACOCO, together with other government-owned cor­porations,
was abolished, and the Board of Liquidators was entrusted with the function of
settling and closing its affairs; and that, since the three-year period has
elapsed, the Board of Liquidators may not now continue with, and prosecute, the
present case to its con­clusion, because Executive Order 372 provides in
Section 1 thereof that -</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
National Abaca and Other Fibers Corporation, the National Coconut Corporation,
the National Tobacco Corporation, the National Food Products Corporation and
the former enemy-owned or controlled corporations or associations, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> are hereby abolished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said corporations shall be liquidated in
accordance with law, the provisions of this Order, and/or in such manner as the
President of the Philippines may direct; <u>Provided</u>, <u>however</u>, That
each of the said corporations shall nevertheless be continued as a body
corporate for a period of three (3) years from the effective date of this
Executive Order for the purpose of prosecuting and defending suits by or
against it and of enabling the Board of Liquidators gradually to settle and
close its affairs, to dispose of and convey its property in the manner
hereinafter provided."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Citing Mr. Justice Fisher, defendants proceed to argue that even
where it may be found impossible within the 3-year period to reduce disputed
claims to judgment, nonetheless, "suits by or against a corporation abate
when it ceases to be an entity capable of suing or being sued" (Fisher,
The Philippine Law of Stock Corporations, pp. 390-391).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Corpus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Juris</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">Secundum</span> </u>likewise is authority for the statement
that "[t]he dissolution of a corporation ends its existence so that there
must be statutory authority for prolongation of its life <u>even</u> <u>for</u>
<u>purposes</u> <u>of</u> <u>pending</u> <u>litigation</u>";<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
and that suit "cannot be continued or revived; nor can a valid judgment be
rendered therein, and a judgment, if rendered, is not only erroneous, but void
and subject to collateral attack."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
So it is, that abatement of pending actions follows as a matter of course upon
the expiration of the legal period for liquidation,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
unless the statute merely requires a commencement of suit within the added
time.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">We, however, express the view that the executive order abolishing
NACOCO and creating the Board of Liquidators should be examined in
context.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proviso in Section 1 of
Executive Order 372, whereby the corporate existence of NACOCO was con­tinued
for a period of three years from the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of
the order for "the purpose of prosecuting and defending suits by or
against it and of enabling the Board of Liquidators gradually to settle and
close its affairs, to dispose of and convey its property in the manner
hereinafter provided", is to be read not as an isolated provision but in
conjunction with the whole.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So reading,
it will be readily observed that no time limit has been tackled to the
existence of the Board of Liquidators and its function of closing the affairs
of the various government-owned corporations, including NACOCO.</p>

<p class="BODY">By Section 2 of the executive order, while the boards of
directors of the various corporations were abolished, their powers and
functions and duties under existing laws were to be assumed and exercised by
the Board of Liquidators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President
thought it best to do away with the boards of directors of the defunct cor­porations;
at the same time, however, the President had chosen to see to it that the Board
of Liquidators step into the vacuum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
nowhere in the executive order was there any mention of the lifespan of the
Board of Liquidators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A glance at the
other pro­visions of the executive order buttresses our conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, liquidation by the Board of Liquidators
may, under section 1, proceed in accordance with law, the provisions of the
executive order, "<u>and</u>/<u>or</u> <u>in</u> <u>such</u> <u>manner</u>
<u>as</u> <u>the</u> <u>President</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <st1:country-region><st1:place><u>Philippines</u></st1:place></st1:country-region>
<u>may</u> <u>direct</u>." By Section 4, when any property, fund, or
project is transferred to any governmental instrumentality "for adminis­tration
or continuance of any project", the necessary funds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
shall be taken from the corresponding special fund created in Sec­tion 5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 5, in turn, talks of special funds
established from the "net proceeds of the liquidation" of the various
corporations abolished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And by Section 7,
fifty per centum of the fees collected from the copra standardization and
inspection service shall accrue "to the special fund created in section 5
hereof for the rehabilitation and development of the coconut industry."
Implicit in all these, is that the term of life of the Board of Liquidators is
without time limit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contemporary history
gives us the fact that the Board of Liquidators still exists as an office with
officials and numerous employees continuing the job of liquidation and
prosecution of several court actions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not that our views on the power of the Board of Liquidators to
proceed to the final determination of the present case is without
jurisprudential support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first
judicial test before this Court is National Abaca and Other Fibers Corporation
vs. Pore, L-16779, <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, the corporation, already
dissolved, commenced suit within the three-year extended period for liqui­dation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That suit was for recovery of money advanced
to defendant for the purchase of hemp in behalf of the corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She failed to account for that money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant moved to dismiss, questioned the
corporation's capacity to sue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower
court ordered plain­tiff to include as co-party plaintiff, <u>The</u> <u>Board</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Liquidators</u>, to which the corporation's liquidation was
entrusted by <u>Executive</u> <u>Order</u> <u>372</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff failed to effect inclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court dismissed the suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff moved to reconsider.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ground: excusable negligence, in that its
counsel prepared the amended complaint, as directed, and instructed the board's
incoming and outgoing corres­pondence clerk, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Receda</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, to mail the
original thereof to the court and a copy of the same to defendant's
counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She mailed the copy to the
latter but failed to send the original to the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was rejected below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff came to this Court on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We there said that "the rule appears to
be well settled that, in the absence of statutory provision to the contrary,
pending actions by or against a corporation are abated upon expiration of the
period allowed by law for the liquidation of its affairs." We there noted
that "[o]<span class="SpellE">ur</span> Corporation Law contains no
provision author­izing a corporation, after three (3) years from the expiration
of its lifetime, to continue in its corporate name actions instituted by it
within said period of three (3) years."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
However, these precepts notwithstanding, we, in effect, held in that case that
the Board of Liquidators escapes from the operation thereof for the reason that
"<u>[o]<span class="SpellE">bviously</span></u>, <u>the</u> <u>complete</u> <u>loss</u>
<u>of</u> <u>plaintiff's</u> <u>corporate</u> <u>existence</u> <u>after</u> <u>the</u>
<u>expiration</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>period</u> <u>of</u> <u>three</u> (<u>3</u>)
<u>years</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>settle­ment</u> <u>of</u> <u>its</u> <u>affairs</u>
<u>is</u> <u>what</u> <u>impelled</u> <u>the</u> <u>President</u> <u>to</u> <u>create</u>
<u>a</u> <u>Board</u> <u>of</u> <u>Liquidators</u>, <u>to</u> <u>continue</u> <u>the</u>
<u>management</u> <u>of</u> <u>such</u> <u>matters</u> <u>as</u> <u>may</u> <u>then</u>
<u>be</u> <u>pending</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
We accordingly directed the record of said case to be returned to the lower
court, with instructions to admit plaintiff's amended complaint to include, as
party plaintiff, The Board of Liquidators.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant’s position is vulnerable to attack from another
direction.</p>

<p class="BODY">By Executive Order 372, the government, the <u>sole</u>
stockholder, abolished NACOCO, and placed its assets in the hands of the Board
of Liquidators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Board of Liquidators
thus became the <u>trustee</u> on behalf of the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was an express trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legal interest became vested in the
trustee - the Board of Liquidators. The beneficial interest <u>remained</u>
with the sole stockholder the government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At no time had the government withdrawn the property, or the authority
to continue the present suit, from the Board of Liquidators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If for this reason alone, we cannot stay the
hand of the Board of Liquidators from prosecuting this case to its final
conclusion.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
The provisions of Section 78 of the Corporation Law - the third method of
winding up corporate affairs - find application.</p>

<p class="BODY">We, accordingly, rule that the Board of Liquidators has
personality to proceed as party-plaintiff in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. Defendant’s second poser is that the action is unenforceable
against the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> heirs of <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>
raised in their motion to dismiss,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
which was overruled, and in their nineteenth special defense, that plaintiff's
action is personal to the deceased <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>, and may not be deemed to have survived after his
death.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
They say that the controlling statute is Section 5, Rule 87, of the 1940 Rules
of Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
which provides that "[a]<span class="SpellE">ll</span> claims for money
against the decedent, arising from contract, express or implied", must be
filed in the estate proceedings of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We disagree.</p>

<p class="BODY">The suit here revolves around the alleged negligent acts of <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> for having entered into the questioned contracts
without prior approval of the board of directors, to the damage and pre­judice
of plaintiff; and is against <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> and the other
directors for having subsequently approved the said contracts in bad faith
and/or breach of trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly then,
the present case is not a mere action for the recovery of money nor a claim for
money arising from con­tract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The suit
involves alleged <span class="SpellE">tortious</span> acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the action is embraced in suits filed
"to recover damages for an injury to person or property, real or
personal", which survive.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The leading expositor of the law on this point is <span class="SpellE">Aguas</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Llemos</span>, L-18107, <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, plaintiffs sought to recover damages
from defendant <span class="SpellE">Llemos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint averred that <span class="SpellE">Llemos</span> had served plaintiff by registered mail with a copy
of a petition for a writ of possession in Civil Case 4824 of the Court of First
Instance at <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>,
with notice that the same would be submitted to the <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>
court on February 23, 1960 at 8:00 a.m.; that in view of the copy and notice
served, plaintiffs proceeded to the said court of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>
from their residence in Manila accompanied by their lawyers, only to discover
that no such petition had been filed; and that defendant <span class="SpellE">Llemos</span>
maliciously failed to appear in court, so that plaintiffs' expenditure and
trouble turned out to be in vain, causing them mental anguish and undue
embarrassment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant died before he
could answer the com­plaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon leave
of court, plaintiffs amended their complaint to include the heirs of the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The heirs moved to
dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court dismissed the
complaint on the ground that the legal representative, and not the heirs,
should have been made the party defendant; and that, anyway, the action being
for recovery of money, testate or intestate proceedings should be initiated and
the claim filed therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court,
thru Mr. Justice Jose B. L. Reyes, there declared:</p>

<blockquote>"Plaintiffs argue with considerable cogency that contrasting
the correlated provisions of the Rules of Court, those concerning claims that
are barred if not filed in the estate settlement proceedings (Rule 87, sec. 5)
and those defining actions that survive and may be prosecuted against the
executor or administrator (Rule 88, sec. 1), it is apparent that actions for
damages caused by <span class="SpellE">tortious</span> conduct of a defendant (as
in the case at bar) survive the death of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Rule 87, section 5, the actions that
are abated by death are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) claims for
funeral expenses and those for the last sickness of the decedent; (2) judgments
for money; and (3) 'all claims for money against the decedent, <u>arising from
contract express or implied</u>.' None of these includes that of the
plaintiffs-appellants; for it is not enough that the claim against the deceased
party be for money, but it must arise from 'contract express or implied', and
these words (also used by the Rules in connection with attachments and derived
from the common law) were construed in Leung Ben vs. O'Brien, 38 Phil. 182,
189-194,</blockquote>

<blockquote>'to include all purely personal obligations <u>other</u> <u>than</u>
those which have their source in <span class="SpellE"><u>delict</u></span> or <u>tort</u>.'</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Upon the other hand, Rule 88, section 1,
enumerates actions that survive against a decedent's executors or
administrators, and they are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
actions to recover real and personal property from the estate; (2) actions to
enforce a lien thereon; and (3) actions to recover damages for an injury to
person or property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present suit is
one for damages under the last class, it having been held that 'injury to
property' is not limited to injuries to specific property, but extends to other
wrongs by which personal estate is injured or diminished (Baker vs. Crandall,
47 Am. Rep. 126; also 171 A.L.R., 1395).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To maliciously cause a party to incur unnecessary ex­penses, as charged
in this case, is certainly injury to that party's property (Javier vs. <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, L-4369, Aug. 31, 1953)."</p>

<p class="BODY">The ruling in the preceding case was hammered out of facts
comparable to those of the present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
cogent reason exists why we should break away from the views just
expressed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, the conclusion remains:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Action against the <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>
heirs and, for that matter, against the Estate of <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span>
Garcia, survives.</p>

<p class="BODY">The preliminaries out of the way, we now go to the core of the
controversy.</p>

<p class="BODY">3. Plaintiff <span class="SpellE">levelled</span> a major attack on
the lower court's holding that <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> <span class="SpellE">justifiedly</span> entered into the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
con­tracts without the prior approval of the corporation's directorate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff leans heavily on <span class="SpellE">NACOCO's</span> corporate by-laws.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Article IV (b), Chapter III thereof, recites, as amongst the duties of
the general manager, the obligation:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"(b) To perform or execute on behalf of the Corporation upon prior
approval of the Board, all contracts necessary and essential to the proper
accomplishment for which the Corporation was organized."</p>

<p class="BODY">Not of <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>minimis</u></span>
importance in a proper approach to the problem at hand, is the nature of a
general manager's position in the corporate structure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A rule that has gained acceptance through the
years is that a corporate officer "<span class="SpellE">intrusted</span>
with the general management and control of its business, has implied authority
to make any contract or do any other act which is necessary or appropriate to
the conduct of the ordinary business of the corporation."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
As such officer, "he may, without any special authority from the Board of
Directors, perform all acts of an ordinary nature, which by usage or necessity
are incident to his office, and may bind the corporation by contracts in
matters arising in the usual course of business."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The problem, therefore, is whether the case at bar is to be taken
out of the general concept of the powers of a general manager, given the cited provision
of the NACOCO by-laws requiring prior directorate approval of NACOCO contracts.</p>

<p class="BODY">The peculiar nature of copra trading, at this point, deserves
express articulation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ordinary in this
enterprise are copra sales for future delivery.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The movement of the market requires that sales agreements be entered
into, even though the goods are not yet in the hands of the seller.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Known in business parlance as <u>forward</u> <u>sales</u>,
it is concededly the practice of the trade.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A certain amount of speculation is inherent in the undertaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>NACOCO was much more conservative than the
exporters with big capital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This short
selling was inevitable at the time in the light of other factors, such as
availability of vessels, the quantity required before being accepted for loading,
the labor needed to prepare and sack the copra for market.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To NACOCO, forward sales were a
necessity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copra could not stay long in
its hands; it would lose weight, its value decrease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Above all, <span class="SpellE">NACOCO's</span>
limited funds necessitated a quick turnover.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Copra contracts then had to be executed on short notice - at times
within twenty-four hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be
appreciated then is the difficulty of calling a formal meeting of the board.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such were the environmental circumstances when <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> went into copra trading.</p>

<p class="BODY">Long before the disputed contracts came into being, <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> contracted - by himself alone as general manager -
for forward sales of copra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the <u>fiscal</u>
<u>year</u> <u>ending</u> <st1:date year="1947" day="30" month="6"><u>June</u> <u>30</u>,
 <u>1947</u></st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> signed some 60 such
contracts for the sale of copra to divers parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During that period, from those copra sales,
NACOCO reaped a gross profit of P3,631,181.48.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So pleased was <span class="SpellE">NACOCO's</span> board of directors
that, on December 5, 1946, in <span class="SpellE">Kalaw's</span> absence, it
voted to grant him a <u>special</u> <u>bonus</u> "in recognition of the
signal achievement rendered by him in putting the Corporation's business on a
self-sufficient basis within a few months after assuming office, despite
numerous handicaps and difficulties."</p>

<p class="BODY">These previous contracts, it should be stressed, were signed by <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> <u>without</u> <u>prior</u> <u>authority</u> from the
board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said contracts were known all
along to the board members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing was
said by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aforesaid contracts
stand to prove one thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously,
NACOCO board met the difficulties attendant to forward sales by leaving the
adoption of means to end, to the sound discretion of <span class="SpellE">NACOCO's</span>
general manager <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Liberally spread on the record are instances of contracts
executed by <span class="SpellE">NACOCO's</span> general manager and submitted to
the board after their consummation, not before.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These agreements were not <span class="SpellE">Kalaw's</span> alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One at least was executed by a predecessor
way back in 1940, soon after NACOCO was chartered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a contract of lease executed on <st1:date year="1940" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1940</st1:date> by the then
general manager and board chairman, <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Rodriguez,

the lease of a space in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Soriano</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1946" day="14" month="11">November
 14, 1946</st1:date>, NACOCO, thru its general manager <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>,
sold 3,000 tons of copra to the Food Ministry, <st1:city><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:city>,
thru Sebastian <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1947" day="22" month="12">December
 22, 1947</st1:date>, when the controversy over the present contracts cropped
up, the board voted to approve a lease contract previously executed between <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> and Fidel <span class="SpellE">Isberto</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ulpiana</span> <span class="SpellE">Isberto</span> covering a
warehouse of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same
date, the board gave its nod to a contract for renewal of the services of Dr.
Manuel L. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, also on that date, the board requested <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>
to report for action <u>all</u> <u>copra</u> <u>contracts</u> signed by him
"<u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>meeting</u> <u>immediately</u> <u>following</u> <u>the</u>
<u>signing</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>contracts</u>." This practice was
observed in a later instance when, on <st1:date year="1948" day="7" month="1">January
 7, 1948</st1:date>, the board approved two previous contracts for the sale of
1,000 tons of copra each to a certain "SCAP" and a certain
"GNAPO."</p>

<p class="BODY">And more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1946" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1946</st1:date>, the board
resolved to ratify the brokerage commission of 2% of Smith Bell and Co., Ltd.,
in the sale of 4,300 long tons of copra to the French Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such ratification was necessary because, as
stated by <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> in that same meeting, "under an
existing resolution he is authorized to give a brokerage fee of only 1% on
sales of copra made through brokers." On <st1:date year="1947" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1947</st1:date>, the brokerage fee agreements of 1-1/2%
on three export contracts, and 2% on three others, for the sale of copra were
approved by the board with a proviso authorizing the general manager to pay a
commission up to the amount of 1-1/2% "<u>without</u> <u>further</u> <u>action</u>
<u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>Board.</u>" On <st1:date year="1947" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1947</st1:date>, the brokerage fee of 2% of J. <span class="SpellE">Cojuangco</span> &amp; Co. on the sale of 2,000 tons of copra was
favorably acted upon by the board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1947" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1947</st1:date>, a 2% brokerage
commission was similarly approved by the board for Pacific Trading Corporation
on the sale of 2,000 tons of copra.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted in the foregoing cases that only the brokerage
fee agreements were passed upon by the board, <u>not</u> the sales con­tracts
themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And even those fee
agreements were submitted <u>only</u> when the commission exceeded the ceiling
fixed by the board.</p>

<p class="BODY">Knowledge by the board is also discernible from other recorded
instances.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the board met on <st1:date year="1947" day="10" month="5">May
 10, 1947</st1:date>, the directors discussed the copra price situation:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a slow downward trend but belief
was entertained that the nadir might have already been reached and an
improvement in prices was expected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
view thereof, <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> informed the board that "he
intends <u>to</u> <u>wait</u> <u>until</u> <u>he</u> <u>has</u> <u>signed</u> <u>con­tracts</u>

<p class="BODY">In the board meeting of July 29, 1947, <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>
reported on the copra price conditions then current:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The copra market appeared to have become
fairly steady; it was not expected that copra prices would again rise very high
as in the unprecedented boom during January-April, 1947; the prices seemed to
oscillate between $140 to $150 per ton; a radical rise or decrease was not
indicated by the trends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> continued to say that "<u>the</u> <u>Corporation</u>

<p class="BODY">We now lift the following excerpts from the minutes of that same
board meeting of <st1:date year="1947" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1947</st1:date>:</p>

<blockquote>"521. In connection with the buying and selling of copra the

<u>followed</u> but that it is not always possible to do so for two reasons:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1) The role of the <span class="SpellE">Nacoco</span> to stabilize
the prices of copra requires that it should not cease buying even when it does
not have actual contracts of sale since the sus­pension of buying by the <span class="SpellE">Nacoco</span> will result in middlemen taking advantage of the
temporary inactivity of the Corporation to lower the prices to the detriment of
the producers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) The movement of the market is such that it may not be practical
always to wait for the consummation of contracts of sale before beginning to
buy copra.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The General Manager explained that in this connection a certain
amount of speculation is unavoidable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However he said that the <span class="SpellE">Nacoco</span> is much more
conservative than the other big exporters in this respect."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Settled jurisprudence has it that where similar acts have been
approved by the directors as a matter of general practice, custom, and policy,
the general manager may bind the company without formal authorization of the
board of directors.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
In varying language, existence of such authority is established, by proof of <u>the</u>

of the company and by the <u>knowledge</u> which the board of directors has, or

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the practice of the corporation has been to
allow its general manager to negotiate and execute contracts in its copra
trading activities for and in <span class="SpellE">NACOCO's</span> behalf <u>without</u>
prior board approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the by-laws
were to be literally followed, the board should give its stamp of prior
approval on all corporate contracts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
that board itself, by its acts and through acquiescence practically laid aside
the by-law requirement of prior approval.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the given circumstances, the <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>
contracts are valid corporate acts.</p>

<p class="BODY">4. But if more were required, we need but turn to the board's
ratification of the contracts in dispute on <st1:date year="1948" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1948</st1:date>, though it is our (and the lower court's)
belief that ratification here is nothing more than a mere formality.</p>

<p class="BODY">Authorities, great in number, are one in the idea that
"ratification by a corporation of an unauthorized act or contract by its
officers or others relates back to the time of the act or contract ratified,
and is equivalent to original authority;" and that "[t]he corporation
and the other party to the transaction are in precisely the same position as if
the act or contract had been authorized at the time."<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
The language of one case is expressive: "The adoption or ratification of a
contract by a cor­poration is nothing more nor less than the making of an
original contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The theory of
corporate ratification is <u>predicated</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>right</u> <u>of</u>
<u>a</u> <u>corporation</u> <u>to</u> <u>contract</u>, and any ratification or

<p class="BODY">Indeed, our law pronounces that "[r]<span class="SpellE">atification</span>
cleanses the contract from all its defects from the moment it was
constituted."<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
By corporate confirmation, the contracts executed by <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>
are thus purged of whatever vice or defect they may have.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, a case is here presented <span class="SpellE">whereunder</span>,
even in the face of an express by-law requirement of prior approval, the law on
corporations is not to be held so rigid and inflexible as to fail to recognize
equitable considerations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, the
conclusion inevitably is that the embattled contracts remain valid.</p>

<p class="BODY">5. It would be difficult, even with hostile eyes, to read the
record in terms of "bad faith and/or breach of trust" in the board's
ratification of the contracts without prior approval of the board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, in reality, all that we have on the
government's side of the scale is that the board knew that the contracts so
confirmed would cause heavy losses.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we have earlier expressed, <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> had
authority to execute the contracts without need of prior approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everybody, including <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>
himself, thought so, and for a long time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Doubts were first thrown on the way only when the contracts turned out
to be unprofit­able for NACOCO.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rightfully had it been said that bad faith does not simply
connote bad judgment or negligence; it imports a dishonest purpose or some
moral obliquity and conscious doing of wrong; it means breach of a known duty
thru some motive or interest or ill will; it partakes of the nature of fraud.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
Applying this precept to the given facts herein, we find that there was no
"dishonest purpose", or "some moral obliquity", or
"conscious doing of wrong", or "breach of a known duty", or
"some motive or interest or ill will" that "partakes of the
nature of fraud."</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor was it even intimated here that the NACOCO directors acted
for personal reasons, or to serve their own private interests, or to pocket
money at the expense of the corporation.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
We have had occasion to affirm that bad faith contemplates a "state of
mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or with some motive of self-interest
or ill will or for ulterior purpose."<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
Briggs vs. Spaulding, 141 U.S. 132, 148-149, 35 L. ed. 662, 669, quotes with
approval from Judge <span class="SpellE">Sharswood</span> (in <span class="SpellE">Spering's</span>
App., 71 Pa. 11), the following:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Upon a close examination of all the reported cases, although there
are many dicta not easily reconcilable, yet I have found no judgment or decree
which has held directors to account, except when they have themselves been
personally guilty of some fraud on the corporation, or have known and connived
at some fraud in others, or where such fraud might have been prevented had they
given ordinary attention to their duties. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." Plaintiff did not even dare charge its
defendant-directors with any of these malevolent acts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, the board thought that to jettison <span class="SpellE">Kalaw's</span>
contracts would contravene basic dictates of fairness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did not think of raising their voice in
protest against past contracts which brought in enormous profits to the
corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the same token, fair
dealing disagrees with the idea that similar contracts, when unprofit­able,
should not merit the same treatment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Profit or loss resulting from business ventures is no justification for
turning one's back on contracts entered into.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The truth, then, of the matter is that - in the words of the trial court
- the ratification of the contracts was "an act of simple justice and
fairness to the general manager and in the best interest of the corporation
whose prestige would have been seriously impaired by a rejection by the board
of those contracts which proved disadvantageous."<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">6. To what then may we trace the damage suffered by NACOCO?</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts yield the answer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Four typhoons wreaked havoc then on our copra-producing regions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Result:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Copra production was impaired, prices <span class="SpellE">spiralled</span>,
warehouses destroyed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quick turnovers
could not be expected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>NACOCO was not
alone in this misfortune.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record
discloses that private traders, old,<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>experienced,
with bigger facilities, were not spared; also suffered tremendous losses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Roughly estimated, eleven principal trading
concerns did run losses to about P10,300,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plain­tiff's witness <span class="SpellE">Sisenando</span>
<span class="SpellE">Barretto</span>, head of the copra marketing department of
NACOCO, observed that from late 1947 to early 1948 "there were many who
lost money in the trade."<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
NACOCO was not immune from such usual business risk.</p>

<p class="BODY">The typhoons were known to plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, NACOCO resisted the suits filed by
Louis Dreyfus &amp; Co. by pleading in its answers <u>force</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>majeure</u></span> as an affirmative defense, and there
vehemently asserted that "as a result of the said typhoons, ex­tensive
damage was caused to the coconut trees in the copra producing regions of the
Philippines and according to estimates of competent authorities, it will take
about one year until the coconut producing regions will be able to produce
their normal coconut yield, and it will take some time until the price of copra
will reach normal levels"; and that "it had never been the intention
of the contracting parties in entering into the contract in question that, in
the event of a sharp rise in the price of copra in the Philippine market pro­duced
by <u>force</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>majeure</u></span> or by causes beyond
defendant's control, the defendant should buy the copra contracted for at
exorbitant prices far beyond the buying price of the plaintiff under the
contract."<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A high regard for normal judicial admissions made in court
pleadings would suffice to deter us from permitting plaintiff to stray away <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, to charge now that the damage suffered was
because of <span class="SpellE">Kalaw's</span> negligence, or for that matter, by
reason of the board's ratification of the contracts.<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a></p>

NACOCO could have, with ease, met its contractual obligations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stock accessi­bility was no problem.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>NACOCO had 90 buying agencies spread
throughout the islands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could
purchase 2,000 tons of copra a day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
various contracts involved delivery of but 16,500 tons over a five-month
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite the typhoons, NACOCO was
still able to deliver a little short of 50% of the tonnage required under the
contracts.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the trial court correctly observed, this is a case of <span class="SpellE"><u>damnum</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>absque</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">injuria</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Conjunction of damage and wrong is here absent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There cannot be an actionable wrong if either

<p class="BODY">7. On top of all these, is that no assertion is made and no proof
is presented which would link <span class="SpellE">Kalaw's</span> acts - ratified
by the board - to a matrix for <span class="SpellE">defraudation</span> of the
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>

concedes that <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> all along thought that he had
authority to enter into the contracts; that he did so in the best interests of
the cor­poration; that he entered into the contracts in pursuance of an over­all
policy to stabilize prices, to free the producers from the clutches of the
middlemen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prices for which NACOCO
contracted in the disputed agreements, were at a level calculated to produce
profits and higher than those prevailing in the local market.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff's witness, <span class="SpellE">Barretto</span>,
categorically stated that "it would be foolish to think that one would
sign (a) contract when you are going to lose money" and that no contract
was executed "at a price unsafe for the <span class="SpellE">Nacoco</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a>
Really, on the basis of prices then prevailing, NACOCO envisioned a profit of
around P752,440.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Kalaw's</span> acts were not the result of
haphazard decisions either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> invariably consulted with <span class="SpellE">NACOCO's</span>
Chief Buyer, <span class="SpellE">Sisenando</span> <span class="SpellE">Barretto</span>,
or the Assistant General Manager.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
dailies and quotations from abroad were guideposts to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> could not have been an
insurer of profits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could not be
expected to predict the coming unpredictable typhoons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And even as typhoons supervened, <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> was not remiss in his duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He exerted efforts to stave off losses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked the Philippine National Bank to
implement its commitment to extend a P400,000.00 loan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bank did not release the loan, not even
the sum of P200,000.00, which, in October, 1947, was approved by the bank's
board of directors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In frustration, on <st1:date year="1947" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1947</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> turned to the President, complained about the bank's
short-sighted policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the end,
nothing came out of the negoti­ations with the bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>NACOCO eventually faltered in its con­tractual
obligations.</p>

<p class="BODY">That <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> cannot be tagged with <span class="SpellE"><u>crassa</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>negligentia</u></span>
or as much as simple negligence, would seem to be supported by the fact that
even as the contracts were being questioned in Congress and in the NACOCO board
