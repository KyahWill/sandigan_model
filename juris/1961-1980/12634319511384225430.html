				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tampus</span>
appealed from the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> del Norte, and <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> City
Branch I, convicting him of rape, sentencing him to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> and ordering him to pay complainant Bella
Flores the sum of P12,000 (Criminal Case No. 386).</p>

<p class="BODY">The perpetration of the alleged rape was tearfully re­counted in
court by Bella, the thirteen-year-old victim who finished the third grade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She testified that at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">nine o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1972" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1972</st1:date> she was in her house
located in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mamaylan</span>,
Barrio Baan, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Butuan</span></span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her companions were her younger brothers, two
and five years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her mother and
stepfather were in the hospital taking care of her sick brother and sister.</p>

<p class="BODY">When Bella and her brothers were already in bed, she heard <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tampus</span>, 29, married, a <u>tuba</u>
gatherer whose house was around one hundred fifty meters away and who <span class="GramE">was her nearest neighbor, calling</span> and asking her to open the
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that he wanted to borrow
the saw of her stepfather so that he could cut the bamboo which he was carrying
and make containers (<span class="SpellE"><u>sugong</u></span>) for tuba.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bella did not open the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span>
that her parents were not in the house.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> was not welcome, he
just the same entered the house by pushing the door made of bamboo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its wooden lock was broken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gavino</span>, who was
armed with a scythe, entered the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He got the saw and sawed the bamboo in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> while Bella and her brothers watched him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He made six <u>tuba</u> containers.</p>

<p class="BODY">After <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> had finished the sawing
operation, Bella told him to go home because she was sleepy but he refused to
leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that he was alone in his
house because his wife was in the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He slept on the bench in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bella placed the lamp near the door of her
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She and her brothers went inside
the bedroom to sleep.</p>

<p class="BODY">Later, or at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">two o'clock</st1:time>
in the morning (June 12), Bella was awakened because she felt that someone was
on top of her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She knew that it was <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">two o'clock</st1:time> because she heard the bell of the
Triumph log pond announcing that hour.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She saw <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span>, who was completely naked,
moving his buttocks up and down into her sexual organ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had no more panties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not know when her panties were
removed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She tried to shout but her
assailant covered her mouth with his hand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She struggled to free herself from his clutches but due to her physical
inferiority she could not dislodge him.</p>

<p class="BODY">As <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> was unable to insert his
penis into her organ he poked his two fingers into her vagina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That insertion caused her much pain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> kissed her
and touched her breasts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, he
was able to have carnal intercourse with her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She felt excruciating pain when his organ penetrated her private part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When his organ was inside her vagina, she
felt as if there was hot water inside her vagina or that some "hot
substance" was poured into it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After warning her that he would kill her and all the members of her
family if what he did to <span class="GramE">her</span> was re­vealed to other
persons, <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> returned to the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bella was scared.</p>

<p class="BODY">Bella cried until she fell asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About two hours later, she again felt that <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> was on top of her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She had forgotten to wear her panties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, he kissed her and touched her breasts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was moving his buttocks up and down (<span class="SpellE"><u>kisikisi</u></span>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She wiggled and tried to prevent him from abusing her but her efforts
were in vain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she asked <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> why he was ravishing her, he told her to keep
quiet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After he had consummated the
second assault, he left the house.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was only on July 8, or twenty-seven days later, after her
mother had returned to their home, that she confided to her parents that <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> had raped her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It took her a long time to reveal the outrage because of the threat Made
by <span class="SpellE">Tampus</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The police medico-legal officer examined Bella on <st1:date year="1972" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He found that her labia <span class="SpellE">majora</span>
and labia <span class="SpellE">minora</span> were <span class="SpellE">coaptated</span>
and that there were "old deep <span class="SpellE">hymenal</span>
lacerations" in her vagina at the three and <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">one
 o'clock</st1:time> positions and an old superficial laceration at the <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">eleven o'clock</st1:time> position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her tight vagina admitted the examiner's
index finger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctor con­cluded that
Bella had lost her virginity long before the examina­tion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Bella's statement pointing to <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tampus</span> as the rapist was taken by a policeman on <st1:date year="1972" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1972</st1:date> and sworn to before the
fiscal on <st1:date year="1972" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her mother's statement was taken by the same
policeman on <st1:date year="1972" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1972</st1:date>
and sworn to before the fiscal on <st1:date year="1972" day="4" month="9">September
 4, 1972</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Bella and her mother filed in the city court on <st1:date year="1972" day="12" month="9">Septem­ber 12, 1972</st1:date> a verified
complaint for rape against <span class="SpellE">Tampus</span> (p. 4,
Record).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gavino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tampus</span> was arrested on <st1:date year="1972" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He did not appear at the preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The city court elevated the case to the Court
of First Instance where on <st1:date year="1972" day="22" month="11">November
 22, 1972</st1:date> the fiscal filed against him <span class="GramE">an
information</span> for simple rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
already stated, he was convicted of rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, appellant's counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
contends that the trial court erred in assuming jurisdiction over the case and
in giving credence to the evidence of the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's first contention is based on the assumption that the
criminal action in this case was commenced by the filing of <span class="GramE">an
information</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That assumption is
wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated above, the victim and
her mother filed the complaint for rape.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They signed the <u>complaint</u> which was sworn to before the
fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is a sufficient compliance
with article 344 of the Revised Penal Code and section 4, Rule 110 of the Rules
of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That complaint is a part of
the record which was elevated to the Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should have been presented in evidence but
even if not offered in evidence, it is a matter of judicial notice (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Savellano</span>, L-31227, May 31, 1974, 57 SCRA 320, 324).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's insinuation that the <u>information</u> should have
been signed and sworn to by the complainant and her mother is not correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not necessary for the complainant to
sign and verify the information for rape filed by the fiscal (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Cerena</span>, 106 Phil. 570).</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused <span class="SpellE">Tampus</span> pleaded alibi as a
defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified that he was not
acquainted with the victim and that at the time the rape was committed he was
in <span class="SpellE">Mainit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>, around
ninety kilometers away from <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His alibi was corroborated by his younger
brother, Felix; his neighbor, <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Narit</span>, and his tuba customer, Antonia <span class="SpellE">Abenoja</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court in discrediting <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tampus</span>' alibi said that the testimonies of Felix <span class="SpellE">Tampus</span>, <span class="SpellE">Narit</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abenoja</span> do not inspire belief because of certain
discrepancies therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tampus</span> did not explain why
he was in <span class="SpellE">Mainit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>,
on <st1:date year="1972" day="12" month="6">June 12, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstances of his stay in that town
were not stated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one from <span class="SpellE">Mainit</span> testified that he was really in that town when the
rape was committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The delay of the complainant in divulging the alleged rape to her
mother and the police is assigned by the appellant as a circumstance casting
reasonable doubt on his guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
victim explained that she did not reveal to her mother imme­diately the
grievous outrage committed against her because she was afraid that the appellant
would make good his threat to kill her and the members of her family.</p>

<p class="BODY">One should not expect a thirteen-year-old girl to act like an
adult or a mature and experienced woman who would have the courage and
intelligence to disregard a threat on her life and the members of her family
and complain immediately that she had been forcibly deflowered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reported cases on rape contain instances
of young girls concealing for sometime the assaults on their virtue because of
the rapists' threat on their lives.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's arguments assailing complainant's credi­bility were
adequately confuted in the prosecution's brief.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An unbiased appraisal of complainant's testimony leads to the con­clusion
that she had truthfully identified the appellant as the rapist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was the neighbor of complainant girl and
was well?known to her and her kid brothers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had been to his house.<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="BODY">It is unthinkable that the thirteen-year-old victim could have
fabricated the details and circumstances recited above concerning the
commission of the rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be
asked:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>if she had not been abused by
appellant <span class="SpellE">Tampus</span>, why would she frame him up, allow
her private organ to be examined, leave the rustic peace and quiet of her
barrio, undergo the trouble and shame of a public trial in the city, and answer
embarrassing questions about her harrowing experience of having had an in­voluntary
carnal intercourse? <span class="SpellE">Tampus</span> did not adduce any reason
why the complainant would pretend that she had been raped and then point to him
as the author of that heinous offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that in a rape case the testimony of the com­plainant
"should not be received with precipitate credulity; and when the
conviction depends at any vital point upon her uncorro­borated testimony, it
should not be accepted unless her sincerity and candor are free from
suspicion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">A little
insight into human nature is of most value in judging matters of this
kind" (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span>, 51 Phil. 852, 856).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">"The books disclose too many instances of false charges of
rape, attempted rape, and kindred offenses to permit the courts to enter a
judgment of conviction of a crime of this nature without having in mind the
possibility that the complaining witness may have been actuated by some
sinister motive in bringing the charge" (U. S. vs. Ramos, 35 Phil. 671,
677).</p>

<p class="BODY">Those judicious observations are not applicable to this
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, we have a case of an artless
and guileless barrio girl, a mere teenager.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was not animated by any mercenary or dishonest motive in imputing
rape to the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had gone to
court to bring to justice the satyr whose beastliness was the cause of her loss
of chastity at an early age.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that complainant's positive, clear and convincing
testimony is sufficient to prove appellant's guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not over-thrown by his alibi which his
counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> did not care to
mention at all in his brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See People vs. <span class="SpellE">Delfinado</span>, 61 Phil. 694
and People vs. <span class="SpellE">Dazo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tiangzon</span>,
58 Phil. 420.)</span> She testi­fied at four hearings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was subjected to a grueling
cross-examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She stuck to her
testimony that <span class="GramE">appellant</span> <span class="SpellE">Tampus</span>
raped her.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime alleged and proven in this case is simple rape
aggravated by dwelling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE">p<u>erpetua</u></span> was correctly imposed by the trial
court (Arts. 63 and 335, Revised Penal Code).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the trial court's judgment is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against the
appellant.</span></p>
