were amended, there were three other accused originally included, namely, Tony <span class="SpellE">Zarcal</span>, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Timcang</span> and Jesus <span class="SpellE">Maunes</span> Jr., but with leave of the trial court, they were
excluded by the fiscal on the ground that the benefit of the second stage of

<p class="BODY">The cases against the two accused Jose <span class="SpellE">Inutan</span>

had died even before these cases were actually filed with the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts, as stated in the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
brief, are:</p>

<blockquote>"At about <st1:time minute="30" hour="9">9:30 o'clock</st1:time>
in the morning of <st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1966</st1:date>,
while Sgt. Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>, Cpl <span class="SpellE">Jalop</span>,
and Pat. Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Galve</span>, all members of the <span class="SpellE">Nasipit</span> Police, were at the police station (p. 29, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, May 31, 1971), accused Jesus G. Ruiz, who is the President
of the Victory Stevedoring and Labor Union, commonly known as the VISLU,
arrived thereat with Ben <span class="SpellE">Abian</span> riding in a pick-up
car (pp. 29, 30, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, May 31, 1967).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then and there, Jesus G. Ruiz angrily
questioned Pat. <span class="SpellE">Galve</span>, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'<span class="SpellE">Galve</span>, where is
that Honda which I donated, why do you al­low it to be used by civilians?' <span class="SpellE">Galve</span> replied:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'Because it was used by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Alota</span>' (p. 30, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, May 31, 1967).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon hearing this answer, Jesus G. Ruiz said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'You policemen are all stupid.' Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> stood up and inquired of Jesus G. Ruiz, 'What is
that?' and Pat. <span class="SpellE">Galve</span> also asked the latter, 'What is
that Bay, what are the mistakes of the policemen?' Then Jesus G. Ruiz said,
'Bay, you have nothing to do with this.' Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>,
answered Jesus G. Ruiz:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Why did you say
we policemen are stupid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am angry
because I am a policeman also.' Thereafter, Jesus G. Ruiz, in disgust,
immediately rode on his pick-up and went away (p. 31, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
May 31, 1967) <span class="SpellE">criss</span>-crossing the town streets (p. 33,
<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, May 31, 1967) until his pick-up was stopped and
checked at the <span class="SpellE">Nasipit</span> <span class="SpellE">Cubi-Cubi</span>
Check point which was then guarded by Pat. <span class="SpellE">Iglesias</span>
who later reported to the police station that Jesus G. Ruiz was mad at him for
effecting the check on his (Jesus G. Ruiz's) pick-up car (p. 3, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, June 1, 1967).</blockquote>

<blockquote>That same night at around eight o'clock, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bito</span> Ruiz was at her home located at <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nasipit</span> <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> del Norte (pp. 162, 163, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
Jan. 31, 1967), preparing something as it was the birthday of her sister, <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among the
people present in her house were her sisters <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Cleotilde</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mr. &amp; Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Teofisto</span> <span class="SpellE">Olamit</span>,
and her younger brother, Sgt. Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>, who was
with Lt. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Felias</span> and
Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Galve</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Nasipit</span>
Police force (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 165-166, Jan. 31, 1967; p.
144, Jan. 23, 1967).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These three members
of the <span class="SpellE">Nasipit</span> Police arrived in <span class="SpellE">Libertad's</span>
house in a police patrol jeep they parked on the right side of the road, its
rear beside the edge of the hallow blocks near the driveway of the VISLU office
located in front of the house of <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span> and
partially blocking the driveway (pp. 11-12, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Feb.
24, 1967).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Before finishing their supper, <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span>
heard the sound of a pick-up stop in front of the VISLU office, (p. 169, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Jan. 31, 1967).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, she went to the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> and heard the
loud voice of her uncle, Jesus G. Ruiz, shouting 'wrong parking, wrong parking'
(p. 170, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Jan. 31, 1967). <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span>
at once informed Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> of what she heard (p. 171,
<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Jan. 31, 1967) and the latter and his police
companions transferred to the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> and continued
eating there (Id.).<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At this juncture a
cousin of <span class="SpellE">Libertad's</span> husband <span class="SpellE">Melquiades</span>
Ruiz arrived (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 141, Jan. 23, 1967; pp.
171-172, Jan. 31, 1967) and told Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Galve</span> to come
down as <span class="SpellE">as</span> accused Jesus G. Ruiz had something to
tell him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Galve</span>
obliged and went down, followed by <span class="SpellE">Melquiades</span> and Lt.
<span class="SpellE">Felias</span> (p. 7, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, June 6,
1967).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Libertad</span> who, at that moment was by her
window near the door opposite the VISLU office (p. 173, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
Jan. 31, 1967) saw the police patrol jeep along the other side of the street
facing towards the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> and Jesus G. Ruiz' green
Scout International pick-up facing towards the wharf (pp. 173-176, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Jan. 31, 1967).</blockquote>

<blockquote>When Lt. <span class="SpellE">Felias</span> and Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Galve</span> reached their parked police patrol jeep, a heated
exchange of words ensued between Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Galve</span> and
accused Jesus G. Ruiz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter asked,
'Why is it that this jeep is parked in front of the VISLU office when this is
not a parking place?' Lt. <span class="SpellE">Felias</span> approached Jesus G.
Ruiz, patted the latter's shoulder and told him it was not <span class="SpellE">Galve</span>
but he who drove the jeep and offered to push the jeep, as it had no starter,
if the same obstructed the view of the VISLU office (pp. 7, 8, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, June 6, 1967).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At this juncture, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> came down the
house of his sister <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span>, and admonished accused
Jesus G. Ruiz to talk softly and not to shout (<st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> told
Jesus G. Ruiz that the latter was abusive ('<span class="SpellE">abusador</span>')
and challenged him to a draw (p. 206, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Nov. 21,
1968).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused Jesus G. Ruiz replied 'Let
us see tomorrow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of you will be
fired out.' (p. 9, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, June 6, 1967) and immediately
rode on his green pick-up and drove to town at full speed (<st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After Jesus G. Ruiz had left, Lt. <span class="SpellE">Felias</span>, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> and Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Galve</span> pushed the jeep and was able to start the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, they did not immediately leave for
the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> because Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>
had to get his jacket he left in the house of <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the latter's companions were waiting
for Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>, with the jeep's motor already running,
the accused Jesus G. Ruiz returned from the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span>
with accused Alfredo, <span class="SpellE">Guno</span>, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Zarcal</span>, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Maunes</span>, Jr., Romeo <span class="SpellE">Dumangcas</span> (p. 11, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, June 6,
1967) and Jose <span class="SpellE">Inutan</span> (p. 12, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
June 6, 1967) riding on the same green pick-up and stopped in front of the
VISLU office (pp. 10-11, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, June 6, 1967).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They stepped down from the pick-up, scattered
themselves and took their respective positions:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Guno</span> went to the <span class="SpellE">Ebarle</span>
dilapidated truck near the house of <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span> (p. 14, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, June 6, 1967).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dumangcas</span> together with the others went to the VISLU office
(<st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>); while Jesus G. Ruiz stayed
near the pick-up and shouted:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Tell Sgt.
<span class="SpellE">Bito</span> that I want to encounter him.' (p. 15, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, June 6, 1967).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At that time Lt. <span class="SpellE">Felias</span> was sitting on the
driver's seat of the jeep with Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Galve</span> seated
beside him, while Patrolman Granada was leaning on the jeep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a sudden, a burst of gun fire came
from Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Guno</span> who was by the dilapidated
truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>
who had just reached the road on his way to the patrol jeep was hit on the leg,
Lt. <span class="SpellE">Felias</span> alighted from the left side of the jeep
and while going towards the front, he saw Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>
already limping (p. 16, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, June 6, 1967).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Galve</span> has jumped out of the jeep upon being fired upon by
Jose <span class="SpellE">Inutan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Galve</span> returned the fire prompting <span class="SpellE">Inutan</span>
to flee towards a dark alley with <span class="SpellE">Galve</span> in hot
pursuit (pp. 33-36, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1967</st1:date>; p. 2 of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. '6',
p. 16, <span class="SpellE">Rec</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gunfires</span> directed towards the patrol jeep were also seen
coming from the office of the VISLU and the green pick-up truck (p. 24, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Feb. 24, 1967).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Patrolman <st1:city><st1:place>Granada</st1:place></st1:city> took cover
and crawled under the jeep (p. 23, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Feb. 24,
1967) from where he saw Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> drew his pistol and
fired, but thereafter the latter ran out of bullets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Patrolman <st1:city><st1:place>Granada</st1:place></st1:city>

not able to catch it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the time Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> turned his face towards Patrolman Granada, he was
immediately shot at the mouth by accused Jesus G. Ruiz (p. 26, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Feb. 24, 1967), killing him (Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>)
on the spot (p. 27, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Feb. 24, 1967).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, accused Jesus G. Ruiz nudged and
prodded with his right foot Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito's</span> body and
after finding him already dead, he (Jesus G. Ruiz) moved backward (p. 29, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Feb. 24, 1967).</blockquote>

<blockquote>With the lights coming from the electric lamp post of the VISLU
office, as well as from <span class="SpellE">Libertad's</span> home and the other
houses, Lt. <span class="SpellE">Felias</span> saw accused Jesus G. Ruiz fire at
him with a Thompson submachine gun that hit both of his thighs (p. 17, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, June 6, 1967).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When he fell, he saw Patrolman Granada crawling under the jeep (p. 18, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, June 6, 1967) and called the latter for help (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 30, Feb. 24, 1967); p. 19, June 6, 1967).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Patrolman <st1:city><st1:place>Granada</st1:place></st1:city>

office, they were obliged to take cover (p. 31, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,

pleaded with Jesus G. Ruiz not to finish Lt. <span class="SpellE">Felias</span>
who was then already unconscious (p. 32, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Feb.

behind Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> lying on the very spot where he was

<p class="BODY">According to the lower court, the accused Jesus G. Ruiz testified
to the following:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
that <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> answered that he was abusing and challenged
him to a draw; that their distance from each other was more than two meters at
this very moment; that he answered him that he will not challenge <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> to a draw because he is a policeman; however, he will
meet him the next day in front of the office of the mayor and the police if he
wants a draw; that his purpose was to deter him in <span class="SpellE">Bito's</span>
desire to fight him to a draw; that he turned his back on <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>
and drove his pick-up and went to his house arriving there at past 8:30 in the
evening; that he went upstairs and told his wife about what happened; that his
wife laughed and remarked:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Is there a
policeman who will challenge you?'; that he stayed in his house sitting for
almost an hour; that he noticed that there were policemen coming from the jeep;
that he rode on his pick-up for <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span> passing by
Eugene Restaurant at about 9:30 P.M.; that upon arriving at <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span>
for the second time that very night, he saw the police jeep moved already from
where it was parked by the policemen; that his purpose in going to <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span> was to verify the relief, the night shift of VISLU
laborers at 10:00 o'clock then loading on a Japanese boat; that the policemen
he saw were <span class="SpellE">Felias</span> sitting at the rear of the jeep, <span class="SpellE">Galve</span> by the side of the jeep, and <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>
beside <span class="SpellE">Galve</span>; that he saw Granada after he parked his
pick-up in front of the house of Luis <span class="SpellE">Faelnar</span>, and
when he went down his pick-up, he was met by Granada who told him the jeep was
already moved forward; that it was while he was conversing with Granada for a
few minutes that he heard a loud voice challenging him to a draw; that at that
moment, he moved backward with his left foot so he would be in a position to
face his challenger, but when he moved backward, he heard a shot; that the
gunshot came from the rear of the police patrol jeep; that he did not see <span class="SpellE">Felias</span>, <span class="SpellE">Galve</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>, but the gunfire came from behind the patrol jeep;
that he sought cover by hitting the ground; that after the first shot, came
several shots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So he continued crawling
on the ground in order to escape from the gunfire; that he slid because the
ground was slippery and sandy; that he continued rolling towards his pick-up;
that the several shots that followed the first shot came from the patrol jeep;
that when he reached his <span class="SpellE">pic-kup</span>, he turned to the
front, crawled to the front of his pick-up; that he did not hear any shots
anymore; that he stood and observed the situation from where he could not be
seen from where the shots came from.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, shots rang again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Fearing he was in danger, he immediately ran in a stooping position passing
by the side of the VISLU office to its back.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He went to the back of his office because the wall at the back is
cemented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He thought of reporting the
incident to the authorities, and was thinking of escaping at the other passage,
but there were a few shots still so he thought of going back to his
pick-up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went running back to his
pick-up, again in a stooping position.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon reaching his pick-up, he opened the door, started immediately its
motor, and drove away towards the wharf; that on the night of the incident he
had with him a .38 cal. revolver, Smith &amp; Wesson.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the shooting, he held his revolver
which was in its holster to prevent it from falling; that he does not know
where the gun-fires came from; he does not know who was being fired upon; that
he knows Jose <span class="SpellE">Inutan</span>; that he remembers having met
him on the night of December 16, 1966; that after he drove his pick-up to a
distance of about ten meters, somebody tapped the body of his pick-up; that he asked
who it was; that the answer was '<span class="SpellE">Tokloy</span>.' He said he
was wounded and would like me to bring him to the hospital; that he allowed <span class="SpellE">Inutan</span> to ride with him and proceeded to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He drove his pick-up straight to the PC
barracks and stopped in front of the guardhouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked the guard if Capt. <span class="SpellE">Collado</span> was in but the Guard replied:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'No, he is at the Elite Restaurant.' So the
witness asked the guard that he be provided with a PC guard so that Capt. <span class="SpellE">Collado</span> will believe him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon remembering that he was not able to bring with him his permit to
carry a firearm, he left his firearm at the guardhouse; that that was the
firearm he carried with him on the night of the incident; that he deposited the
same with Jose <span class="SpellE">Cabillo</span> of the PC; that said PC examined
the number of rounds and gave him a receipt for it, Exhibit 10; that he drove
to the Elite Restaurant with the PC; that the PC went upstairs and he waited
downstairs; that he met Capt. <span class="SpellE">Collado</span>; that he told
Capt. <span class="SpellE">Collado</span> of the incident at <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span>;
that they went back to the PC headquarters; that upon arrival, Capt. <span class="SpellE">Collado</span> ordered that the bugle be sounded; that the men
assembled and <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Esparagoza</span>
was ordered to take him to the guardhouse; that he wanted to go to <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span> with Capt. <span class="SpellE">Collado</span>, but the
latter told him to stay; that he stayed at the guardhouse from the evening of
December 16, to 28, 1966; that on December 17, 1966, he was investigated
relative to the <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span> incident; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> "<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

brought him to the other wharf near the government wharf; that they took <span class="SpellE">Eliazar's</span> jeep; that they stayed for about thirty minutes
there at a small store owned by a certain <span class="SpellE">Fely</span>; that
from there, he went home; that <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span> <span class="SpellE">Guno</span> lives at and is the owner of the Eugene Restaurant;
that they took supper there and went to the dance at <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span>
near the house of Joe Jimenez; that while waiting for a tricycle, a green pick-up
passed by owned by accused Jesus G. Ruiz; that he was driving it; that he saw,
among others inside the pick-up, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Maunes</span>, Jr.;

being invited by <span class="SpellE">Maunes</span>, Jr., he rode on it at the
rear; that <span class="SpellE">Maunes</span> Jr. and he were at the rear; that
there were three persons in front, <span class="SpellE">Dumangcas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Inutan</span> among others; that they drove towards <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span>; that the pick-up stopped at the VISLU office; that

<p class="BODY">The contention of the accused Jesus G. Ruiz that the testimonies

<p class="BODY">While it is true that <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span>
testified that Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Guno</span> and Romeo <span class="SpellE">Dumancas</span> also fired at Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>,
they could not have caused the fatal wound sustained by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Guno</span> could have only hit the leg of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> who was seen limping immediately after the first shot

only fired towards Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> and also towards the

</span>Therefore, <span class="SpellE">Dumancas</span> could not have been

Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> does not necessarily make her a biased

appellant did not go to the PC headquarters after the shooting to surrender but
to report the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed he never
evinced any desire to own the responsibility for the killing of the
deceased."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defense claims that the accused Jesus G. Ruiz was intoxicated
at the time of the shooting incident because he was allegedly drinking <span class="SpellE"><u>Tanduay</u></span> liquor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He even offered prosecution witness Antonio <span class="SpellE">Zarcal</span>

intoxicated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record has no evidence that shows that the liquor taken by Jesus
G. Ruiz was of such quantity as to have blurred his reason and deprived him of
self control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said circums­tance must
first be established before drunkenness may be considered as a mitigating
circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the last
paragraph of Art. 15, Revised Penal Code, fails to provide for the degree of
intoxication needed to mitigate the penalty for an offense, it should be such
an intoxication that would diminish the agent's capacity to know the injustice
of his acts, and his will to act accordingly.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

by prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Zarcal</span> drinking <span class="SpellE"><u>Tanduay</u></span> liquor up to the shooting incident, did not
show that he was in such a state of intoxication that would mitigate his
liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is significant to note that the defense only interposed on
appeal the alleged mitigating circumstance of drunkenness of Jesus G.
Ruiz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said accused never claimed during
the trial that he was drunk at any time during the shooting incident in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the testimony
of accused Jesus G. Ruiz to show that he was drunk or intoxicated during the
said incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, this Court finds that the mitigating circumstance of
having acted in vindication of a grave offense should be appreciated in favor
of the accused Ruiz in so far as the killing of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>
is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower Court made the
following findings and conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>"14.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That accused Jesus
G. Ruiz and <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> were caught in an argument over the
parking of the jeep that caused Jesus Ruiz to leave the place hurriedly in his
green pick-up towards town;" (p. 70, Sentence; p. 641, Rec.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as admitted by both the prosecution and
the defense, it ended up in an argument between accused Jesus G. Ruiz and <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> where the prosecution contends that <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> advised accused Jesus G. Ruiz to talk softly, and not
to shout and where accused Jesus G. Ruiz contends <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>
asked him what he wanted, called him '<span class="SpellE">abusador</span>',
culminating in his being challenged by <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> to a
draw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a balance of probabilities is
struck, the only rational conclusion consistent with the natural order of
things and the experience of man, is that accused Jesus G. Ruiz must have felt
insulted, if not slighted, if not hurt, if not deeply offended, inconvenienced
as he was by the jeep and then ending up only to be called '<span class="SpellE">abusador</span>'
and challenged to a draw by <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
X-12), which doubtless, fired in accused Jesus G. Ruiz a desire to get even

<p class="BODY">The question of whether or not a certain personal offense is
grave is dependent upon such factors as the social standing of the person, the
place, and the time when the insult was made.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case at bar, the accused Ruiz was the President of the Victory
Stevedoring and Labor Union (VISLU).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering that he was called an '<span class="SpellE">abusador</span>'
and challenged to a draw by the deceased, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>,
in the presence of Lt. <span class="SpellE">Felias</span> and Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Galve</span> and right in front of his own office building where
his laborers were then sup­posed to be reporting preparatory to a loading job,
the act of the accused Ruiz in subsequently killing Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The accused Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Guno</span>
submits that the foregoing conclusion is based on mere suspicion.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention proceeds from the erroneous assumption that the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> portion of the decision constitutes the sole
basis of the lower court in convicting the accused <span class="SpellE">Guno</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
observations are mere justifications for the court's refusal to believe accused
<span class="SpellE">Guno's</span> pretensions that he did not have prior
knowledge about the forthcoming showdown between them and Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> and his police companions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conviction of Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Guno</span> is
anchored on the strong evidence adduced pointing to him as the person who shot
Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> on the left leg.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not only the testimony of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span> <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> Ruiz which proves
this point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The corroborative

</span>Therefore, the allegation of the accused <span class="SpellE">Guno</span>
that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span> <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>
Ruiz could not have possibly seen accused <span class="SpellE">Guno</span> fire

by <span class="SpellE">Collado</span>, cannot affect the conclusion of the lower
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the second error assigned, the accused <span class="SpellE">Guno</span> attempts to discredit the testimony of witness <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span> <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> Ruiz by invoking
the maxim or rule of <span class="SpellE"><u>falsus</u></span><u> in <span class="SpellE">unos</span>, <span class="SpellE">falsus</span> in omnibus</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is pointed out that a portion of her
testimony implicating the accused <span class="SpellE">Melquiades</span> Ruiz was
disregarded by the lower court because <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span>
"was testifying more from emotion than what she actually saw from the
window of her house in the semi-darkness of the night of the incident,
specially if we are to remember that <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> was her
younger brother."</p>

<p class="BODY">The cited maxim deals only with the weight of evidence and is not
a positive rule of law or of universal application.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
It should not be applied to portions of the testimony corro­borated by other

Furthermore, the rule <span class="SpellE"><u>falsus</u></span><u> in <span class="SpellE">unos</span>, <span class="SpellE">falsus</span> in omnibus</u> is
not mandatory but merely sanctions a disregard of the testimony of a witness if
the circumstances so warrant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the
complete disregard of all the testimony of witness on this ground, his
testimony must have been false as to a material point, and that the witness

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the lower court disregarded that portion of <span class="SpellE">Libertad's</span> testimony implicating <span class="SpellE">Melquiades</span>
Ruiz because she was then testifying more from emotion so that it cannot be
said that she consciously and deliberately intended to falsify a material
point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, her entire testimony need
not be disregarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her testimony that
accused <span class="SpellE">Guno</span> shot Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>
at the left leg is sufficiently corroborated by the testimonies of Pat. <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> Granada, Lt. Amador <span class="SpellE">Felias</span>
and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Timcang</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of the accused <span class="SpellE">Guno</span> that
the prosecution witnesses Pat. Granada, Pat. <span class="SpellE">Galve</span> and

<p class="BODY">Under the third assignment of error, the accused <span class="SpellE">Guno</span> assails the lower court's finding of conspiracy among <span class="SpellE">Guno</span> and Ruiz and contends that inasmuch as the prosecution
evidence shows that the accused <span class="SpellE">Guno</span> boarded the
pick-up at Eugene restaurant without any conversation having taken place

that there was no time to reach an agreement to commit the crime since there
was a very short span of time between the time when the accused Ruiz was deeply
offended as he was called "<span class="SpellE">abusador</span>" and
challenged by <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> to a draw and the time when accused
Ruiz came back to <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span> with <span class="SpellE">Inutan</span>

and that the accused <span class="SpellE">Guno</span> was only a chance passenger
in the pick-up, because he was going to a party and he took advantage of the
only available transportation then.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The contentions of accused <span class="SpellE">Guno</span> are not
meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a well-settled rule
that conspiracy need not be proved by direct evidence and may be deduced from
the mode and manner in which the offense was perpetrated.<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The finding that there was conspiracy between the two accused
Ruiz and <span class="SpellE">Guno</span> was proven by the following:</p>

<blockquote>"1. In their
boarding together of accused Jesus G. Ruiz' pick-up minutes after Jesus G. Ruiz
admitted he was called by <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> '<span class="SpellE">abusador</span>'
and was then and there challenged by <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> to a draw;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their proceeding immediately to <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span> where <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> was;</blockquote>

accused Jesus G. Ruiz after their shooting of <span class="SpellE">Felias</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bito</span> and <span class="SpellE">Galve</span>, except
crossing the canal breast deep with sea water behind the house of <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span>;</blockquote>

<span class="SpellE">Inutan</span> to the hospital for treatment right after the

complaint against <span class="SpellE">Felias</span> and <span class="SpellE">Galve</span>,
who together with deceased <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>, shot him and wounded
him by his buttocks."<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court finds no merit in the contention of the accused <span class="SpellE">Guno</span> that there could be no conspiracy because there was
very little time for them to have reached the agreement to commit the
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prevailing rule is that
"unlike in evident premeditation, where a sufficient time must elapse to afford
full opportunity for meditation and reflection and for the perpetrators to
deliberate on the consequences of their intended deed,<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a>
conspiracy arises on the very instant the plotters agree, expressly or
impliedly, to commit the felony and forthwith decide to pursue it." The
above-enumerated eight circumstances prove the presence of conspiracy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since conspiracy has been established, the rule is every
conspirator is responsible for the acts of the others in the furtherance of
conspiracy and are liable as co-principals.<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>
Therefore, although the shot fired by the accused <span class="SpellE">Guno</span>
at Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> only hit the latter's left leg, the
former is still liable as co-principal for the death of said Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, the
accused <span class="SpellE">Guno</span> should be held liable as co-principal
for the injuries inflicted upon <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Felias</span> and Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Galve</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the fourth assignment of error, the accused <span class="SpellE">Guno</span> contends that the lower court erred in allowing itself
to be swayed in rendering the decision under review by its prejudice and bias
against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused <span class="SpellE">Guno</span> cited the following incidents to prove his contention:</p>

<blockquote>"(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span> <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> Ruiz, prosecution witness, was under direct examination
and appeared to be having some difficulty in answering the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>

about the co-accused <span class="SpellE">Dumangcas</span>, who had already died,
the Court, without giving counsel a chance to explain the materiality of the
question, sustained the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> objection, saying:</blockquote>

without merit because, as stated by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style=""> </span>The incidents cited by appellant <span class="SpellE">Guno</span> (pp. 40, 41, Brief for Appellant Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Guno</span>) are merely innocuous and isolated remarks from the
lower court during the long drawn out trial of these two criminal cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were brought about by the lower court's
obvious desire to expedite the proceedings with regard to the proper
presentation of evidence by both parties.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the interest of justice, courts have
discretion to order the striking out of any portion of a witness' testimony if
the same is not responsive to the question propounded or touched on matters

the lower court may be inferred out of a short portion of ap­pellant <span class="SpellE">Guno's</span> direct testimony (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
Vol. III, p. 601).</blockquote>

active participation taken by a judge in the conduct of a trial motivated by a
desire to expedite the proceedings and direct the course thereof in accordance
with the real issues involved should not be taken as interest nor partiality
nor hostility on the part of the judge (Ventura vs. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>,

ignore the other remarks and or rulings of the lower court which are favorable

questions even if they are improper, irrelevant and immaterial to the issues

judges should take a leading part by directing counsel to submit evidence on
facts, by asking clarifying questions and by showing an interest in its speedy

<p class="BODY">The foregoing discussion also disposes of the fifth and sixth
errors assigned.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of the accused <span class="SpellE">Guno</span>
under the seventh error assigned that the killing of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>
was not murder but only homicide on the ground that there was neither treachery
or evident premeditation is well taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">After analyzing the testimonies of the witnesses for the
prosecution and the defense, the trial court found that the shooting incident
took place in the following manner:</p>

<blockquote>"TO begin with, the whole incident on the night of <st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1966</st1:date> started with the
partial blocking by <span class="SpellE">Felias</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Galve</span> of their police patrol jeep by the driveway
of the VISLU office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This prompted accused
Jesus G. Ruiz to verify as to who drove the same, and to ask that the jeep be
moved forward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as admitted by both
the prosecution and the defense, it ended up in an argument between accused
Jesus G. Ruiz and <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> where the prosecution contends
that <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> advised accused Jesus G. Ruiz to talk
softly, and not to shout, and where accused Jesus G. Ruiz contends <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> asked him what he wanted, called him '<span class="SpellE">abusador</span>,' culminating in his being challenged by <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> to a draw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a
balance of probabilities is struck, the only rational conclusion consistent
with the natural order of things and the experience of man, is that accused
Jesus G. Ruiz must have felt insulted, if not slighted, if not hurt, if not
deeply offended, inconvenienced as he was by the partial blocking of his
driveway by the jeep and then ending up only to be called '<span class="SpellE">abusador</span>'
and challenged to a draw by <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> (Exhibit X-12),
which, doubtless, fired in accused Jesus G. Ruiz a desire to get even with <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>BUT finding himself alone before <span class="SpellE">Felias</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> and <span class="SpellE">Galve</span>, who were armed as
they were supposed to be being police officers, could not make a move
then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This prompted accused Jesus G. Ruiz
to leave hurriedly in his green pick-up for town, and minutes later came back
with deceased <span class="SpellE">Inutan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dumangcas</span>,
accused <span class="SpellE">Guno</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zarcal</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Maunes</span>, Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be it
remembered that accused Jesus G. Ruiz left <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span>
after being called '<span class="SpellE">abusador</span>' by <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>,
and to top it all, after he was challenged by <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> to
a draw, as testified to by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, the
only rational conclusion consistent with the natural order of things and the
experience of man is that accused Jesus G. Ruiz, in his second going to <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span>, this time in company with <span class="SpellE">Inutan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Dumangcas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Guno</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zarcal</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Maunes</span>, Jr. was
hell-bent for a showdown with <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO, it was not a surprising thing, in the considered opinion of the
Court, that upon accused Jesus G. Ruiz' second arrival in <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span>
minutes after he was called by <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> '<span class="SpellE">abusador</span>,' and was challenged by the latter to a draw, this
time in company with <span class="SpellE">Inutan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dumangcas</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Guno</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zarcal</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Maunes</span>, Jr., all hell broke loose all of a sudden."<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">From the foregoing facts, it is clear
that there was neither treachery nor evident premeditation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Evident premeditation was not present in the case at bar because
there was no "sufficient lapse of time between the determination and
execution to allow him to reflect upon the consequences of his act."<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a></p>

in the evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shooting took place
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 o'clock</st1:time> that same night

was not sufficient time for the two accused to coolly and serenely think and

reflect and deliberate on the crime they planned to commit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The attack on the policemen by Jesus G. Ruiz and Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Guno</span> was not sudden.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, there was already a previous altercation between the policemen

Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Guno</span>, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Zarcal</span>,
Jesus <span class="SpellE">Maunes</span>, Jr. and Romeo <span class="SpellE">Dumancas</span>
were riding in the same pick-up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
stopped in front of the VISLU office, stepped down from the pick-up, and took
different positions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Guno</span> went to a truck near <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Dumancas</span>, together with the others, went to the VISLU
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused, Jesus G. Ruiz, went
near the pick-up and shouted "Tell Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>
that I want to encounter him." The accused gave a warning to the policeman
before the former opened fire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bito</span> was able to return the fire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The policemen could seek cover and fire
back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a shoot-out, plain and
simple, between the policemen on the one hand, and the two accused and their
companions on the other hand.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the facts found by the trial court, it is evident that the
two accused did not employ means to commit the crime without risk to
themselves.</p>
