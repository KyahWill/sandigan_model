				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On February 27, 1963, the Development Bank of the Philippines,
successor of the now defunct Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, both to be
referred to hereinafter as the Bank, filed an action in the Court of First
Instance of Manila against the Nation­al Merchandising Corporation (likewise
referred to hereinafter as NAMERCO), John, Paul and Alfonso, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>, to recover the total sum of P554,632.61, plus
interest thereon at 6% per annum from December 5, 1962 up to the date of
payment, plus reasonable attor­ney's fees and costs of suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The principal amount sought to be recovered
was the unpaid balance due on the four (4) promissory notes attached to, and
made an integral part of the complaint, executed jointly and severally by said
defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 19 of the same year the defendants filed an answer, with
a counterclaim, wherein, after denying some of the allegations made in the
complaint and admitting the others, they interposed the following af­firmative
and special defenses:</p>

<blockquote>"1.-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The alleged promissory notes and mortgage
contracts mentioned in paragraph 3 of the herein complaint did not and do not
express the true intent of the parties thereto; and the said promissory notes
and mortgage contracts were and are merely sim­ulated for the farmers named in
the said mortgage contracts, so that they are un enforceable;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>2.-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
alleged mortgage contracts mentioned in said paragraph 3 of the com­plaint were
and are void and unenforceable, the plaintiff well know that at the time they
were executed the chattels covered by such mortgage contracts the defendant Na­tional
Merchandising corporation was not the absolute owner thereof, as they had been
already sold previously to the differ­ent farmers or persons named or mentioned
in said mortgage contracts, and the execu­tion of said promissory notes and
contracts by defendants were in accordance with the wishes of the plaintiff;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">3.-</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The amounts represented by the prom­issory
notes mentioned in paragraph 3 of the complaint were in fact in payments by the
plaintiff to herein defendant National Mer­chandising Corporation for the
benefit and to the credit of the farmers named in said mortgage contracts, and
representing about 50% of the total selling prices or value of the equipment or
chattels previously sold by defendant National Merchandising to said farmers;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>4.-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
the foreclosures of the alleged chattel mortgages, the plaintiff has renounced
and waived whatever right it might have on the promissory notes mentioned in
paragraph 3 of the complaint, or on any balance there might be due <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">5.-</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff has no cause of action against
the defendants upon the said prom­issory notes and mortgage contracts, as the
same were and are only a simulation of the real obligors and nature of the
obligations;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">6.-</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The real owners of the properties covered by
the said mortgage contracts as well as the real debtors to the plaintiff for
the amounts covered by said promissory notes were and are the farmers named in
said mortgage contracts, who have not beam made parties in this case and in the
foreclosures thereof, and in whose possession and under whose control the
properties were taken from by the Pro­vincial Sheriff;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>7.-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
sales at public auction of the mortgaged properties under the said mortgage
contracts were made and conducted in the manner against the direc­tion of the
defendants to sell the pro­perties separately in order to attract and bring
bidders and to obtain the most likely the highest prices or values <span class="SpellE">there­for</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>8.-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
alleged mortgaged properties have the total value, as stated by the plaintiff
in said mortgage contracts, of P1,107,181.46, but herein plaintiff had
allegedly acquired them for only P67,400.00 very unconscionable, shocking,
depreci­ated price or consideration;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">9.-</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The order or writ of attachment issued herein
has been obtained by the plaintiff improperly and irregularly, and that the
defendants have never at any time ever thought of disposing of their proper­ties
in order to defraud their creditors;</blockquote>

<blockquote>10<span class="GramE">.-</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff, well knowing that by having the
properties sold as a whole lot none could compete with it in the bid­ding <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, and it knowing that there exists no redemption,
and believing that the defendants have properties to go after, had the
properties sold as a whole lot and against the direction of the defendants, and
had caused the properties to be sold to itself for a conscience-shocking,
unconscionably depreciated price or consideration; x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Their counterclaim was for the recovery of damages amounting to
over a million pesos allegedly suffered by them due to alleged unlawful or
malicious and unjust acts committed by the Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter's answer to de­fendants'
counterclaim alleged the following defenses:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in 15pt 0.1in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: normal;">"A-
As to the First Counterclaim,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It specifically denies each and every
allegation in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 thereof, the truth of the matter being that
the various loans granted by the plaintiff to the defendants were all applied
for and obtained by them for their exclusive use and benefit, binding
themselves, jointly and severally, to repay the same in accordance with the
terms and condi­tions of the mortgage contracts and promissory notes they
executed in favor of the plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The defendants cannot deny that the defendant NAMERCO owned the
mortgaged properties at the time of the <span class="GramE">mortgage,</span>
otherwise, it would not have constituted a mortgage thereon in favor of the
plain­tiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the mortgaged
properties are owned by the NAMERCO is so stated in the mortgage contracts
executed by it, through its President, the defendant John <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>,
who declared under oath that the same were executed to secure a just and valid
obli­gation and were not entered into for the purpose of fraud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For defendants to in­sist that the NAMERCO was
not the owner of the properties at the time they were mortgaged would, in
effect, amount to a confession that they were in bad faith when they obtained
the loans from the plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It likewise denies specifically the allegations
in paragraphs 4 and 5 thereof, the same being conclusions of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fur­thermore, the defendants cannot contest
the amount realized from the auction sales of the mortgaged properties since
they were not precluded from participating therein and offer bids which they
believe to be reasonable for the properties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It should be noted that the auctions sales were held on different dates
and in no instance did the defendants or anyone of them questions the regularity
of the pro­ceedings while they were then being con­ducted by the Sheriff.</blockquote>

the Second Counterclaim,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has no knowledge or information sufficient
to form or justify a belief as to the truth of the allegations in paragraphs 1
and 2 thereof and, therefore, denies the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That the defendants, as alleged by them, have enjoyed and are enjoying a
high commercial credit end standing, etc., cannot possibly alter the fact that
the defendants obtained the loans in question from the plain­tiff and have not
paid the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the present suit
against them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, as to the allegation in paragraph 3
that by reason of the issu­ance of the writs of attachment against their
properties, the plaintiff has caused the defendants moral damages to the tune
of P1<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span> the same is likewise denied, it being
frivolous and unfounded."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1963</st1:date>,
over the opposition of the defendants, the trial court issued a writ of

filed a motion to quash the writ, but the same was denied four days later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 30, 1963, upon a motion for
reconsideration filed by them, the trial court issued an order setting aside
the writ of preliminary attach­ment provided the defendants posted bond in the
sum of P100,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said defendants
having done so, the writ was dissolved on April 6 of the same year.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial upon the issues thus joined, the trial court rendered
judgment "dismissing the com­plaint and ordering the plaintiff, instead,
to pay the defendants the sum of P550<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as
damages, and the costs of suit", and further set aside the prelim­inary
attachment issued theretofore.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due time the Bank perfected its appeal from the aforesaid
decision and the same was docketed in this Court as G. R. L-22957.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> likewise appealed (G.
R. L-23737).</p>

<p class="BODY">The following are the issues raised by the Bank in the six
assignments of error submitted in its brief:</p>

<blockquote>1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in finding it necessary
to determine the nature of the contract between the parties and in later
holding that the understanding between them was that the tractors that were to
be sold by NAMERCO to the farmers, the Bank would advance a loan of fifty (50%)
per cent of the cost thereof to the farmers who, in turn, undertook to pay the
amortizations thereof directly to the Bank;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in holding that,
following the intention of the parties, the Bank is not entitled to recover any
amount from <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, and in not holding, instead,
that the latter are liable to the Bank in the "deficiency claim of
P554,865.14";</blockquote>

<blockquote>3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial court also erred in holding that
the price at which the mortgaged chat­tels were sold at public auction was ridic­ulously
low, and in further holding that the bank did not act with fairness and justice
in foreclosing the chattel mortgages, and that it was responsible for the
depreciated value and worn out condition of the mortgaged chat­tels; and
lastly,</blockquote>

<blockquote>4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in assessing against
the Bank the amount of P500<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for actual,
compensatory, exemplary and moral damages and P50,000.00 as attorney's fees.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A fair resolution of the two appeals now before <span class="GramE">Us</span> demands a detailed statement of the background facts that
led to the execution of the contracts of loan in­volved in this case, evidenced
by the four promissory notes and four chattel mortgages attached to and made
part of the Bank's complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Bank is a government-owned and controlled corporation
established for the purpose of helping in the development of Philippine
economy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the NAMERCO
is a domestic corporation engaged in the importation and sale of tractors and
other farm machineries and equipment, whose officers at the time the contracts
involved herein were entered into were John <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>
(President and General Manager), Paul <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>, Mariano
U. <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> and <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> David.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 21, 1955, John <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>, as
President and General Manager of NAMERCO, addressed a letter to the Hon. Ramon <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>, President of the Republic of the Philippines,
submitting "suggestions and/or proposals that will help your
administration in the building up of our nation's economic stability and
prosperity, and the lifting up of its poverty from among the masses, especially
our rural farmers" (Exhibit 1, p. 342, Fold­er of Exhibits) and expressing
the opinion that "if given due approval and assistance, will no doubt help
to promote, in due course of time, a wide scale mechani­zation of our
agriculture" (Idem).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The specific
sugges­tions or proposals made in Mr. John <span class="SpellE">Sycip's</span>
letter were as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We propose to undertake the estab­lishment of
Tractor Pools in different agricultural areas here in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to serve the farmers in their land prepara­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Together with this Project, we shall provide
technical assistance whereby the farmers will be assisted, advised or in­structed
in the modern ways of farming, what to plant, their marketing, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Home industries also will be promoted.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
propose to put up from 200 - 300 big diesel tractors in these Tractor Pools
within the period of two (2) years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
estimated value of these units will amount to about P5<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order to enable us to realize this big
Project, we propose that the Government finances us, through the RFC, Fifty
(50%) percent of the value, payable in four (4) years amortization, and against
which we shall pledge or secure these machineries until the obligation is fully
paid for.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
farmers in the areas where the Tractor Pools will be established will be served
and Custom Service fees charged for plowing, harrowing, planting, cultivation,
harvesting, etc., as may be required.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The fees charged, will cover the cost of operation and its profit
to cover the yearly amortization of the cost of tractors and implements
invested.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Within the period of 3-4 years, we expect to recover the cost of
this invest­ment.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
the value of the tractors and implements are fully recovered and paid for, both
to RFC and to us, the ownership of the Tractor Pools will go to the farmers,
who, at the start of this Project, will be organized into Associa­tions or
Cooperatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Members of <span class="GramE">this,</span> will be actively trained in mechanization, farm
management and other requirements to be assured, that when the Tractor Pools
are turned over to them, they will be capable of continuing the operation
successfully.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Through this Project, it will help farm­ers produce cheaper and
abundant farm products.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In places where
irrigations have been estab­lished, it will enable the farmers to obtain two to
three plantings every year, thus obtain­ing the maximum production from their
lands which will thus increase and improve their eco­nomic and financial
status.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Farm mechanization being comparatively new to most farmers in the
Philippines, Tractor Pools will likewise serve as a working model or Pilot
plant, where data of cost of operation, performance, etc. will be opened to
them for study and consideration, with the view of ex­tensively encouraging and
introducing mechani­zation all over our country.</blockquote>

<blockquote>With the rural folks' increased productivities, will mean more
wealth to them, and business and industries will share in this prosperity too,
and the country's economic stability assured with peace, order, and happi­ness
for the entire country against which com­munism will hardly prevail.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Your approval and endorsement to our <span class="GramE">pro­posal,</span>
will be an opportunity for civic-spirited private enterprises to show to the
country what they can contribute and help to expedite the agricultural
development of the country, where ordinarily it would be diffi­cult for the
Government, itself, to undertake."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Crystal clear it is from the above proposal that NAMERCO was <u>the
party soliciting financial assistance from the Bank far itself</u> in
connection with the acquisi­tion of some 200-300 big diesel tractors within a
two-year period, of an estimated total value of about P5 Million, and that to
enable it "to realize this big project" it proposed' "<u>that
the Government finances us, through the RFC</u>, Fifty (50%) percent of the
value, pay­able in four (4) years amortization, and against which we shall
pledge or secure these machineries until the obligation is fully paid
for." The proposal envisioned serving the farmers in the areas where
Tractor Pools would be established, Customs Service fees to be charged for
plowing, harrowing, planting, cultivation, harvesting, etc., which fees
"will cover the cost of operation and its profit to cover the yearly
amortization of the cost of tractors and implements invested." The letter
further expressed the hope that "within the period of 3-4 years, we expect
to recover the cost of this investment." <span class="SpellE">NAMERCO's</span>
proposal likewise provided that <u>once the value of the tractors and
implements had been fully recovered and paid for</u> "both to RFC and to
us, the owner­ship of the Tractor Pools will go to the farmers."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is beyond doubt that <span class="SpellE">NAMERCO's</span>
proposal was inspired by the desire to "help farmers produce cheaper and
abundant farm products," so that they may "increase and improve their
economic and financial status." But the scheme was not all charity or <span class="SpellE">philantrophy</span>; it was also intended to have "business
and industries x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> share
in this prosperity."</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on January 4, 1956, prior to the submission of <span class="SpellE">Dimacali's</span> report Mr. John <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>,
as Pres­ident and General Manager of NAMERCO, addressed a letter to the
Chairman of the Bank "to inquire into the possi­bility of securing
financial assistance from RFC <u>in order to expand the sales and distribution
of our agricultural machinery and implements</u> on installment terms to our
farmers and small businessmen in rural areas," (Under­lines supplied,
Exhibit N) - an inquiry clearly tied up with the suggestions embodied in his
letter to President <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After stating that NAMERCO was engaged in assembl­ing and selling
farm machinery, etc., and manufacturing rice cone mills, small rice hullers,
etc., which were generally sold on installment for a term of 24 months or more,
the letter above-mentioned stated that "in view of the increasing volume
of sales we already have, it will be necessary for us to secure additional
financing" and asked the Bank "for assistance from your Corporation,
in the form of discounting of Notes Receivable under such terms and conditions
as may be required."</p>

<p class="BODY">In line - no doubt - with the transaction proposed in its two
letters mentioned heretofore, NAMERCO, again through Mr. John <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>, its President and General Mana­ger, addressed on May
30, 1956 another letter to the Bank (Exhibit M) in which it applied "for a
loan of P13,290.50, representing Fifty (50%) percent of the value of Farm
Machinery and Implements listed in the attached <span class="SpellE">Proforma</span>
Invoice" consisting mainly of one (1) unit - MASSEY HARRIS Tractor, Model
44D to be acquired at a cost of P13,770.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Due to its importance, <span class="GramE">We</span> reproduce the
following portions of the letter:</p>

<blockquote>"This machinery and implements will be delivered to bona fide
settlers in <span class="SpellE">Lagao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>,

NARRA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fifty per cent of the cost will
be assumed by the undersigned ap­plicant corporation, and the repayment of the
loan will likewise be assumed by it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
machinery and implements will be offered on first mortgage as security for the
loan.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The applicant will take charge of col­lecting from the group of
farmers concerned the amounts corresponding to the amortiza­tion on the R.F.C.
loan, together with the payment of 50% of the value of the machinery
corresponding to the applicant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
manner of payment is embodied in a contract be­tween the farmers and the
dealer-applicant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We are also attaching hereto the appli­cation of the applicants,
duly notarized, if the R.F.C. desires to bind them jointly and severally with
the undersigned.</blockquote>

</span>The purpose of this plan is to insure the proper handl­ing of the

<p class="BODY">The foregoing application for a P13,290.50 loan – the first of
four (4) separate loans granted by the Bank to NAMERCO - clearly shows that
NAMERCO expressly obli­gated itself:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to
sell the tractor, agricultural machine­ry and equipment to be acquired by it,
to <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> set­tlers; to assume payment of fifty (50%) percent
of the cost of the tractor and equipment described in its letter application;
to take charge of collecting from the farm­ers to whom it would sell said
tractor, etc., the cost thereof, expressly assuming the obligation to pay
"fifty (50%) percent of the cost" as well as the "repayment of
the loan"; to take charge of collecting from the pur­chasing farmers the
amounts corresponding to the amortization on the loan, together with the
payment of fifty (50%) percent of the value of the machinery, correspond­ing to
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, clearly intended to induce
the Bank to grant the loan applied for, NAMERCO further said in its application
"<u>we are ready to comply with any con­dition that the R.F.C. may require
or impose for the successful carrying out of this plan of financing</u> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" (Underlines supplied).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1956" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1956</st1:date>,
the Bank advised NAMERCO that its loan application for P13<span class="GramE">,290.50</span>
had been approved by its Board of Governors subject, however, to the condition,
among others, that John <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>, Paul <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span> and Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span> - the
principal stockholders and officers of NAMERCO shall sign the corresponding
promissory note, jointly and severally with NAMERCO (Exhibit Z).</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus it seems clear that the original proposal of lending money
to the farmers and making NAMERCO only their guarantor or co-maker - as
outlined in Exhibit 2 - was dropped entirely.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was evident that banking on John <span class="SpellE">Sycip's</span>
letter of May 30, 1956 making of record in unmistakable terms the readiness of
NAMERCO and its of­ficers "to comply with any condition that the RFC may
require or impose for the successful carrying out of the proposed plan of
financing," and the willingness "of any three" of the members of
its Board of Directors "to sign under their personal responsibility the
mortgage papers", the Bank, to better protect its interests, adopted the
final plan under which it would extend aid to NAMERCO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the Bank did so is not difficult to
understand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As between dealing with a
big number of poor farmers as its <u>debtors</u> albeit with the guaranty of
NAMERCO, the Bank un­doubtedly felt better secured with NAMERCO and the <span class="SpellE">Sycips</span> as its <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> <u>debtors</u>,
plus the chattel mortgage to be executed by the first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on October 5, 1956, John <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>, Paul <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span> and Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>, the first as Presi­dent of NAMERCO and in his
personal capacity, signed the promissory note Exhibit A for the sum of
P13,290.50, bind­ing themselves, jointly and severally, to pay said amount in
accordance with the terms and conditions thereof; and on the same date,
NAMERCO, represented by its President and General Manager, John <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>, executed the chattel mort­gage on the tractor
described in its application which fur­ther said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Fifty percent of the cost will be
assumed by the undersigned, and the repayment of the loan will likewise be
assumed by it." The corresponding check was issued, how­ever, in the name
of NAMERCO alone, pursuant to the request of its co-debtors (Exhibit A).</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition to the P13,290.50 loan already mentioned, NAMERCO
subsequently applied for and was granted three more by the Bank under similar
conditions as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A loan of
P135,008.50 granted on February 27, 1957; another loan of P200,000.00 granted
on December 16, 1957, and a last one also of P200,000.00 granted on March 3,
1958; all of them covered by the corresponding promissory note (Exhibits B, C
and D) and secured by separate chattel mortgage contracts on the tractors and
agricultural equipment subsequently sold <u>conditionally</u> by NAMERCO to
several groups of farmers (Exhibits E, F, G and H).</p>

<p class="BODY">The four loans were in the total sum of P548<span class="GramE">,299.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to a resolution of the Board of
Governors of the Bank, John <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>, Paul <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span> and Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span> signed
the corresponding promissory notes, jointly and severally with NAMERCO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The corresponding checks were also released
to NAMERCO alone, pursuant to the request of its co-obligors (Exhibit A).</p>

<p class="BODY">Of importance in the resolution of the issues before Us are the
following circumstances:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the first
chattel mortgage executed by NAMERCO, through its duly authorized President and
General Manager, John <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>, makes an express
declaration that the mortgagor was "the absolute owner, free from all
liens and encumbrances, of the mortgaged chattels; the mortgagor agreed not to
sell, etc., nor in any manner encumber them without the written consent of the
mortgagee; if, in spite of this commitment, the mortgaged property was sold,
the vendee shall assume the mortgage but with the understanding that such
assumption of the mortgage by the vendee, "shall not release the vendor of
his obligation to the mortgagee"; on the contrary, both vendor and vendee
"shall be jointly and severally liable for said mortgage obligation";
upon default on the part of the mortgagor, the loan shall be­come due and the
mortgagee may then immediately fore­close the mortgage judicially or
extra-judicially; in case of an extra-judicial foreclosure the auction sale
shall take place in the city or capital of the province where the mortgaged
properties were located and, whether the foreclosure was judicial or
extra-judicial, "the sheriff may, at the option of the mortgagee, sell the
chattels individually or as a whale lot"; and finally, the mortgagor shall
use the proceeds of the loan "<u>exclu­sively to cover Fifty (50%) Per
Cent of the cost</u>" of the tractor or tractors and other agricultural
equipment to be purchased by NAMERCO, the latter paying the other Fifty (50%)
Per Cent with its own funds; the amount loaned (P13<span class="GramE">,290.50</span>)
shall be available to NAMERCO to pay Fifty (50%) Per Cent of the total
acquisition cost (P26,581.00) of the tractor, farm machinery and equipment
described in its application, such tractor, etc. "to be sold to a group of
farmers composed of <span class="SpellE">Teodulo</span> Santos, Miguel Combo, <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> Santos, Cesar Santos and <span class="SpellE">Honorio</span>
Zeta (Record on Appeal pp. 15-38).</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute that the three other contracts of chattel
mortgage are identical in terms and conditions.</p>

<p class="BODY">As NAMERCO and its co-obligors defaulted in the payment of the loans,
the Bank was constrained to demand from them the remittance pf substantial <span class="GramE">payments,</span> other­wise, foreclosure proceedings would be
commenced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a letter of May 24, 1962,
John <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span> asked for the suspension of the
contemplated foreclosure proceedings, inform­ing the Bank that, upon
foreclosure, the 47 mortgaged tractors, in the condition they were at that
time, would have a selling value of about P100,000.00 only (Exhibit W).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This request was denied and foreclosure proceedings
were commenced (Exhibits I to I-6).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the ensuing public auc­tion sales conducted by the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> on different dates and in different places, the
mortgaged properties were sold to the Bank, in the absence of bids higher than
those made by it, as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On the date of the first public auction sale - <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1962</st1:date> - the total of the
mortgage debts owing to the Bank from NAMERCO and its co-obligors amounted to
P619<span class="GramE">,881.15</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Deducting the amount of P86<span class="GramE">,650.00</span> realized
from the foreclosure sales, the resulting balance is P554,865.14 - exactly the
amount the Bank sought to collect from NAMERCO and its co-obligors.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the pleadings and the evidence of the parties, the trial
court held the view that it was necessary to determine "the exact nature
of the contract between the parties." And mainly, if not exclusively, on
the strength of the testimony of John <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>,
President and General Man­ager of NAMERCO, it arrived at its conclusion -</p>

<blockquote>"From this evidence, it seems quite self-evident that the understanding
between the parties was that of a sale of farm machinery and equipments
belonging to the defendant NAMERCO to the different farmers who under­took to
pay the same by installment to the RFC for the loan advanced by it and later,
after the payment of the said loan, to the defendant NAMERCO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The RFC, however, advanced 50% of the value
of the tractors to the defen­dants, who executed chattel mortgages on the
tractors which were sold to the farmers." (R.A. pp. 292-299) (Italic
supplied)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">If there seems to be some ambiguity and confusion in the court's
conclusion, the same may be ascribed to the fact that it failed to consider
that, according to the documentary evidence of record, there were involved in,
connection with the proposal submitted by NAMERCO to President <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> - later on endorsed through channel to the Bank
for study and action - two separate contracts; one was between NAMERCO and the
Bank, the latter as lender or financier, and the other was to be between
NAMERCO and its co-obligors, on the one hand, and groups of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>
farmers, on the other.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first contract was a "financing" contract:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>NAMERCO was to acquire a given number of
tractors and other farm machineries and equipment, paying Fifty (50%) percent
of the total cost thereof with its own funds, and the remaining Fifty (50%)
percent with the funds borrowed and received from the "financier." As
the latter approved the "financing" scheme to help NAMERCO carry out
its plan of helping the <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> farmers mechanize
their farming, the contracts between the Bank and NAMERCO and its co-obligors
expressly, clearly and repeatedly provided that the tractors, etc. to be
acquired by NAMERCO shall be resold to the <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>
farmers, by groups, at a price "not to be more than the usual cost at
which the same machinery and equipment are sold in the local market"
(chattel mortgage to secure payment of the P13,290.50 loan, Record on Appeal p.
38).</p>

<p class="BODY">The second contract, which was exclusively between NAMERCO, on
the one hand as seller, and separate groups of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>
farmers, as buyers, on the other, was for the conditional resale to the latter
of the tractors and other agricultural machinery and equipment to be acquired
by NAMERCO, with the understanding that title thereto would pass to the farmers
only upon full payment of the agreed cost.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While both contracts were, to a certain degree, inter­related, one did
not depend upon the other; much less did they make the <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>
farmers privy to the contract entered into exclusively between the Bank and NAMERCO
and its co-obligors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the only
interest of the groups of farmers in the BANK-NAMERCO contract was perhaps that
they could invoke it to compel NAMERCO to resell to them the tractors and other
agricultural machineries and equipment acquired with the help of the Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contracts between the Bank, as lender, and the NAMERCO and
its co-obligors, as borrowers, are crystal clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They do not need to be construed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No amount of quibbling can render them
ambiguous or uncertain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So are, on the
other hand, the separate contracts between the NAMERCO and the groups of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> farmers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the documentary evidence before <span class="GramE">Us</span>,
there cannot be even the slightest doubt as to the obligation of NAMERCO and
its co-obligors to repay the loans granted to them by the Bank, or that portion
thereof not paid with the proceeds obtained from the foreclosure sale of the
chattels mortgaged by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
surprising, therefore, that the trial court, based almost exclusively, on the
testimony of John <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>, not only denied recovery to
the Bank but sentenced it to pay an obviously unwarranted claim for damages and
attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In doing so, <span class="GramE">We</span> are convinced that it committed a gross reversible error.</p>

<p class="BODY">Gist of John <span class="SpellE">Sycip's</span> pretense and
supporting testi­mony is that, upon being confronted with the Bank's demand
that the promissory note of P13,290.50 (and the subsequent ones) should be
signed by NAMERCO, jointly and severally by himself, Paul and Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>, he went to see the then President <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>; that, after a telephone conversation with a high
ranking official of the Bank - who <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>
"thought" was the "President" - the former assured him that
"with the chattel mortgage an the tractors, in case of default, the RFC
will go after the farmers" instead of going after NAMERCO and its
co-obligors.</p>

<p class="BODY">One needs be exceedingly naive, indeed, to believe this
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>John <span class="SpellE">Sycip's</span>
testimony - it is obvious - suffers firstly, from the infirmity of being
self-serving intended as it is to free him and his co-obligors from pay­ing the
respectable amount of money that they had borrowed from the Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, while President <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>
may have made a telephone call upon "presumably" the President of the
Bank, <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span> admits that he "could not listen to
what they were talking about" (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1964</st1:date>, pp. 71-75).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the third place - and this is perhaps the
most serious objection against his testimony - <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>
attributed something to a <u>dead</u> person who could not rise from his grave
to deny the imputation, thus also depriving the adverse party of the right of
confrontation.</p>

<p class="BODY">But assuming, for the sake of argument, that the alleged
conversation between President <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> and the
"President" of the Bank had taken place and that thereafter the
former assured <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span> that he and his co-obligors had
nothing to worry about, still the fact remains that President <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> could not have legally bound the Bank, and that
whatever personal assurances he had given to the borrowers cannot now relieve
them of liability under the terms and conditions set forth in the documents
that they <u>subsequently</u> signed, freely and voluntarily, in accordance
with the previous assurance they had given to the Bank that they were ready and
willing to comply with any condition that the latter would deem fit to impose
in order to push through the transaction.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is, moreover, the circumstance that John <span class="SpellE">Sycip's</span> testimony was uncorroborated by credible
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, Rene <span class="SpellE">Leuterio</span>,
at that time an employee of the <span class="SpellE">Sycips</span>, tried to give
corroborative testimony, but his own is also suspect intended as it was to
absolve his employers from liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, there are these circumstances to consider:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the recorded evidence shows that when <span class="SpellE">NAMERCO's</span> applica­tions were being processed, no account
was taken at all of any alleged understanding between John <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>
and Pres­ident <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>; <span class="SpellE">Sycip's</span>
testimony is contradicted by resolutions of the Board of Directors of NAMERCO
authorizing him to negotiate the loans without any condition at all related to
the supposed assurance given by President <span class="SpellE">Mag­saysay</span>;
in its applications for loans NAMERCO expressly assumed the obligation to repay
the loans.</p>

<p class="BODY">The well settled jurisprudence applicable to the issue under
consideration is that, to justify disregarding the legal effects and consequences
of contracts formally and voluntarily entered into, the evidence must be clear
and convincing and more than merely preponderant (<span class="SpellE">Mendezona</span>
vs. Philippine Sugar Estate Development Co. 41 Phil. 475; Camacho vs.
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Baliuag</span>, 28 Phil. 416; <span class="SpellE">Centenera</span> vs. Garcia <span class="SpellE">Palicio</span>, 29
Phil. 470; <span class="SpellE">Alojado</span> vs. Lim <span class="SpellE">Siongco</span>,
51 Phil. 339).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We certainly do not have
such evidence in the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before closing this part of our decision, <span class="GramE">We</span>
make this final consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
principal stockholders and officers of NAMERCO, particularly the <span class="SpellE">Sycips</span> who co-signed the promissory notes in question,
were, as the lower court found, businessmen of experience and
intelligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be assumed,
therefore, that they knew what they were doing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is, indeed, diffi­cult to believe that they would have signed the
four (4) promissory notes in question representing a total amount of more than
half a million pesos, on the mere verbal assurance of President <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> that, in case of default, they would not be held
liable thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is possible, however,
that in spite of their intelligence and business experience, <span class="GramE">they</span>
did not foresee failure in the business transaction that they themselves had
proposed to President <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> and the Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, they expected the whole matter to be
liquidated in three or four <span class="GramE">years</span> time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this did not happen, it was their
misfortune.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We might say - paraphrasing
Tan <span class="SpellE">Tua</span> <span class="SpellE">Sia</span> vs. Yu <span class="SpellE">Biao</span> <span class="SpellE">Sontua</span>, 56 Phil. 707 - that
they being of age and busi­nessmen of experience, it must be presumed that they
had acted with due care and to have signed the documents in question with full
knowledge of their import and the ob­ligations they were assuming thereby; that
this presump­tion of law may not be overcome by the mere testimony of the
obligor or obligors; that, to permit a party, when sued upon a contract, to
admit that he signed it but to deny that it expresses the agreement he had
made, or to allow him to admit that he signed it solely on the verbal assurance
given by one party, however high his station may be, that he would not be held
liable thereon, would destroy the value of all contracts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it would be disastrous to give more
weight and reliability to the self–serving testimony of a party bound by the
contract than to the contents thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><u>Verba</u></span></span><span class="GramE"> <span class="SpellE"><u>volant</u></span>, <span class="SpellE"><u>scripta</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>manent</u></span>.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Having thus disposed of the issues raised in the first and second
assignments of error, We shall now con­sider jointly those covered by the third
and fourth rel­ative to the finding made by the trial court that the price at
which the chattels mortgaged were sold at public auction was ridiculously low;
that it was the one respon­sible for their depreciated value and worn-out
condition; and that the Bank did not act with fairness and justice in
foreclosing the chattel mortgages.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the obligors jointly and severally signed the promissory
notes sued upon and that they were in default is not denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the mortgagee's right to
foreclose the chattel mortgages is beyond question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So is its right to foreclose them judicially
or extra-judicially, the contracts of the parties clearly giving that option to
the <span class="GramE">mortgagee.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court, therefore, erred in holding that, by exercising such
right and option, the Bank acted with unfairness and injustice towards the mortgagors.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is argued, however, that the Bank should have allowed
"the defendant corporation" to sell the tractors, and that because
the sale thereof was made by lots, good prices could not be obtained because
the price of each lot "was beyond the capacity of any single person to
pay," while had they been sold one by one individual farmers could have
made offers to buy them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reasoning
thus, the trial court lost sight completely of the fact that the chattel mortgages
foreclosed gave the Bank full discretion to sell the tractors and other farming
equipment mortgaged, either by lots or by piece.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having given such authority the mortgagor
should be the last to complain against the mortgagee exercising it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the lower court's finding that the total price of
P67,400.00 was ridiculously low, it must be stated firstly, that that figure is
erroneous, the real total a­mount being P86,650.00 (Exhibits J, J-1 to
J-6).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This price the trial court
considered as ridiculously low in spite of the fact that John <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span> himself said in a letter addressed to the Bank under
date of May 24, 1962, that if at that time the Bank was to repossess the 47
tractors, their selling value would only be about P100,000.00 (Ex­hibit W).</p>

<p class="BODY">Aside from what has been said heretofore, the record discloses
that NAMERCO and its co-obligors had failed to show convincingly that the sale
of the tractors by piece would have really resulted in a much bigger total sale
price.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding what has been said heretofore, a majority of the
members of the court is of the opinion that, although in strict law NAMERCO and
its co-obligors have no reason to complain in connection with the foreclosure
of the chattel mortgages and the price obtained from the pub­lic auction sale
of the mortgaged chattels, at least in equity they are entitled to have
credited to them, in pay­ment of their outstanding obligations, whatever price
was obtained by the Bank from the disposal or sale thereof, and that in this
connection, the record of the case should be remanded to the trial court for
further proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of all the above, it is clear that the fifth and
sixth assignments of error submitted in the Bank's brief are meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">The obligation of NAMERCO and the parties who with it executed
the promissory notes sued upon, jointly and severally, appears indubitable, as
far as the evidence presented in this case is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, having expressed
heretofore the view that the Bank had the perfect right to foreclose the
chattel mortgages and that it was not responsible at all for the apparently
low, price obtained in their sale at foreclosure, the conclu­sion must be that
the trial court erred in sentencing the aforesaid Bank to pay actual,
compensatory, exemplary and moral damages, and P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
by way of attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed
and set aside, and another is rendered sentencing the National Merchandising
Corporation, John <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>, Paul <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>
and Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span> to pay, jointly and severally, to
the appellant Bank, the amount of P554,865.14, with inter­est thereon at the
legal rate from the date of filing of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, the record of this case is remanded below for further
proceedings exclusively to determine the price at which the Bank was able to
dispose of the tractors, farm­ing machineries and equipment it acquired at the
foreclo­sure sales conducted in connection with the foreclosure of the chattel
mortgages marked as Exhibits E, F, G and H; the resulting net amount to be
deducted from the total amount adjudged herein in favor of the Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">With reference to the appeal interposed by the <span class="SpellE">in­tervenors</span> (G.R. No.</span> L-23737), <span class="GramE">We</span>
find the same to be entirely without merit in the light of the findings and
conclusions above set forth.</p>
