				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by A. M. <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> &amp; Co. from
the order of <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1961</st1:date>
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in Civil Case
No. 4677 dismissing its appeal from the decision of the Justice of the Peace
Court of <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, in turn dismissing its complaint
for forcible entry filed against Benito <span class="SpellE">Symaco</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 28, 1967 appellant filed with the abovementioned Justice
of the Peace Court a complaint for forcible entry, with a prayer for the
issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, against <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
the main allegations of which were that it was the owner of a parcel of land
situated in <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
with an area of approximately 328 square meters, covered by TCT No. 39853 of
the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>; that on or about June
21, 1957, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, unlawfully and by means of force,
strategy and stealth, entered upon a portion of 32.42 square meters of said
land and had been constructing a building thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Answering the complaint, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
alleged that he was the owner of the parcel of land in question, having
acquired the same by purchase from appellant itself on July 21, 1954, as
evidenced by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 3560 of the Register of Deeds of
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> issued in his name; that, as the issue between
the parties was one of ownership, the court had no jurisdiction over the case;
and that, because of the unfounded action, he suffered actual and moral damages
in the sum of P2,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding that the issue involved was ownership and not mere
possession, the Justice of the Peace Court dismissed the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant then took the case on appeal to the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the pre-trial held thereat, the Court made
a preliminary finding that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had encroached
upon a portion of about 70 centimeters, along the side of <span class="SpellE">Calle</span>
Real, of the property described in the Plan SWO-63711 beyond the boundary of his
property as described in said plan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
result, the court ordered the parties to submit "such pleadings as, in
their opinion, would be necessary regarding the ownership of the property in
question and the Court will thereafter then define whether it will act in its
appellate or original jurisdiction".</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the order mentioned above, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">appellee</span></span><span class="GramE"> moved dismiss</span> the
appeal on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction of the court a quo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court, however, postponed its resolution thereon
until after the presentation of the evidence by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter the court appointed <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> <span class="SpellE">Infante</span>, supervising
surveyor of the Bureau of Lands, as commissioner to conduct a relation survey
of the land covered by appellant's title in order to ascertain whether a
portion thereof had been included in <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> title
or whether said parcel of land was a part of <span class="SpellE">Calle</span>
Real in <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In his report submitted to the court, <span class="SpellE">Infante</span>
sated that appellate was actually occupying a portion of 5.51 square meters of
appellant's land but which also formed part of <span class="SpellE">Calle</span>
Real, as shown by the sketch plan attached to the report.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1959</st1:date>,
the court, upon a verified motion of appellant, issued a writ of preliminary
injunction prohibiting <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> from making any
construction on the questioned area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
latter's motion for a reconsideration of said order was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the date set for hearing, <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
counsel called the court's attention to his previous unresolved motion to
dismiss the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection
the court ordered him to file a formal motion to dismiss based on the evidence
already presented - which order was complied with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, finding that the evidence of
record tended to show that the issue of ownership was necessarily involved in
the proceedings, the Court issued the appealed order with the following
alternative to the parties:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
However, if the parties would express their intention to have this case heard
under the original jurisdiction of the Court, the Court will be willing to hear
the same and decide it on the merits so long as proper pleadings necessary for
the determination of all the issues will be filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence of this order of dismissal,
the Court hereby dissolves the writ of preliminary injunction issued."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Instead of submitting the controversy to the court in the
exercise of its original jurisdiction, as suggested above, appellant interposed
the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing facts show that the present appeal is without
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the time the case was instituted in the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, appellant raised the question of ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He raised it again on appeal in the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proceedings had in said court, as stated
heretofore, clearly show, not only that the true question between the herein
parties is ownership, but that the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>
is also affected by the controversy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no doubt, therefore, that the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> and the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> were right in dismissing the case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of dismissal appealed from is
affirmed, with costs.</p>
