				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> V. Villanueva, Jr.,
a member of the Philippine Bar, prays for the issuance of the writ of
certiorari to annul the order of respondent Judge of June 1, 1966, requiring
him "to sur­render the documents and papers" which allegedly had lawfully
come to his possession in his professional capacity as counsel of Elvira <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> and Miguel <span class="SpellE">Matti</span> in Civil
Case No. 7725 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental, pending before respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It turned out that petitioner was dismissed, while the trial of the
above-entitled case was still in progress and before petitioner's attorney's
fees were fixed and paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would
likewise have this Court annul he order of the respondent Judge, dated <st1:date year="1966" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1966</st1:date>, declaring petitioner in
contempt of Court and ordering his arrest for having failed to surrender the
aforementioned documents and papers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Prohibition is likewise sought to restrain respondent Judge from
enforcing its aforementioned orders of <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="6">June
 1, 1966</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1966" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is equally a plea for mandamus to
compel respondents to recognize petitioner's retaining lien over such documents
and papers.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
As will hereafter be made more explicit, the question presented possesses an
element of novelty.</p>

<p class="BODY">His former clients, Elvira <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> and
Miguel <span class="SpellE">Matti</span>, were made respondents in addition to
the Honorable Jose R. <span class="SpellE">Querubin</span>, Judge of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental.</p>

<p class="BODY">The statement of facts, as set forth in the petition, revealed
that respondents Elvira <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> and Miguel <span class="SpellE">Matti</span>, Board Members of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental, engaged the professional services of petitioner for the purpose of
filing an action against the Provincial Governor, Vice-Governor, Treasurer,
Auditor and Secretary to the Provincial Board of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1965</st1:date>, petitioner filed an action for
injunction, recovery of a sum of money and damages with preliminary injunction,
Civil Case No. 7725 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental, against such provincial officials.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the same day, the hearing on the preliminary injunction was held, the
writ being granted.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, several hearings took place, petitioner asserting
that "he gave all his time, effort and utmost ability to protect the
interest of his clients." In his preparation of the case, petitioner was
able to acquire documents and papers which were subsequently presented and
marked as exhibits during the trial thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1966</st1:date>,
however, respondents Elvira <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> and Miguel <span class="SpellE">Matti</span> requested petitioner to allow them to have the <span class="SpellE">expediente</span> of Civil Case No. 7725 under the pretext that
they would study the records to prepare them for a conference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the resumption of the trial of Civil Case
No. 7725 on <st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1966</st1:date>,
petitioner was surprised when in open court, his clients, respondents <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Matti</span>,
"manifested before the respondent Judge that they were already terminating
the services of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
course of their manifestation, said respondents read their letters, addressed
to petitioner, advising the latter of the termination of his professional
services."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="10" month="5">May 10, 1966</st1:date>,
petitioner filed with the respondent Judge, a pleading opposing his dismissal
as counsel. On June 1, 1966, "without resolving the above opposition and
motion, respondent Judge issued an order requiring petitioner to 'deposit with
the Clerk of Court all the documents presented by him and marked as exhibits
during the hearing conducted by him, so that same will, be presented as
exhibits before closing the evidence of the plaintiffs,' * * *. "<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition goes on to state:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Immediately upon receipt of this order on the same day, June 1,
1966, petitioner filed a manifestation and motion informing the respondent
judge that 'all said documents are in Manila where they were brought because
they were the subject of conference with Atty. Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
recently and therefore the same could not be delivered to the Clerk of Court,
because it is humanly impossible to do so,' and moving 'that the said * * *
order issued in the absence of [petitioner] be held in abeyance to give [him]
the time, the means and the opportunity to go to Manila.’ * * *; Respondent
Judge, however, orally denied on the same day petitioner's manifestation and
motion and forth with ordered the latter's incarceration in the provincial jail
of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After repeated but respectful entreaties, and after raising the point
that he has a charging lien over the documents which is dependent upon his
possession of said documents, petitioner we allowed to go free but with a
warning that if within eighteen [18] hours, he should tail to surrender the
documents, a warrant for his arrest would be issued; On the same day,
petitioner flew to Manila to get the documents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, on <st1:date year="1966" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1966</st1:date>,
petitioner received a long distance call from his office informing him that the
respondent Judge had declared him in contempt of Court and issued a warrant for
arrest for his failure to surrender the documents. * * *.”<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is the allegation of petitioner that he "has no appeal or
adequate remedy in the ordinary coarse of law to protect not only his rights
and honor but, what is more important, the decorum and respectability of the
legal profession, from the arbitrary and unreasoning actuations and orders the
respondent Judge, save this petition."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
It is peti­tioner's contention further that "the documents and papers
which respondent Judge requires petitioner to, surrender had lawfully come to
[his] possession in the course of his employment by his clients, the
respondents Elvira <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Matti</span>.
<span style="">&nbsp;</span>In gathering these documents which he
successfully utilized as evidence in Civil Case No. 7725, petitioner - bound by
his loyalty and relationship a trust to his clients - had to spend considerable
time, effort and money; When, therefore, respondents <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Matti</span> terminated petitioner's services without
paying his lawful attorney's fees, petitioner acquired the right - and the
respondents, particularly respondent Judge, are bound to recognize this right -
to retain all these documents and papers until his fees are paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[Respondent Judge in] issuing orders
requiring petitioner to surrender the said documents * * * and declaring him
for contempt of court, and issuing a warrant for his arrest because of his
failure to do so, * * * has acted without jurisdiction and in manifest
violation of <span class="SpellE">Iaw</span> and jurisprudence; Petitioner
respectfully submits, therefore, that the writs therein prayed for lie and
should issue."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the 8th day of June, 1966, this Court adopted a resolution
giving due course to the above petition for certiorari, prohibition and
mandamus. A restraining order effective immediately up to and including <st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="6">June 24, 1966</st1:date>, the hearing being set
for <st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1966</st1:date>, forms
part of the aforesaid resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge himself filed an answer the pertinent portion of
which contained the following:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"That this certiorari case stemmed from orders of the undersigned
dated June 1, June 3 and <st1:date year="1966" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1966</st1:date>,
in connection with Civil Case 7725, <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span>, et al.
vs. Gomez, et al., for injunction. Atty. <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> Villanueva,
Jr., filed said case on behalf of Board Member Elvira <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span>
and Miguel <span class="SpellE">Matti</span> to stop Governor Benjamin M.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gomez, Treasurer Juan D.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Taala</span> and Provin­cial
Auditor <span class="SpellE">Tereso</span> <span class="SpellE">Bomediano</span>
from disbursing funds of the govern­ment for electioneering purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A writ of preliminary injunction was
issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was set for hearing on
the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the presentation of
the plaintiffs' evidence, the plaintiffs wanted Attys.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alfredo Soto and Francisco G. <span class="SpellE">Banzon</span>, to handle the presentation of evidence but after a
huddle among the plaintiffs' lawyers, the Court granted Atty. Villanueva to
present the plaintiffs' first witness, inas­much as he personally examined the
documentary evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he was about
to present his second witness, Atty. Elvira <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span>
submitted a written notice dispensing with the services of Atty. Villanueva.
Due to the fact that he was still acting as counsel for plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Matti</span>, he was allowed to proceed with the presentation of
his second witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the afternoon
session, Atty. Villanueva received a written notice of his dismissal as counsel
for plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Matti</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court allowed. Attys. Soto &amp; <span class="SpellE">Banzon</span> to
take over the presentation of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon petition, Atty. Villanueva, Jr. was allowed to continue his
appearance as amicus curiae.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the
testimony of the second witness, Attys. Soto and <span class="SpellE">Banzon</span>
asked that the exhibits be deposited with the Clerk of Court. Atty. Villanueva
prayed that he be given custody of the exhibits, con­sisting of public
documents, which the Court granted, with the under­standing that said exhibits
be made available when needed by the Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The hearing was continued for another date. Atty. Villanueva did not
appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court set three days successively
for the next hearing of the case with the view to terminate it as expeditiously
as possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the plaintiffs
finished the presentation of their oral evidence, Atty. Soto &amp; <span class="SpellE">Banzon</span> asked Atty. Villanueva, Jr. be ordered to bring to
Courts the exhibits under his custody for formal presentation of said
documentary evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence the
controversial orders were issued ***”<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was likewise explained by respondent Judge that petitioner was
given up to the afternoon of <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="6">June 1,
 1966</st1:date> to produce the exhibits under his custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After manifesting that such exhibits were in
the possession of the Senator <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>, petitioners
were given forty-eight hours to produce the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was by virtue of his failure either to
appear on the next day as well as in the morning session of <st1:date year="1966" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1966</st1:date> that respondent Judge
issued the order for the arrest of petitioner.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was further stressed in the answer of respondent Judge that
the ruling in <span class="SpellE">Rustia</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Abeto</span>,
“has absolutely no application in this present case at bar.” It stands as
authority for "the right of attorney's retaining lien over the documents
and moneys turned over by a client to his counsel." Here, "the
documents consist of public records, which were brought to Court in virtue of a
subpoena <span class="SpellE">duces</span> <span class="SpellE">tecum</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said documents were marked as exhibits
and Atty. Villanueva was given permission to have under his custody the said
exhibits with the understanding that same should be made available in case the
Court orders their production thereof." His defiance of the court orders to
produce such exhibits amounted to contempt.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent judge would rely on his power to discipline and punish erring
practitioners.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
For him, the dismissal of the petition is called for.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge prays for the dismissal of this petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His plea must be granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No certiorari lies as the orders complained
of were not issued without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of
discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The enforcement thereof
cannot be restrained by prohibition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither is petitioner entitled to mandamus to compel respondent Judge to
recognize his alleged retaining lien over the disputed documents and papers.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>As admitted in the
petition, the documents and papers in question were introduced as exhibits;
moreover, as set forth in the answer of respondent Judge, they consist of
public documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no occasion,
therefore, for the privilege of a retaining lien granted an attorney to be
availed of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be to extend its
scope beyond unwarranted limits to make it applicable to the kind of documents
and papers of such character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
it would be to curtail unduly the inherent power of a judicial tribunal in the
conduct of the proceedings before it if it is to be held bereft of power to
compel the surrender of such documents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such an un­desirable eventuality this Court cannot willingly allow to
pass.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Rustia</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Abeto</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
a 1941 decision, is relied upon by petition. Such a reliance is misplaced. It
does not aid its cause at all, as correctly stated by respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was a petition for certiorari and
mandamus to declare null and void certain orders of respondent Judge in an
intestate case before him as well as to compel, the return to the petitioner of
a transfer certificate of title to recognize his retaining lien over certain
"documents, papers, funds and properties of the deceased" in such
intestate proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner,
likewise a member of the Philippine Bar, rendered professional services as
counsel for the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After being relieved of his services as
attorney, he presented a bill for professional services, the claim being
submitted for resolution of respon­dent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He sought not only the immediate payment of his honorarium but likewise
a retaining lien over all funds, documents and papers in his possession until
he was fully paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His plea was
rejected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, the respondent court
required petitioner to deliver certificate of title in question to the probate
clerk of court of the First Instance of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner complied but three days thereafter instituted this proceeding
for certiorari and mandamus.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the decision of the Court granting the writ prayed for, the
opinion being penned by Justice Laurel, it was stressed:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"That the petitioner water rendered
professional services in behalf of the respondent <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
and other heirs of the deceased, Antonio de la Riva is not disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not concerned with the disagreement
between the petitioner and the respondent <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
as to the value of the said professional services, nor with the alleged preferential
right of the petitioner to the payment of his fees, as they are not at issue in
the instant proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to
state here that the petitioner has already interposed an appeal from the orders
of <st1:date year="1940" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1940</st1:date>, and <st1:date year="1941" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1941</st1:date>, which orders, among
other things reduced the professional fees claimed by the petitioner from
P32,330 to P2,000. Moreover, such dispute do not, and cannot, affect the
general or retaining lien conceded to the petitioner by the first sentence of
section 33 of No. 127 of the Rules of Court, which provides that ‘An attorney
shall have a lien upon the funds, documents and paper of his client which have
lawfully come into his possession and may retain the same until his lawful fees
and disbursements have been paid and may apply such funds to the satisfaction
thereof.’ The general, <span class="SpellE">possessory</span>, or retaining lien
of an attorney attaches to all property, papers, books documents, or securities
of the client that come to the attorney professionally or in the course of his
professional employment, such as a bond, a municipal warrant, promissory note
or other negotiable papers, an account, a voucher, a bank book, a letter or
writing, a contract, insurance policy, or lease, a deed, or a mortgage.”<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Later, the opinion likewise stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"We are aware of the inconvenience that
may accrue to the client because of the retention of important papers by an
attorney claiming fees for services rendered, but this is the reason and
essence of the lien. Withal, the courts may require the attorney to deliver up
the papers in his possession which may serve to embarrass his client, provided
the client files proper security for the attorney's compensation. This proceeds
from the power of the courts to control its own officers and to compel attorneys
to act equitably and fairly towards their clients."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus obvious that even if the most expansive interpretation
be accorded the rather generous recognition of an attorney's retain­ing <span class="SpellE">Iien</span>, the situation presented by this controversy falls outside
its operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What must be stressed
anew is that if petitioner were to be indulged in his refusal to abide by the
lawful orders of respondent Judge, the proper and due respect to which a court
of justice is by right entitled would be diminished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That cannot be permitted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The disputed documents and paper were public in<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>character.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, they were introduced as exhibits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were properly subject to the court's
custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The intransigence of the petitioner
to continue in possession of the same based on his erroneous belief as to the
extent of the privilege of a retaining lien, to impart a semblance of legality
to his defiance, must not be, as earlier noted, accorded the imprimatur of the
approval of hi Tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If such were
not the law, the resulting injury to a fair and efficient administration of
justice might well prove to be incalculable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Against such a deplorable consequence this Court must resolutely set its
face.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record is bereft of the slightest indication that in acting
as he did, respondent Judge laid himself open to any accusation failing to
follow the dictates of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
no occasion then for the supervisory authority of this Tribunal to come into
play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The orders of respondent Judge
complained of can stand the test of the most rigorous scrutiny.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this petition for certiorari, prohibition and
mandamus is dismissed. With costs against petitioner.</p>
