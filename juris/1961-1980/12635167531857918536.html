				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Suit for forcible
entry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The land involved is located in
barrio <span class="SpellE">Telegrafo</span>, San Jose, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, bounded on the north­east by Cornelia and <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span> <span class="SpellE">Prado</span>, <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Feli­zardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cilot</span>, on the
northwest by a canal, <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
and Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pande</span>,
on the southeast by Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> and on the <u>southwest</u>
by <span class="SpellE">Rangas</span> River and <span class="SpellE">Felipa</span> <span class="SpellE">Capus</span> before, now <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint
filed on September 3, 1960 before the Justice of the Peace (Municipal) Court of
San Jose, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,
avers that on April 3, 1960, defendants, confede­rating together and helping
one another, by means of force, stra­tegy and stealth, unlawfully entered the
southwestern portion of the property just described, having an area of 75 <span class="SpellE">ares</span>, more or less, ejecting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
plaintiff's <span class="SpellE">encargado</span> and depriving plain­tiff of the
possession thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants' answer
in the inferior court dated October 13, 1960 describes in paragraph 3 thereof
two parcels of land both bounded on the north by <span class="SpellE"><u>Rangas</u></span>
<u>River</u> which is the southwestern boundary of plaintiff's land, and avers
"[t]hat if the plaintiff refers to the land described in paragraph 3
hereof, he has no right over the same." The judgment of the inferior
court, after trial, went for plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendants appealed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, defend­ants in their new answer repeated the
averments just mentioned.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, on <st1:date year="1963" day="12" month="2">February 12,
 1963</st1:date>, defendants filed an amended answer in the Court of First
Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their two parcels of <span style="">land described as such in paragraph 3 of the
two previous answers were there - also in paragraph 3 - consolidated into
one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be noted is that this
consolidated parcel describes the boundary on the <u>north</u> by </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rangas</span></u></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><u><span style="">River</span></u></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> (before), by <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span>
P. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> (now).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then followed the following material amendments:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"5.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That during the strong typhoon sometime in the year 1948, the <span class="SpellE">Rangas</span> River which, prior thereto, was the natural boundary
between the estates of the parties herein, suddenly changed its course by
traversing the northern portion of the defendants' lands separating from it the
northern portion thereof; 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the
old river bed has become dry and defendants have taken pos­session thereof and
have never abandoned the possession of the segregated northern portion; 7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That if the plaintiff refers to the land
described in paragraph 3 hereof and referred to in the two preceding
paragraphs, then he has no right whatsoever over the same." This amended
answer was admitted by the court on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="2"><span style="">February 28, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, the court stating that the claim of
ownership was "only for the purpose of showing the character and extent of
possession."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1963</st1:date>,
plaintiff filed his amended complaint which repeats the description of his land
showing that the southwest portion thereof is bounded, amongst others, by <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Rangas</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The disputed paragraph 3 of the amended
complaint reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on the SW which is bounded by the <span class="SpellE">Rangas</span> River and <span class="SpellE">Felipa</span> <span class="SpellE">Capus</span> now of the plaintiff there existed a por­tion which
was periodically covered by water during rainy season and hence it was not
included in the survey but later became higher thus forming an accretion to the
plaintiff's property thru the gradual effect of the current of said river from
which time then it was dedicated to pasture and to <span class="SpellE">casava</span>
and <span class="SpellE">camotes</span> up to April 3, 1960." Then follows
the allegation of forcible entry.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 13, 1964, defendants moved for the dismissal of the
action, in the words of counsel, "for lack of jurisdiction because the
land litigated before this Honorable Court by virtue of the amended complaint
has not been litigated in the inferior court", and that there was "a
change of theory and cause of action." They directed their criticism
against paragraph 3 of the amended complaint just adverted to.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 20, 1964, the trial court, declaring that "it was
obvious that there is a change of subject matter which this court, as an
appellate court has no jurisdiction", and that "there is a <span style="">change of theory and cause of action, now
that the plaintiff is proving that there was accretion which is different from
that of the original case", dismissed the complaint, and directed the
plaintiff "to reimburse the defendant <span class="SpellE">Agapita</span> <span class="SpellE">Concina</span> the sum of P300.00 representing the costs of survey
of the property of the plaintiff."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is now plaintiff's turn to appeal on purely questions of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">1. No serious question arises as to plaintiff's cause of
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is forcible entry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The subject matter thereof merely is the
material possession or possession <u>de</u> <u>facto</u> over the real
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ownership or the right of
possession as an attribute of ownership is not to be determined.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The questions to be resolved simply are these:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>First</u>, who had actual possession over the piece of real
property?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Second</u>, was the
possessor ousted <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> within one year from the
filing of the complaint by force, threat, strategy or stealth?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">And <u>lastly</u>,
does he ask for the restoration of his possession?</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Mere posture of ownership by plaintiff or
defendant does not take the case out of the jurisdiction of the trial court,
unless the issue of material possession necessarily depends upon the question
of ownership,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> which is not the case here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any controversy over ownership rights could
and should be settled after the party who had the prior, peaceful and actual
possession is returned to the property.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Here, plaintiff averred prior material possession; that he was
ousted <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> by means of force, strategy or
stealth; and that this usurpation was done within the one-year period prior to
the filing of the suit in the inferior court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Succinctly did this Court explain in one case the nature of the
forcible entry action:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In giving
recognition to the action of forcible entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
the purpose of the law is to protect the person who in fact has actual
possession; and in case of <span class="SpellE">con­troverted</span> right, it
requires the parties to preserve the <u>status</u> <u>quo</u> until one or the
other of them sees fit to invoke the decision <span style="">of a court of competent jurisdiction upon the question of owner­ship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is obviously just that the person who has
first acquired possession should remain in possession pending this decision;
and the parties cannot be permitted meanwhile to engage in a petty warfare over
the possession of the property which is the subject of dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To permit this would be highly dangerous to
individual security and disturbing to social order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There­fore, where a person supposes himself
to be the owner of a piece of property and desires to vindicate his ownership
against the party actually in possession, it is incumbent upon him to institute
an action to this end in a court of competent jurisdic­tion; and he can not be
permitted, by invading the property and excluding the actual possessor, to
place upon the latter the burden of instituting an action to try the property
right."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
then the trial court, viewing the amendment set forth in paragraph 3 of the
amended complaint, did rule that such amendment changed the subject matter over
which as an appellate court it had no jurisdiction; and that because plain­tiff
would have to prove that there was accretion which was different from the
original cause of action, a change of theory and cause of action likewise
resulted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Misconception is right
here apparent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be observed is that in
the original complaint the technical description of plaintiff's land</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> shows that on the southwest its boundary is </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rangas</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">River</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
coincide with this in a general way is that defendants' answer in the inferior
court and their original answer in the Court of First Instance state that their
two parcels of land, as they were originally described, place the boundary to
the north of their properties as the same </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rangas</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">River</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And,
in their amended answer, the two parcels of land (this time consolidated into
one) claimed to be owned by defendants were described by the latter as being
bounded on the north by </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rangas</span></u></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><u><span style="">River</span></u></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> (before), but by <span class="SpellE"><u>Jovito</u></span>
<u>P</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Dizon</u></span> (now).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in paragraph 5 thereof, they do aver that
the course of the river suddenly changed by traversing the northern portion of
their lands, segregating each portion from the </span><span style="">rest; </span><span style="">but that, as
alleged in paragraph 6, the old river bed had become dry, and defendants had
taken possession of the same, and never abandoned such possession of the
segregated northern portion; and that if plaintiff referred to the consolidated
land, the northern portion of their land separated as well as the old river
bed, then plaintiff, in the words of the amended answer, "has no right
whatsoever over the same."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It thus appears all along
in plaintiff's original and amended complaints that his land was described as
being bounded on the southwest by the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rangas</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">River</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> - which <u>actually</u> <u>separates</u> it
from defendants' land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he made the
additional averment in the amended complaint stating that on the southwest
portion of his land bounded by the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rangas</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">River</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> a part was added by accretion, and that
defendants forcibly entered the said southwestern portion, it was merely to
clarify the issues of the case and to localize, more particularly, the land in
dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, this amendment was
merely an offshoot of, and was made to meet, the averments in defendants'
amended answer - on appeal - referring to the sudden change in the course of
the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rangas</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">River</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> by traversing the northern portion of their
lands separating it from the rest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Even on the assumption that there was an apparent con­flict in
the description of the disputed land as set forth in the two complaints, such a
situation would not change the case from a forcible entry suit into a different
action.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The case must <span style="">be tried and the identity
of the land alleged in the complaint estab­lished, to determine whether or not
plaintiff's rights have been violated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the trial court of July
20, 1964 dismissing plaintiff's complaint and ordering him to reimburse
defendant <span class="SpellE">Agapita</span> <span class="SpellE">Concina</span>
in the sum of P300 is hereby set aside, and this case is hereby remanded to the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> with instructions to proceed until the determination
thereof on the merits.</p>
