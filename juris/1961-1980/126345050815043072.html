				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Defendants <span class="SpellE">Getulio</span>, Reynaldo and
Roberto, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Verzo</span>, having been convicted by
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte of the
crime of murder, with which they are charged, and each sentenced to the extreme
penalty, the case is now before us for review pursuant to Section 9 of Rule 122
of the Revised Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The version of the prosecution is this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While heading for the town of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Labo</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
Norte, on <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1962</st1:date>, at
about <st1:time minute="30" hour="18"><span style="">6:30
 p.m.</span></st1:time><span style="">, riding a
bicycle, to buy medicines, <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> <span class="SpellE">Casis</span> noticed that defendant Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Verzo</span>
was seemingly trailing him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sensing,
because of this and other circumstances here­inafter adverted to, that Reynaldo
and other members of his family wanted to waylay him, <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>
went to the municipal building, after purchasing the aforementioned medicines,
and asked policeman Lope <span class="SpellE">Jariel</span> to escort him (<span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>) on his way home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Jariel</span> agreed to do so and followed him about
15 meters behind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, as <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> passed in front of the house of defendant <span class="SpellE">Getulio</span> <span class="SpellE">Verzo</span> - father of
Reynaldo - about 100 meters from the municipal building, <span class="SpellE">Getulio</span>
threw at <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> a stone, which hit his bicycle,
thereby causing him to fall <span class="SpellE">there­from</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> shouted
at <span class="SpellE">Getulio</span>, asking why he (<span class="SpellE">Getulio</span>)
had stoned him (<span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>), former patrolman Benjamin
Camino - then inside a bar across the street from the house of the <span class="SpellE">Verzos</span> - overheard him (<span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Camino stepped out of the bar, asked <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> what had happened and advised him to report to the
authorities in the municipal building.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the two (2) began to proceed thereto, they noticed that <span class="SpellE">Jariel</span> had approached <span class="SpellE">Getulio</span> and
inquired why he had stoned <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Getulio</span> replied
that his son had been struck by <span class="SpellE">Filemon's</span> son, <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span>; but, <span class="SpellE">Jariel</span> bade <span class="SpellE">Getulio</span> not to take the law into his hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this juncture, Camino approached them and,
address­ing <span class="SpellE">Getulio</span>, remarked:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"What more do you want?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You already threw a stone." Instead of
answering, <span class="SpellE">Getulio</span> entered his house, and came back
immediately thereafter, with his sons, Reynaldo and Roberto, each holding a
bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, the three (3) (<span class="SpellE">Ge­tulio</span>, Reynaldo and Roberto) attacked Camino, with their
bolos, but, soon, Camino was able to run away, <span class="SpellE">severly</span>
wounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Forth­with, the <span class="SpellE">Verzos</span> turned their fury at <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>,
whom they hacked and stabbed, until <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> fell down
unconscious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Camino - who sustained
several incised wounds,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> one of which, inflicted from behind,
affected the liver - died less than an hour and a half later, in consequence of
the resulting hemorrhage and shock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>, in turn, sustained twelve (12) wounds, including
the loss of three (3) fingers of the right hand, which were cut off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For the death of Benjamin Camino, the <span class="SpellE">Verzos</span>
were charged with murder in Criminal Case No. 1905 of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte, and, for the injuries
inflicted upon <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> <span class="SpellE">Casis</span>,
they were ac­cused, in Criminal Case No. 1909 of the same Court, of frustrated
murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense would have the Court believe that, in the evening of
July 6, Camino entered the store in the house of the <span class="SpellE">Verzos</span>,
in a drunken condition, accompanied by Manuel <span class="SpellE">Cambronero</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> and
David <span class="SpellE">Casis</span>; that, upon entering said store, Camino
boxed <span class="SpellE">Rey­naldoVerzo</span>, who fell down; that, as
Reynaldo rose to his feet, he went to the barber shop, in the adjoining compart­ment;
that thereupon Camino stabbed Roberto <span class="SpellE">Verzo</span>, with an
ice pick, three times; that the first thrust hit Roberto on the arm and the <span style="">second </span>on the back; that, when Camino
made the third thrust, Roberto managed to hold his (Ca­mino's) arm; that, at
this juncture, <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> <span class="SpellE">Casis</span>
came and tried to stab Roberto; that the latter, however, suc­ceeded in using
the body of Camino as a shield, and <span class="SpellE">Carlito'<span style="">s</span></span><span style=""> thrust landed on Camino's back; that, as <span class="SpellE">Getulio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Verzo</span> passed by the barber shop, in order to call a
police­man, <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> <span class="SpellE">Casis</span>
and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Cambronero</span> hit him with pieces of wood, on
the head and the shoulder, thereby ren­dering him unconscious; that </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Filemon</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Casis</span></span><span style="">, then, tried to attack <span class="SpellE">Getulio</span> with a bolo,
whereupon Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Verzo</span> grappled for its possession
with <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>; that, in the course of this struggle, <span class="SpellE">Filemon's</span> bolo wounded his own hand; and that, as <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> would</span> <span style="">not
yield his weapon, Reynaldo pushed him into </span>a ditch <span style="">nearby, where there were broken bottles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After a joint trial, the lower Court accepted the version of the
prosecution and found the witnesses for the defenses unworthy of credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It, accordingly, rendered judgment finding
the defendants guilty as charged in both cases and sentencing each of them, in
Criminal Case No. <span style="">1905, to the extreme
penalty and to indemnify the heirs of Benjamin Camino in the sum of P3,000.00,
as well as to pay one-third of the costs; and, in Criminal Case No. 1909, to an
"indeterminate penalty ranging from ten (10) years to seventeen (17) years
and four (4) months," to indemnify <span class="SpellE">Fi­lemon</span> <span class="SpellE">Casis</span> in the sum of P5,000.00, and to pay one-third of the
costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of the defendants having
appealed from this decision, the same, insofar only as Criminal Case No. 1905
is concerned, is before us for review, pursuant to Sec­tion 9 of Rule 122,
owing to the penalty therein imposed up­on the defendants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Their counsel <u>de</u> <u>officio</u>
maintains that the lower court erred<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
in finding that the fatal wound which caused the death of Benjamin Camino was
criminally inflicted by the ac­cused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
in convicting all the three accused in the absence of proof of conspiracy and
of who among them inflicted the fatal wound.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
in appreciating the pre­sence of treachery and abuse of superior strength.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
in failing to consider in favor of the accused the mitigating circum­stances
shown by the evidence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
in finding the accused guilty and imposing on them the death penalty."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under the first
assignment of error, counsel as­sails the sufficiency of the evidence for the
prosecution, by impugning the veracity of its witnesses, because of al­leged
inconsistencies and improbabilities in their testimo­nies, and by pointing out
defendants' alleged lack of motive to kill Camino.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon examination of the records we are satisfied that His Honor,
the trial Judge, has not erred in accept­ing the version of the prosecution and
rejecting that of the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
the testimonies of Lope <span class="SpellE">Jariel</span> and <span class="SpellE">Fi­lemon</span> <span class="SpellE">Casis</span> were substantially
corroborated by those of Emmanuel <span class="SpellE">Cambronero</span> and
Nestor Samson.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cambrone­ro</span>
was admittedly in the bar in front of the house of the <span class="SpellE">Verzos</span>,
and had stepped out of said bar, together with Ca­mino, shortly before the
occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jariel</span>
is a peace officer, who had not taken sides.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nestor Samson lived near the scene of the occurrence and had witnessed
part thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of these
witnesses for the prose­cution, which is plain, simple and straight forward,
was, moreover, corroborated by the number, the nature and the location of the
injuries sustained by Camino and <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the wounds of Camino was on his
back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The al­leged inconsistencies in
said testimonies refer to minor details on which persons witnessing the same
occurrence are likely to disagree, in the ordinary course of events.</p>

<p class="BODY">The failure of <span class="SpellE">Jariel</span> to prevent the
untoward events that happened in his presence should not affect the credi­bility
of his testimony, for he is young and he had been in the police force barely 3
months prior to the occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He fired
warning shots during the same, and had tried to dissuade the <span class="SpellE">Verzos</span>, by word of mouth, from taking the law into their
hands; but, to no avail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apart from
attest­ing to an obvious fact - that he is not a seasoned peace officer - his
performance is characteristic of the typical simple and unsophisticated
policemen of rural areas in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say, the fact that Camino had
been his colleague in the police force and that <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>
is the offended party in the case for frustrated murder does not suffice to
discredit their respective testimonies, in the light of the surrounding
circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the alleged lack of motive of the defend­ants to
attack Camino, it should be noted that proof of mo­tive is not indispensable
when the record clearly shows, as it does in the case at bar, that the death of
the offended party is due to injuries inflicted by the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, there is ample evidence that bad
blood existed be­tween the <span class="SpellE">Verzos</span>, on the one hand,
and the <span class="SpellE">Casises</span>, on the other, resulting from several
incidents between the children of <span class="SpellE">Getulio</span> <span class="SpellE">Verzo</span> and those of <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> <span class="SpellE">Casis</span>, and that, earlier in the afternoon of the
occurrence, Ben­jamin Camino had escorted <span class="SpellE">Filemon's</span>
son, David <span class="SpellE">Casis</span>, who was reluctant to pass alone
near the house of the <span class="SpellE">Ver­zos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, the latter felt that Camino had
identified himself with the <span class="SpellE">Casises</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the other hand,
defendants' version of the oc­currence is too <span class="SpellE">artificious</span>
to merit credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although they claimed
to have been wounded during the occurrence, their alleged injuries were not </span>shown
<span style="">to any physician </span>until several
days after the filing of the complaint against them, on <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The medical examination of <span class="SpellE">Getu­lio</span> <span class="SpellE">Verzo</span> took place on July 11, and that of Roberto and
Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Verzo</span> on July 17.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, the injuries of Rober­to <span class="SpellE">Verzo</span> consisted of three (3) abrasions and one superficial
wound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those of Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Verzo</span> were two (2) abra­sions, one (1) lacerated wound on
the left forearm and an incised wound in the index finger of the right
hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Getu­lio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Verzo</span> had an abrasion, two (2) contusions, one (1) la­cerated
wound and a small incised wound on the left pari­etal region, and an incised
"avulsion" on the left fore­finger.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These were superficial injuries.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Some of them might have been caused by a fall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Others could have been self-inflicted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, considering that His Honor, the
trial Judge had the decided advantage of observing the behavior of the
witnesses while giving their testimony, and taking into account the other
circumstances obtaining in the case, it is clear to us that the findings of fact
made in the decision appealed from should not be disturbed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With respect </span>t<span style="">o the second assignment of error the facts
proven leave no room for doubt that defendants herein were united in their
purpose and in carrying out the same into execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, no other conclusion may be drawn from
the circumstance that they emerged from their house at the same time, each
brandishing a bolo; that they immediately attacked Benjamin Camino and chased
him as he tried to run away; that they did not desist, despite the shots of
warning fired by Patrol­man <span class="SpellE">Jariel</span> and his words of
advice; that when, after sustaining six (6) wounds, Benjamin Camino managed to
place himself beyond their reach, the defendants proceed­ed to attack <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> Casts; and that Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Verzo</span>
em­braced or held <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> Casts from behind and then
said "Go ahead, father stab him," which <span class="SpellE">Getulio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Verzo</span> did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As regards the third
assignment of error, we hold that, although the defendants may be given the
benefit of doubt on whether or not there had been treachery, it is manifest
that they had acted with abuse of superior strength, for whereas the three (3)
of them were wielding <span class="SpellE">boloes</span>, Ben­jamin Camino was
unarmed and trying to flee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the
crime committed was murder.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a><span style=""> Although Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Jariel</span> was present at the
scene of the crime, it can not be said that the same has been committed in
contempt of or with insult to the public authorities, inasmuch that a policeman
is merely an agent of a person in authority, not a person </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">authority.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Defendants invoke the
mitigating circumstances of provocation on the part of the victim, and
incomplete self-defense and voluntary surrender on their part, but none of
these circumstances has been established.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">No modifying circumstance
having attended the per­petration of the crime of murder committed by the
accused, the penalty <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> should be imposed in
its medium period, which is life imprisonment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the corresponding civil liability should, in line with settled
jurisprudence, be increased from P3,000.00 to P6,000.00.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus modified as to the
penalty and the amount of the civil liability, the decision appealed from
should be, as it is hereby, affirmed, in all other respects, with costs against
the defendants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
