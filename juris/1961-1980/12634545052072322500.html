				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The record shows that of the <span style="">shipment of twenty-one </span>(21) packages of industrial control
parts, etc., consigned to General Electric, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and delivered by SS "Pioneer Mist" into the custody of the Bureau of
Customs as the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator, the latter did not
de­liver two (2) packages valued at P36,914.35.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Fireman's Fund Insurance Company as insurer of the said shipment against
loss or damage, paid the consignee said amount and as consignee's <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span> pursued the claims before the Bureau of
Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failing in recovery, <span style="">the Fireman's </span>Fund Insurance Company
filed before the Court of First Instance of Manila on June 21, 1966, <span style="">a complaint to re­</span>cover P36,914.35
plus P1,000 attorney's fees and costs; <span style="">alleging
that the condition of the </span>goods was not known when it was delivered by the
carrier to the Bureau, it <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as defendants,
the Republic of the Philippines and the carrier United States Lines Company.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Republic of the Philippines moved to dismiss, alleging its
non-suability and non-compliance with Act 3083 as amended by C.A. 327 requiring
money claims to be filed with the Auditor General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The United States <span style="">Lines, denying liability, claimed </span>that the shipment was
discharged into the custody of the Bureau of Customs in good order condition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Over the opposition </span>of
the plaintiff, the Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the case as
against the Republic of the Philippines, ruling that the Republic was not
subject to suit without its consent, aside from the fact that the claim was not
filed with the Auditor General as should be the case under Act 3083 as amended
by C.A. 327.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The assessment, collection of lawful revenues from imported
articles and all other tariff and customs duties, fees, charges, fines and
penalties, is a prime governmental function being carried out <span style="">by </span>the Republic of the Philippines
through the Bureau of Customs and the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service as its agencies, the latter performing a necessary incidental function
- the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the performance of such a necessary incident,
neither the Republic nor the Bureau of Customs nor the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service may be sued without its consent, for
obvious reasons of public policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as
provided for in Act 3083 as amended by C.A. 327, the money claim should have
been filed before the office of the Auditor General.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The present claim appears to be a liquidated one, being <span style="">for </span>a fixed sum of money based on
fairly accessible papers and records; the fact that the Government disputes its
liability for a liquidated claim does not convert it into an <span class="SpellE">unliquidated</span> one.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of dismissal appealed from is hereby
affirmed and the case against the Republic of the Philippines is
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
