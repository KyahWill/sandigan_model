				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this appeal by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span>
(Philippines) Inc. from a decision of respondent Workmen's Compensation
Commission, the award granted the employee, respondent <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span>
D. Castillo, in view of the ailments "admittedly work-connected" with
his employment <span style="">at </span>the <span class="SpellE">ethylizing</span> plant of petitioner, due to exposure to tetraethyl
lead, <span style="">is </span>sought to be set aside
on due process grounds, it being alleged that the finding as to the cause of
such ailments "is not supported by any evidence on record" and that
an additional compensation for alleged disability was likewise without such
support and, what was worse, granted without such claim having been presented.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the decision of respondent Workmen's Compensation Commission,
which is sought to be reversed, the antecedents of the case were set forth,
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It appears that claimant <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> D. Castillo was first taken in by the respondent
in<span style=""> 1954 to
work in the Pumping and Shipping Section of its Refinery in <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>
with a daily wage of P13.17.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He worked </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">TEL Blending
Operator in this section, after undergoing the required training and had
remained in this particular job up to July 1956, when he was transferred to
another section because of his complaint of body weakness and dizzi­ness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this section, he was assigned to act as
pump operator with the principal duty of opening intake and outlet valves of
the respondent's storage tanks and noting their gauge readings until 1958, when
his designation was changed to that of mechanic at P14.67 a day."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Then came the finding as to the ailment from which respondent
Castillo was found to be suffering.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"On January 14, 1956, while still performing the job of a TEL
Blending Operator (blending ethyl fluid, <span style="">a
</span>poisonous substance, with gasoline), claimant was for the first time
found to be suffering from <span class="SpellE">Thrombo</span>-phlebitis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1960 Castillo's varicose veins had become
hemorrhagic and in 1961, his <span class="SpellE">Thrombo</span>-phlebitis,
together with his dermatitis, had so asserted to the point of disabling
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When examined on <st1:date year="1961" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1961</st1:date>, by Dr. Prospero Ma. <span class="SpellE">Oreta</span> (doctor to whom claimant was referred by the
respondent's physician for expert advice and treatment), Castillo was found to
be suf­fering from ‘<span class="SpellE">Thrombo</span>-phlebitis, <span class="SpellE">obronic</span>, lags, bilateral, Allergic Dermatitis, leg,
right.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His <span class="SpellE">thrombo</span>-phlebitis
was operated on in the early part of 1962."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>What trans­pired next follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"On account of the above-described
ailments, Castillo was not able to report for work from <st1:date year="1962" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1962</st1:date>, to <st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1962</st1:date>, and from <st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1962</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But because his ailments had considerably impaired his capacity to meet
efficiently the duties attached to his job (mechanic) he was prevailed upon on <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1964</st1:date> by the respondent to
retire under its retirement plan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During
the first period of his disability, however, respondent paid him the amount of
P460.95.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amount of P1<span class="GramE">,351.50</span> spent by Castillo for the hospital (P554.60) and for
medicines (P796.90) came from his own pocket."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of respondent Commission likewise noted:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It further appears that on <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1963</st1:date>, a decision in this
case was rendered by the aforesaid officer holding respondent liable for
compensation for the work-connected <span style="">ailments (<span class="SpellE">thrombo</span>-phlebitis,
varicose veins, and dermatitis) of the claimant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent filed on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="17" month="10"><span style="">October 17, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, a petition for
review of said decision on the grounds we have at the outset stated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently convinced by the soundness of one
of the grounds (re: computation of compensation under Section 14 of the Act)
interposed therein by the respondent, the Hearing Officer in an order dated December
12, 1963, modified the computation of the compensation provided for in said
decision by reckoning claimant's weekly compensation at P35.00 (the maximum
allowed by Law) and not at P39.51, as previously computed, but ordered, in the
same breath, the elevation of the entire records to us pursuant to Section 5,
Rule 23, Rules of the WCC."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, respondent Commission in effect upheld its hear­ing officer
in <st1:place><st1:placename>San Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">After
being </span>employed by petitioner for some time, respondent Castillo
"noticed there was<span style=""> </span><span style="">something wrong with

company doctor and complained also of dizziness and pains on the chest and
back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span>,
the company physician, <span style="">advised </span><span style="">him to go to Dr. </span><span style="">Prospero Maria <span class="SpellE">Oreta</span> of the St. Luke's Hospital who diagnosed the
claimant's ailments </span><span style="">as </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">thrombo</span></span><span style="">-phlebitis, </span><span style="">chronic, legs <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">bil</span></span><span class="GramE">.;</span> varicose ulcer, leg right, edema, acute leg right;

</span><span style="">was </span><span style="">a summary of what was testified to by the
Doctor:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Dr. Prospero <span class="SpellE">Oreta</span>, being presented as an expert witness, testified that
the claimant's allergic dermatitis of the right leg is probably due to contact
with </span><span style="">tetraethyl lead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">He
further stated the other possibilities that there may be some other cause or
causes for the ailment, but the history given by the claimant shows that he got
this from his work because exposure to the tetraethyl lead is dangerous if it
is prolonged and continuous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
exposure </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">not enough but if it is
done again </span><span style="">and again, it could </span><span style="">lead </span><span style="">to skin </span><span style="">eruptions and other conditions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Claimant here works for 8 hours, sometimes, 4 hours </span><span style="">at </span><span style="">the minimum and sometimes more than 8 hours depending upon the

<p class="BODY">Petitioner was likewise required to pay respondent Castillo's
legal counsel in the amount of Two hundred twenty-five pesos (P225.00) and
respondent Commission the sum of Thirty-six pesos (P36.00) as partial decision
fee and cost of the review, <span style="">as </span>well
as the sum of one peso (P1.00) for every hundred pesos (P100.00) of
compensation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the facts as above found, which this Court is not free to
disregard, the first due process question raised, namely, the absence of
evidence in support thereof, must fail.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The scope of the appellate function exercised by this Court in appeals
from decisions of the Workmen's<span style=""> Compensation Commission was set forth with clarity
in <span class="SpellE">Basaysay</span> v. Workmen's Compensation Commission.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> According to the
then Justice, now Chief Justice, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, "It
is well settled that in appeals by certiorari, such </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">the one we have
before us, the findings of fact made in the decision appealed from will not be
reviewed by this Court, unless there has been </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">grave abuse of discretion in making said findings,
by reason of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">total absence of
competent evidence - which, to our mind, is, also, substantial - in support of
the finding contested in the case at bar which admittedly exists, petitioner's
contention being merely that said evidence (Dr. Lorenzo's </span><span style="">testimony) </span><span style="">should not have
been given credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The task of
ascertaining the credibility and weight of conflicting <span class="GramE">evidence,</span>
is, however, beyond the province of our authority in appeals by certio­rari.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, petitioner's contention is
untenable."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Since the brief for petitioner would in effect require this Court
to disregard the appraisal made by respondent Commission of the testimony of
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Oreta</span>, to whom respondent Castillo "was
referred by [petitioner's] physician for expert advise and treatment”, the <span style="">words </span>of the Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> in the above case, if heeded, would show that
such an assertion cannot possibly find acceptance with this Court.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the allegation that the finding that the ailments from
which respondent Castillo suffered were "admittedly work-connected"
could be characterized "as wholly unsupported by any evidence" of
record ignores the statutory provision that the presumption in the absence of
substantial evidence to the contrary <span style="">is
</span>that the claim <span style="">comes within the
provisions of this Act.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the latest decision on the subject,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court, thru Justice <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, stated that under
the above pro­vision "once the claimant has established that the illness, <span style="">upon which </span>the claim is premised,
supervened <u>during</u> the time of his employment, there is <span style="">a </span><span class="SpellE">rebuttable</span>
presumption that the illness arose <u>out</u> <u>of</u> or at least was
aggravated by, his employment."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
<span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> case refers to an earlier decision.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, again in interpreting the above
presumption established by the law, Justice J.B.L. Reyes speaking for the Court
correctly noted "that the laborer at present is relieved from the burden
of proving causation once the injury is shown to have arisen in the course of
the employment."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His opinion went
on to state:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">"The disease </span>having arisen in the
course of the employment, it <span style="">is </span>presumed
by law that it arose out of it; and the fact that the conditions of work are
only <span style="">a </span>contributory cause that
permitted the disease to take hold in the organism of the laborer does not make
<span style="">the injury less </span>compensable
(Larson, Workmen's Compensation Law, Vol. 1, p. 50)."</p>

<p class="BODY">It would then be to reverse what <span style="">is </span>now settled <span style="">doctrine
in conformity with </span>the mandate of the Workmen's Compensation Act and in
keeping <span style="">with </span>its basic
philosophy of holding an employer liable for injury or illness which <span style="">thus afflicts an </span>employee in the
course of employment to sustain petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover a more careful analysis of what <span style="">was </span>testified to would disclose the inaccuracy of the assertion
that there was no support for the finding made by the Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other due <span style="">process
question raised, on its face, </span>appears to call for a more serious consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is <span style="">undeniable that Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Baens</span>
<span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario <span style="">did
</span>not limit her a</span><span style="">ward to
cover only the earlier period for which </span><span style="">the claim </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">filed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her decision of February 5, 1965, in addition to affirming whet was
granted by the hearing </span><span style="">officer, increased
the </span><span style="">compensation by ONE THOUSAND
SEVEN HUNDRED TEN PESOS (P1<span class="GramE">,710.00</span>), with the proviso
that the weekly amount of THIRTY FIVE PESOS (P35.00) be granted respondent
Castillo from February 16, 1965 as long </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">the limit of FOUR THOUSAND PESOS </span><span style="">(P4,000.00) was not reached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">As to such additional compensation than the
contention that petitioner was not originally heard could plausibly be
raised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">understandable then why procedural due
process was invoked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">From <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Tibay</span>
v. Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>

it has been the constant holding that one must be heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A disregard of such <span style="">a </span><span style="">right has fatal consequences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
such indeed were the case, then petitioner must prevail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Could it be truly said however that such a
right was in fact denied petitioner?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such an assertion, as above noted, could only have been made when the </span><span style="">matter was before the hearing officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Then
came </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">above modification by Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Baens</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner could argue that such an amendment
could not have been anticipated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
no doubt true, it is not decisive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
its petition for reconsideration before res­pondent Workmen's Compensation
Commission, petitioner did have the opportunity to make vocal its protest
against the grant of additional compensation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, it sought and was heard on oral argument before respondent
Workmen's Compensation Commission where the opportunity to discuss such a
question was once again afforded it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It cannot be truthfully <span style="">said </span>then that it was not heard at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court had occasion to state once,
what <span style="">is </span>sought
to be safeguarded against is not "lack of previous notice <span style="">but the denial of </span>opportunity to be
heard on the claim."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The due process requirement therefore was not altogether disregarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">One other thing.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither <span style="">in
</span>the motion for reconsideration filed before respondent Workmen's
Compensation Commission, nor <span style="">in its
brief was </span>there even the remotest hint that if it were thus heard, the
result would have been different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
what due process contemplates <span style="">is </span>freedom
from arbitrariness and what it requires is fairness or justice, the substance
rather than the form being paramount, an allegation based solely on the lack of
opportunity to be heard without notice does not <u>per</u><span style=""> </span><u>se</u> merit unconditional approval.</p>

<p class="BODY">That counsel would exert his utmost to advance his client’s cause
is commendable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It often happens that in
the zeal of advocacy, in his earnest desire to press his claim, the temptation
to employ strong language to show the weak­ness of the contrary view <span style="">may </span><span style="">be difficult to resist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Nonetheless, counsel must make the
effort.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should be aware that a
pleading unduly harsh in its characterization <span style="">of what the </span>other party did would be far from persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The
brief for petitioner has not avoided such a pitfall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>
noted, the use of "intemperate language * * * detracts from the force of
arguments * * *.”<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Nor <span style="">is </span>this all.</span> Proper respect must be <span style="">accorded </span>quasi judicial agencies like
the Workmen's Compensation Commission.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Along with the courts, they are collaborative instruments in the search
