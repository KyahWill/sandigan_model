owner of a certain parcel of land situated at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Tagalag</span>,
Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, containing an area of 23,245
square meters and was embraced in Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-55814;
that the plaintiffs are some of the legal heirs of the deceased, Ana <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, who died intestate; that on or about March 15,
1965, during her last illness, the deceased decided to mortgage the
above-mentioned property for P5,000.00 so that she could pay her existing
obligation to one <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE">Jusayan</span>
in the amount of P3,000.00 and to spend for her recovery from illness; that she
entrusted the title to her property to the defendant, Jaime <span class="SpellE">Rivero</span>,
trusting that he would facilitate the mortgage; that the defendant did not
mortgage the property but instead, on or about March 25, 1965, when Ana <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> was no longer in full possession of her
reasoning faculties, said defendant, through fraud and misrepresentation,
manifesting that certain documents were supposed to be deeds of mortgage of the
above-named property and also through violence and undue influence on Ana <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, effected the signing by the deceased of the
documents which are in reality a deed of absolute sale and an affidavit of
alienation; that the defendant did not give any consideration to Ana <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> and, in fact, the deceased died without paying
her debt to <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE">Jusayan</span>,
and said Ana <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> lacked proper medical
treatment; that on or about March 26, 1965, the defendant effected the
registration of the property in question in his name and Transfer Certificate
of Title No. T-56789 was issued to him by virtue of the documents signed
through mistake, fraud and violence; that as a consequence of the defendant's
fraudulent acts and breach of trust, the plaintiffs suffered moral and
exemplary damages amounting to a total of not less than P40,000.00; and that
the plaintiffs were constrained to engage counsel for a fee of P5,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">After his motion to dismiss was denied, the defendant, Jaime <span class="SpellE">Rivero</span>, filed on September 14, 1965 an answer<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein he alleged as special and affirmative defenses that the trial court has
no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action; that the plaintiffs have
no legal capacity to sue; that the claim on which the action is founded is unenforceable
under the Statute of Frauds; that the complaint states no cause of action; that
the suit is between members of the same family and no earnest effort towards a
compromise had been made; that the deed of absolute sale and affidavit of
alienation were executed by Ana <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> freely and
voluntarily; and that the defendant has fully paid the consideration of the
said deed of absolute sale and affidavit of alienation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant interposed a counterclaim for
damages and attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Despite the number of errors assigned, the principal issue is the
validity of the deed of sale, Exhibit A.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record discloses that Ana <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
was the only daughter of Vicente <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> who died
in 1934; that Ana <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> inherited from her
father a parcel of land which is the subject of the present controversy; that
Ana <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> was afflicted with pulmonary
tuberculosis and as she needed money for her treatment, she requested her
nephew, Jaime <span class="SpellE">Rivero</span>, to work for the transfer of the
title of the land in question to her; that on January 20, 1965, through the
efforts of Jaime <span class="SpellE">Rivero</span>, Transfer Certificate of
Title No. T-55814 embracing said land was issued in the name of Ana <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>; that Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-55814
was never delivered by Jaime <span class="SpellE">Rivero</span> to Ana <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> until she died; that not long after the death of
Ana <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> on April 18, 1968, the relatives of
the deceased discovered that the land of Ana <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
had been registered in the name of Jaime <span class="SpellE">Rivero</span> who
secured Transfer Certificate of Title No. 56789 in his name from the Register
of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>; and that a deed entitled "<span class="SpellE">Kasulatan</span> Sa <span class="SpellE">Ganap</span> Na <span class="SpellE">Bilihan</span>" dated March 24, 1965, whereby it was made to
appear that Ana <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> had sold to Jaime <span class="SpellE">Rivero</span> the land in question, was allegedly concocted by
Jaime <span class="SpellE">Rivero</span>, taking advantage of his being in

<p class="BODY">The evidence of the plaintiffs on the issue of forgery consisted
of the testimony of Major <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> F. Hernandez who
was presented as a handwriting expert.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Major Hernandez declared that he made a study of the authenticity and
genuineness of the signature of Ana <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> on the
deed of sale, Exhibit A, by comparing it with the signatures of Ana <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> appearing in four (4) documents admittedly
signed by her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The standards used by the
handwriting expert are the sworn statement dated March 25, 1965, Exhibit B; the
affidavit of adjudication dated <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="1">January
 20, 1965</st1:date>, Exhibit C; the option to sell dated <st1:date year="1958" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1958</st1:date>; and the voter's affidavit and
list of voters for the election of 1955 which contain the signature of Ana <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of Major <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> F.
Hernandez that the deed of sale was a forgery was not contradicted by evi­dence
of the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to said
handwriting expert, the signature in the deed of sale, Exhibit A, shows irregu­lar,
tremulous, hesitating and corrective strokes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is written with a drawing movement, unlike the standard signa­tures
where the movement is fluent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
handwriting charac­teristics are dissimilar.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Based on these dissimilarities, Major Hernandez concluded that the
signature on the deed of sale, Exhibit A, was not written by Ana <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, although desisting from calling the deed of
sale, Exhibit A, a forgery, found that the consent of Ana <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
was obtained through fraudulent misrepresentation of Jaime <span class="SpellE">Rivero</span>
because:</p>

<blockquote>"This Court, for one, is not infallible, and will desist from
calling Exhibit A <span class="SpellE">a</span> forgery to avoid the risk of passing
erroneous judgment on people who might otherwise be innocent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even on the assumption that the document
was in fact signed by Ana <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, the Court finds
that it could not have been her intention to sell the land to <span class="SpellE">Rivero</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Ana <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> was illiterate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She could sign her name with difficulty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Luisa <span class="SpellE">Rivero</span>, who
attended her, studied only up to grade school, and the two of them could not
have understood the meaning and import of the documents Ana <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
was made to sign.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the latter knew
the value of her property as far back as 1958, for in that year she gave an
option to sell it for P4.50 per square meter (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
D), which is more than P100,000.00 for the whole area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She could readily have sold it for perhaps
less than that amount at any time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
instead of doing so she only borrowed P2,623.00 from <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span>
Zamora (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 19) and P450.00 from <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Origen</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 20).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This can only mean that she did not want to
sell the property for less than its actual value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="3">March
 25, 1965</st1:date> she was already gravely ill and in need of funds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet why should she be willing to sell the
land for P5,000.00, when she well knew that she could get P100,000.00 for
it?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this situation, it is not difficult
to believe the testimony of Luisa <span class="SpellE">Rivero</span> that what
the old woman wanted was to mortgage the property in order to pay off her debts
and have ready funds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the same token
she could not have agreed to sell the land to <span class="SpellE">Rivero</span>
for P5,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If she signed the deed of
sale and subsequent affidavit, it was under the false belief that she was only
mortgaging the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sale is
therefore <span class="SpellE">voidable</span>, because the consent of Ana <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> was obtained thru the fraudulent
misrepresentation of <span class="SpellE">Rivero</span> that the contract she was
signing was one of mortgage (Art. 1330, N.C.C.).</blockquote>
