				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.P., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Respondent Lilia <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span> Gonzales seeks
reconsideration of Our decision holding her liable for the payment of P97<span class="GramE">,723.96</span> as estate and inheritance taxes plus delinquency
penalties as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> of the intestate estate
of <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The grounds raised by her, deserve this
extended resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, <span class="SpellE">movant</span> maintains that the
issue of whether or not the estate and inheritance tax return filed by Jose <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span> on <st1:date year="1949" day="13" month="5">May 13,
 1949</st1:date> was sufficient to start the running of the statute of
limitations on assessment, was neither raised in the Court of Tax Appeals nor
assigned as error before this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
records in the Court of Tax Appeals however show the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph 2 of the answer filed by the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue states:</p>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That he likewise admits, as alleged in
paragraph 1 thereof, having received the letter of the petitioner dated
November 27, <span style="">1959 </span>(Annex
"A" of the Petition for Review), contesting the assessment of estate
and inheritance taxes levied against the Intestate Estate of the Late <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span>, Special Proceedings
No. 459, Court of First Instance of Iloilo, on the ground that the said assessment
has already prescribed, but specifically denies the allegations that the
assessments have already prescribed, the truth of the matter being that the
returns filed on May 11, 1949, cannot be considered as a true and complete
return sufficient to start the running of the period of five (5) years prescribed
in Sec. 331 of the Tax Code;"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This point was discussed in the
memorandum of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"In the estate and inheritance tax return filed by Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span> (Exhibits B &amp; 1, pp. 14-20, B.I.R. records) the
net value of the estate of the deceased was claimed to be P203<span class="GramE">,354.00</span> and no inheritance tax was shown as the heirs were
not indicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the final computation of
the estate by an examiner of the respondent, the net estate was found to be
worth P410<span class="GramE">,518.30</span> (p. 105, B.I.R. records) or about
more than twice the original amount declared in the return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the subsequent investigation of this case,
it was also determined that the heirs of the deceased were Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span>, a legitimate son, and Lilia <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span>,
an acknowledged natural child, (petitioner herein).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under the circumstances, we believe the return filed on <st1:date year="1949" day="11" month="5">May 11, 1949</st1:date> was false or fraudulent
in the sense that the <span class="GramE">value of the properties were</span>
under declared and that the said return was also incomplete as the heirs to the
estate were not specified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as
the respondent was not furnished adequate data upon which to base an
assessment, the said return cannot be con­sidered a true and complete return
sufficient to start the running of the period of limitations of five (5) years
prescribed in Section 331 of the Tax Code."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the lower court the defense of the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue against Lilia <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span> Gonzales' plea of
prescription, centered on the insufficiency and fraudulence or falsity of the
return filed by Jose <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Tax Appeals overruled the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
the Tax Court:</p>

<blockquote>"The provision of Section <span style="">332(a) </span>of the Tax Code cannot be invoked <span style="">in </span>this case as it was neither alleged in respondent's answer,
nor proved during <span style="">the hearing </span>that
the return was false or fraudulent with intent to evade the payment of
tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the failure of respondent
to <span style="">charge fraud and </span>impose the
penalty thereof in the assessments made in <span style="">1953, 1955 </span>and <span style="">1958 </span>is
an eloquent demonstration that the filing of petitio­ner's transfer tax return
was not attended by falsity or fraud with intent to evade tax.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But respondent urges upon us that the filing of the return
did not start the running of the five (5) year period for the reason that the
return did not disclose the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Matias</span>
<span class="SpellE">Yusay</span>, and contained inadequate data regarding the
value of the estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe that
these mere omissions do not require additional returns for the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Altho</span> incomplete
for being de­ficient on these matters, the return cannot be regarded as a case
of failure to file a return where want of good faith and intent to evade the
tax on the part of petitioner are not charged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It served as a sufficient notice to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
to make his assessment and start the running of the period of limitation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, it must be borne in mind
that the Commissioner is not confined to the taxpayer's return in making
assessment of the tax, and for this purpose he may secure additional
information from other sources.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">As was done in the case at bar, he sends inves­tigators to examine
the taxpayer's records and other pertinent data.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>His assessment is based upon the facts
uncovered by the inves­tigation (Collector v. Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, G.R. Nos. L-11760 &amp; L-11761, <st1:date year="1958" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1958</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Furthermore, the failure to state the heirs in the return can
be attributed to the then unsettled conflict raging before the probate court as
to who are the heirs of the estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
failure could not have been a deliberate attempt to mislead the government in
the assessment of the correct taxes."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his appeal, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assigned as
third error of the Court of Tax Appeals the finding that the assessment in
question was "made beyond the five-year statutory period provided in
Section 332(a) of the Tax Code," and that the right of the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue to assess the estate and inheritance taxes has already
prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To sustain his side, the
Commissioner ventilated in his brief, fraud in the filing of the return,
absence of certain data from the return which prevented him from assessing thereon
the tax due and the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> in this Court of <span style="">L-11374 </span>entitled "Intestate
Estate of the late <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Matias</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span>, </span>Jose
C. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Yusay</span></span><span style="">, </span>Administrator vs. Lilia <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span> Gonzales" which allegedly had the effect of
suspending the running of the period of limitations on assessment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, therefore, it would be incorrect to<span style=""> say </span>that the question of whether or not the return filed by
Jose <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span> was sufficient to start the running of the
statute of limitations to assess the corresponding tax, <u><span style="">was </span>not
raised </u>by the Commissioner in the Court of Tax Appeals and <span style="">in this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Second.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Movant</span> contends that contrary to <span class="GramE"><span style="">Our</span></span><span style=""> ruling, </span>the return filed by Jose <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span>
was sufficient to state the statute of limitations on assessment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as this question was amply discussed
in <span class="GramE">Our</span> deci<span style="">sion
</span>sought to be reconsidered, and no new argument was advanced, We deem it
unnecessary to pass upon the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is no reason for any change on <span class="GramE">Our</span> stand on this
point.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Third.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Movant</span> <span style="">insists
</span>that since she administers only one-third of the estate of <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span>, she should not be
liable for the whole tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And she
suggests that <span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> </span>hold the intestate estate of <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span> liable for said
taxes, one-third to be paid by Lilia <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span> Gonzales
and two-thirds to be paid by <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The foregoing suggestion to require payment of
two-thirds of the total taxes by <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> P. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Vda</span></span><span style="">.</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span> is
not acceptable, for she (<span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span>) is not a party in
this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be pointed out that Lilia <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span>
Gonzales appealed the whole assessment to the Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue questioned her legal capacity to institute the appeal on the ground
that she administered only one-third of the estate of <span class="SpellE">Matias</span>
<span class="SpellE">Yusay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
opposition, she espoused the view, which was sustained by the Tax Court, that
in co-administration, the <span class="SpellE">administratrices</span> are
regarded as one person and the acts of one of them in relation to the regular
administration of the estate are deemed to be the acts of all; hence, each <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> can represent the whole estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In advancing such a proposition, Lilia <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span> Gonzales represented the whole estate and hoped to
benefit from the favorable outcome of the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For the same reason that she represented her co-<span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
and the whole estate of <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span>,
she risked being ordered to pay the whole assessment, should the assessment be
sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Her change of stand adopted in the motion for reconsideration to
the effect that she should be made liable for only one-third of the total tax,
would negate her aforesaid proposition before the Court of Tax Ap<span style="">peals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She is now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from denying liability for
the whole tax.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At any rate, estate and
inheritance taxes are <u>sa</u></span><u>tisfied from the estate</u> <span style="">and are to be paid by the executor or
