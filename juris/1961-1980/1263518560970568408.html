				<BR><STRONG>CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These two appeals by certiorari taken by the respective
complainants from the decision and the resolution dated October 3, 1963 and
August 29, 1964, respectively, of the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) in
case 2879-ULP (LVN Pictures Employees and Workers Association [NLU] v. LVN
Pictures, Inc.), and from the decision and the resolution dated June 2, 1966
and July 18, 1966, respectively, of the same court in case 3013-ULP (LVN
Pictures Checkers’ Union [NLU] v. LVN Pictures, Inc. and/ or <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> Pictures, Inc.), are here considered together
because all the complainants in both cases were former employees of the LVN
Pictures, Inc. and the two cases involve similar, if not identical, factual
situations and issues.</p>

<p class="BODY">The LVN Pictures, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the LVN) was a
corporation engaged in the business of producing <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>
movies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among its employees were the
members of the LVN Pictures employees and Workers Association (NLU)
(hereinafter referred to as the EWA) with which it executed on <st1:date year="1959" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1959</st1:date> a collective
bargaining agreement to expire on <st1:date year="1960" day="31" month="12">December
 31, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During their
employment with LVN, the members of the EWA served in various capacities in the
LVN, such as cameramen and their assistants, soundmen and their assistants,
sound technicians, carpenters, electricians, drivers, laboratory personnel, and
laborers doing odd jobs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Previous to the year 1957, the LVN was realizing profits from its
business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, from 1957 to 1961, it
suffered heavy losses in its movie production due to causes beyond its
control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As of <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1961</st1:date> its total losses amounted to
P1,580,985.14, while its paid-up capital as of the said date was only
P1,204,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus the losses exceeded the
paid-up capital by P356,985.14.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also as
of <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1961</st1:date>, the
company's total liabilities reached P1,189,946.10 while its total assets were
only P853,961.05, so that its liabilities exceeded its assets by
P335,985.14.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, outstanding
loans due from it amounted to P527,960.53.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Of its overdraft line of 200,000 with the Philippine National Bank which
served as part of its operating capital, it had used and with­drawn the total
sum of 199,303.45, leaving the amount of only P696.55.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>LVN had likewise used and withdrawn
P199,167.95 of its overdraft line in the amount of P200,000 with the Commercial
Bank &amp; Trust Company, leaving a balance of P832.05.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding the foregoing adverse financial posture, the LVN
continued to operate its movie production with the expec­tation that it would
recoup part of its losses and investments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And in order to avoid immediate closure of business, as well as lay-off
of employees, the management of the LVN, by letter dated <st1:date year="1960" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1960</st1:date>, proposed to the EWA a change in
the payment of salaries and wages of the employees from salary or wage basis to
the "<span class="SpellE">pakiao</span>" system per picture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This proposal was however rejected by the
union in its letter of <st1:date year="1960" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="8" month="4">April
 8, 1960</st1:date> the LVN asked the EWA to reconsider its decision on the
"<span class="SpellE">pakiao</span>" system, to no avail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, on <st1:date year="1961" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1961</st1:date>, the LVN proposed to reduce the monthly
compensation of all its employees and laborers regardless of whether or not
they were union mem­bers, according to the following scale:</p>

<blockquote>"from P175.00 to P190. 00 -----------------<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>5%</blockquote>

<blockquote>"from P200.00 to P350.00 ------------------ 10%</blockquote>

<blockquote>"from P 400.00 up ----------------------------
20%."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The salaries and/or wages of employees
and workers below P175 as well as the daily wage earners were not to be
affected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This proposal was approved by
the board of directors of the LVN as a measure to stave off the mounting losses
in the operation of its <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span> movie
production.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it was also rejected by
the EWA in its letter of <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="2">February 15,
 1961</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the expiration of the term of the collective bargaining
contract, the EWA proposed negotiations for a new contract on <st1:date year="1961" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a letter-reply dated <st1:date year="1961" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1961</st1:date>, the LVN informed the EWA that on <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="3">March 15 1961</st1:date> the LVN stockholders
would hold a meeting at which one of the matters to be discussed was whether
because of the financial losses of the corporation, it would still continue to
make pictures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The LVN therefore advised
union that it would answer neither yes nor no to the proposed negotiations but
would await the outcome of the stockholders’ meeting.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>By letter dated March 20,
1961, the LVN informed the EWA that, because of huge losses incurred and the
many obligations of the former which could not be met, the stockholders had
agreed not to invest additional capital and to stop producing new moving
pictures, and to finish only the pictures that were then under production.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in view of the refusal of the EWA
to consider the <span class="SpellE">LVN's</span> proposals and because of the
mounting losses, the <span class="SpellE">LVN's</span> board of directors decided
to close its movie production as of <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="5">May
 31, 1961</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a necessary consequence of the stoppage of its movie
production after <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1961</st1:date>,
the LVN was compelled to dismiss its personnel employed in the said movie
production, among them the 84 employees and/or workers of the EWA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The equipments and properties of the LVN were
kept in the studio premises under the care of a skeleton force selected for the
purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, in order to secure
rents to meet some of its obligations the leased its equipments and properties
for the production of moving pictures to the <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span> <span class="SpellE">Ilang-Ilang</span> Productions, Arriba Productions, Inc., Manuel
M. <span class="SpellE">Lagunsad</span> Productions, Galaxy Productions, Inc. <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> Pictures, Inc., Magna East Productions and other
producers, at P13,000 per picture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the production of moving pictures, the several lessees employed their own
personnel to handle the leased properties and equipments of the LVN.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were some instances when these lessees
employed former workers and employees of the LVN.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 31, 1961 the <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> Pictures,
Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the DPI) was incorporated, capitalized at
P100,000 which was wholly subscribed and fully paid by its incorporators, as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Delfin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Buencamino</span>, 1,000 shares, P50,000; <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span> Luna, 400 shares, P20,000; Maria <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span>, 200 shares P10,000; Jose T. Beltran, 200 shares,
P10,000; and <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>,
200 shares, P10,000.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1961</st1:date>,
the LVN Pictures Checkers' Union (NLU) (hereinafter referred to as the LPCU)
was organized and was registered with the Department of Labor on <st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="27" month="2">February
 27, 1961</st1:date> it sent a letter to the LVN containing collective
bargaining proposals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The LVN informed
the LPCU that the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> stockholders would meet to
decide whether or not it would continue production of pictures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="24" month="3">March
 24, 1961</st1:date> all the members of LPCU received identical letters
informing them that the LVN would stop its movie production business ef­fective
<st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the LVN began reducing the
work-load of the members of LPCU and, in November 1961, dismissed them from
employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="18" month="7">July 18, 1961</st1:date>
the EWA filed a complaint charging the LVN with violations of section 4(a) (1)
and (4) of Republic Act 875 (Industrial Peace Act), consisting of alleged union
interference by the LVN and/or discriminatory dismissal of 84 employees, and
workers because of their membership in the EWA.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The LPCU likewise filed on October 20, 1961 a complaint against the LVN
and the DPI for alleged violations of sec. 4(a) (1), (4) and (6) in relation to
sections 12 and 13 of the Industrial Peace Act, consisting of alleged acts of
discrimination, shortening of working hours and/or days, and forced dismissals.
<span style="">&nbsp;</span>In both cases the CIR decided in favor
of the respondents, holding the latter not guilty of unfair labor practices in
dismissing the employees-members of the EWA and the LPCU, and, in the latter
case filed by the LPCU, declaring that the DPI is a business establishment and
entity separate and distinct from the LVN.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The motions for re­consideration filed by the respective complainants
were denied by the CIR.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, these appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The numerous issues raised in both appeals can be <span class="SpellE">capsulized</span> lined into two main issues:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) Is the LVN guilty of funfair labor
practice in dismissing its employees who are members of the EWA and the
LPCU?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(2) Are the LVN and the DPI one
and the same corporation or entity?</p>

<p class="BODY">We resolve both issues in favor of the respondents LVN and DPI,
and affirm the CIR decisions and resolutions appealed from.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The evidence in both appealed
cases is clear that the LVN incurred losses from 1957 to 1961, reducing it to a
state of practical bankruptcy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the
respondent CIR found that as of December 31, 1957, the LVN suffered a net loss
of P364,320.32; December 31, 1958, P210,857.01; December 31, 1959, P393,644.29;
December 31, 1960, P399,085. 85; and </span><st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1961</st1:date>, P 333,714.60.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As of <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="5">May
 31, 1961</st1:date>, the total losses suffered by LVN amounted to
P1,560,985.14, whereas its paid-up capital was only P1,204,000.00 - the former
exceeding the latter by P356,785.14.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
liabilities of the LVN as of <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="5">May 31,
 1961</st1:date> <span class="SpellE">totalled</span> P1,189,946.19, while its
total assets were only P853,961.05, the total liabilities exceeding the total
assets by P335,985.14.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On top of these,
the LVN as of <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1961</st1:date>
had loans due from it in the amount of P527,960.53.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had an overdraft line of P200,000 with the
Philip­pine National Bank which served as part of its operating capital, but of
this amount it had already withdrawn and used the total sum of P199,303.45 as
of <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1961</st1:date>, leaving a
balance of only P696.55.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had also as
of the aforementioned date withdrawn and used P199,167.95 of its P200,000
overdraft line with the Commercial Bank &amp; Trust Company, leaving a balance
of only P832.05.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its yearly balance
sheets, yearly profit and loss statements, and yearly income tax returns
unquestionably proved that the LVN be­came insolvent due to heavy financial
losses suffered in good faith and in the ordinary course of business operations
from 1957 to May 31, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it was
constrained to stop its movie produc­tion business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since its operating capital of P400,000
consisting of an overdraft line in the amount of P200,000 each with the Phil­ippine
National Bank and the Commercial Bank &amp; Trust Company, was nearly
completely exhausted as of May 31, 1961, it is clear that when the LVN
completely stopped its movie production busi­ness on May 31, 1961, it was not
only insolvent but was also with­out any operating capital.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to the credit of the LVN, however, that it did not de­cide
to stop producing movies immediately.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Notwithstanding its insolvency and before it finally closed its business
on May 31, 1961, it had in good faith attempted to avail of all possible
arrange­ments with its employees to avoid the complete closure of its bu­siness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It proposed various remedial measures, e.g.,
the pay­ment of wages or salaries on the <span class="SpellE"><u>pakiao</u></span>
system per picture, and the gradual reduction of the employees’ salaries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, these proposals were flatly
rejected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To avoid total bankruptcy, the
LVN had no alternative but to close and stop its movie produc­tion
business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The employees, by their
refusal to meet the LVN halfway, in effect "killed the goose that laid the
golden eggs." It is not therefore correct to say that when the LVN
proposed the "<span class="SpellE">pakiao</span>" system and the
reduction of wages for both union and non­-union members, it was committing an
unfair labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was merely
trying, understandably and justifiably, to stave off eventual bankruptcy and
the ultimate folding-up of its movie production business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither can the LVN be accused of being
anti-labor when it gradually reduced the working hours of the checkers and finally
laid them off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The members of the LPCU
were theater­ checkers of the LVN.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
services were needed only in the exhibition of new pictures which were shown on
percentage basis, in order that the LVN might receive its lawful share in the
gross gate receipts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, since the
LVN stopped its movie production business on <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1961</st1:date>, and its second-run or old pictures, were
being exhibited on flat-rate rental basis, there was no longer any need to
employ checkers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument is advanced that the LVN refused to bargain when it
put off answering the proposals of the EWA and the LPCU pending the
stockholders’ meeting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not
agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was en­tirely reasonable for
the LVN to hold in abeyance its answers to the proposals because whether or not
it would still enter into a collective bargaining agreement with the EWA and
the LPCU would depend on the consensus that would be arrived at by the
stockhold­ers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There would be neither
rhyme nor reason for a collective bargaining agreement if the company would
decide - as it did de­cide - to stop producing moving pictures, because as the
resultant ultimate effect would be the dismissal or separation of
employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, subsequent events
proved the prudence of the action taken he the LVN.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the stockholders decided to stop movie
produc­tion as of <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1961</st1:date>,
the LVN was compelled to dismiss its employees because there was no more work
for them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had the LVN agreed to enter
into collective bargaining agreements with the two unions without awaiting the
result of the stockholders' meeting, the contracts would have become inutile
anyway because it was closing shop.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners in both cases also allege that non-union members
were employed by the LVN even after <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="5">May
 31, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not
correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The truth is that although the
LVN studio equip­ments and movie apparatus were being used in the production of
pictures, they were being used not to produce LVN pictures but were leased to
small independent producers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The several
lessees employed former workers of the LVN, but the employment of these people
depended solely upon the discretion of the different lessees, without any
participation of or interference from the LVN.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners also contend that the LVN was not "really
losing" because its assets, namely, all the 320 finished films, were
undervalued at only P320, or at P1.00 book value per picture, when they were
actually earning thousands of pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
find no merit in this argument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
determining the yearly profit or loss of a business enterprise, what is taken
into account under section 28, Chapter IV of the National Internal Revenue Code
(Act No. 466, as amended), are the "gross income computed under section
twenty-nine, less the deductions allowed by section thirty" of the said Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A perusal of the said pertinent provisions of
the Tax Code will clearly show that the book value or inventory value of assets
(such as the 320 finished films book-valued at P1.00 per picture) is immaterial
and is not considered in the preparation of the yearly profit and loss
statement which is usually attached to the yearly balance sheet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What are considered only are the incomes (not
book value of assets) and the expenses or deductions allowed in section 30 of
the Tax Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is relevant and mate­rial,
therefore, for purposes of determining the yearly profit or loss of a
corporation like the LVN is that all such incomes are duly reported.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this has been done by the LVN.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, this rate of depreciation has been observed and adhered to
strictly by the LVN since 1946, and sanctioned and al­lowed by the Bureau of
Internal Revenue which, up to now, has not found any occasion to object to the
said system of full depre­ciation after a period of 6 months from the date of
first exhibi­tion. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Indeed, under this
procedure, the LVN made and realized annual profits from 1943 to 1956,
inclusive, as aforementioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
as hereinbefore explained, it suffered losses in its mo­vie production business
from 1957 to 1961.</p>

<p class="BODY">The amount of P10,124,400, allegedly earned by these fi­nished
films from 1956 to 1961, included both the earnings from the old pictures that
were continued to be exhibited even after the period of six months, and the
incomes realized from the exhibition of all new pictures produced at an average
of 22 new pictures a year from 1956 to May 31, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the said amount of P10,124,400.00
represented practically the total gross income of the LVN in the period of five
years as reflected in the yearly ope­rating account and yearly profit and loss
statements attached to its yearly balance sheets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the petitioners' allegation that the
said amount of P10,124,400.00 represented only the earnings of the 320 finished
films book-valued at P1.00 each, is inaccurate and misleading.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court, in a number of cases, has recognized and af­firmed
the right of an employer to lay off or dismiss employees because of losses in
the operation of its business,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
lack of work,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and considerable reduction in the volume of his business.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
We have held that such acts of dismissal do not constitute unfair labor
practice.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, "an employer may close his business, provided the same is done in
good faith and is due to causes beyond his control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To rule otherwise would be oppressive and
inhuman."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent CIR found for a fact, and our own indepen­dent
study of the evidence shows, that the LVN suffered tremen­dous losses,
completely depleting its capital which was needed to operate and continue its
business of producing moving pictures.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In order to avoid immediate lay-off of employees and the closure of its
business, the LVN proposed to the EWA a change in the payment of salaries and
wages of the employees and workers from salary or wage basis to the "<span class="SpellE">pakiao</span>" system; and when this was rejected by the
union, it offered to reduce the monthly compensa­tion of all the employees
(except those receiving less than P175 a month and the daily wage earners)
regardless of their union mem­bership, but this too was rejected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order to avoid further losses and in view
of the refusal of the union to cooperate in alleviating its mounting losses,
the LVN was left with no alternative but to close its movie production as of
May 31, 1961 and to dismiss its employees.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This the LVN had the right to do, and it did so in good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not unmindful of the plight of the
emplo­yees in this case, but we consider it oppressive to compel the LVN to
continue its business of producing movies when to do so would only result in
its incurring further losses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the Termination Pay Law (R.A. 1052; sec. 1, as amended by
R.A. 1737), one of the just causes for terminating an employment without a
definite period by the employer, is the closing or cessation of operations of
the establishment or enterprise, unless the closing is for the purpose of
defeating the intention of the said law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since the LVN in good faith stopped its movie pro­duction business on <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1961</st1:date>, it could therefore
legally dis­miss its employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
before doing so, it gave them sufficient notice and an ample period within
which to look for other employ­ments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, contrary to the petitioner’s allegation, the Termination Pay
Law applies.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anent the second issue,
the CIR found that the DPI is an entity separate and distinct from the
LVN.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the CIR held in case 3013-ULP
(LVN Pictures Checkers' <st1:place>Union</st1:place> [NLU] v. LVN Pictures, et
al.) that:</p>

<blockquote>"The <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> Pictures, Inc. is a
separate and distinct entity from the LVN Pictures, Inc., hence, it cannot be
said that there was bad faith in the termination of the employees mentioned in
paragraph 5(a) of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Articles of Incorporation of the <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> Pictures,
Inc. (Annex '2' RCA) duly registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission shows that the incor­porators of the said corporation are <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span> Luna, Maria <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span>, <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Buencamino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>, Jose T.
Beltran, who are entirely different from the owners of the LVN Pictures,
namely, the De Leon family, <span class="SpellE">Villongco</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Navoa</span> family. Hence, the two corporations are distinct and
separate from each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only point
of contact between the <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> Pictures, Inc. and the
LVN Pictures, Inc. is when the former leases its movie equipment with the
latter."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">To the same tenor is the <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span> holding in case 2879-ULP (LVN Pictures Employees
&amp; Workers Association [NLU] v. LVN Pictures, Inc.) which states, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>:</p>

<blockquote>"The lessees <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> Pictures, Inc.,
<span class="SpellE">Ilang-Ilang</span> Productions, Arriba Productions, Inc.,
and Magna East Productions, are separate and distinct business establishment
and/or entities from the LVN Pictures, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These are separate and distinct corporate entities and independent from
each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They pursue their business
enterprises ac­cording to their respective incorporation papers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They produce movie pictures of their own choice
employing their own capital and separate personnel force without the
intervention and interference of the respondent LVN Pictures, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These firms leased the equipments and
production properties of the latter (LVN Pictures, Inc.) with rents properly
paid by them."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The foregoing factual findings of the CIR
are supported by subs­tantial evidence on record and therefore are
conclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule is now firmly
established that the CIR findings of fact are not to be disturbed on appeal as
long as they are supported by such ma­terial and relevant evidence as a
reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
the appeal to the Supreme Court being then confined to questions of law.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
We can not there­fore disturb the CIR findings of fact on the matter of the
separate identities of the LVN and the DPI.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have noted that in the
second case at bar (LVN Pic­tures Checkers' Union [NLU], L-26432), the CIR
awarded one-month pay to each of the workers involved therein, in addition to
holding that they should be given the first preference in the event the LVN
would operate anew.</p>

<p class="BODY">The award of one-month pay to the members of the LPCU is not
justified under the circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
it is now settled that when an employment is terminated for a just cause as
defined in section 1 of Rep. Act 1052, as amended by Rep. Act 1787, be­cause of
the losses incurred by the business, the employee whose services are terminated
or dispensed with is not entitled to sepa­ration pay.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
However, because the LVN did not appeal from the said portion of the decision
awarding a month's pay to each of the members of the LPCU, nor discussed or
called the attention of this Court to this error, we are not authorized to
consider this unassigned error.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>
