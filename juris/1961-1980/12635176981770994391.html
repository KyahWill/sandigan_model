				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by the Republic Flour Mills from the decision of the Court
of Tax Appeals (in CTA Case No. 1151) on the sole question of whether or not in
computing the manufacturer's sales tax due on the flour it manufactured and
sold in 1959, where­in wheat grains imported tax-free in 1958 were utilized,
the cost of said wheat grains is deductible.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stipulated by the parties and found by the court below, the
facts of this case are briefly as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1957, the Republic Flour Mills, Inc., a domestic corporation
engaged in the business of manufacturing flour, was granted tax - exemption
privileges as a new and necessary industry pursuant to <span style="">Republic Act 901,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> commencing on </span><st1:date year="1957" day="28" month="1"><span style="">28 </span><span style="">January
 1957</span></st1:date><span style=""> to con­tinue as
<span style="">a diminishing exemption until </span></span><st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="12"><span style="">31 December 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In 1958, the corporation imported a quantity of wheat grains,
part of which it was not able to mill and use in the business that year, so
that by 1 January 1959 the corporation carried a surplus of P1,486,616.41 worth
of wheat grains from the previous year's im­portation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These surplus grains were finally utilized
and manufactured into flour and sold in 1959.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For the year 1959, the corporation paid manufacturer's sales tax on its
produce in the sum of P37,275.55, in the computation of which the cost of the
wheat left over from the 1958 importation was treated as a deductible item from
the gross sales in 1959.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="3">28 March 1961</st1:date>,
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue <span style="">assessed
</span>the corporation of deficiency tax for 1959 <span style="">in </span>the <span style="">total sum of P23<span class="GramE">,170.17</span>. </span>The corporation requested a reinvestigation
of the assessment, <span style="">and when </span>it
was denied filed a petition for review <span style="">in
</span>the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA Case No. 1151) to contest the assessment
of advance <span style="">sales tax </span>on the
wheat grains imported tax-free in 1958 and the disallowance of the deduction of
the cost of <span style="">said wheat grains from its
gross sales of flour in </span>1959.</p>

<p class="BODY">R<span style="">espondent Commissioner
of Internal Revenue <span style="">defended and
maintained </span>the assessment, on the ground <span style="">that by </span>1959 the raw <span style="">materials
used by </span>petitioner in its tax-exempt industry were <span style="">already subject to payment of </span>10% tax
thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the hearing, the <span style="">parties entered into a Partial </span>Stipulation
of facts, the pertinent <span style="">provisions of
which </span>are the <span style="">following:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

sold <span style="">in </span>1959, is deductible from

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="12"><span style="">12 </span>December 1965</st1:date>, the
Court of Tax Appeals sustained the correctness of the disputed assessment, and
petitioner corporation was ordered to pay the sum of P24<span class="GramE">,587.98</span>
as deficiency sales tax and surcharge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence the filing by petitioner of the present appeal, on the same legal
issue litigated by the parties in the court below.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be observed from the stipulated facts quoted above that
the issue in this case has nothing to do with the enforcement or exercise of
the tax-exemption privileges granted to the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The point in controversy is only whether or
not the cost of the tax-free wheat grains used in the manufacture of flour,
which is also tax-exempt, is a deductible item for purposes of computing the
percentage tax (10%) admittedly due on the said manufactured product in 1959.</p>

<p class="BODY">Disputing the assessment of deficiency tax by the respondent
Commis­sioner of Internal Revenue, herein petitioner insists that the cost of
im­ported tax-free wheat grains is a deductible item from its gross sales of
the flour, pursuant to Section 186-A of the Internal revenue Code, which reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 186-A.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whenever a tax free product is utilized in
the manufacture or production of any article, in the determination of the value
of such finished article, the value of such tax free product shall be de­ducted.
"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Respondent Commissioner refutes this
contention, saying that, as defined by the Internal Revenue Office, the term
“tax-free product” <span style="">ment</span>ioned in
the above-quoted Section 185-A refers to raw materials purchased from
tax-exempt industries,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
whereas the wheat grains involved in the case, although used by a tax-exempt
industry, were not acquired from one enjoying tax-exemption privilege under our
laws.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the resolution of the long issue in this case, it is
worthwhile to mention that prior to <st1:date year="1957" day="22" month="6">22
 June 1957</st1:date> the prevailing rule on the matter was to allow the cost
of raw materials used in the manufacture of another article to be deducted from
gross sales, whenever such raw materials had been subjected to sales tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
as expressed by this Court, was to preclude a second assessment of the
percentage tax on the raw materials.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
This ruling finds basis in Section 186 of the Tax Code which reads:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">“Sec. 186.</span>
<span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE"><u>Percentage tax on
sales of other articles</u>.</span> -- There shall be levied, assessed and
collected once only on every original sale, barter, exchange, and similar
transaction either for nominal or valuable considerations, intended to transfer
ownership of, or title to, the articles not enumerated in sections one hundred
and eighty-four and one hundred and eighty-five a tax equivalent to seven par
centum of the gross selling price or gross value in money of the articles so
sold, bartered, exchanged or transferred, such tax to be paid by the <span style="">manufacturer or producer: <u>Provided,</u>
That <u>where the articles subject to tax under this section are manu­factured
out of materials likewise subject to tax</u> under this section and section one
hundred and eighty-nine, the total cost of such materials, as duly established,
shall be deductible from the gross selling price or gross value in money of
such manufactured articles.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With the establishment of tax-exempt industries in the mid-50s,
enforcement of the foregoing provision must have created a peculiar problem, so
much so that on 22 June 1957 the legislature enacted Republic Act 2025, which
inserted Section 186-A in the Tax Code, expressly constituting the value of
tax-free products to be a deductible item from the gross sales of the finished
goods manufactured out of the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Cast against this background, <span class="GramE">We</span> agree <span style="">with the </span>petitioner that there is
actually no cause <span style="">here calling for an </span>administrative
definition or interpretation of Section 186-A.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For no reason <span style="">exists </span>to
read into the provision a qualification<span style="">
that is not there, <span class="GramE">nor</span> to gi</span><span style="">v</span><span style="">e
to the phrase "tax-free product" a meaning other than what it
ordinarily and commonly conveys -- a material or article exempted from payment
of tax.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Commissioner himself could supply no plausible
reason for excluding tax-free imported raw materials from the coverage of the
term "tax -free" product other than the lame argument that wheat
grains are not a "product" because they are not made out of another article
(V. B.I.R. Circular No. V-252, <st1:date month="7" day="15" year="1957">15 July
 1957</st1:date>). </p>

<p class="BODY">The Commissioner's stand, upheld by the Tax Court, runs contrary
to the legal definition of the term "product" which covers
"anything that is produced, whether as the result of generation, growth,
labor or thought" (Molina vs. Rafferty, 38 Phil. 171; 50 C. J. S., pages
631-632).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, <span style="">as </span>held in the case cited, <u>fish</u> were agricultural <u>product</u>,
no reason is seen why wheat grains should not equally be products of agri­culture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, if the Commissioner's definition were
correct, it would be logical to expect that Section 186-A of the Tax Code (<u>ante</u>),
instead of referring to "<u>a tax free product</u>" utilized in the
manufacture of other articles, would have proclaimed the deductibility of the
value of "products <u><span style="">of a tax </span>exempt
industry</u> . . . <span style="">utilized in the
manufacture or production of any article ".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Further, it must not be overlooked that the exemption granted to
the petitioner covered not only the sales tax of the manufactured product but
also the sales tax "on raw materials and supplies to be used exclusively
in the manufacture of such, (exempt) products" (Brief for <span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>, page 1).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To bar the deductibility of the value of such raw materials is to tear
away the tax exemption from sales tax on said materials Indeed, if, as is
conceded, these wheat grains were allowed to enter in 1958 as exempt from
paying advance sales tax, no reason exists why the value of this same material
should be subjected to tax just because they were milled in 1959 and not in the
year of importation.</p>

<p class="BODY">That petitioner's manufactured flour would be subject in 1959 to
only a part of the normal sales tax, pursuant to Re­public Act 901, would not
alter the principles herein established.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that in the construction of tax statutes tax exemp­tions
(and deductions are of this nature) are not favored in the law, and are
construed <span class="SpellE"><u>strictissimi</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">juri<span style="">s</span></span></u><span style=""> against the taxpayer.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
However, it is equally a <span style="">recognized
principle that where the pro­vision </span>of the law is clear and unambiguous,
so <span style="">that there is no </span>occasion for
the court's seeking the legislative intent, <span style="">the law </span>must be taken as it <span style="">is, </span>devoid of <span style="">judicial
addition or subtraction.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>In this case, we find the provision
of Section 186-A -- "whenever a <u>tax free product</u> is utilized,
etc." -- all encompassing to comprehend tax-free raw materials, even if
imported.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the law provided no
qualification for the granting of the privilege, the court is not at liberty to
supply any.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, and for the foregoing considera­tions, the decision
appealed from is reversed <span style="">and </span>set
aside, <span style="">and, in accordance with the
stipulation </span>of the parties, petitioner is hereby ordered to pay <span style="">to respondent Commissioner the sum of P3<span class="GramE">,288.16</span> <span style="">as </span>deficiency
