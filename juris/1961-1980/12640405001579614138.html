<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is a petition for 
naturalization filed by Felipe <span class="SpellE">Tochip</span> before the Court 
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>. On </span><st1:date month="1" day="13" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 13, 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, a 
decision was rendered granting the petition subject to the two-year limitation 
provided for by law. The government took the present 
appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner is a citizen of the 
Republic of China. He was born in <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>, 
</span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Samar</span></span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> on </span><st1:date month="7" day="25" year="1933"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 
25, 1933</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
He is registered as an alien in the Bureau of Immigration for which he was 
issued an alien certificate of registration. He is single. He finished high 
school in the Philippine Chinese School in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and had studied up to the third 
year of mechanical engineering in the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Institute 
of Technology. Except during the period of occupation and the time he studied in 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Cebu</span></span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, petitioner has continuously 
resided since his birth in the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Municipality</span></st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Catbalogan</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner is the purchasing 
agent of Go <span class="SpellE">Bontad</span> Agency and underwriter of the 
Agricultural Surety and Insurance Company from which he derived an income of 
P3<span class="GramE">,240.00</span> in the year 1960. On said income he paid a 
tax in the amount of P33.48. He can speak and write Chinese, English and 
</span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Samar</span></span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> dialect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Cesario</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="SpellE">Singson</span>, a former Justice of the Peace of <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> declared that he 
knew petitioner since birth; that lie was the one who solemnized the marriage of 
his parents; that petitioner has conducted himself during his entire residence 
in the Philippines in an exemplary manner; and that he has all the 
qualifications and none of the disqualifications to become a Filipino 
citizen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Rafael Tan, an assistant property 
clerk of the Bureau of Public Highways, testified that he knew petitioner since 
his birth and, according to his observation, petitioner has conducted himself as 
a person of good moral character during his entire stay in the Philippines, and 
that, in ill is opinion, petitioner has all the qualifications and none of the 
disqualifications to become a Filipino citizen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The main objection set up by the 
Government, to the competency of petitioner to become a Filipino citizen is his 
failure to prove that he has a lucrative occupation to entitle him to such 
citizenship. Indeed, even if we consider that petitioner is single and has no 
family to support yet the income he has reported is insufficient as to make him 
economically qualified to be a Filipino citizen. Thus, the record shows that 
petitioner was merely a purchasing agent of Go <span class="SpellE">Bontad</span> 
Agency and an underwriter of the Agricultural Surety and Insurance Company from 
which he reported an income of P3,240.00 in the year 1960, but from his own 
testimony it become apparent that his annual salary as such agent only amounted 
to P1,800.00. In fact, this is what appears in his income tax return for 1960 
wherein his employer appeared to be one To Chip-Ford Dealer. And even assuming 
that in 1960 the income he derived from his occupation was P3,240.00, this only 
goes to show that in that year he earned that much, but in other years he earned 
a lesser amount. He may contend that occasionally he earns substantial 
commissions as underwriter of the Agricultural Surety and Insurance Company so 
much to that in 1961 his gross income from this source reached a total of 
P5<span class="GramE">,525.22</span>. But such source is so speculative or 
precarious that can hardly give him a lucrative occupation within the meaning of 
the law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It further appears that 
petitioner took up his secondary education in a Philippine Chinese School in 
Manila which argues against his sincere desire to embrace the customs and 
traditions of the Filipino citizen or against what our law requires that he 
should mingle socially with the Filipinos, for he could have taken up his 
initial education in a school owned or run by Filipino citizens. Philippine 
citizenship is a privilege that should not easily be given away. It should be 
accorded only to one who evinces a true and sincere desire to embrace such 
citizenship. Petitioner falls short of this requirement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision of the court 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">a quo</span></em> is hereby reversed.
