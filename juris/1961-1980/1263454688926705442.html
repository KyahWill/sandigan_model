				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The case before us is an incident in a suit for a sum of money
(Civil Case Q-2618, Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Branch), entitled "Ramon R. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, Plaintiff, vs. Lorenzo J. Valdes, <span class="SpellE">Valleson</span>, Inc., and <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> J.
Valdes, Defendant." Judgment was, on December 2, 1960, there rendered
directing defendants <span class="SpellE">Valleson</span>, Inc. and <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> J. Valdes (Lorenzo J. Valdes excluded) "to pay
jointly and severally to the plaintiff the amount of P6,260.00 with interest at
the rate of 12% per annum from September 1, 1954 until fully paid and to pay attorney's
fees in the amount of P600. <span class="GramE">00 with costs."</span> The
counterclaim of defendants Lorenzo J. Valdes and <span class="SpellE">Valleson</span>,
Inc. was dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="1">January 11, 1961</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Valleson</span>, Inc. filed its notice of appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its appeal was perfected on <st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="2">February 11, 1961</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1961" day="10" month="1">January
 10, 1961</st1:date>, one day before <span class="SpellE">Valleson's</span>
notice of appeal, plaintiff petitioned for and the trial court directed the
issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment against the properties, real and
personal, of defendants <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> J. Valdes and <span class="SpellE">Valleson</span>, Inc. upon an P11<span class="GramE">,730</span>-bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 11, said bond having been filed,
the corresponding writ was issued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pursuant thereto, garnishment notices were served by the Manila Sheriff
on one <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> and
the Philippine Guaranty Co.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1961</st1:date>,
the judgment debtors moved to dissolve the writ of attachment, upon P11<span class="GramE">,730</span>-counter-bond subscribed by the Capital Insurance &amp;
Surety Co., Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following day, <st1:date year="1961" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1961</st1:date>, the trial court
dissolved the writ.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1961</st1:date>,
plaintiff registered a motion to admit its "Claim for Damages"
attached thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff's claim was
that the dissolution of the attachment "put out of the reach of the
plaintiff the properties and assets which may be held to answer for the
adjudged claim"; and that, by reason thereof, "plaintiff suffered and
will suffer damages in the amount of P11,730.00 plus the corresponding 12%
interest thereon and attorney's fees and costs." He then prayed that
"defendants and the Capital Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc. be ordered to
pay the plaintiff, jointly and severally, the amount of P11,730.00 plus
interests, expenses, and attorney's fees."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1961</st1:date>,
the surety, Capital Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc., opposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assertion was made that pursuant to the Rules
of Court (then, Section 17, Rule 59; now Section 17, Rule 57), the surety on
any counter-bond shall only become charged and bound to pay plaintiff upon
demand, the amount due under the judgment; and that such amount may be
recovered from the surety after notice and summary hearing in the same action -
only if execution be returned unsatisfied in whole or in part.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1961</st1:date>,
at the hearing fixed by the court, plaintiff presented evidence on the merits
of its claim for damages, in the absence of defendants and surety, who made no
appearance thereat.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, in its order of <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1961</st1:date>, ruled that plaintiff's claim for <span class="GramE">damages was</span> premature, since the main case was then still
pending appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration, filed on <st1:date year="1961" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1961</st1:date>, was thwarted by the
court below on <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1961</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the environmental facts, can plaintiff's claim for damages
on defendants' counter-bond prosper?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
answer must be in the negative.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. By the terms of the counter-bond itself,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
liability <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> attaches only "<u>in</u> <u>case</u>
the <span class="GramE">plaintiff recover</span> judgment in the action."
Indeed, by Section 12 of Rule 59 of the old Rules,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the law in force at the time the counter-bond was executed, the statutory
counter-bond was made "to secure the payment to the plaintiff of any
judgment he may recover in the action." Complementary to this legal
precept is Section 17 of the same Rule 59 of the old Rules<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> -
which should be deemed as read into the bond - <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 17.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>When</u> <u>execution</u> <u>returned</u> <u>unsatisfied</u>,
<u>recovery</u> <u>had</u> <u>upon</u> <u>bond</u>. - If the execution be
returned unsatisfied in whole or in part, the surety or sureties on any bond
given pursuant to the provisions of this rule to secure the payment of the
judgment shall become finally charged on such bond, and bound to pay to the
plaintiff upon demand the amount due under the judgment, which amount may be
recovered from such surety or sureties after notice and summary hearing in the
same action."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since at the time the claim for damages was registered, the case was
still pending appeal, it is quite obvious that the motion for the claim for
damages was premature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the lower
court thus correctly ruled out plaintiff's motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, Section 17 contemplates of proceedings
on execution after judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, it is
only thereafter that liability upon the surety's bond may be determined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The key term in Section 17 is the phrase
"[<span class="SpellE">i</span>]f the execution be returned unsatisfied in
whole or in part." Until such proceeding shall have taken place and unless
unsatis­fied liability under the judgment still exists, no action upon the
counter-bond may be taken against the surety.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2. We do not follow plaintiff when he says that what controls here
is Section 20 of Rule 57 (then Rule 59).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By its very terms,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
this obviously refers to the recovery of damages by a party <u>against</u> <u>whom</u>
attachment was issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a remedy
available to the defendants here, not the plaintiff.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is therefore not to be doubted that, upon the applicable
rules, the counter-bond does not answer for damages on account of the lifting
of the attachment, but for the payment of the amount due under the judgment
that may be recovered by an attaching creditor.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3. Nor is importance to be attached to plaintiff's argument that
the dissolution of the attachment put out of his <span class="GramE">reach</span>
the properties and assets answerable for his claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The counter-bond, it should be emphasized,
precisely stands "in place of the properties so released."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, the release of such property cannot really "prejudice the rights of
the attaching party."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We accordingly affirm the lower court's order of <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1961</st1:date> under review.</p>
