				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Once more Courts are asked to arbitrate between rights and duties
of parents and children, and between parent and foster parent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's claim for custody of a minor boy, Joseph <span class="SpellE">Casero</span>, was sought to be enforced by <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>
proceedings in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>,
in its Special Proceeding No. 1947.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After hearing, the writ was denied by the Court, and the case was
appealed directly to this Supreme Court exclusively on points of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Uncontested facts found by the Court below are that on <st1:date year="1961" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1961</st1:date>, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> Medina gave birth to a baby boy named Joseph <span class="SpellE">Casero</span> in the <span class="SpellE">Makabali</span> Clinic in <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, owned
and operated by respondent <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <span class="SpellE">Venancia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Makabali</span>, single, who assisted at the delivery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The boy was <span class="SpellE">Zenaides</span>
third, had with a married man, Feliciano <span class="SpellE">Casero</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The mother left the child with <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <span class="SpellE">Makabali</span> from his birth.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter took care and reared Joseph as her own son; had him treated
at her expense for poliomyelitis by <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. Fe del <span class="SpellE">Mundo</span>, in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
until he recovered his health; and sent him to school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From birth until August 1966, the real mother
never visited her child, and never paid for his expenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial disclosed that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
Medina lived, with Feliciano <span class="SpellE">Casero</span> with her two
other children apparently with the tolerance, if not the acquiescence, of <span class="SpellE">Casero's</span> lawful wife who resides elsewhere, albeit the
offspring of both women are in good terms with each other; that <span class="SpellE">Casero</span> makes about P400.00 a month as a mechanic, and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> herself earns from 4 to 5 pesos a day.</p>

<blockquote>"The Court, upon calling Joseph on the witness stand, observed
that the boy is fairly intelligent as a witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He never knew his mother, Zenaida.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was calling the respondent his 'Mammy'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court informed him that his real mother
is <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was asked with whom to stay - with his real mother or the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The boy pointed to the respondent and said
'Mammy.’ The Court asked him, 'Why do you choose to stay with your
"Mammy?"' He answered, 'She is the one rearing me.' This
confrontation was made in the presence of the two women, <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>,
the petitioner, and the respondent, <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <span class="SpellE">Makabali</span>, in open court." (C.F.I. <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 39).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After extracting from <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <span class="SpellE">Makabali</span> a promise to allow the minor a free choice with
whom to live when he reaches the age of 14, the Court held that it was for the
child's best interest to be left with his foster mother, and denied the writ
prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The real mother appealed, as
already stated.</p>

<p class="BODY">We see no reason to disturb the order appealed from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While our law recognizes the right of a
parent to the custody of her child, Courts must not lose sight of the basic principle
that "in all questions of the care, custody, education and property of
children, the latter's welfare shall be paramount" (Civil Code of the
Philippines, Art. 363), and that for compelling reasons, even a child under
seven may be ordered separated from the mother (Do.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is as it should be, for in the continual
evolution of legal institutions, the <u>patria</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>protestas</u></span>
has been transformed from the <u>jus</u> <u>vitae</u> <u>ac</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>necis</u></span> (right of life and death) of the Roman law,
under which the offspring was virtually a chattel of his parents, into a
radically different institution, due to the influence of Christian faith and
doctrines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">obligational</span>
aspect is now supreme.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out by
<span class="SpellE">Puig</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>, now "there
is no power, but a task; no complex of rights (of parents) but a sum of duties;
no sovereignty, but a sacred trust for the welfare of the minor."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As a result, the right of parents to the company and custody of
their children is but ancillary to the proper discharge of parental duties to
provide the children with adequate support, education, moral, intellectual and
civic training and development (Civil Code, Art. 356).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As remarked by the Court below, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> Medina proved remiss in these sacred duties; she
not only failed to provide the child with love and care but actually deserted
him, with not even a visit, in his <span class="SpellE">tenderest</span> years,
when he needed his mother the most.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may
well be doubted what advantage the child could derive from being coerced to
abandon respondent's care and love to be compelled to stay with his mother and
witness her irregular <span class="SpellE"><u>menage</u></span> <u>a</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>trois</u></span> with <span class="SpellE">Casero</span> and the
latter's legitimate wife.</p>

<p class="BODY">it is hinted that respondent's motivation in refusing to
surrender the boy is to coerce petitioner to pay for the rearing of the
child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not acceptable, for <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <span class="SpellE">Makabali</span> knew (at least at
the trial) that any expectation on her part is illusory, given <span class="SpellE">Zenaida's</span> meager resources, yet expressed willingness to
care and educate him.</p>

<p class="BODY">No abuse of discretion being shown, but on the contrary, the
appealed order being justified in fact and law, we hold that said order should
be, and hereby is,</p>
