Antonio Cotas, rendered its decision, finding appellant guilty of the crime of parricide, sentencing him to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P12,000.&nbsp; From this decision, appeal was interposed to this Court.<br><br>In his brief, appellant assigned the following errors, to wit:&nbsp; that –<br><blockquote>"I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower court erred in the appreciation and application of the rule on conspiracy, circumstantial evidence and procedure;<br><br>"II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower court erred in considering the testimony of the prosecution witness Ernesto Manalo as retraction and sentenced him to suffer thirty (30) days imprisonment for contempt; and<br><br>"III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower court erred in convicting the accused based on circumstantial evidence."<br></blockquote>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In support of his first assigned error, appellant argued that the information alleged confederation and conspiracy between him and his co-accused Antonio Cotas, in the commission of the crime charged, patently, due to the impossibility under the circumstances prevailing, for one man alone to commit the crime; that when the alleged co-conspirator was acquitted, the allegation of conspiracy necessarily failed, for the simple reason that there could be no conspiracy unless at least two are united in a criminal design<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup>; that consequently appellant must also be acquitted.<br><br>The first assigned error that because conspiracy between appellant and his co-accused Cotas was alleged, the acquittal of his co-accused Cotas must necessarily result in the acquittal of the appellant cannot be seriously defended.&nbsp; It is to be noted that the two accused were not charged with conspiracy as a distinct and separate offense.&nbsp; Conspiracy was alleged in the information as one of the means in the commission of parricide.&nbsp; Evidence of conspiracy in the commission of the offense may be wanting, but, from that it does not necessarily follow that there cannot be sufficient evidence regarding the commission of the crime charged.<br><br>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellant's second assignment of error was that the court erred in considering the testimony of prosecution witness Ernesto Manalo as retraction and in sentencing him to suffer 30 days imprisonment for contempt.&nbsp; We do not think that the trial court committed an error in finding Ernesto Manalo guilty of direct contempt, for he gave false testimony while acting as a witness, and his misbehavior was committed in the presence of or so near the judge or court, as to obstruct the proper administration of justice.&nbsp; The punishment meted against Ernesto Manalo of imprisonment for 30 days was, however, excessive for according to Section 1 of Rule 71 of the Rules of Court, direct contempt is punishable by fine not exceeding two hundred pesos or imprisonment not exceeding ten (10) days, or both, if it be committed against a superior court or judge thereof; or by fine not exceeding ten pesos or imprisonment not exceeding one (1) day, or both, if committed against an inferior court.<br><br>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellant complained in his third assignment of error that the trial court convicted him on the basis of circumstantial evidence and argued that the court erred in saying that the evidence for defense consisted merely of the denial of the accused; that the accused's theory of suicide was flimsy for the suicidal letters Exhs. 10, 11, and 12 were not theories but facts; that the three attempts of the deceased to commit suicide as borne by the evidence and admitted by the mother of the deceased, Asuncion Dayco Ymson, were neither mere theories but facts; that the appellant was made to answer for the crime by the mother-in-law because of her demonstrated loathe against him and her fear that she would not receive the proceeds of the insurance policy if the deceased committed suicide; and that there are many missing links in the circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecution.<br><br>Appellee contended that appellant's guilt of the crime charged had been sufficiently and satisfactorily established by the prosecution witnesses, as evidenced by the trial court's decision.<br><br>We believe that, candidly considering all the evidence presented by both the prosecution and the defense, appellant's guilt has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Our conclusion is based on the following reasons:<br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, some facts and circumstances of weight and influence have been overlooked by the trial court; their significance has been misinterpreted; and the prosecution's evidence suffered from an inherent fatal weakness.&nbsp; We have noticed in the transcript of stenographic notes that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses as to the vital incidents that constituted, according to the trial court, the chain of circumstantial evidence pointing to the accused as the perpetrator of the crime charged, are so surprisingly harmonious and fitting with one another, such that not even the slightest inconsistency can be detected in them.&nbsp; Such perfect dovetailing of the witnesses' testimonies cannot but generate a suspicion that the various material circumstances the prosecution witnesses testified to were integral parts and parcels of a well thought of and prefabricated story.&nbsp; The prosecution witnesses appear to have been willing pupils diligently instructed on how to make their several testimonies fit in with each other.&nbsp; In other words, the testimonies have the earmarks of a manufactured story which clearly appear upon scrutiny of the facts which the court held to have been proven by the prosecution.&nbsp; We quote hereunder the very words of the trial court, but with such insertions from the transcript and context that show how perfectly they fit each other, to wit:<br><br>"The accused and the victim had not been living harmoniously as husband and wife having quarreled on several occasions and even leading to separation and filing of a criminal case against the accused; x x x On November 4, 1965, at about 9:00 o'clock in the evening," (as testified to by Loida Buenaventura) "the accused and the victim quarreled and the latter threatened the former that she will go home to her mother's house but the accused dared her not to go saying '<i>huwag kang maka-alis-alis'</i> with threats that should she go, something would happen.&nbsp; Between 1:00 and 2:00 (o'clock) in the early morning of November 5, 1965 the victim was seen (by Loida Buenaventura) "coming out of their gate going to the street and followed by the accused a minute later." (It so happened at that very moment) that "witness Crisanto D. Gonzales" (who was then going home from a gambling den which he left at about 1:00 a.m. of November 5, 1965) "saw the victim walking towards the direction of her mother's house but the accused caught up with her.&nbsp; The accused pulled the victim's hair and twisted her hand and forced her to go back to their house.&nbsp; Upon reaching home, the accused pushed the victim against the door causing the victim to fall in a prone position (<span style="font-style: italic;">pasubsub</span>).&nbsp; The quarrel continued and a loud sound (<span style="font-style: italic;">kalabog</span>) was heard followed by the moaning of the victim.&nbsp; [This "kalabog" or loud sound was also heard by Damaso Cruz on his way home from the gambling place which he left between 1:00 and 1:15 a.m., November 5, 1965] [Between 1:00 to 2:00 o'clock a.m., the following day as testified to by Loida Buenaventura] "the accused was seen coming out of their house with the victim on his shoulder but went back inside the house upon noticing Loida Buenaventura still awake and was in her house.&nbsp; On the same early morning, witness Damaso Cruz [who, as said earlier left the gambling place between 1:00 and 1:15 o'clock a.m. of November 5, 1965, providentially and luckily had stomach ache, entered the premises of Peping Garcia, and went near the river to move his bowels] "saw the accused and another unidentified man carrying in-between them an apparently unconscious woman.&nbsp; He categorically identified the accused as one of the men referred to.&nbsp; He recognized the accused as they knew each other very well having lived together in the same locality and considering that there was an electric light at the time." [The other prosecution witness, Ernesto Manalo, providentially and coincidentally also went at about 1:35 o'clock a.m. of November 5, 1965 to the Pateros River to move his bowels and there saw two men carrying the deceased Dolores.] [At about dawn of November 5, 1965] "witness Loida Buenaventura, [who did not throw garbage on November 4, 1965 (TSN, January 16, 1967, p. 82)] while disposing of some human waste into the river, saw the accused near the bank with a flashlight focused at the bank.&nbsp; Bothered perhaps by his conscience and to be sure that the witness did not see him, the accused asked the witness [Loida Buenaventura] whether she noticed something at about 3:00 a.m. x x x"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> After having read the above should we not at this juncture take stock that while circumstances cannot lie, they can be feigned, invented, distorted, half-stated, misapplied, mistaken or lied about with most infernal skill?<br><br>The times and occasions when the various prosecution witnesses entered the chain of events also surprisingly fitted one another.&nbsp; Loida Buenaventura admitted that she did not have a clock or even a wrist watch in her house<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup>; that she could not exactly calculate one hour<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup>; yet her guess as to the time when the quarrel of the spouse began, even her guess regarding the length of time she slept, her guess of the time Dolores went out to the street followed by the appellant, her guess of the time she heard the "<i>kalabog</i>" or loud sound, her guess as to the time that she allegedly saw the accused coming out of the house with the victim on his shoulder, so perfectly dovetailed with the witness Crisanto D. Gonzales' leaving the gambling den and reaching the appellant's house, and, with Damaso Cruz's leaving the gambling den and moving his bowels when he allegedly saw two men carying the victim.&nbsp; The time pieces used by Crisanto and Damaso must have been perfectly synchronized with Loida's guesses.&nbsp; In this connection, it is enlightening to recall that "where a witness undertakes to swear positively from mere memory to the fraction of hours or to minutes, we may well distrust his testimony and doubt his sincerity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup><br><br>We also note that the prosecution witnesses had tenacious memories not only as to time, but also as to vital incidents constituting the chain of circumstantial evidence relied upon by the trial court, but were extraordinarily forgetful of, or inattentive to, incidental matters.&nbsp; This begets suspicion of veracity<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup>.&nbsp; Thus the record shows that even if Loida Buenaventura claimed to have seen the appellant at least six times from 9:00 o'clock p.m. of November 4 to dawn of November 5, she could not remember what the appellant was wearing<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup>; she did not notice the color his pants and dress<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup>; she did not notice whether he was wearing pajamas or undershirt<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> or whether he had any footwear or not<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup>.&nbsp; Loida likewise saw the deceased that night four times, but she was completely unobservant and/or forgetful of what Dolores was wearing.&nbsp; She testified that she did not notice what Dolores was wearing<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup>; that she did not know the color of her dress<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup>; and that she did not notice whether she had any footwear[161.]&nbsp; Loida did not even relate what she saw to her husband who arrived at 4:00 o'clock a.m. of November 5, 1965.<br><br>The timing of Crisanto B.

Lasal and a Fiscal, that he was told that even if he did not know anything about the incident, he should make a statement or testify, and that he should tell what he was - taught to tell<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[187]</sup>.&nbsp; He also testified, upon the court's questioning, that he declared only that which he was taught to testify.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[188]</sup> He furthermore testified in open court that Mr. Young paid all of the witnesses, Crisanto Gonzales, Damaso Cruz and Loida Buenaventura<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[189]</sup>; that Loida Buenaventura was given money weekly by Mr. Young; that Crisanto Gonzales was paid P700.00; and that Damaso Cruz was paid P2,000.00, and that he was present when the money was given to the witnesses<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[190]</sup>.&nbsp; Were these big amounts paid to the prosecution witnesses to make them testify to the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?&nbsp; That the witnesses were paid was corroborated by Perpetuo Garcia who testified that Loida Buenaventura told him in December 1965 that she would testify against the appellant and that for doing so she would be paid by a Chinaman who was the husband of a cousin of the deceased Dolores Alviar<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[191]</sup>.&nbsp; Even Loida Buenaventura herself corroborated it when she admitted that on several occasions she rode in the car of Mrs. Young.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[192]</sup> Prosecution witness Ernesto Manalo also testified that he was taught what to testify.&nbsp; Were not those big sums of money given also for that purpose, that said witnesses should testify what they were taught to?&nbsp; If not, how can the incredible dovetailing of the prosecution witnesses testimonies be explained?&nbsp; Noteworthy is the fact that the prosecution did not even make an attempt to rebut such payments to the witnesses.<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, there is another fatal infirmity in the prosecution's evidence.&nbsp; The facts considered by the trial court as having proved appellant's guilt do not show that it was impossible that the deceased might have died because of accident or because she committed suicide.<br><br>From the results of the autopsy as testified to by Dr. Ibarrola, the deceased died from asphyxia caused by drowning.&nbsp; The results of the autopsy would not vary, according to Dr. Ibarrola, whether the deceased committed suicide, or she was drowned by another, and it may be added even if her death was due to an accident.&nbsp; Anent this matter it has been said that in case of grown­-ups, medical evidence will not be able to tell whether a death which occurred by drowning was due to accident, suicide, or homicide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[193]</sup><br><br>There is likewise no proof of the motive that might have impelled the appellant to commit the alleged parricide.&nbsp; Generally, proof of motive is not necessary to pin a crime on the accused if the commission of the crime has been proven and the evidence of identification is convincing; however, where the proof of identification is not convincing, the proof of motive is necessary<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[194]</sup>.<br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth appellant's theory and defense that the deceased committed suicide cannot be brushed aside, as the trial court did, as flimsy and improbable, for first, according to the results of the autopsy, there were no indications of foul play in the deceased's body there being no wounds and no injuries in the whole skeletal framework, and no ante mortem contusions or abrasions; and second, there are important facts and circumstances that tend to prove that the deceased's death might have been suicidal, namely:&nbsp; the presence of motivational factors, the suicidal notes, and the suicidal attempts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[195]</sup><br><br>Disappointment in love as well as loss of money, mental depression and psychopathic tendencies, among others, may be sufficient motives for suicide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[196]</sup> It is undisputed, as testified to not only by the appellant but also by prosecution witness Loida Buenaventura<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[197]</sup>, that the deceased Dolores was a very jealous wife.&nbsp; In fact the quarrel on that fateful night of November 4 was caused by jealousy, about an umbrella and notebook which Dolores claimed she left in their house<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[198]</sup>, and not being able to locate them, Dolores said that the umbrella and notebook might be with Jose's girl<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[199]</sup> and Dolores accused Jose of living with another girl<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[200]</sup>.<br><br>There are also suicidal notes and suicidal attempts.&nbsp; It should be noted at the outset that the methods of communicating suicidal ideas vary.&nbsp; There may be direct statement of an intent to commit suicide or a wish to die, or mere vague statements showing preoccupation with death, suicide, and methods of suicide.&nbsp; Any expression of defeat, despair, hopelessness, or a wish to disappear should serve as a warning of a suicidal risk.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[201]</sup> Generally, a suicide note does not contain specific details of the suicidal act.&nbsp; The suicide seems more intent on other things such as provisions for the family and loved ones, instructions, requests and the like.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[202]</sup><br><br>Now to the suicidal notes and attempts.&nbsp; The first suicidal note on the record is Exhibit "10", a letter written on May 22, 1964 by the deceased to her husband, Jose, which reads in part as follows:<br><blockquote>"Dear Peping,<br><br>As a wife it is my duty to give you happiness although it calls for life taking.&nbsp; I never deem that x x x you have another woman whom you can never part with.&nbsp; You valued her at the expense of my love for you.&nbsp; I know before hand that I'm really worthless to you, but I tried to gamble my love for you with the hope that I can make you love me for the sake of the children.&nbsp; But that I have experienced only false forced love.&nbsp; So my hope is in vain.<br><br>Peping, from this time you are free x x x I know that you are tired seeing me, but only wait until I have enrolled Boy and see them go to school for a week.&nbsp;

These are various nuances of communicating suicidal ideas.&nbsp; What Dolores meant by "life taking", "not seeing her in town" in that letter of May 22, 1964 became clear in July 1964<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[203]</sup>, when she attempted to commit suicide by going down the river beside the apartment where they were residing but was unable to consummate the suicide for her husband caught up with her.&nbsp; This attempt was testified to by the accused<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[204]</sup> and corroborated by Dolores' mother<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[205]</sup>.<br><br>The second suicidal note was another letter dated August 27, 1964 (Exhibit "11") which reads in part thus:<br><blockquote>"Dear Peping,<br><br>With my departure, I have come to know that you are ashamed of me in public, … I'd like to help you give an ease to your situation.&nbsp; I don't like to be a hindrance to your happiness.&nbsp; In case you are really with another woman, who will really make you happy, just tell me the truth and you will not hear anything from me.&nbsp; I have sacrifice twelve years away from you and I think I can manage to carry and risk it yet.&nbsp; For if we shall stay together and your feeling is with another woman or your heart belongs to another, our life will only be in grief …<br><br>P.S.<br><br>Although it is painful to part with you ...

How tragic jealousy can be?&nbsp; She drank iodine, but was saved by the timely intervention of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[207]</sup> This incident was corroborated by the deceased's mother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[208]</sup><br><br>If Dolores tried to commit suicide in those three instances because of jealousy, was it not then probable that she also could have tried to commit, and succeeded in committing it also because of jealousy, on November 5, 1965?&nbsp; Anent this matter it has been said that a decedent had made one or more previous suicidal attempts is often relied by courts to sustain a verdict of suicide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[209]</sup><br><br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, We do not agree with the trial court's reason in disbelieving appellant's testimony and defense.&nbsp; One of those reasons was that appellant's acts after his wife was gone were unnatural and indicative of a bothered conscience.&nbsp; The trial court's conclusion would be plausible if it is assumed that appellant was guilty.&nbsp; But that was the <i>factum probandum,</i> and it could not and should not be assumed.&nbsp; Appellants's acts in fact could very well be consistent with his innocence.&nbsp; Assuming that he was innocent, and assuming that it was true that at dawn of November 5, 1965 he was at the river bank with a flashlight focussed at the river, it cannot be said unnatural for a husband to look for his wife who slipped away at 3:00 o'clock a.m. and who might have again gone to the river to commit suicide as she had done before.&nbsp; The trial court also considered strange the appellant's asking Loida if the latter noticed something at about 3:00.a.m.&nbsp; Assuming that to be true, was it not compatible with accused's innocence to look for his wife, to ask others, especially the neighbors, if the latter had seen her, she having slipped away at 3:00 o'clock?&nbsp; Is it strange for a husband to ask a neighbor such question?&nbsp; That the accused was seen sneaking into the house of his mother-in-law two days later could again be compatible with the accused's innocence.&nbsp; His wife was missing.&nbsp; He did not know where she was and he was looking for her.&nbsp; Was it strange then that appellant might have thought that she went home to her mother and might be hiding there?&nbsp; If this was not strange, why should it be strange that the appellant looked for her in that house?<br><br>Furthermore, the trial court could not believe that Dolores committed suicide because Dolores, according to the appellant, woke up appellant at 2:00 o'clock a.m.&nbsp; The trial court said that "if it is true as claimed by the accused and as the defense would have this Court to believe that the deceased committed suicide, the deceased would not have warned him, much more wake him up and ask for his permission to go downstairs for a while if her purpose then was really to give end to her life." It is to be noted that according to the record, at about 2:00 o'clock a.m. of November 5, 1965, Dolores told appellant that she would go down for personal reasons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[210]</sup> Dolores did not warn the accused that she would commit suicide – she said that she was going down for personal reasons.&nbsp; And even if the "personal reasons" meant "to commit suicide," still We find no improbability in a would be suicide to tell another her intention, perhaps in order to arouse the husband's sympathy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[211]</sup><br><br>The trial court believed that the deceased was a victim of foul play.&nbsp; This opinion is not in accordance with the findings of the National Bureau of Investigation's medico-legal officer Dr. Ibarrola who found no injury in the whole skeletal framework including the skull, and no signs of ante mortem contusions and abrasions.<br><br>Another reason advanced by the trial court for not believing that the deceased committed suicide was that she knew how to swim.&nbsp; But Dr. Ibarrola, when asked whether a person who knows how to swim may drown, categorically answered that such a person can also kill himself by drowning, that even if a person knows how to swim, the tendency of the body is to go down the water.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, We conclude that the prosecution's evidence has not proved beyond reasonable doubt appellant's guilt of the crime charged.&nbsp; The decision, therefore, of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, dated October 8, 1969, in its Criminal Case No. 15358 is set aside, and the appellant is hereby acquitted of the crime charged.&nbsp; The bond filed for the provisional liberty of appellant is ordered cancelled.&nbsp; <i>Costs
