surviving partners of Atty. Alexander <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>, who died
on May 5, 1975, and 2) by the surviving partners of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ozaeta</span>, who died on February 14, 1976, praying that
they be allowed to continue <span style="">using, in
the </span>names <span style="">of </span>their firms,
the names <span style="">of partners who had passed
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the Court's Resolution of </span><st1:date year="1976" day="2" month="9"><span style="">September
 2, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">, both
Petitions were ordered consolidated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners base their petitions on the following arguments:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. Under the law, a partnership is not prohibited from continuing
its business under a firm name which includes the name of a deceased partner;
in fact, Article 1840 of the Civil Code explicitly sanctions the practice when
it provides in the last paragraph that:</p>

<blockquote>"The use by the person or partnership continuing the business
of the partnership name, or <u>the name of a deceased partner as part thereof,</u>
shall not of itself make the individual property of the deceased partner liable
for any debts contracted by such person or partnership."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">2. In regulating other professions, such as accountancy and
engineering, the legislature has authorized the adoption of firm names without
any res­triction as to the use, in such firm name, of the name of a deceased
partner;<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>the legislative authorization given
to those engaged in the practice of accountancy - a profession requiring the
same degree of trust and confidence in respect of clients as that implicit in
the relationship of attorney and client - to acquire and use a trade name,
strongly indicates that there is no fundamental policy that is offended by the
continued use by a firm of professionals of a firm name which includes the name
of a deceased partner, at least where such firm name has acquired the
characteristics of a "trade name."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3. The Canons of Professional Ethics are not transgressed by the
continued use of the name of a deceased partner in the firm name of a law
partnership because Canon 33 of the Canons of Professional Ethics adopted by
the American Bar Association declares that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>The continued use of the name of a deceased
or former partner when permissible by local custom, is not unethical, but care
should be taken that no imposition or deception is practiced through <span style="">this use.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>”</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">4. There is no possibility of imposition or deception because the
deaths of their respective deceased partners were well-publicized in all
newspapers of general circulation for several days; the stationeries now being
used by them carry new letterheads indicating the years when their respective
deceased partners were connected with the firm; petitioners will notify all
leading national and international law directories of the fact of their
respective deceased partners' deaths.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">5. No local custom prohibits the continued use of a deceased
partner's name in a professional firm's name;<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
there is no custom or usage in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
or at least in the Greater Manila Area, which recognizes that the name of a law
firm necessarily identifies the individual members of the firm.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">6. The continued use of a deceased partner's name in the firm name
of law partnerships has been consistently allowed by U.S. Courts and is an
accepted practice in the legal profession of most countries in the world.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The question involved in these Petitions first came under
consideration by this Court in 1953 when a law <span style="">firm </span><span style="">in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> (the <span class="SpellE">Deen</span> case) continued
its practice of including in its firm name that of a deceased partner, C.D.
Johnston.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matter was resolved with
this Court advising the firm to desist from including in their firm designation
the name of C. D. Johnston, "who has long been dead."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The same issue was raised before this Court in 1958 as an
incident in G.R. No. L-11964, entitled Register of Deeds of Manila vs. China
Banking Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law firm of
Perkins &amp; Ponce <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span> moved to intervene as <u>amicus</u>
<u>curiae.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before acting thereon,
the Court, in a Resolution of <st1:date year="1957" day="15" month="4">April
 15, 1957</st1:date>, stated that it "would like to be informed why the
name of Perkins is still being used although Atty. E. A. Perkins is already
dead".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a Manifestation dated May
21, 1957, the law firm of Perkins and Ponce <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>, <u>raising
substantially the same arguments</u> as those now being raised by peti­tioners,
prayed that the continued use of the firm name "Perkins &amp; Ponce <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>" be held proper.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1958" day="16" month="6"><span style="">June 16,
 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, this Court
resolved:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"After carefully considering the reasons given by Attorneys
Alfonso Ponce <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span> and Associates for their
continued use of the name of the deceased E. G. Perkins, the Court found no
reason to depart from the policy it adopted in June 1953 when it required
Attorneys Alfred P. <span class="SpellE">Deen</span> and Eddy A. <span class="SpellE">Deen</span> of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City to desist from
including in their firm designation, the name of C. D. Johnston, deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court believes that, in view of the
personal and confidential nature of the relations between attorney and client,
and the high standards demanded in the canons of professional ethics, no
practice should be allowed which even in a remote degree could give rise to the
possibility of deception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said attorneys
are accordingly advised to drop the name "PERKINS" from their firm
name."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners herein now seek a re-examination of the policy thus
far enunciated by the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds no sufficient reason to depart from the rulings
thus laid down.</p>

<p class="NUM">A. Inasmuch as "<span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>, Salazar,
Feliciano, Hernandez and Castillo" and "<span class="SpellE">Ozaeta</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>, De Leon, <span class="SpellE">Mabanta</span>
and Reyes" are partnerships, the use in their partnership names of the
names of deceased partners will run counter to Article 1815 of the Civil Code
which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1815.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every
partnership shall operate under a firm name, which may or may not include the
name of one or more of the partners.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Those who, not being members of the partnership, include
their names in the firm name, shall be subject to the liability of a
partner."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clearly tacit in the above provision that names in a firm
name of a partnership must either be those of living partners and, in the case
of non-partners, should be living persons who can be subjected to
liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, Article 1825 of the
Civil Code prohibits a third person from including his name in the firm name
under pain of assuming the liability of a partner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The heirs of a deceased partner in a law firm
cannot be held liable as the old members to the creditors of a firm
particularly where they are non-lawyers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, Canon 34 of the Canons of Professional Ethics "prohibits an
agreement for the payment to the widow and heirs of a deceased lawyer of a
percentage, either gross or net, of the fees received from the future business
of the deceased lawyer's clients, both because the recipients of such division
are not lawyers and because such payments will not represent service or
responsibility on the part of the recipient." Accordingly, neither the
widow nor the heirs can be held liable for transactions entered into after the
death of their lawyer-predecessor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
being no benefits accruing, there can be no corresponding liability.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Prescinding</span> the law, there could be
practical objections to allowing the use by law firms of the names of deceased
partners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The public relations <span style="">value of the use of an old firm name can tend
to create undue advantages and disadvantages in the practice of the
profession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An able lawyer without
connections will have to make a name for himself starting from scratch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another able lawyer, who can join an old
firm, can initially ride on that old firm's reputation established by deceased
partners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">B. In regards to the last paragraph of Article 1840 of the Civil
Code cited by petitioners, <u>supra</u>, the first factor to consider is that
it is within Chapter 3 of Title IX of the Code entitled "Dissolution and
Winding Up." The Article primarily deals with the exemption from liability
in cases of a dissolved partnership, of the individual property of the deceased
partner for debts contracted by the person or partnership which continues the <u>business</u>
using the partnership name or the name of the deceased partner as part
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the law contemplates
therein is a hold-over situation preparatory to formal re­organization.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, Article 1840 treats more of a <u>commercial</u>
partnership with a good will to protect rather than of a <u>professional</u>
partnership, with no saleable good will but whose reputation depends on the
personal qualifications of its individual members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it has been held that a saleable
goodwill can exist only in a commercial partnership and cannot arise in a
professional partnership consisting of lawyers.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"As a general rule, upon the dissolution of a <u>commercial
partnership</u> the succeeding partners or parties have the right to carry on
the business under the old name, in the absence of a stipulation forbidding it,
(s)<span class="SpellE">ince</span> the name of a commercial partnership is a
partnership asset inseparable from the good will of the firm <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span>
." (60 Am <span class="SpellE">Jur</span> 2d,s 204, p. 115) (Emphasis
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand,</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> a <u>professional
partnership</u> the reputation of which depends on the individual skill of the
members, such as partnerships of <u>attorneys</u> or physicians, has no good
will to be distributed as a firm asset on its dissolution, however
intrinsically valuable <span style="">such skill and
reputation may be, especially where there is no provision in the partnership
agreement relating to good will as an asset.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" </span>(ibid, s 203, p. 115) (Emphasis supplied)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">C. A partnership for the practice of law cannot be likened to
partnerships formed by other professionals or for business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one thing, the law on accountancy
specifically allows the use of a trade name in connect<span style="">ion with the practice of accountancy.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> It is of the
essence of a profession that it is practiced in a spirit of public
service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'A trade' <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>'aims primarily at
personal gain; a profession at the exercise of powers beneficial to mankind.'
If, as in the era of wide free opportunity, we think of free competitive self
assertion as the highest good, lawyer and grocer and farmer may seem to be
freely competing with their <span style="">fellows </span>in
their calling in order each to acquire as much of the world's good as he may
within the limits allowed him by law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the member of a profession does not regard himself as in competition
with his professional brethren.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is not
bartering his services as is the artisan nor ex<span style="">changing the products of his skill and learning as the farmer sells
wheat or corn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There should be no such
thing as a lawyers' or physicians' strike.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The best service of the professional man is often rendered for no
equivalent or for a trifling equivalent and it is his pride to do what he does
in a way worthy of his profession even if done with no expectation of
reward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This spirit of public service in
which the profession of law is and ought to be exercised is a prerequisite of
sound administration of justice according to law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other two elements of a profession,
namely, organization and pursuit of a learned art have their justification in
that they secure and maintain that spirit."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
