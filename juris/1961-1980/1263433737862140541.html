Margarita E. <span class="SpellE">Sian</span>, <span class="SpellE">Criste</span>
C. <span class="SpellE">Sian</span>, <span class="SpellE">Celsa</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span>
III, <span class="SpellE">Siegfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span>,
Alberto <span class="SpellE">Tia</span> and Arturo A. Able, all employees of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, Branch
VI, requested an investigation of the respondent, Ma. <span class="SpellE">Nena</span>
<span class="SpellE">Magdaluyo</span>, also an employee thereat, charging the
latter for:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) being highly
inefficient; (2) habitual tardiness; and (3) making entries in the logbook that
she was present, when in fact she was absent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This case was subsequently referred to the Honorable Ernesto S. <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span>, the Executive Judge of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental for investigation, report and <span style="">recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence of the transfer of Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> to </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, the investigation was taken over by the
Honorable Ramon B. <span class="SpellE">Britanico</span>, in his capacity as
Vice-Executive Judge and Acting Executive Judge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his report, the
Investigator found the evidence insufficient to support the charges, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"After a careful review of the record of this case, the
undersigned investigator is of the opinion that there is not enough evidence to
just<span style="">ify complainants' charges against
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the respondent is
'highly inefficient' is </span>belied by the fact that she was given other assignments
in the office even after an administrative charge for inefficiency was filed
against her on 6 June 1977 (pp. 24-25, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1978" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1978</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it was complainant <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> himself who gave respondent these assignments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His gripe, however, is that 'respondent * <span style="">* * asks </span>so many questions even in
simple matters' (p. 3, <i><span style="">ibid</span></i><span style="">.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>This,
to the mind of the investigator, is not reason enough to hold that respondent
is inefficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted that
respondent has been assigned to a variety of tasks in the office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was responsible for preparing the court
calendar (p. 2, <i style=""><span style="">ibid</span></i><span style="">.), </span>releasing orders and subpoenas in criminal cases (p. 3, <i style=""><span style="">ibid</span></i><span style="">.), </span>making
a list of pending criminal cases at the end of the month (p. 4, <i style=""><span style="">ibid</span></i><span style="">.), </span>and
receiving mail matter for the office (p. 5, <i style=""><span style="">ibid</span></i><span style="">.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>She
was later on designated clerk in charge of criminal cases in July 1977 (p. 24, <i style=""><span style="">ibid</span></i><span style="">.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>With all these changes and/or
additional assignments, it is only natural to expect that respondent has not
developed mastery over all of the details of her task, in the span of time that
she had been working in the office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is not, therefore, any indication of inefficiency if she asks questions
relative to any particular matter or job <span class="GramE">she</span> is
engaged in at the moment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Neither is there convincing evidence regarding the charge of
'habitual tardiness.' The daily time record submitted by respondent and
certified to as correct by the Branch Clerk of Court is enough to negate
complainants' claim that respondent reported to the office habitually
late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it strikes the
investigator as rather strange that respondent was singled out and charged with
habitual tardiness when the office's logbook shows that there were also other
employees who made entries of their arrival after her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If she was <span class="SpellE">undertimed</span>,
surely these others must likewise be <span class="SpellE">undertimed</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records, however, does not disclose that
those others were so marked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
more than meets the eye in this situation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is not far fetched for one to conclude that there have been some
personal <span style="">misunderstandings among </span><span style="">the <span style="">employees
in </span>that court, so that their grievances came to a head with the filing
of <span style="">these </span>charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">may
also </span></span><span style="">not be amiss to
point </span><span style="">out
</span>that because of the strained relationship among the personnel of the
Court, their efficiency may have been affected, with the consequent detriment
to the judicial service.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Regarding the charge that respondent had made entries in the
logbook that she was present when in fact she was absent, especially during the
period of 16-20 May 1977, this is belied by the fact that <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'6', which is the Monthly Report of Employees' Tardiness, Absences and <span class="SpellE">Undertimes</span> for May, 1977, signed by the Clerk of Court <span style="">of that branch himself,
reflects no absence whatsoever made by respondent during the period in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it seems incredible
that if respondent was really absent, she was able to make daily entries in the
logbook corresponding to the dates of her alleged absences (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
<span class="GramE">'O' to 'S-2', inclusive), with these entries being followed
by the entries of other employee, like stenographer <span class="SpellE">Criste</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sian</span>, also a complainant herein.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>For all the dates in question, respondent's
entries were always followed by other entries of her co-employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent was said to have done all the
entries in only one day while the entries after hers were allegedly done at the
end of the month of May.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This practice
would be explained, unsatisfactorily, in the opinion of this investigator, by
complainant <span class="SpellE">Gavaran</span> that it was the presiding judge
who authorized the same for stenographers only as the latter were transcribing
their notes at their homes owing to space limitations at the office </span><span style="">(p. </span><span style="">14, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., February 28, 1978).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"From
all the foregoing, this investigator is of the opinion that the respondent may
not be guilty of the charges, but it is evident that she cannot get along well
with her co-employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She has made
enemies of almost all if not all of the other members of the staff of Branch
VI."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find the findings of the Investigator to be supported by the
evidence on record.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is, however, important to note that the afore-mentioned
charges arose from the failure of respondent to act with civility in her
relationship with her co-employees and to cooperate with them in the
performance of their public duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
conduct of public officers and employees in their dealings with each other and
with the public should be marked by respect for and consideration of the
feelings of others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, courtesy and
tactfulness are the most eloquent manifestations of a decent social <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">WHEREFORE,</b><span style=""> in view of the foregoing, the Court hereby
resolved to DISMISS the charges against respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She is, however, admonished to improve her
relationship with her co-employees, to act with civility, tact and courtesy in
her dealings with them and with the public.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
