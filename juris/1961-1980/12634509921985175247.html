				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by certiorari, taken by Manuel <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>,
from an order of the Court <span style="">of </span>Appeals
dismissing his petition for mandamus to compel the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
  City</st1:place></st1:city>, Branch No. V) to give due course to his appeal
in Civil Case No. 5161 thereof, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Resurreccion</span>
S. Reyes et al. vs. Manuel <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>".</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 18, 1960, <span class="SpellE">Resurreccion</span> S. Reyes
(hereinafter referred to as Miss Reyes) filed, on her behalf and as
guardian-ad-<span class="SpellE">litem</span> of her minor child <span class="SpellE">Nacito</span> Reyes, with said court of first instance, a
complaint - which was docketed as Civil Case No. 5161 of said court - against
Manuel <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>, for the acknowledgment of said minor,
as his alleged natural child, <span style="">as </span>well
as for support and dam­ages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1960</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>
filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied in an order dated <st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the filing of <span class="SpellE">Bernabe's</span>
answer, dated <st1:date year="1960" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1960</st1:date>,
the case was set for hearing on <st1:date year="1960" day="13" month="10">October
 13, 1960</st1:date>, notice of which was served on counsel for <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> on <st1:date year="1960" day="26" month="9">September
 26, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
notwithstanding, neither <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> nor his counsel
appeared at said hearing, he having received on <span style="">October </span>10, 1960, copy of a motion of Miss Reyes - dated October
3, 1960, and set for hearing on October 8, 1960 - for postponement, which was
denied; but, notice of the order denying the motion was not received by him
until October 17, 1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more,
the court of first in­stance proceeded with the hearing of the case, received
the evidence introduced by <span style="">Miss </span>Reyes and, on October 28, 1960, rendered a decision ordering <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> to acknowledge <span class="SpellE">Nacito</span>
Reyes as his natural child and sentencing <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> to
pay <span style="">Miss </span>Reyes
and <span class="SpellE">Nacito</span> Reyes a monthly alimony of P<span style="">100, </span>plus P3,000 as moral damages,
P1,000 as exemplary damages, P500 by way of attorney's fees, and the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> received copy of this decision
on <st1:date year="1960" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Five (5) days later, or on <st1:date year="1960" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1960</st1:date>, he filed a
"motion to set aside decision and/or for new <span style="">trial", </span>predicated upon the allegation that his failure to
appear at the hearing of the case had been due to the mistaken belief that the
motion for postponement would be granted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1960</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> received notice of an order, dated <st1:date year="1960" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1960</st1:date>, denying his
motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1960</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> filed
a motion for reconsi­deration of this order, but, on <st1:date year="1960" day="24" month="12">December 24, 1960</st1:date>, he re­ceived copy of an
order, dated <st1:date year="1960" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1960</st1:date>,
denying it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 3, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> filed his notice of ap­peal from said orders of <span style="">August </span>30, November 25 and <span style="">Decem­ber </span>10, 1960, to the Court of
Appeals, as well as his ap­peal bond and record on appeal, but on January 7,
1961, the lower court disapproved said record on appeal, upon the ground that
the appeal had not been perfected within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A </span>reconsideration of the order to this effect having been
denied, on February 6, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> filed, with the
Court of Appeals, the petition for mandamus in this case, to compel the lower
court to give due course to his aforementioned appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="2">Feb­ruary
 11, 1961</st1:date>, said appellate court issued the order, from which the
present appeal has been taken, dismissing the petition herein, for the reason
that the decision of <st1:date year="1960" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1960</st1:date>
was already final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, and that, being
interlocutory, no appeal could be taken from the or­ders of August 30, November
25 and <st1:date year="1960" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1960</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In holding that said
decision had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, the Court of
Appeals expressed itself as fol­lows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"From November 7, 1960, date of receipt of notice of decision,
to November 12, date of the filing of the motion for new trial, five (5) days
elapsed; and from November 26, 1960, date of receipt of the order denying the
motion for new trial, to December 5, date of the filing of the motion for
reconsidera­tion, nine (9) days elapsed or a total of fourteen (14) days, which
is to be deducted from the 30-day statutory period, leaving a balance of <span style="">sixteen </span>days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The filing of the motion for reconsideration
on December 5, alleging the same grounds stated in the motion for new trial,
did not suspend the running of the balance of the 30-day period, so that when
the notice of appeal, appeal bond and Record on Appeal were filed on January 3,
1961, a total of forty-three (43) days had elapsed, which <span style="">is </span>far in
ex­cess of the 30-day period for perfecting an appeal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bernabe</span></span><span style=""> assails this process of reasoning </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">premis­ed upon a false predicate - that an appeal has been taken from
the decision of </span><st1:date year="1960" day="28" month="10"><span style="">October 28, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">He </span><span style="">had merely ap­pealed, he stresses, from the orders of November 25 and </span><st1:date year="1960" day="10" month="12"><span style="">December
 10, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, which, he
maintains, are not inter­locutory, but, final, because they put an end to the
is­sue disposed of thereby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">He </span><span style="">concludes, accordingly, that the period to perfect his appeal should be
reckoned from notice of said orders.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The cases he relies upon,
in support of this theory,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> are, however, not in point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They refer to appeals from or­ders denying <u>motions
for relief under Rule 38 of the Rules, of Court</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, such orders are <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>,
pursuant to the express provision of Section 2, of Rule 41 of the Revised Rules
of Court.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a><span style=""> It should be noted, however, that the aforesaid "relief",
under Rule 38, may not be availed of </span><u>except when the decision has
become final and executory</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a> <span style="">and only when a new trial is not available.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a><span style=""> In the case
at bar, said new trial was still available and the decision of October 28,
1960, was <u>not</u> as yet final and </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">executory</span></span><span style=""> when <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> filed
his </span><span style="">"motion to set aside
decision and/or for new trial" on November 12, 1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we ruled in <span class="SpellE">Samia</span>

<blockquote>"Between an order denying a motion for a new trial under
section 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Rule 37 of the Rules of Court),
which this court has held to be interlocutory and hence <span class="SpellE">unappealable</span>
(Co-<span class="SpellE">Yengco</span> vs. Reyes, 4 Phil. 709; <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> vs. De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>, 3 Phil.

677), and an order deny­ing a motion for new trial under section 113 of the
Code (Rule 38 of the Rules of Court), which this Court held to be final and
therefore, <span class="SpellE">ap­pealable</span> (Philippine Manufacturing Co.
and Government of the Philippine Islands vs. <span class="SpellE">Cabañ­gis</span>,
49 Phil. 107; Philippine Manufacturing Co. vs. Imperial, 47 Phil. 810; <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Coronel</span>, 43 Phil.,
358; <span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Sian</span>, 53
Phil. 155) there is this fundamental difference:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first case, since the judgment sought
in the motion for new trial to be annulled is not final, the question of the
denial of this motion may be raised on appeal <u>from such judgment</u>; in the
second, since the judgment sought in the motion for a new trial to be annulled
is al­ready final, there is <u>no</u> other remedy than ap­peal <u>from the
order denying the motion</u>, in or­der that the question as to its correctness
can be raised." (Underscoring ours.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bernabe's</span> aforementioned "motion
to set aside decision and/or for new trial", suspended the running of his
period to appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a> Hence, when the motion was
denied, his <u>only</u> remedy was to appeal from said decision, and, in
connection therewith or as an incident of said appeal, he could have assailed
the order denying the new trial.</p>

<blockquote>"The second assignment of error concerns the denial of
plaintiff's first motion for a new trial and attacks the court's findings,
thereto­fore extracted, on the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Denial or granting of that motion lay within the sound discretion of the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The plaintiff's <span style="">sole </span>remedy if he disagreed with the
court's ap­praisal of the proofs <span style="">was </span>to

argument in this instance, designated to show that the court's <a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a>conclusions are wrong, can not afford him any
relief".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Tañada</span>

<p class="BODY">It may not be amiss to note that, at any rate, <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> had no valid ground to complain against the order
of Novem­ber 25, 1960, denying his motion for new trial, for the same was
addressed to the sound discretion of the court of first instance and the latter
had not abused its discretion in denying it, because:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> had no
reasonable ground to assume that the motion for postponement of the hearing
would be granted;<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a> and (2) more important still, no
affidavit of merit had been attached to said motion, so that there was no
possible reason to expect or assume that the result of the case would be otherwise,
if the motion were granted.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a></p>
