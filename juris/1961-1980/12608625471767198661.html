Judge and to enjoin him to cause petitioner to be placed in possession of 
certain parcels of land.
<p>On September 27, 1954, petitioner herein, the Republic of the Philippines, 
instituted Civil Case No. 763 of the Court of First Instance of Pampanga, 
entitled "Republic of the Philippines <i>vs</i>. Justice Jose Gutierrez David, 
et al.", for the expropriation of an estate of about 2,054 hectares, situated in 
San Luis, Pampanga, and more particularly described in the complaint therein 
filed, to be subdivided into home lots and family sized farms, in order to 
provide homes and means of livelihood to some 570 families of about 3,000 
individuals and drive away dissidence and restore peace in the area. The 
complaint was amended on November 26, 1955, to include additional defendants and 
additional properties to be expropriated. On December 3, 1956, the complaint was 
further amended by the inclusion therein of Lots Nos. 2599, 2609 and 2625 of the 
San Luis Cadastre, San Luis, Pampanga, among the properties sought to be taken, 
and that of Cecilia Lagman Vda. de Salas, and Leonides, Josefa, Alberto, Pastora 
and Luz, all surnamed Salas—and hereinafter referred to as the Salases as 
alleged owners of said properties pursuant to a decision rendered in Cadastral 
Case No. 56 (L. R. C. Rec. No. 1979), dated November 26, 1956, and Original 
Certificate of Title No. 1898 of the office of the Register of Deeds of 
Pampanga. Forthwith, the Salases moved that the sum of P3,240, deposited by the 
Government as the provisional value of said lots, be paid to them, which was 
granted, whereupon the movants collected said amount.</p>
<p>Over two (2) months later, or on February 11, 1957, respondents herein, Jose 
P. Ingal and Marceliano Caliuag hereinafter referred to as intervenors—moved to 
intervene in the case and filed an opposition to the expropriation of the lots 
aforementioned. Meanwhile, or on or about January 19, 1957, the intervenors had 
filed in Cadastral Case No. 56 a petition for review of the said decision of 
November 26, 1956, adjudicating to the Salases the lots in question, upon the 
ground that the same belong to them (the intervenors). Before this petition for 
review could be heard, or on July 14, 1957, the Salases and the intervenors 
entered into a compromise agreement in both cases, whereby—after making 
reference to the aforementioned decision, to the provisional value received by 
the Salases in the expropriation proceedings, to the motion for review of said 
decision in the cadastral case and to the motion to intervene in the 
expropriation proceedings—they stipulated, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That, the parties herein desire to buy peace and stop the troubles of 
litigation in both Cadastral Case No. 56 and Civil Case No. 763, the object of 
which are cadastral Lots Nos. 2599, 2609, and 2625 of the San Luis Cadastre;</p>
<p>"That, the claimants, herein, represented by Leonides Salas, for himself and 
as attorney-in-fact of his co-parties, for having received from the Republic of 
the Philippines in Civil Case No. 763 the provisional value of the said parcels 
of land, do hereby waive, quitclaim, transfer, and convey, all the claimants' 
rights, interests, shares, and participations on Lots Nos. 2599, 2609, and 2625 
of the San Luis Cadastre, in favor of the petitioners-intervenors, Marceliano 
Caliuag and Jose P. Ingal, share and share alike;</p>
<p>"That, petitloners-intervenors Marceliano Caliuag and Jose P. Ingal consider 
the payment by the Republic of the Philippines of the said provisional value as 
legal and valid payment;</p><p align="center">x x x x<br></p>
<p>"That, claimants Cecilia Lagman Vda. de Salas, et als., shall not claim any 
further claim from the Republic of the Philippines affecting the said three (3) 
parcels of land; and petitioners-intervenors shall not claim against the 
Republic of the Philippines for the same provisional value paid to the herein 
claimants;</p>
<p>"That, the petitioners-intervenors shall remain party-defendants in Civil 
Case No. 763-for Expropriation; and the herein claimants shall withdraw 
therefrom as party-litigants:</p>
<p>"That, by virtue of this COMPROMISE AGREEMENT, all parties herein agree to 
have the three (3) parcels of land, namely Lots Nos. 2299, 2609, and 2625 of the 
San Luis Cadastre adjudicated to:</p>
<p>MARCELIANO CALIUAG, of legal age, married to Donata Ingal, Filipino, with 
residence and postal address at San Luis, Pampanga, and</p>
<p>JOSE P. INGAL, of legal age, married to Isabel Feliciano, Filipino, with 
residence and postal address at Calero, Morong, Rizal, share and share 
alike."</p></blockquote>
<p>In view of this compromise agreement, on July 26, 1957, the Court of First 
Instance of Pampanga amended its above mentioned decision, in Cadastral Case No. 
56, so as to adjudicate the lots in question to the intervenors, and Original 
Certificates of Title No. 1898 was cancelled, and, in lieu thereof, Transfer 
Certificate of Title No. 17396—R was issued in favor of said intervenors. Prior 
thereto, or on July 21, 1957, petitioner had filed in the expropriation case a 
motion praying for the delivery of several lots covered by said proceedings, 
including the lots in question. On February 8, 1960, petitioner filed another 
motion reiterating its prayer for the delivery of said lots, the provisional 
value thereof having already been collected by the Salases. Subsequently, or on 
March 21, 1960, petitioner moved that the intervenors be substituted in lieu of 
the Salases as parties-defendants, upon the ground that the former had stepped 
into the shoes of the latter in consequence of the compromise agreement 
aforementioned. The intervenors objected to both motions, which were denied by 
respondent Judge, in an order dated April 23, 1960. A reconsideration of this 
order having been, likewise, denied, petitioner instituted the present action 
for certiorari and mandamus upon the ground that in denying the motion for 
delivery of the possession of said lots, respondent Judge had acted without or 
in excess of jurisdiction and with abuse of discretion, and that there is no 
appeal or any other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of 
law against the order of denial adverted to above.</p>
<p>Such order appears to be based mainly upon the premise that the intervenors, 
not the Salases, are the real parties in interest, insofar as the lots in 
question are concerned, because the original decision, in the cadastral case, in 
favor of the Salases, had been vacated, and the intervenors were declared 
therein lawful owners of the said lots. However, it appears, also, that 
respondent Judge had failed to give due weight and effect to the fact that said 
adjudication in favor of the intervenors was (as alleged in paragraph 10 of the 
petition herein and admitted by respondents herein) made "by virtue of the 
compromise agreement—and, hence, in compliance therewith, or as a consequence 
thereof—whereby the Salases waived, quitclaimed, <i>transferred</i> and 
<i>conveyed</i> all their "rights, interests, shares and participations in and 
to the lots in question in favor of the intervenors, and that (pursuant to said 
paragraph 10 of the petition herein, the allegations of which are admitted in 
respondents' answer) by virtue of said compromise agreement, "Original 
Certificate of Title No. 1898", in favor of the Salases, "was cancelled and the 
ownership of Lots Nos. 2599, 2609 and 2625 were <i>transferred</i>" to the 
intervenors, "in whose favor <i>Transfer</i> Certificate of Title No. 17396—R 
was issued by the Register of Deeds of Pampanga", thus, the title of the 
intervenors in and to said lots was merely <i>derived</i> from the Salases. 
Otherwise, the former would have been issued an original certificate of title, 
instead of the <i>transfer</i> certificate of title they got.</p>
<p>Again it was explicitly stipulated in the compromise agreement that the 
intervenors considered as "legal and valid" the payment to the Salases of 
P3,240, as the provisional value of said lots, and that said intervenors would 
not claim such provisional value from the Government. Said payment to the 
Salases could not be valid, but the aforementioned sum would have to be refunded 
by them to the Government, under the principle of <i>solutio indebti</i>, and 
the intervenors would be entitled to collect it from the Government, if the lots 
in question did not belong to the Salases at the time of the aforementioned 
payment. Said provisions of the compromise agreement necessarily imply, 
therefore, a recognition by the intervenors that the Salases owned the lots in 
question at such time.</p>
<p>In other words, in consequence of the compromise agreement, the intervenors 
became the successors in interest to the rights of the Salases, so that the 
admission made by the latter of petitioner's right to expropriate said lots is 
binding upon the former and their (intervenors') rights in the expropriation 
proceedings are now limited to the collection of the difference between the 
provisional value aforementioned and such amount as may eventually be fixed as 
the just compensation for the taking of the lots in question.</p>
<p>Lastly, being "legal and valid" said payment to the Salases should produce 
its legal effects. And what are they. The sum of P3,240 was deposited by the 
Government as a condition precedent to its right to take possession of said 
lots, pursuant to Rule 69, section 3, of the Rules of Court. The collection of 
said sum by the Salases was a recognition not merely of that right, which was 
perfected upon the making of said deposit, unless the court fixed another amount 
as the provisional value of the lots, but, also, of the compliance with said 
condition. It thus rendered such right effective and executory. As a 
consequence, in denying petitioner's motion for the delivery of the lots in 
question, respondent Judge has gravely abused his discretion and unlawfully 
excluded the petitioner from the use and enjoyment of a right to which it is 
entitled (Rule 67, sections 1 and 3, and Rule 69, section 3, of the Rules of 
Court).</p>
<p>Wherefore, the aforementioned order of April 23, 1960, is set aside and 
respondent Judge is hereby enjoined to cause petitioner herein, the Republic of 
the Philippines, to be placed in possession of Lots Nos. 2599, 2609 and 2625 of 
the San Luis Cadastre and to substitute Jose P. Ingal and Marceliano Caliuag, in 
lieu of Cecilia Lagman Vda. de Salas, and Leonides, Josefa, Alberto, Pastora and 
Luz, all surnamed Salas, as defendants in Civil. Case No. 763 of the Court of 
First Instance of Pampanga, with costs against said Jose P. Ingal and Marceliano 
Caliuag. It is so ordered.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, 
Reyes, J.B.L., Paredes, De Leon,</i> and <i>Natividad, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
