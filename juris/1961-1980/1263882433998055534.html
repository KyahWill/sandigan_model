Casualty &amp; Surety Company vs. Pacific Star Line, The <span class="SpellE">Bradman</span>
Co. Inc., Manila Port Service and/or Manila Railroad Company, Inc."
dismissing the complaint on the ground that the plaintiff has no legal capacity
to bring this suit and making no <span class="GramE">finding</span> as to the
liability of the defendants.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On February <span style="">11, 1963, </span>Smith
Bell &amp; Co. (Philippines), Inc. and Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. Inc., as
<span class="SpellE">subrogee</span>, instituted Civil Case No. 53074 in the
Court of First Ins­tance of Manila against Pacific Star Line, The <span class="SpellE">Bradman</span> Co. Inc., Manila Port Service and/or Manila
Railroad Company, Inc. to recover the amount of US$2,300.00 representing the
value of the stolen and damaged cargo plus litigation expenses and exemplary
damages in the amounts of P1,000.00 and P2,000.00, respectively, with legal
interest thereon from the filing of the suit and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint stated that during the time material to the action,
the defendant Pacific Star Line, as a common carrier, was operating the vessel
SS <span class="SpellE">Ampal</span> on a commercial run between United States
and Philippine Ports including Manila; that the defendant, The <span class="SpellE">Bradman</span> Co. Inc., was the ship agent in the Philippines for
the SS <span class="SpellE">Ampal</span> and/or Pacific Star Line; that the
Manila Railroad Co. Inc. and Manila Port Service were the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operators in the port of Manila and were authorized to deliver car­goes
discharged into their custody on presentation of re­lease papers from the
Bureau of Customs and the steamship carrier and/or its agents; that on December
22, 1961, the SS <span class="SpellE">Ampal</span> took on board at New York,
N.Y., U.S.A., a con­signment or cargo including 33 packages of Linen &amp;
Cotton Piece Goods for shipment to Manila for which defendant Pacific Star Line
issued Bill of Lading No. 18 in the name of I. Shalom &amp; Co., Inc., as
shipper, consigned to the order of Judy Philippines, Inc., Manila; that the SS <span class="SpellE">Ampal</span> arrived in Manila on February 10, 1962 and in due
course, discharged her cargo into the custody of Manila Port Ser­vice; that due
to the negligence of the defendants, the shipment sustained damages valued at
US$2,300.00 repre­senting pilferage and seawater damage; that I. Shalom &amp;
Co., Inc. immediately filed claim for the undelivered and damaged cargo with
defendant Pacific Star Line in New York, N.Y., but said defendant refused and
still refuses to pay the said claim; that the cargo was insured by I. Shalom
&amp; Co., Inc. with plaintiff Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company for loss
and/or damage; that upon demand, plaintiff Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company
indemnified I. Shalom &amp; Co., Inc. the amount of US$2,300.00; that in
addition to this, the plaintiffs had obligated themselves to pay attorney's
fees and they further anticipated incurring litigation expenses which may be
assessed at P1,000.00; <span style="">that </span>plaintiffs
and/or their predecessor-in-interest sustained losses due to the negligence of
Pacific Star Line prior to delivery of the cargo to Manila or, in the alternative,
due to the negli­gence of Manila Port Service after delivery of the cargo to it
by the SS <span class="SpellE">Ampal</span>; that despite repeated demands, none
of the defendants has been willing to accept liability for the claim of the
plaintiffs and/or I. Shalom &amp; Co., Inc.; and that by reason of defendants'
evident bad faith, they should consequently be liable to pay exemplary damages
in the amount of P2,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On motion of the defendants Pacific Star Line and The <span class="SpellE">Bradman</span> <st1:place>Co.</st1:place> Inc. and with the
conformity of the plain­tiff Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company, the plaintiff
smith Bell &amp; Co. (<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>),
Inc. was dropped and the com­plaint was dismissed as to <span class="GramE">said</span>
plaintiff.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In their answer filed on February 28, 1963, the defendants Manila
Port Service and Manila Railroad Company, Inc. alleged that they have exercised
due care and dili­gence in handling and delivering the cargoes consigned to
Judy Philippines, Inc.; that, in fact, they had delivered the merchandise to
the consignee thereof in the same <span style="">quantity,
order and condition as </span>when <span style="">the
same was </span>actually received from the carrying vessel; that a portion of
the shipment in question was discharged from the carrying vessel in bad order
and <span style="">condition </span>and consequently,
any loss or shortage incurred thereto, is the sole responsibility of <span style="">the said carrying vessel and not that of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator; that they have delivered to the
consignee thereof the same quantity of merchandise and in the same order or
condition as when received from the carrying vessel; that since no claim of the
value of the goods in question was filed by the plaintiff or any of its
representative within 15 days from the discharge of the last package from the
carrying vessel, the claim has become time-barred and/or prescribed pursuant to
the management contract under which said defendants were appointed as <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator at the Port of Manila; that consequently,
they are completely relieved or released from any or all liability <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>; and that they do not in any manner act as agent
of the carrying vessel in the discharge of the goods at the piers.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Pacific Star Line and The <span class="SpellE">Bradman</span>
Co. Inc. alleged in their answer as special defenses that the plaintiff's cause
of action, if any, against the answering defendants had prescribed under the
provisions of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act and/or the terms of the covering
bill of lading; that the entire shipment covered by the bill of lading issued
by answering defendant Pacific Star Line was dis­charged complete and in good
order condition into the cus­tody of <span style="">the
</span>other defendant, Manila Port Service, which was the operator of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service at the Port of Manila; that any damage
which may have occurred to the cargo while it was in the custody of the
defendant Manila Port Service was caused solely by the negligence of said <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator and is, therefore, its sole responsibi­lity;
the defendant Manila Port Service is not the vessel agent in the receiving,
handling, custody and/or delivery of the cargo purchased; that the vessel's
responsibility ceased upon removal of the cargo from the ship's tackle; that
defendant Manila Port Service is not the vessel's or answering defendant’s
agent in the receiving, handling, custody and/or delivery of the cargo
consignee; that the vessel's responsibility ceased upon removal of the cargo
from the ship's tackle; that the vessel's liability, if any, for one case
cannot exceed the sum of P500.00 under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants Manila Port Service and Manila Railroad Company,
Inc. amended their answer to allege that the plaintiff, Aetna Casualty &amp;
Surety Company, is a foreign corporation not duly licensed to do business in
the Philippines and, therefore, without capacity to sue and be sued.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

of the Philippines shall be permitted to transact business in the Philippines
or maintain by itself or assignee any suit for the recovery of any debt, claim,
or demand whatever, unless it shall have the license prescribed in the section
immediately preceding <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is settled that if a foreign corporation is not engaged in
business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
it may not be denied the right to file an action in Philippine courts for iso­lated
transactions.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The object of Sections 68 and 69 of the Corporation Law was not
to prevent the foreign corporation from per­forming single acts, but to prevent
it from acquiring a domicile for the purpose of business without taking the
steps necessary to render it amenable to suit in the local courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was never the purpose of the Legislature
to exclude a foreign corporation which happens to obtain an isolated order for
business from the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
from securing redress in the Philippine courts.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Mentholatum</span> Co., Inc. et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Mangaliman</span>, et al., this Court ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>"No general rule or governing principle can be <span style="">laid </span>down as to what constitutes
'doing' or 'en­gaging in' or 'transacting' business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, each case must be judged in the light
of its pe­culiar environmental circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The true test, however, seems to be whether the foreign corporation is
continuing the body or substance <span style="">of the
business or enterprise for which it was organized or whether it has
substantially retired from it and turned it over to another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Traction Cos. v.

<p class="BODY">And in <span class="SpellE">Eastboard</span> Navigation, Ltd., et

does not follow that it has no capacity to bring the present action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such license is not necessary because it is

the first business undertaken by plaintiff in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,

<p class="BODY">Based on the rulings laid down in the foregoing cases, it cannot
be said that the Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety <span style="">Company </span>is <span style="">transacting </span>business
of insurance in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>

that all the actions, except two (2) cases filed by Smith, Bell &amp; Co., Inc.
