				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeals, dated
November 9, 1963, reversing the judg­ment rendered by the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte, and dismissing the
petition for mandamus and prohibition <span class="GramE">filed</span> by herein
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span> was first appoint­ed in the National Shipyards and
Steel Corporation (NASSCO) on July 13, 1950 as Cost Clerk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On July 1, 1952 he was extended a promotional
appointment to the position of Cost Accountant at the <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span>
Steel Mills, at P2<span class="GramE">,760.00</span> per annum, which appointment
was attested by the Commissioner of Civil Service as temporary under Section
682 of the Revised Administrative Code because <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span>
was then not a civil service eligible.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
By virtue of this promotional appointment <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span>
assumed his duties and rendered service since then in the NASSCO compound at
Overton, <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On June 20, 1961, NASSCO
General Manager Bernardo P. <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span>, one of the
respondents herein, issued office order No. 99 transferring petitioner,
together with six other employees, from the <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span>
Steel Mills to the </span>NASSCO Central Office at Engineer Island,
Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the seven employees named in
the aforementioned office order, only <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span>
protested his transfer, addressing a letter to General Manager <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span> on July 1, 1961 re­questing his retention in his
position as Cost Account­ant of the NASSCO at <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span>
City instead of his transfer to the Accounting Department, Engineer Island, <span class="GramE">Manila</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
notwithstanding this request for retention, <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span>
reported for duty at the latter office in Manila on July 19, 1961.</p>

<p class="BODY">After working for thirty-eight days at the Manila Accounting
Department of the NASSCO, <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span> was allowed to go
to <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City, under a travel order, so he could
secure his <span style="">clearance </span>of any
property responsibility at the <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> Steel Mills and
prepare for the transfer of his family and personal belongings to <span style="">Manila, in </span>con­nection with his
permanent assignment <span style="">at </span>the
main of­fice of the NASSCO in Manila.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But instead of accomplishing the purpose for which the travel order was
is­sued, what <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span> did was to report for duty at
the <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> Steel Mills on the day of his arrival at <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City, and continued to work there until September
10, 1961.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 11, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span> returned
to Manila, and he again worked at the main office of the NASSCO un­til October
6, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On September 28, 1961, while
work­ing at the NASSCO central office in Manila, <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span>
again wrote a letter to General Manager <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span>,
giving reasons against his transfer to Manila, the pertinent portions of <span style="">which letter read </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“(<span class="GramE">a</span>)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, I humbly feel and believe that I have
been practically demoted because I have been deprived of the discretionary and
supervisory functions appurtenant to my Plant position;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(b) I wish to
mention further that my present situation does not give me a peaceful mind and
I really believe that I cannot render an efficient ser­vice; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What <span class="GramE">bothers</span> me most
are the many setbacks and inconveniences which I am undergoing while my family
has been left behind in <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last but not the least that confronts me <span class="GramE">are</span> incidental expenses in the city which I believe could
not be incurred, if only my folks are around."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Even after sending the aforesaid letter, on October 5, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span> requested General Manager <span class="SpellE">Ab­rera</span>
to allow him to go to <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City for the purpose of
"bringing his family to Manila and return to Manila for permanent
assignment in the Manila Accounting Depart­ment on or before October 31,
1961." General Manager <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span> accommodatingly
granted the request by issuing another travel order for <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span>,
but with the warning that "no further trip of this nature to <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> will be allowed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span> shall secure his final clearance
in <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> Steel Mills."</p>

<p class="BODY">However, instead of making good the reasons for his request to be
allowed to go to <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City, and again in disregard
of the instructions contained in his travel order, what <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span>
did upon arriving at <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City was again to report
for duty at the <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> Steel Mills, where he worked
from October 6, 1961 to October 31, 1961; and in order to frustrate his
transfer to<span style=""> </span>Manila he went on
vacation and sick leave from Novem­ber 1 to 19, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 20, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span>
wired General Manager <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span> informing the latter
that he had <span style="">resumed his work at the <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> Steel Mills.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On November 29, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span> wrote the Chairman and Members of the Board of
Directors of the NASSCO, explaining his reluctance to return to Manila, the per­tinent
part of his letter reading </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"My wife is permanently employed in the office of the Highway
District Engineer, Bureau of Public Highways, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> Norte and at the same time she is schooling like our two
children, so that these problems will only add more to the setbacks and
inconveniences I will undergo, if I am transferred in an inopportune
time."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At the end of his letter <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span> stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Nonetheless, I would finally say that I am very willing to
transfer and leave this place in an opportune time, but not in such
circumstances and situa­tion."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On December 8, 1961,
Esteban O. Robles, Manager of the <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> Steel Mills,
wired General Manager <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span> asking the latter if <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span> should be paid </span><span style="">his wages, </span><span style="">and in reply <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span> sent radio message No. 98 instruct­ing Robles to pay
<span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span> his salaries up to December 12, 1961 and
forthwith to drop him from the payroll of <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span>
Steel Mills effective December 13, 1961.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After the Board of
Directors of the NASSCO de­nied his request for retention at the <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> Steel Mills, <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span>
brought his case to the attention of the Office of Economic Coordination, on
February 21, 1962, claiming, for the first time, that politics was the motive
behind his transfer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Office of Econo­mic
Coordination indorsed <span class="SpellE">Quiocho's</span> letter to the Gene­ral
Manager of the NASSCO for comment, and the latter made an explanation, the pertinent
part of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"From the foregoing, it will be noted that the assignment of
Mr. <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span> in the Cen­tral Office, Manila <span style="">is </span>for the
best interest of the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He will
assume the duties of handling the Books of Accounts which were <span style="">previously done by Mr. Jose Rojas prior to
his promotion as Chief Accountant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
plan was to reclassify his position upon arrival in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> after his orienta­tion of the new assignment
called for by the directives of this Office.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Mention may be made that the previous <span style="">ISM </span>General Superintendents and
Acting Gen­eral Superintendents, Messrs. Vicente Ser­rano, Oscar Flores and
Esteban Robles in­cluding Mr. Jose <span class="SpellE">Amante</span>, Jr.,
present Manager <span style="">of </span>ISM, have recommended for the transfer of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span> to other NASSCO Units for the best interest of ISM
and the Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His actions by and
large during his assignment in <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> have created
irritants in the labor group as well as in the Management level.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He (Mr. <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span>)
has the tendency to engender animosity between Management and labor which is
not healthy in any organization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, because of this repulsive conduct of <span style="">Mr. </span><span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span>,
<span style="">a </span>new
group of labor leaders has cropped up in ISM and new Presidents of the
supervisory union (NAPROSEA) and workmen union (NISMEA) were elected, and since
then <span style="">a </span>smooth
and harmonious relation has been existing between labor and local management in
ISM.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It <span style="">is </span>the observation of the Management that during the years of
his employment, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span> lacks the inherent
qualities for res­pect due to his superiors and associates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All premises considered, it is the considered
opinion of this Management that his (Mr. <span class="SpellE">Quio­cho's</span>)
transfer falls within the prerogatives of this Management for the best interest
of the service and no extraneous factors have been considered in the proposed
transfer."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On March 5, 1962, <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span> filed a petition for mandamus and prohibition
before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del
Norte, against General Manager Bernardo P. <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span> of
the NASSCO and Manager Esteban O. Robles of the <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span>
Steel Mills, alleging that having a clear and unequivocal right to the office
of </span><span style="">Cost Accountant of the
NASSCO-<span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> Steel Mills, res­pondents <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span> and Robles acted arbitrarily or in excess of their
power and authority in transferring him to the central office in Manila, and
the transfer having been made without his consent and without just cause, the
same is tantamount to his removal from the service and the transfer, therefore,
is null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The <span style="">respondents filed their answer, contending,
among others, that it is within their managerial prerogatives to transfer an
employee of the NASSCO, from one branch to another, as demanded by the
exigencies, or for the good, of the service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On November 28, 1962, the lower court rendered judgment,
"ordering respondents to vacate office order No. 99 dated June 20, 1961 in
so far as it pertains to the herein petitioner and likewise to vacate office
memorandum dated December 12, 1961 and x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> orders the same respondents to restore or reinstate the

to pay costs."</p>

<p class="BODY">From the decision of the lower court, respondents <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span> and Robles appealed to the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1963</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals rendered a decision reversing that of the lower court, and
dis­missed petitioner's petition for mandamus and prohibition, without pronouncement

without prejudice to prosecuting his appeal in the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 16, 1963, <span class="SpellE">Quiocho's</span>
motion for rehearing or reconsideration was denied by the Court of Appeals, and
on the same date, he reported for duty at the Manila central office of the
NASSCO and worked in a position that carried a salary of P3<span class="GramE">,984.00</span>
per annum, the same salary that he was receiving when he was dropped from the <span style="">payroll of the NASSCO-<span class="SpellE">Iligan</span>
Steel Mills.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 24, 1963, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Quiocho</span>
inter­posed the present appeal to this Court, assigning three errors which,
stripped of non-essentials, boil down to the contention:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the Court of Appeals erred in not
declaring that the transfer of the petitioner from <span style="">his </span>position as Cost Accountant at the <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span>
Steel Mills to the Accounting Department of the NASSCO in Manila was illegal,
was done with evil motives and was tantamount to <span style="">a removal </span>from the <span style="">service
without </span>cause.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in petitioner's appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim of petitioner that behind his
transfer from the <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> Steel Mills to the central
office of the NASSCO in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
there was political motivation <span style="">deserves
</span>no consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record
shows that in the letters he wrote to respondent <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span>
and to the Board of <span style="">Directors </span>of
the NASSCO complaining about his transfer, petitioner did not mention about
political motives but only the <span style="">inconveniences
</span>that the transfer would cause him and his family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He only claimed political motivation for the
first time in the letter he subsequently sent to the Office of the Economic
Coordination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is noteworthy that in
the complaint that he filed in court, in his reply, in his testimonial
evidence, and in the brief that he filed in the Court of Appeals, the
petitioner failed to mention that politics was behind his transfer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, petitioner admits that
he brought out only in this appeal the matter about political and per­sonal
motivations.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We find that respondent <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Abrera</span></span><span style=""> </span>effected the trans­fer of petitioner in line with the <span style="">desire </span>of the superin­tendents and/or
managers, past and present, of the <span class="SpellE">Ili­gan</span> Steel
Mills, because during his assignment <span style="">in
<span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> </span>petitioner created irritants, or
engendered animosity, between management and labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This circumstance is im­pliedly admitted by
petitioner when he stated that he <span style="">"</span><span style="">still wields considerable power and influence
over x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span style="">two labor unions who more or less command 600
members" </span><span style="">and "it was
during the petitioner's incumbency </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">the top official of
these two labor organizations when the x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> strikes in 1959 and 1960 were staged."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Taking into consideration the circumstance
that the transfer of petitioner was not a demotion in rank or salary, and, the
fact that petitioner was allowed to resume work in his position in the
Accounting Department of the NASSCO in Manila on December 16, 1963 - an
indication that pe­titioner was not dismissed from the service - We agree with
the ruling of the Court of Appeals that the act of respondent <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span> in transferring petitioner to the Accounting
Department of the NASSCO in Manila </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">in accordance with
Section 32 of Republic Act 2260, known </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">the Civil Service Act
of 1959, which provides -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">That</span> a transfer from one position

<p class="BODY">We uphold the finding of the Court of Appeals that petitioner's
transfer was not done in bad faith or with ulterior motives, designed to bring
about his removal from the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
such transfer brought inconve­nience to petitioner and his family is of no
moment, because the personal convenience of a person in the public service
should not be given more importance than the interest of the public
service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What matters <span style="">is </span>that the transfer is done in good
faith and the best <span class="GramE">interests of the public service is</span>
thereby served.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in the present case,
because the petitioner was simply transferred from one office of the NASSCO to
the other and for the good of the service, <span class="GramE">We</span> hold
that the act of respondent <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span> in effecting the
transfer of pe­titioner was proper and in accordance with law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having arrived at the foregoing conclusion, <span class="GramE">We</span>
deem it unnecessary to dwell on the other matters touched by petitioner in his
appeal which would not affect the result of this case.</p>
