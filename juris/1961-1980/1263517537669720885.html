in the evening of <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="5">May 14, 1963</st1:date>,
while Claudio A. <span class="SpellE">Bagaoisan</span>, the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Batac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, was driving
his jeep on his way to the municipal hall, his attention was attracted by the
head­lights of a vehicle running along the municipal dirt road leading to the
national highway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stopped at the
junction to observe, a recent robbery in the locality having made him
suspicious of vehicles going around at night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon reach­ing the highway the vehicle, which turned out to be a jeep,
proceeded northward at a fast clip.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sensing something unusual, <span class="SpellE">Bagaoisan</span> have
chase and <span class="SpellE">signalled</span> its driver to stop by blowing the
police siren and firing a warning shot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The jeep slowed down somewhat, and as he was about to overtake it, one
of the passengers looked back and shouted a question at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of stopping, however, the jeep shot
forward and left him behind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the
brief interlude enabled the Chief of Police to observe that one of the
passengers occupying the front seat was a woman and to note the facial
appearance of the passenger who shouted at him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He also noted the jeep a registration plate No. 22274, Series 1963.</p>

<p class="BODY">Realizing the futility of further pursuit Chief <span class="SpellE">Bagaoisan</span> turned back drove to a police station and then
proceeded to the municipal hall. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>There
he was informed by the guard that <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> of San Nicolas, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>
Norte had called up by phone, requesting the <span class="SpellE">Batac</span>
police to be on the look-out for a jeep with plate number 22274, which had
allegedly been stolen from its owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was also requested that the message be relayed to the PC detachment at <span class="SpellE">Badoc</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly after
<st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Espejo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Jovencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span>, a certain <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> <span class="SpellE">Macadangdang</span> and another unnamed companion arrived at the
municipal hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Espejo</span>
inquired whether a jeep with plate number 22274 had been seen in <span class="SpellE">Batac</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bagaoisan</span> related what he had seen earlier that evening and
even described the passenger who had shouted at him, eliciting a remark from <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> that he could surmise who that passenger was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The group then bade good night and left.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following morning, May 15 1963, between six and seven
o'clock, <span class="SpellE">Ko</span> <span class="SpellE">Pian</span> (also
referred to as Co <span class="SpellE">Piang</span> in the record) a Chinese
merchant was found stabbed to death inside his garage located at the back of
his store just across the public market of <span class="SpellE">Batac</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The local police department was immediately
notified and the initial investi­gation at the scene revealed that one of the
dead manes steel safes and two (2) as axes displayed at the store were missing
while the other steel safe had been slightly pulled forward from its place and
found with a piece of rope still tied to it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The post-mortem examination conducted by the municipal health
officer showed that the victim had received five stab wounds and five puncture
wounds in the neck and chest and that he died from the resulting massive
hemorrhage.</p>

<p class="BODY">Suspecting that the persons riding in the jeep he pursued the
previous night had something to do with the crime, <span class="SpellE">Bagaoisan</span>
went to San Nicolas to check.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There he
learned from <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> <span class="SpellE">Macadangdang</span>
that the jeep had been found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then
tried to contact <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> but the latter had gone to <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So he
proceeded to the place, where he was able to locate <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Questioned as to the identity of the jeep's
passenger whom <span class="SpellE">Bagaoisan</span> described when they met in <span class="SpellE">Batac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> was at first
hesitant but Later on named <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bagaoisan</span> then informed the PC head­quarters about his
findings and requested the commanding officer to impound the said jeep and to
pick up <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
for questioning.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the afternoon, <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span> and another unidentified person brought the jeep to
the PC headquarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span> was investigated he admitted that he was the owner
of said jeep, but claimed that it had been stolen from him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That evening <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
was apprehended by the PC, but he denied any participation in the
robbery-killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However when the Chief
of Police of <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> was summoned he positively
identified <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> to be the jeep's passenger who
shouted at him during the chase the previous night.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, May 16, <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span> went
back to the PC headquarters and executed a sworn statement (Exhibit "1- <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span>") stating, among other things, that he was the
owner of the jeep with plate number J-22274, S-63; that he lent it to <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> at about 6:30
o'clock in the evening of May 14, 1963; that when <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
failed to return the jeep that same evening he, <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span>,
went to see <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span>
in San Nicolas on the pretext of inquiring whether the latter had taken it;
that he resorted to the foregoing pre­text because he was afraid <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> might get angry with him for lending away his jeep
although they had previously agreed to use it in their scheduled trip to <span class="SpellE">Abra</span> that night; that he and <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span>
went to the San Nicolas municipal hall and reported the supposed loss of the
vehicle that from there <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> contacted the
policeman on duty in <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> by phone and requested him
to impound the said jeep if it should pass that way; that he, <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Macadangdang</span> went to <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> later that same night to make inquiries regarding the
jeep; that at about 7:00 o'clock in the morning of May 15, 1963 he found the
jeep parked near his wife's boarding house in <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>;
that after he was informed that it was the suspected get­away vehicle used by
the persons who had robbed the Chinese store in <span class="SpellE">Batac</span>
on May 14, he was constrained to reveal to <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span>
that the jeep had in fact been borrowed by <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
and that it had not really been lost.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, May 16, <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> gave a written statement (Exhibit "I"),
which was sworn to before Judge <span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span> Ortega of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, wherein

declared among other things, that <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> was the master­mind; that he had three (3)
companions, one of them a woman, but did not know their names although he could
recognize them if presented to him; that he and his companions used the jeep of
<span class="SpellE">Jovencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span> in going to
<span class="SpellE">Batac</span>, with himself doing the driving; that while in <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> he was left behind by his companions to guard the
jeep; that when his companions returned they loaded something on it, after

</span>After the preliminary in­vestigation the corresponding warrants of
arrest were issued against the two named accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No bail was fixed for their temporary
liberty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second stage of the
preliminary investigation was waived by them, and the case was remanded to the

<p class="BODY">When the case was called for arraignment on <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1963</st1:date>, all accused were present except <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> Mending, who was still at large.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon petition of accused <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Julio <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Constante</span> <span class="SpellE">Cachuela</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span> <span class="SpellE">Topinio</span>, the trial court
appointed Attys. Santiago <span class="SpellE">Rañada</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sixto</span>
Pedro, Herman Coloma and Guillermo Passion as their counsel de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span>, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To give them time to go over the records of the case and to confer with
their respective clients, the trial Judge suspended the proceed­ing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the case was called anew, all the
accused, as­sisted by their respective counsel pleaded "not
guilty".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an order issued on the
same day the trial court set the hearing of the case for August 8, 9, and 10,
1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, upon motion of the
Provincial Fiscal dated August 2, the trial was postponed to August 27 and 28.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the prosecution could present its evidence on the first
day of hearing, August 27.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> and Julio <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span>, through their respective counsel, moved that they
be permitted to withdraw their former plea of "not guilty" and to
substitute it with that of "guilty".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court granted the motion and upon being arraigned anew the two
accused pleaded "guilty" to the charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Con­sidering, however, that the plea was to a
capital offense the trial court withheld judgment until after the presenta­tion
of the evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the course of the trial, <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span> <span class="SpellE">Topinio</span> was discharged as defendant and utilized as witness
for the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In substance her
testimony is as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1963</st1:date> she played mahjong in
the house of one Mateo Reyes in <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
she was about to leave the place <span class="SpellE">Constante</span> <span class="SpellE">Cachuela</span> came and confided to her that he and his
companions were planning to rob the house of <span class="SpellE">Ko</span> <span class="SpellE">Pian</span> in <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> and that they
needed her cooperation because she was a known friend of the Chinaman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, she told <span class="SpellE">Cachuela</span>
that she was afraid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After their
conversation, she left the place.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the following day <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span> met <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> in front of the
Tobacco Monopoly monument at the public plaza and the latter inquired from her
whether <span class="SpellE">Cachuela</span> had gone to her house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She answered no, but added that <span class="SpellE">Cachuela</span> did tell her something at the mahjong place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> then asked
her whether she had agreed, and she replied she had not because she was
afraid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before parting <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> told her that he would send <span class="SpellE">Cachuela</span>
to her house so that they could talk about the matter again.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="5">May 2, 1963</st1:date>,
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">eight o'clock</st1:time> in the morning,
<span class="SpellE">Cachuela</span> and <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> went to <span class="SpellE">Conchita's</span>
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cachuela</span>
introduced <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> and reiterated to her what she
had been told at the mahjong place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
she insisted that she was afraid to cooperate, they threatened her with death.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next morning, May 3, <span class="SpellE">Cachuela</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, together with Julio <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Jovencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span> and <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Manding</span> returned to <span class="SpellE">Conchita's</span> house and advised her that they were going to <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> on that day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At past six in the evening the group composed of <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Julio <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Jovencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span>, <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Manding</span> and <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span> <span class="SpellE">Topinio</span> proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> in a jeep driven by <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cachuela</span> had
declined to go with them on the pretext that he was known in <span class="SpellE">Batac</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span> knew why they
were going to <span class="SpellE">Batac</span>, as she was at <span class="SpellE">Conchita's</span> house the first time <span class="SpellE">Cachuela</span>
came.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On their way, her companions
talked about how they could enter the store and how they could get out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they reached <span class="SpellE">Batac</span>
she pointed to them the house of the Chinaman.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She also showed them the door at the back of the store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jovencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span>, who was at the wheel, said that there was an exit
westward, and forthwith drove in that direction, then turned south of the
municipal hall, and circled back again to the rear of the store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having reconnoitered the place, the group returned
to <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the way they passed near the house of certain Dr. <span class="SpellE">Aoigan</span>,
and <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
remarked that said house had recently been robbed but that it should not give
them cause for worry because the culprits were his companions and were still at
large.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About one kilometer farther on
the way, <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> asked <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span>
to stop the jeep for a while and said that once they were inside the store they
should not touch anything in order not to leave fingerprints by which they
could be identified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next morning, <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> and Julio <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span> went to her house and showed her a sketch of the
store of the Chinaman in relation to the national road and the public
market.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before leaving, they told her
that they would commit the robbery on <st1:date year="1963" day="9" month="5">May
 9, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the last mentioned date, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">six o'clock</st1:time> in the evening, <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Jovencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span>, Julio <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Manding</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span> <span class="SpellE">Topinio</span> left for <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> in a jeep driven by <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On their way <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> were told not to touch anything in the
store, nor carry any handkerchiefs which might be left at the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they arrived in <span class="SpellE">Batac</span>
the store of the Chinaman was already closed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon instruction of <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span> got off the
jeep and knocked at the door, but no response came from inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> then
decided that they should leave and return on <st1:date year="1963" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, when the day came the plan could not be carried out because
there was no available jeep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
postponed its execution to May 14.</p>

<p class="BODY">Between <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">eleven o'clock</st1:time>

<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> went to <span class="SpellE">Conchita's</span>
house and reminded her about their scheduled trip to <span class="SpellE">Batac</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was instructed to go to his boarding
house at <st1:time minute="30" hour="17">5:30 o'clock</st1:time> in the
afternoon with <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they arrived there they were met by
Julio <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a while, <span class="SpellE">Jovencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Manding</span>
arrived in a jeep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Julio <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> and <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span> joined them
in the jeep and they proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Batac</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Near the public market <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> were ordered to get off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They entered the market through the southern
gate and then proceeded to the western gate in front of <span class="SpellE">Ko</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pian's</span> store, where they stayed for a while.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the Chinaman would not let them enter
his place without pre­vious notice, <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span> sent <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> to the store to buy "<span class="SpellE">chicklet</span>"
and to inform him that they were already there and would pass through the back
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>
came back she told <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span> that <span class="SpellE">Ko</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pian</span> had agreed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The two girls then repaired to the rear of the store and sought cover
near the fence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a while <span class="SpellE">Ko</span> <span class="SpellE">Pian</span> let them in and the three
of them went upstairs together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
China­man and <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> entered his bedroom, leaving <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span> outside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The two remained inside the bedroom for about ten minutes, and as soon
as they came out the three went downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Ko</span> <span class="SpellE">Pian</span> opened the
door to let them out, and it was then that <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, followed by Julio <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Manding</span>,
suddenly barged in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
covered <span class="SpellE">Ko</span> <span class="SpellE">Pian's</span> mouth
with his hand while <span class="SpellE">Manding</span> held him by the
body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span>
then stabbed the helpless victim in the neck with a double-bladed weapon, after
which they laid him on the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> then stabbed him several times with an ice
pick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wounded man, moaning and
bleeding, was left to die in that posi­tion, while <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span> carted away a steel safe and loaded it on
the jeep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They tried to bring out the
other safe also but were not able to lift it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They then took two axes from the store and after pushing the girls
inside the jeep, they sped away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
original plan was to open the safe near the river in <span class="SpellE">Sarrat</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, but on the highway they were pursued by
another jeep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tolen­tino</span>
ordered <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span> to drive faster, but the other vehicle
was able to close the distance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> then told <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span> to
slow down, and when the other jeep was already abreast he leaned outside and
shouted at the driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that moment <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span> stepped on the gas and left the other jeep
behind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they heard a gunshot, <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> loaded his gun and warned his companions to get
ready, but the pursuit was not pressed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon reaching the town of <st1:city><st1:place>San Nicolas</st1:place></st1:city>
the group took a <span class="SpellE">sideroad</span> where their jeep developed
engine trouble and stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had to
push it until the motor started again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When they arrived at a place north of the provincial capitol in <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>, the two girls asked permission to get off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tabios</span> agreed and
added that he would report that his jeep had been stolen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two girls then went to a restaurant to
eat.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition to the testimonies of its witnesses, the prosecution
submitted as evidence, among others, Exhibit "I", the sworn statement
of <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> dated May 16, 1963; Exhibit
"J", the sworn statement of Julio <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span>;
Exhibit "K", the sworn statement of <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span>; Exhibit "B", the jeep with plate
No. 22274; Exhibit "F", the door of the steel safe Exhibit
"F-1", the metal box of the safe; and Exhibit "E", one of
the axes taken from the store of the Chinaman.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Nolasco's</span>
defense is that she was not aware of the criminal intent of her co-accused when
they went to <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> on <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="5">May 14, 1963</st1:date> and that her purpose in going there was
merely to verify the result of her application as a salesgirl in <span class="SpellE">Ko</span> <span class="SpellE">Pian's</span> store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She denied the truth of most of the answers
given by her in her sworn statement (Exhibit "K") and said that she
signed it twice, first at the barracks and later at the office of the
Provincial Fiscal, because the Constabulary soldiers threatened to rape her if
she did not do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">On his part, <span class="SpellE">Jovencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span> testified that he was not aware of any plan on the
part of his co-accused to commit the said crime, nor did he participate in its
commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While admitting that he was
the one who drove his jeep on which <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Manding</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Topinio</span> rode on May
3, 9 and 14, 1963, he alleged that <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> had
hired his jeep only to go out on dates with girls, paying him the sum of P20.00
per trip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further claimed that he
came to know for the first time that some­body had been killed by <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> and his companions when he was driving the jeep
back to <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>.</p>

respective alibis, and were acquitted on reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, his counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
avers that the trial court erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in
denying the motion of his counsel de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span> for time
to prepare for trial - an error or irregularity <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of his constitutional right to due process; (2) in admitting his plea of
guilty, which was given improvidently; and (3) in imposing upon him the penalty
of death.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Julio <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span> joins <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> in his third assignment of error.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the first assigned error, <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
contends that considering the repeated manifestations of his counsel that he
was not prepared to enter into trial, the Court's actuation in continuing with
the hearing of the case on August 27, 1963, which resulted in his hurried and
impro­vident plea of guilty, was clearly an abuse of discretion prejudicial to
his rights as provided in Section 5 Rule 116 and Section 7, Rule 118 of the
Rules of Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
He maintains that the plea of his counsel for a separate trial was an implied
request for postponement and should have been granted, or that the court, even <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>,
should have postponed the trial in accordance with Section 2, Rule 119,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the <span class="SpellE">unpreparedness</span> of counsel being a valid ground <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears from the record that on July 8,
1963 the trial court appointed Atty. Santiago <span class="SpellE">Rañada</span>,
Sr. as <span class="SpellE">Tolentino's</span> counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>; that on the same date, with the assistance
of said counsel, he entered the plea of "not guilty"; that on July
30, 1963 Atty. Loreto U. Bautista formally entered his appearance also as
counsel for the same appellant; and that on August 27, 1963 trial was
started.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, the appellant had
more than two days as provided for in the Rules, to prepare for trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His counsel even admitted that he was given
fifteen (15) days to study the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the circumstances, even if an express request for postponement had
been made, the trial court would not have erred in denying the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the second assigned error, the appellant claims
that the trial court did not sufficiently or adequately explain to him the
meaning and consequences of a plea of guilty to the offense charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim is unfounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears from the transcript of
stenographic notes that after conferring with his client Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rañada</span> manifested that the latter decided to plead guilty
to the charge reserving his right to prove mitigating circumstances at the
proper time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, the trial court
questioned the appellant thus:</p>

<blockquote>"COURT to ACCUSED ANSELMO
TOLENTINO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
speak English, you heard the manifestation of your counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your counsel is praying permission for you to
be allowed to withdraw your former plea of not guilty and substitute it to that

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,

imprisonment to death?</blockquote>

law?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
you are willing to withdraw your former plea of not guilty to substitute it for
that of guilty?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Make of record that the

<p class="BODY">Considering that the appellant was assisted by counsel and that
he was a college student at that time, we are convinced that the explanation
made by the court as to the meaning and consequences of a plea of guilty was
sufficient, and that he entered his plea with full knowledge of its
significance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plea was made on <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1963</st1:date>, and sentence was
promulgated on <st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the intervening period of three years
he could have complained to the court that his plea had been improvidently
made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not do so; on the contrary,
there appears in the record a letter dated <st1:date year="1964" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1964</st1:date>, addressed by him to the Presiding
Judge, pleading for a "humanitarian decision" inasmuch as he had
pleaded guilty to the charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant suggests that at the time he pleaded the trial
court entertained a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The suggestion has no basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact the court did not even fix bail for
his temporary liberty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over, when
the appellant offered to plead guilty to the lesser offense of homicide the
court turned him down, "considering the facts and circumstances appearing
on the record of the case."</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the third assignment of error the two appellants <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> and Julio <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span> first contend that the trial court should not have
considered the aggravating circumstances of "use of motor vehicle" in
the determination of the penalty to be imposed because the same was not alleged
in the information as a means by which the crime of robbery with homicide was
committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They point out that the
information merely alleged that a motor vehicle was used by the accused in
carrying away the personal properties belonging to the victim, and that by then
the offense had already been consummated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They maintain that the use of motor vehicle after the commission of the
crime is not what the law<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
considers as an aggravating cir­cumstance but rather its use as a means to
commit the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The information recites that the crime was committed with several
aggravating circumstances one of which was "use of motor vehicle.” Since a
plea of guilty admits all the material averments in the information including
the aggravating circumstances alleged therein,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
the appellants cannot now question the actuation of the trial court in appre­ciating
"use of motor vehicle" as an aggravating circums­tance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it has been established during the
trial that the accused used the motor vehicle in going to the place of the
crime in carrying away the effects thereof, and in facilitating their escape.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two appellants claim that the trial court mis­applied Article
63, paragraphs 2 and 4 of the Revised Penal Code<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
by offsetting only the aggravating circums­tance of treachery (which according
to the trial court absorbed "nighttime" and "superior
strength") with the mitigating circumstance of "plea of guilty,"
leaving the aggravating circumstance of "use of motor vehicle" to
justify the imposition of the death penalty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They main­tain that said plea should have been weighed against both
aggravating circumstances, considering its importance and moral value.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no error in the application of the article cited by the
appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts of the case
particularly the manner the victim was repeatedly stabbed and the utter
senselessness of the killing itself show the correctness of the court's
ruling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since there is still one
aggravating circumstance left the penalty of death was properly imposed by the
trial court on the two appellants.</p>

OF JOVENCIO TABIOS<o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">In his brief appellant <span class="SpellE">Jovencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span> alleges that the trial court erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in finding him guilty of the crime of
robbery with homicide and (2) in sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> with the accessories prescribed by
law to pay jointly and severally with his co-accused <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Julio <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span>, alias <span class="SpellE">Tessie</span>, the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Ko</span> <span class="SpellE">Pian</span> the sum of P5,216.00 representing the value of the
properties allegedly taken and the additional sum of P6,000.00 for the death of
said <span class="SpellE">Ko</span> <span class="SpellE">Pian</span>; and to pay
the proportional costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">This appellant contends that the prosecution has failed to
establish by strong, clear and convincing evidence that he participated in the
conspiracy to commit the crime of robbery with homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to him the only evidence against
him on this point is the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span> <span class="SpellE">Topinio</span>, which does not deserve the credence accorded to it
by the trial court because the witness was herself a co-conspirator, and a
woman of low morals besides.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial
court did not overlook the so-called questionable morals of the state witness
nor the fact of her being a co-conspirator.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"In the evaluation of the evidence for the prosecution, this
Court is aware of the low morality of witness <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Topinio</span> alias <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Chita</span></st1:place></st1:city> and of her being a
co-conspirator in the com­mission of the crime charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How­ever, after examining her testimony with
a jealous care and with a watch­ful scrutiny, the Court finds it consistent in
its details and harmoni­zes so well with the surrounding cir­cumstances, and it
is further corroborated not only by the interlocking confession and/or
admission of accused <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
Julio <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Jovencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span> alias <span class="SpellE">Tessie</span> (Exhibit

"I"; "1-Espejo; "J" and "K") but also by
other evidence on record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her testimony
deserves full credence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is a settled rule that where the issue is one of credibility
of witnesses, appellate courts will generally not disturb the findings of the
trial court, considering that it is in a better position to decide the
question, having heard the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment
and manner of testifying during the trial, unless it has plainly overlooked
certain facts of substance and value that if considered, might affect the
result of the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
In the instant case we find no cogent reason to disagree with the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to appellant <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span>' participation
in the conspiracy the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span> <span class="SpellE">Topinio</span> finds corroboration in the interlocking confessions
of appellant Julio <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span>, showing that on May 3, 1963, said appellant
drove his jeep with them to and from <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> for the
purpose of surveying the scene of the projected robbery; that on their way to <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> they discussed how they could enter the store and how
they could get out; that appellant even told his companions about an exit
westward and in fact drove the jeep in that direction; that on the night of May
9, he again drove his jeep to <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> with <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Topinio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Manding</span> as his companions for the purpose of carrying out
their plan but failed to do so because the Chinaman did not open the door of
his store; that on May 14, the same group went to <span class="SpellE">Batac</span>
again on appellant's jeep, some of them armed with an ice pick, a bladed weapon
and a pistol; that all of them fully understood what each had to do; that
appellant parked his jeep about 100 meters from the store, ready to pick up his
companions at a moment's notice; that when he was fetched by <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span> he drove his jeep towards the rear of the store to
load the articles taken <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, and that he drove
the jeep in escaping from the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus the appellant's participation in the
conspiracy has been fully established.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case of People, vs. Estrada,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"To establish conspiracy, it is not necessary to prove
previous agree­ment to commit a crime if there is proof that the malefactors
have acted in concert and in pursuance of the same objective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has repeatedly decided that
conspiracy may be inferred from the acts of the accused themselves when such
acts point to a joint purpose and design.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their action must be judged by what they do and not altogether by what
they say; for what men do is the best index of their intention."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Tabios</span> now contends that even granting
that he was aware of the plan of his co-accused to commit the crime of robbery,
he should not be held liable for the crime of robbery with homicide because the
killing of the Chinaman was not a part of the conspiracy, invoking the case of
People vs. <span class="SpellE">Basisten</span>, et al., 47 Phil. 493, where­in
this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"Where it appears that only one of the defendants committed
homicide at the time of perpetrating the robbery, said homicide not having been
the sub­ject of the conspiracy, nor the others having had any intervention in
said homicide, the author of the homicide is the only one responsible for the
complex crime of robbery in band with homicide, the other defendants being
responsible only for the robbery in band."</blockquote>

where the accused also invoked the ruling in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Basisten</span>,
this Court rejected his view, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"We do not share appellant's view, in this respect; for as
early as 1926, one year after We enunciated the ruling in the <span class="SpellE">Basisten</span> case <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;

v. <span class="SpellE">Macalalad</span>, 9 Phil. 1, in the following
language:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The Supreme
Court of Spain, interpreting the provisions of the Penal Code touching the
complex crime of ROBO CON HOMICIDIO, has frequently decided that, where the
complex crime has been committed, <u>all those who took part as principals in
the commission of the robbery are guilty as principals in the commission of the
crime of ROBO CON HOMICIDIO</u>, unless it appears that they endeavored to
prevent the unlawful killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Decisions
of the Supreme Court of Spain, April 30 and <st1:date year="1872" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1872</st1:date>, and <st1:date year="1890" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1890</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>See

<p class="2Q">‘x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> Whenever a homicide has been
committed as a consequence or on the occasion of a robbery, all those who took
part as principals in the commission of the robbery will also be held guilty as

not actually take part in the homicide</u>, unless it clearly appeared that
they endeavored to prevent the homicide (U.S. <span class="SpellE">Macalalad</span>,

<p class="BODY">The same ruling was applied in many subsequent cases, among them
People vs. <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span>, G. R. No. L-22518 (Jan. 17,
1968), where this Court held that while the appellants therein might not have
participated in the slaying of the victims, nevertheless, they were liable for
the crime actually committed, for the rule is settled that when homicide takes
place as a consequence or on the occasion of a robbery, all of those who took
part in the robbery shall be guilty as principals of the complex crime of
robbery with homicide, unless there is proof that they had endeavored to
prevent the killing, citing the cases of People vs. de la Rosa, 90 Phil. 365;
People vs. <span class="SpellE">Libre</span>, 93 Phil. 5: U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Macalalad</span>, 9 Phil. 1; U.S. vs. Santos, 4 Phil. 189.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same ruling was reiterated in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pujinio</span>, G.

<p class="BODY">Since it has been established that the appellant in the instant
case was a co-conspirator and that he performed overt acts in furtherance of
the conspiracy the lower court correctly held that he was liable for the crime
of robbery with homicide as a co-principal.</p>

<p class="BODY">When a group of malefactors conspire to commit robbery and arm
themselves for the purpose, no member of the group may disclaim responsibility
for any act of violence that is perpetrated by reason or on the occasion of the
robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such violence is always
reasonably to be expected either to overcome active opposition or to forestall
it altogether by disabling the victim at the very outset, or even to silence
him completely thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
instant case the group that set out for <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> to rob <span class="SpellE">Ko</span> <span class="SpellE">Pian</span> was provided with lethal
weapons - a dagger, an ice pick and a gun.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These instruments were intended to facilitate the commission of the
robbery, and if their use resulted in homicide, the liability <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> attaches to the entire group.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only exception recognized in the
decisions of this Court presumably drawing an analogy with the situation
provided for in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 296 of the
Revised Penal Code, concerning robbery by a band, is when a co-conspirator in
the crime of robbery tried to prevent the homicide or the other acts of
violence committed by reason or on the occasion of the robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In robbery by a band punished under the said
Article, of course, proof of conspiracy is not required so as to hold all
members of the band liable for any of the assaults committed on the occasion of
the robbery, whereas such proof is necessary where several accused, not
constituting a band, are charged with the offense of robbery with homicide
under Article 294.</p>

<p class="BODY">With this view we take of the case of appellant <span class="SpellE">Jovencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span>, strictly
speaking he should suffer the same penalty as that imposed upon <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> and Julian <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some
members of the Court, however, are of the opinion that a distinction should be
made as far as the penalty is concerned, considering that <span class="SpellE">Tabios</span>
al­though co-conspirator, was not in the immediate scene of the crime but
guarding the jeep some distance away, and had no direct hand in the killing of
the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For lack of the required
number of votes to impose the maximum penalty, that meted out by the trial
court on this appellant stands affirmed.</p>

portion thereof; and (3) in not dismissing the case upon motion of the defense

<p class="BODY">Knowing the plan as she did she still went with the group, and

<p class="BODY">In the computation of the penalty to be imposed on appellant <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span>, the trial court
