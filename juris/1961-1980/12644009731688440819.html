convicted by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> for 
robbery with homicide under Paragraph 1, Article 294, <span class="GramE">Revised</span> Penal Code.</p>
<p>As found by the trial court, the facts are: At about seven o'clock of 
Saturday evening, December 29, 1956, <span class="SpellE">Amiril</span> <span class="SpellE">Asmawil</span> went looking for <span class="SpellE">Sanadi</span> 
<span class="SpellE">fiakon</span> in the house of the latter's first wife, <span class="SpellE">Pullong</span>, located in <span class="SpellE">Tipo-tipo</span>, 
municipal district of <span class="SpellE">Talipao</span>, province of <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>. <span class="SpellE">Sanadi's</span> daughter, Anti, who 
was then with <span class="SpellE">Halid</span> <span class="SpellE">Majid</span> in 
the balcony of the house, informed accused that her father was in the 
neighboring house of <span class="SpellE">Anang</span>, his second wife. 
Thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Asmawil</span> went to <span class="SpellE">Anang's</span> house.</p>
<p><span class="SpellE">Sanadi</span> <span class="SpellE">Bakon</span> and <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Asmawil</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> 
subsequently came down from <span class="SpellE">Anang's</span> house and 
proceeded towards <span class="SpellE">Pullong's</span> house. Upon reaching the 
gate, which was more than three fathoms from the balcony, <span class="SpellE">Sanadi</span> called <span class="SpellE">Halid</span> <span class="SpellE">Majid</span> to open it. <span class="SpellE">Halid</span> <span class="SpellE">Majid</span> got a key and descended the stairs to open the gate, 
but, before he could do so, <span class="SpellE">Asmawil</span> hacked <span class="SpellE">Bakon</span> with a barong, hitting him across the breast. The 
victim fell backward. <span class="SpellE">Asmawil</span> then picked up the .45 
caliber pistol which <span class="SpellE">Bagon</span> held in his hand and ran 
away with it Anti and <span class="SpellE">Halid</span> <span class="SpellE">Majid</span> saw and recognized the accused by the light of a lamp 
in the balcony.</p>
<p><span class="SpellE">Haiid</span> <span class="SpellE">Majid</span> hurriedly 
took a barong from the house and, together with <span class="SpellE">Kamlon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sabdani</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abdulsail</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sawadi</span>, pursued 
<span class="SpellE">Amiril</span> <span class="SpellE">Asmawil</span>. They did not 
overtake him Anti rushed to her severely wounded father, who died before he 
could be brought inside the house.</p>
<p><span class="SpellE">Anang</span> and some companions reported the incident to 
Mayor <span class="SpellE">Usman</span> <span class="SpellE">Asgal</span> and the 
Philippine Constabulary in <span class="SpellE">Talipao</span>. At <st1:time hour="6" minute="20">6:20 a.m.</st1:time>, <st1:date month="12" day="30" year="1956">December 30, 1956</st1:date>, Philippine Constabulary soldiers 
headed by Lt; <span class="SpellE">Angal</span> P. Garcia arrived in the scene of 
the crime. They interrogated <span class="SpellE">Halid</span> <span class="SpellE">Majid</span> and <span class="SpellE">Anang</span> who informed them 
that it was <span class="SpellE">Amiril</span> <span class="SpellE">Asmawil</span> 
who killed <span class="SpellE">Sanadi</span> <span class="SpellE">Bakon</span> and 
robbed him of his pistol. Lt. Garcia sent to the Provincial Commander of <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> the following radiographic <span class="GramE">report</span>:</p>

<p><span class="SpellE">Sanadi</span> <span class="SpellE">Bakon</span> was buried 
on <st1:date month="12" day="30" year="1956">December 30, 1956</st1:date>. On 
the basis of affidavits executed on December 31 by <span class="SpellE">Halid</span> <span class="SpellE">MaIid</span> and <span class="SpellE">Anang</span> before Lt. Garcia, a criminal complaint was in the 
Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Talipao</span> against <span class="SpellE">Amiril</span> <span class="SpellE">Asmawil</span>. The accused 
pleaded not guilty and waived his right to the second stage of the preliminary 
investigation. After the records of the case were transmitted to the Court of 
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>, <span class="GramE">an 
information</span> was filed therein against <span class="SpellE">Asmawil</span> 
for robbery with homicide.</p>
<p>After trial, or on <st1:date month="7" day="7" year="1961">July 7, 
1961</st1:date>, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> rendered the following 
judgment:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"<b>WHEREFORE</b>, the accused, AMIRIL ASMAWIL, is hereby found guilty beyond 
reasonable doubt of the crime of ROBBERY WITH HOMICIDE, defined and penalized in 
Paragraph 1, Article 294, <span class="GramE">Revised</span> Penal Code. He should 
be, as he is hereby, sentenced to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA, with 
all the accessory penalties of the law; to indemnify the heirs of the deceased, 
Councilor <span class="SpellE">Sanadi</span> <span class="SpellE">Bakon</span>, In 
the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, without subsidiary imprisonment 
in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs."</p></blockquote>
<p>The accused has appealed to this Court.</p>
<p>Appellant's defense is alibi which he tried to prove with his own testimony 
that at about the time the crime was committed, he was at his house in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lambayong</span>, about four 
kilometers from the scene of the crime; that he never left home that evening; 
that he came to know, from his mother, of the death of <span class="SpellE">Sanadi</span> <span class="SpellE">Bakon</span> on December 30; and 
that he attended the funeral of <span class="SpellE">Sanadi</span> <span class="SpellE">Bakon</span>.</p>
<p>As a rule, alibi is a weak defense since it is easy to concoct. Courts view 
it with caution and accept it only if proved by positive, clear and satisfactory 
evidence. <span class="GramE">(U.S. v. <span class="SpellE">Olais</span>, 36 Phil. 
828; People v. <span class="SpellE">Pili</span>, 51 Phil. 965; People v. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, 76 Phil. 265, People v. Bautista, L-17772, Oct. 31 
1962.)</span> Alibi cannot prevail over the clear, explicit and positive 
identification of the accused by credible witnesses. <span class="GramE">(People 
vs. <span class="SpellE">Palomos</span>, 49 Phil. 601; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Rafanan</span>, L-13289, Sept. 29, 1962.)</span> Accordingly, the 
uncorroborated testimony of appellant in support of his alibi cannot be given 
credence in the face of his clear and positive identification by prosecution 
witnesses Anti and <span class="SpellE">Halid</span> <span class="SpellE">Majid</span>. Prosecution witnesses also stated that they did not 
see appellant in the funeral of <span class="SpellE">Sanadi</span> <span class="SpellE">Bakon</span> and that if he were there he could have been killed by 
the relatives of the deceased.</p>
<p>Appellant would impugn the credibility of Anti and <span class="SpellE">Halid</span> <span class="SpellE">Majid</span>, stating that being 
blood relatives of the deceased they were interested in the success of the 
prosecution. Suffice it to state in this regard that this Court has ruled that 
where no improper motive—such as personal grudge against the accused—has been 
shown, relationship to the victim does not render the clear and positive 
testimony of witnesses less worthy of full faith and credit. <span class="GramE">(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Valera</span>, L-15662, August 30, 
1962.)</span></p>
<p>This Court, moreover, will not interfere with the conclusion of the trial 
court concerning the credibility of witnesses, in the absence of a showing that 
some fact or circumstance of weight and influence in the record was overlooked 
or misapplied, or its significance misunderstood by the court (U.S. v. <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span>, 17 Phil. 295; U.S. v. Estrada, 24 Phil. 401).</p>
<p><span class="SpellE">Anang</span>, testifying for the defense, repudiated her 
affidavit of <st1:date month="12" day="31" year="1956">December 31, 
1956</st1:date>. Appellant emphatically relies upon this repudiation to press 
for the reversal of the judgment. However, such disavowal took place after she 
married appellant and after she attempted to bribe <span class="SpellE">Halid</span> <span class="SpellE">Majid</span> to recant. She stated 
in her affidavit that she saw appellant cut down her husband and that the 
latter, while cradled in her arms and dying, told her that it was appellant who 
hacked him. It is not strange, therefore, that having subsequently married 
appellant, she should choose to defend him and repudiate her affidavit. Such a 
repudiation, however, cannot overcome the testimonies of Anti and <span class="SpellE">Halid</span> <span class="SpellE">Majid</span> that they saw 
appellant commit the offense in question.</p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs 
against appellant. </p>
<p><b>IT IS SO ORDERED.</b></p>
