First Instance of Manila, in its Civil Case No. 62264, dismissing, upon motion,
appellant's complaint against the Republic and the Bureau of Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service, on the ground of non-suability of
defendants.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Subrogated to the rights of the consignee, <span class="SpellE">Sillicons</span>
Manufacturing Company, the appellant, Union Insurance Society of Canton, Ltd.,
brought action to re足cover P42<span class="GramE">,370.30</span>, as the value of
135 coils of copper wire unloaded from the vessel "Eastern Star" on <st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="9">27 September 1964</st1:date> and allegedly lost
while in posses足sion of the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service
by negligence of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
defendants pleaded (a) that the complaint: was based on a money claim against
the Republic, which is immune from suit without its consent, neither the Bureau
of Customs nor the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service being
juridical persons that can be parties to any suit, but mere dependencies of the
Republic; and (b) that, under section 902 of the "Tariff and Customs Code,
the "Government assumes no legal responsibility in respect to the
safekeeping of articles stored in any customs or bonded ware足house".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court below having upheld defendants'
motion to dismiss, plaintiff insurance company appealed to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue of the Republic's non-suability for acts of the Customs
<span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> personnel raised in the <span class="GramE">appeal,</span>
is not new.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was extensively
considered and discussed in Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc., vs. Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service, 17 December 1966, 18 S. C. R. A. 1121,
where the Republic's immunity was upheld, and the doctrine has been uniformly
reiterated repeatedly since then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
cases are collated in the annotations at 18 S. C. R. A., pages 1127, <span class="GramE">et</span>, seq.; 21 S. C. R. A. 428.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>See also <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span>
(Phil.) Inc. vs. Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service, <st1:date year="1967" day="26" month="12">26 December 1967</st1:date>, and numerous cases
therein cited.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principles and rulings of the previous cases equally govern
the one at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing here
that would justify a deviation from a <span class="GramE">doctrine</span> so
uniformly and firmly established.</p>

affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs
