				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On August 29, 1962, the City of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
passed Resolu­tion No. 732 declaring as officially and legally existing,
pursuant to Republic Act 2370, the several barrios of the city.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among these were barrios <span class="SpellE">Agdao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bucana</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pobla­cion</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, barrio <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span>, also
called barrio Central, claiming that it was created under Section 27 of the
Code of Mindanao and <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>, asked from <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City for its alleged 10% share in taxes collected on
real <span class="GramE">property</span> located within the barrio, as provided
in Section 23 of Republic Act 3590.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City's Treasurer, however, re­fused to release the
share for said barrio, on the ground that the amount pertaining to said barrio,
in relation to those of barrios <span class="SpellE">Agdao</span> and <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Bucana</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span>
cannot be determined, because the respective boundaries of said barrios were
not yet fixed as required by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Stated otherwise, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City's stand
was that the amount covering the 10% share of these three barrios com­bined has
been allocated, but it cannot be determined how much thereof pertains to each
of said barrios, because their boundaries not having been fixed as regards each
other, it could not be determined <span style="">how
much of the taxes </span>were collected from real properties located in each of
the three aforesaid barrios, taken separately.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September <span style="">3, </span>1964,
however, the Secretary of Fi­nance, acting on the request of the same barrio
Central or <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span> for release of its 10% share in
real proper­ty taxes, stated that barrios <span class="SpellE">Agdao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bucana</span> were crea­ted only in 1963 in violation of Republic
Act 2370 that prohibited creation of barrios out of chartered cities, so that
said barrios are not recognized under Republic Act <span style="">3590 </span>providing for the abovementioned share of 10% in realty
taxes. Accordingly, he ruled that the allocated 10% share of taxes for barrios <span class="SpellE">Agdao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bucana</span> and Central should
accrue and be given to Barrio Central only, after all conditions <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> are met.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 2, <span style="">1964, </span>barrio
Central filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>,
thru its barrio captain, a petition for declaratory relief with mandamus,
against <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Davao</span></span><span style=""> City's </span>Treasurer, Council, Auditor
and Mayor, alleg­ing the facts mentioned earlier in this decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among others, the petition questioned the
legality of Resolution No. <span style="">732 </span>of
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">Davao</span></span><span style=""> City's </span>Council creating barrios <span class="SpellE">Agdao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bucana</span>; the actuations
of the Auditor in passing in audit an alleged expenditure of P50<span class="GramE">,000</span> out of the 10% fund; and the failure of the council to
delimit the territorial boundaries of the three barrios concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it prayed that the court order payment to
petitioner by respondents of its 10% share in realty taxes as provided by
Republic Act <span style="">3590, </span>declare <span style="">illegal </span>the creation of barrios <span class="SpellE">Agdao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bucana</span>, and prohibit
the Auditor from approving expenditures out of <span style="">its </span>10% share.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents moved to <span style="">dismiss
</span>but their motion was de­nied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
January 29, <span style="">1965, </span>respondents
answered, stating among other averments, that barrio Central is inexistent or
not a part of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City; that there are other
barrios <span style="">claiming </span>the 10% share
in real property taxes correspond­ing to the territory claimed by petitioner; <span style="">that Republic Act </span><span style="">3590 </span><span style="">providing for </span>the 10% share applies
only to bar­rios in municipalities and municipal districts, not to those <span style="">in cities; </span>and that the alleged
expenditure <span style="">in ques­tion was legal and </span>not
taken from the 10% share allocated for barrios.</p>

<p class="BODY">After <span style="">issues were </span>thus
joined the case was set for <span style="">trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="8"><span style="">August 2, </span>1965</st1:date>,
however, the Court, upon motion <span style="">of the
Fiscal, dismissed </span>the case without prejudice, on the ground that the
issues were rendered academic by the passage of Republic Act 4354, on <st1:date year="1965" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1965</st1:date>, amending the Charter
of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner, having failed in its motion for reconsideration, took the
present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At issue is the legal
question </span>or <span style="">the propriety or
correctness of the </span><span style="">dismissal </span><span style="">order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Republic Act 4354, in Section 2, enumerated the bar­rios
comprising the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner barrio <span class="SpellE">Cenral</span>
or <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span> was not mentioned therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, there <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
arises the conclusion that said law abolished barrio Central as part of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Expressio</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>unius</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><u>est</u></span></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>exclusio</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>alterius</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> had sufficient <span style="">and </span>tenable reason to<span style=""> </span>dismiss the suit in<span style=""> </span>the <span style="">face </span>of said <span style="">law, </span>for
being academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A non-existent barrio,
or a barrio not situated in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, cannot present a claim
against it or its officials for a share in taxes un­der Republic Act <span style="">3570.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Said
law must be presumed, until squarely challenged and declared by the courts to
be other­wise, as constitutional, especially because the power to create or
abolish municipal corporations resides in Con­gress (<span class="SpellE">Mendenilla</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Onandia</span>, L-17803, June 30, 1962).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner may of course assail the
constitutionality of <span style="">said </span><span style="">new </span><span style="">law. </span>The present suit, however, is not
for that <span style="">purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in </span>the pleadings questions <span style="">said l</span><span style="">aw's validity, </span><span style="">for </span>the
reason that said law came after the <span style="">pleadings
</span>were joined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither was there <span style="">amendment to said pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span>court a quo therefore, rightly <span style="">dismissed the present suit, </span><u>without
prejudice</u>, that <span style="">is, </span>not
thereby precluding the filing of a suit to <span style="">assail </span>the <span style="">validity </span>of
Republic Act <span style="">4354.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
