				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by the Republic from the judgment of the Court of First
instance of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>
granting the petition of Leon Te <span class="SpellE">Poot</span>, a Chinese, for
naturalization as a ci­tizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our study of the record in the light of the errors assigned in <span class="GramE">appellants</span> brief shows that the contentions of appellant are
tenable in view of the following considerations:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The lower court did not acquire jurisdiction over the case in
view of petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> failure to file a
declaration of intention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> did not file a declaration of intention, and con­tended
that he was exempt <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> on the grounds that he
was born in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and that he completed his primary and secondary education in schools recog­nized
by the Philippine government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
trial petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> presented a certificate
from the Local Civil Registrar of Governor <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span>
(formerly <span class="SpellE">Siga­boy</span>), <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>,
stating that the record of births, covering June 28, 1933, the alleged date of
birth of Leon Te <span class="SpellE">Poot</span>, had been lost before the
war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In lieu of birth certificate,
petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> presented his Alien Certificate
of Registration and his Certificate of Re­sidence, both of which show that he
was born on <st1:date year="1933" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1933</st1:date>,
in <span class="SpellE">Sigaboy</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These documents are, however, hearsay evidence;
hence, not satisfactory to prove the fact of petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
birth in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Alfonso Po <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> King <u>vs</u>. Republic, L-20810, May 16, 1967; De
Lara <u>vs</u>. Republic, L-18203-04, May 29, 1964.)</span> The evi­dence
presented by one claiming exemption from the filing of a declaration of
intention must be clear and convincing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Apacible</span> <u>vs</u>.
Republic, L-16987, June 21, 1966.)</span> It is easy to understand why
petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> parents, or either of them,
were not presented as witnesses, for they could have been cross-examined on
this important point by the counsel for the Republic.</p>

<p class="BODY">To prove compliance with the educational require­ments,
petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> presented his high school diploma
from the Mindanao Colleges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also
presented a certificate from the Principal of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Chinese</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>High School</st1:placetype></st1:place> to the effect that he
studied in that school from Grade One to the First Year of high school; that
said school was recognized by the Philippine government; and that Philippine
civics, history and government were taught therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This certificate is hearsay evidence,
considering that the Principal who made it was never pre­sented as a witness in
court, thus depriving the State of the opportunity to cross-examine him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Boco</span> <u>vs</u>. Repub­lic, 85 Phil., 320.) While it is true
that Miguel de Cas­tro, one of petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
character witnesses, dec­lared in court that his son, a Filipino, had been a
class­mate of petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Chinese High School, and that there were some
Filipinos enrolled therein, it does not appear that the said school was
"regularly attended by a sizable number of Filipino students from whom
applicant could have imbibed Filipino customs and traditions." <span class="GramE">(Lee Ng Len <u>vs</u>. Republic, L-20151, March 31, 1965.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> having failed to
file a declara­tion of intention although he was not exempt <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
the court did not acquire jurisdiction over his petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Yap vs. Republic, L-12939,
July 31, 1951.)</span></p>

<p class="NUM">2. Petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> has not conducted
himself in a proper and irreproachable manner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He admitted using two names:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Leon
Te <span class="SpellE">Poot</span> and Te Bon <span class="SpellE">Beng</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his Alien Certificate of Registration and
in his Certificate of Residence issued by the Bureau of Immigration,
petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> name is "Leon Te <span class="SpellE">Poot</span>"; and it is not shown therein-that he is also
known by another name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His Certificate
of Nationality and his income tax returns for 1960 and 1961 are also in the
name of "Leon Te <span class="SpellE">Poot</span>" only; they do not
show any other name by which he is known.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In all his school records petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
name is "Te Bon <span class="SpellE">Beng</span>"; and it does not
appear therein that he was known also by another name while he was a
student.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
contends that his alias "Te Bon <span class="SpellE">Beng</span>" was
given to him by his parents when he was a child, hence, his use also of said
name was justified, citing People vs. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Jui</span> <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> (55 Off, <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>., No. 40, p. 8463).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <span class="SpellE">Kock</span> Tee Yap <u>vs</u>. Republic, L-20992,
May 14, 1966, where, as in the present case, the applicant used different names
on different oc­casions without mentioning the other names by which he was also
known, and where he claimed that one of his names was given to him by his
parents when he was a child, this Court held that the ruling in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Uy</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">Jui</span> <span class="SpellE">Pio</span></u> case was not applic­able, because there, the
petitioner always used the name by which he was generally known along with his
real name," namely, "<span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Jui</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pio</span>, alias <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">By using different names on different occasions with­out judicial
authority, thus violating the Anti-Alias Law (Comm. Act No. 142), petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> has failed to conduct himself in a proper and
irreproachable manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Kock</span> Tee Yap <u>vs</u>. Republic, <u>supra</u>.)<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="NUM">3. Petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> cannot be deemed
to have a lucrative trade, profession or lawful occupation for purposes of naturalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
he started working for his father in January, 1960, receiv­ing a monthly salary
of P200, which was increased to P250 in January, 1961, and to P300 in March of
the same year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claimed that aside
from the salary, his father furnished him free board and lodging.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged salary of peti­tioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was not supported by any payroll, time re­cord or
book of account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The absence of these or
similar documents (Yap <u>vs</u>. Republic, L-19832, August 23, 1966), considered
with the circumstance that petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
alleged employer was his own father, makes the claim of employment
suspicious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Chug <span class="SpellE">Siong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hua</span> <u>vs</u>. Republic,

<p class="BODY">Moreover, an applicant's qualifications for naturali­zation must
be determined as of the date of the filing of the application (0 Ku <span class="SpellE">Phuan</span> <u>vs</u>. Republic, L-23406, <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1967</st1:date>), and increases in earnings after
such filing cannot be taken into consideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Tan <u>vs</u>. Republic, L-22077, February 18, 1967) Considering,
therefore, Leon Te <span class="SpellE">Poot</span> filed his petition on
February 2, 1961 the privileges of free board and lodging, his alleged in­come
of P250 per month cannot be considered lucrative even though he is single, (<span class="SpellE">Sia</span> Paw <u>vs</u>.

was admittedly limited to the few times that he went to <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>

necessarily incompetent to declare, as he did declare, that "petitioner
