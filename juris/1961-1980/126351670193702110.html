				<BR><STRONG>MAKALINTAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The municipalities of Pasacao and Libmanan, both of the province
of Camarines Sur, are situated along the Ragay Gulf.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the coastal barrio of Tinalmud they are
separated by a river, which also divides their respective marine waters from
which they derive income by leasing the same to fishing concessionaires.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sometime in 1952 a dis­pute arose between
them when the municipality of Libmanan began claiming a certain portion of the
marine waters allegedly belonging to the municipality of Pasacao.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They agreed to refer the dispute to the
Provincial Board of Camarines Sur for decision.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board in turn referred the matter to a
commissioner for investigation and after the commissioner submitted his report
dated January 2, 1953, the Board, <span style="">on </span>February
13, 1954, approved Resolution No. 57 awarding the disputed area to the
Municipality of Libmanan.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 5, 1954 the municipality of Libmanan filed an ordinary
civil action (Civil Case No. 2631) against <span style="">the municipality of Pasacao in the Court of First Instance of Camarines
Sur for recovery of possession of the municipal waters awarded to the former by
virtue of Resolution No. 57. On March 21, 1961, while the said action was still
pending trial, the municipality of Pasacao instituted its own pro­ceeding - a
petition for certiorari against the municipality of Libmanan and the Provincial
Board of Camarines Sur for the annulment of Resolution No. 57, alleging that
the same had been enacted by the Board with grave abuse of discretion because:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the petitioner was not informed of the
report of the commissioner who had been directed to investigate the dispute
between the two municipalities nor given a hearing thereon before the
resolution was passed; (2) the resolution did not have the concurrence of the
Provincial Governor, but only of the two members of the Provincial Board; and
(3) the report of the Commissioner was actually in favor of the petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The respondents
respectively answered the petition but the municipality of Libmanan
subsequently filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted by the trial court in
an order issued on January 10, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The herein petitioner moved to reconsider the order of dismissal, and
after the motion was denied elevated the case to us on appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The order appealed from must be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties are agreed that the law which
governs the dispute between the two municipalities is Section 2167 of the
Revised Administrative Code, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 2167. - <u>Municipal boundary dispute</u> - <u>How
Settled</u>. - Disputes as to jurisdiction of municipal governments over places
or barrios shall be decided by the provincial boards of the <span style="">provinces in </span>which such municipalities
are situated, after an investigation at which the municipalities concerned
shall be duly heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the decision of
the provincial board appeal may be taken by the municipality aggrieved to the
Secretary of Interior <span style="">(now </span>Office
of the Executive Secretary), whose <span style="">decision
shall be final. x x x "<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The circumstance that the Provincial Board enacted the questioned
resolution without first informing the petitioner of the commissioner's report
was not a grave abuse of discretion, as pointed out by the trial court, but a
mere irregularity which could have been a ground to ask the Board to reconsider
its action, and if turned down, to appeal to the proper authority.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fact <span style="">is that when the respondent municipality filed Civil Case No. 2631 on
April 5, 1954, less </span>than two months after the approval of Resolution No.
57, the petitioner came to know of its exist­ence, since it was alleged in the
complaint as the ground for the right of possession sought to be enforced; and
subsequently, in May 1955, a copy of said resolution was presented in
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even then, therefore, the
petitioner should have taken the necessary steps to elevate the matter on
appeal to the office of the President, pursuant to Section 2167 of the Revised
Administrative Code.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Or if the
petitioner believed that its remedy lay in asking for the annulment of the
resolution, it should have filed the corresponding action for that purpose at
the time, or put up the alleged nullity as a defense in the action itself filed
by <span style="">the respondent municipality </span>for
recovery of possession.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Certiorari is
not a proper substitute for appeal, or for an action or defense which is
available, since it is justified only when there is no plain, speedy and
adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>And when, as in this case, the petition for certiorari was not filed
until after the lapse of more than six years from the time the question should
have been brought up, laches would constitute an additional obstacle to the
proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention that the challenged resolution is null and void
because it did not have the concurrence of the Provincial Governor does not
deserve serious considera­tion.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
appears that when the resolution was approved the said official was absent on
official business, and one of the two Board members acted in his place as
presiding officer in the session held for the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fact that the Governor did not
thereafter question the authority of the said Board member to preside was in
effect a ratification of the action taken.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner has not cited any law to support the suggestion that
whenever the Provincial Governor is absent the Provincial Board is rendered
powerless to carry on its corporate functions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last argument of the petitioner <span style="">is </span>that the Provincial Board did not follow the recommendation of
the Commissioner whom it had empowered to investigate the dispute.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This, however, is beside the point, because
the decision was in the hands of the Board, subject only to appeal to the
office of the President, and the issue <span style="">in
</span>this case is one of power or authority, not the correct­ness of the <span style="">decision </span>actually rendered and
embodied in Resolution No. 57.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Wherefore</b>, the order appealed from is <span style="">affirmed, </span>without pronouncement as to
costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>
