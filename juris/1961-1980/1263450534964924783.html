				<H3>THE PHILIPPINE POSTAL SAVINGS BANK AND FRANCISCO V. LOPEZ,
SUPERINTENDENT OF THE PHILIPPINE POSTAL SAVINGS BANK, PETITIONERS, VS.
COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RE­LATIONS AND PHILIPPINE COMMUNICATIONS, ELEC­TRONICS
& ELECTRICITY WORKERS FEDERATION, PCWF, RESPONDENTS.

				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review by certio­rari of an order and a
resolution of the Court of Industrial Relations, hereinafter referred to as
CIR, although the petition states that it may, also, be "considered as a
petition for certiorari under rule 65, Rules of Court."</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that, on or about August 24, 1964, the
Philippine Communications, Electronics and Electricity Workers Federation
filed, with the CIR, a petition docket­ed therein as Case No. 1409-MC, praying
that said Federa­tion be certified as the exclusive bargaining representative
of all the employees of the Philippine Postal Savings Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter moved to dismiss the petition upon
the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the CIR to hear and decide it, upon the
ground that the Bank is a mere division and, hence, an integral part of the
Bureau of <span style="">Posts, </span>which performs <span style="">go</span>vernmental functions and is not
subject to the provisions of Republic Act No. 875.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After conducting a preliminary hearing, Judge
<span class="SpellE">Bugayong</span> <span style="">of </span>the
CIR issued an order dated <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1965</st1:date>,
denying the motion to dismiss, and directing that the case be set for hearing
on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reconsideration of this
order having been denied by the CIR, sitting <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, in a
resolution dated April 8, 1965, the Bank and its Superintendent, Francisco V.
Lopez, filed the present peti­tion for review by certiorari to set aside the
aforementioned order and resolution of March 4 and April 8, 1965.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 11 of Republic Act No. 875 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>Prohibition Against Strikes in the Go­vernment</u>. - The
terms and conditions of em­ployment in the Government, including any political
subdivision or instrumentality there­of, are governed by law and it is declared
to be the policy of this Act that employees there­in shall not strike for the
purpose of securing changes or modification in their terms and conditions of
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such employees may belong to
any labor organization which does not imposed the obligation to strike or join
in strike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, <u>however</u>,
That this section shall apply only to employees employed in governmental
functions and not to those employed in proprietary functions of the Government
including but not limited to governmental corporations."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This section permits government employees to join labor
organizations, as well as upholds their right to self-organization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In connection therewith, they are divided in
to two (2) groups, namely, those employed in governmental functions, and those
engaged in proprietary functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those <span style="">belonging </span>to the first class may not
belong to labor organizations which "impose the obligation to strike or
join in strike;" but, those pertaining to the second class are not subject
to such restriction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other <span style="">words, </span>they may join said labor
organizations and may strike "for the purpose of securing changes or
modification in their terms and condition of em­ployment." Needless to
say, this power to strike neces­sarily implies that they may, <span style="">likewise, resort </span>to the peace­ful and
non-violent means of collective bargaining to achieve said objective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the jurisdiction of the CIR to hear
and decide disputes affecting employees engaged in proprie­tary functions is
well-settled.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The issue for our determi­nation is whether or not the members of respondent
Federa­tion are employed in proprietary functions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners herein maintain that they are not, because the Bank
is merely a division of the Bureau of Posts, which has no personality of its
own, independently of that of the Go­vernment, and cannot be sued, therefore,
without the latter's consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cases
cited by petitioners herein<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
in support <span style="">of this pretense are not
decisive of the issue before us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The METRAN Case was
decided on January 12, 1948, or several years before the passage of Republic
Act No. 875, on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="17" month="6"><span style="">June 17, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
employees involved therein did not have, therefore, the benefit of Section 11
of said Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over, as a mere office
of the Government, the METRAN was an integral part thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was, also, the <u>ratio</u> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>decidendi</u></span> <span style="">in
the cases of Metropolitan Waterworks</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a><span style=""> and National Air­ports Corporation.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a><span style=""> It is true
that, in the case of the <span class="SpellE">Angat</span> River Irrigation
System,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a><span style=""> it was held that, being an agency of the Government, this System could
not be sued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the System was but
a Section of the Division of Irrigation of the Bureau of Public Works, which is
under the direct control of the President, through the Secretary of Public
Works and Communications; the expenditures of the System were de­frayed by the
National Government; the appropriation for the System was included in the </span><u>General</u>
<span style="">Appropriations Act; and the salaries
and wages of the officials and employees of the System were itemized in said
Act, just like the compensa­tion of other officials and employees of the
Government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Bank is not in the same situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ope­rates <u>separately</u> from the
Bureau of Posts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It keeps a set of books
of account distinct from those of said Bureau.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Al­though the latter advances the Bank's operational expenses, <u>the
same are refunded by the Bank</u> out of its earnings and reserve funds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These earnings do <u>not</u> accrue to the
general funds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>They remain with the
Bank</u> and are invested by it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
properties acquired in the course of the operation of the Bank are invested in,
and managed by, the same, <u>for its own benefit</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, in Government of the Philippine
Islands vs. China Banking Corporation,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> this
Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
while it is true that the Postal Savings Bank is a division of the Bureau of
Posts (sec. 1986, Administrative Code), which is, in turn, under the Department
of Commerce and Communications of the Philip­pine Government (Sec. 86, Adm.
Code), and although the board of directors of said bank is made up of
Government officials (sec. 1989, Adm. Code) still <u>property acquired by said
bank is its</u> own particular property (sec. 2033), and <u>its reserve fund is
not revenue fund</u> in the sense of section 614 of said Code, but a trust fund
to be used 'for no other purpose than to meet de­ficits In those years after
its establishment in which the earnings of the bank are not suf­ficient to pay
the expenses of the bank' (sec. 2035, Adm. Code), which expenses, however,
though for the time paid <span style="">by </span>the
Bureau of Posts, are to be repaid to said bureau at the end of each fiscal year
(sec. 2037, Adm. Code.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"From this it follows that <u>the funds of the Postal Savings
Bank cannot be termed In­sular Government funds</u>, and <u>debts contracted in
favor of said bank in its ordinary operations </u><u><span style="">as </span>provided by law are not to be held debts in favor of the
Insular Government, but in its own name and behalf and for its own benefit</u>,
as may be implied from the law on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In such a loan, therefore, the Insular Government is <u>not</u> the
lender or the creditor; and hence, the debt is contracted <u>not in its favor</u>
but <u>in favor of the Postal Savings Bank</u>, which <u>has a per­sonality</u>
of its own."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">We hold, therefore, that the Bank
performs <u>proprietary</u> functions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the right of a Government employee to ful­ly enjoy the benefits
of Republic Act No. 875, is dependent, <u>not</u> on whether the <u>office</u>
in which he works is engaged in go­vernmental or proprietary functions, but on
the nature of the work for which <u>his</u> services have been engaged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, the above-quoted section 11
provides that the restriction contained therein does not apply "to those
employed in proprietary functions including <u>but not limited</u> to
government corporations." This implies that even those employed in an
office of the government which, <u>not</u> being a corporation, with <u>a
personality</u> distinct and sepa­rate from the government, <u>is an integral
part thereof</u>, may avail of the provisions of Republic Act No. 875, if <u>they</u>
in particular — as distinguished from the office, in general — are employed or
engaged in proprietary func­tions.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, on <st1:date year="1965" day="28" month="10">October
 28, 1965</st1:date>, the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
certified the issue between the parties herein to the CIR, pursuant to Sec. 10
of Republic Act No. 875, as a dispute affecting an industry indispensable to
the national interest, thus leaving no room for doubt on the jurisdiction of
the CIR to settle such dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is
more, on <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1966</st1:date>,
petitioner asked the <span style="">C</span>IR to
order the Federation and its members to return to work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a conference called by the CIR, both
parties reached an agreement pursuant to which the respondents undertook t o
return to work and the peti­tioners bound themselves to deposit in Court
P83,000.00 in payment of salary increases and overtime differentials, and to
make specified promotional appointments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, petitioners have not only submitted themselves to the jurisdiction
of the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have, also, <u>invoked
the authority thereof</u> to avail themselves of the benefit of Republic Act
No. 875.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order and the resolution appealed from are
hereby affirmed, without special pro­nouncement as to costs.</p>
