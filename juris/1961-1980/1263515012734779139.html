				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Before Us now are the following:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) A MOTION FOR CLARIFICATION filed by Norberto de la Rea
concerning:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the length of his
service as Auditor and Corporate Auditor of NAMARCO; (b) the basis to be used in
the com­putation of the amount he has been sentenced to refund; (c) his status
in the service from the date of his ouster <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
and immediately prior to his reinstatement to his original position as <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City Auditor; (d) the six months suspension imposed
upon him by the Commissioner of Civil Service; and (2) A MOTION FOR PARTIAL
RECON­SIDERATION filed by the Auditor General and the Commis­sioner of Civil
Service, claiming that, as de la Rea had waived his right to return to his
former position as City Auditor of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>, our
decision of March 1, 1968 in the above-entitled cases should be modified
accordingly.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Auditor General and the Commissioner of Civil Service also
filed an opposition to de la Rears motion for clarification.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the above matters, it is perti­nent to bear in
mind and consider the following portion of our decision:</p>

<blockquote>"In accordance with the foregoing, it is clear that the
promotional appointments ex­tended to De la Rea by the Auditor General involved
in the cases before Us were not final nor complete, and as both were
disapproved by the Commissioner of Civil Service, they ceased to exist in law
upon said disapproval becoming final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, it is also clear that De la Rea
should be deemed to have reverted to his position of Auditor of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City; that he would be entitled to collect and
receive the salary of Auditor or Corporate Auditor of NAMARCO during the period
he acted as such, but only at the rate of P15<span class="GramE">,600</span> per
year, this being the annual salary for the position of Assistant General
Manager of the NAMARCO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is in
accordance with Republic Act No. 2260 which provides that the salary of
corporate auditors shall be equal to the salary authorized for the first
assistant or next ranking managing head of the Corporation."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of our decision related to the above-quoted portion is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In G. R. No.</span> L-26082, the decision
appealed from (Civil Case No. 63551) is here­by reversed and set aside, and
judgment is rendered declaring valid the decisions of the respondent
Commissioner of Civil Service <span class="SpellE">Subido</span> (1) finding De
la Rea guilty of miscon­duct in office in Administrative Case No. 28684, and
(2) disapproving the promotional appoint­ments extended by Auditor General
Jimenez in favor of petitioner Norberto de la Rea, first as Auditor and
subsequently as Corporate Auditor of the National Marketing Corporation.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“(2)
In G. R. No.</span> L-27248, the decision appealed from is likewise reversed
and set aside together with the order and writ of execution pending appeal
issued on <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1967</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Furthermore, in consonance with the
findings and conclusions <span class="SpellE">setforth</span> above with respect
to G. R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-26082 and G. R. No.</span> L-27248, <span class="GramE">We</span> hereby declare that upon the disapproval of De la Rea's
appointments as Auditor and later as Corporate Auditor of NAMARCO, he reverted
to his original posi­tion as Auditor of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, he is hereby
sentenced to pay to the Na­tional Marketing Corporation whatever may be the
difference between his salary as Auditor of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City, on the one hand, and the salary that be had collected and received as
Auditor or Corporate Auditor of NAMARCO from the time the decision disapprov­ing
his appointments for such positions be­came final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, the case (Civil Case No.
67663) is remanded below for further proceedings in connection with the
accounting to be made."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Due to the peculiar facts involved in the cases at bar -
particularly the circumstance that De la Rea, a government Auditor, appears to
have, become enmeshed in the dispute between the Auditor General and the Commis­sioner
of Civil Service regarding their respective powers over the appointment of
auditors assigned to different governmental agencies - We endeavored to decide
the issues raised by the parties on the basis of broad considerations of
fairness and equity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus <span class="GramE">We</span> held that upon the finality of the disapproval by the
Commissioner of Civil Service of the promotional appointments extended by the
Auditor General in favor of De la Rea, first as Auditor and later as Corporate
Auditor of NAMARCO, he should be deemed to have reverted to his original
position as Auditor of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City.</p>

<p class="BODY">We held, however, that during the period he acted as Auditor or
Corporate Auditor of NAMARCO in accordance with said promotional appointments,
he was entitled to collect and receive the salary appertaining to said
positions, but only at the rate of P15<span class="GramE">,600</span> per annum.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, it is not disputed that De la Rea's salary
as Auditor of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City was P11<span class="GramE">,400</span>
per annum.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the foregoing, the reimbursement to be made in
accordance with our original decision must be on this basis:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(a)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">No reimbursement need be made by
De la Rea in relation to the period he had actually served as Auditor or
Corporate Auditor of NAMARCO, unless at any time during said period he
collected monthly salaries in excess of P15,600 per annum, or he continued to
act as Auditor and to collect the corresponding salary even after the
disapproval of his appointments had become final;</span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(b)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">After the finality of said
disapproval, De la Rea shall reimburse NAMARCO the excess of whatever salaries
he had collected from the latter as its Auditor or Corporate Auditor, over the
salary corresponding to the position of Auditor of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City, namely P11<span class="GramE">,400</span> per annum.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The dates when De la Rea started collecting salary from NAMARCO
under his aforesaid two promo­tional appointments; the date when the decision
of the Commissioner of Civil Service disapproving said appointments became
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, the date when he actually
stopped collecting and receiving salary from NAMARCO are matters to be threshed
out in the proceedings to he had below.</p>

<p class="BODY">Going now to the motion for partial reconsideration filed by the
Auditor General and the Commissioner of Civil Service, We find the same to be
without merit for the reasons stated in our original decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the penalty of six months suspension without
pay imposed upon De le Rea by the Commissioner of Civil Service effective upon
notice of the latter's decision, De la Rea says the following in his motion for
clarification -</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">"<u>IV. On de is Rea's suspensions for six (6)</u>
months (L-26082).-</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"In G.R. No.</span> L-26082 this Honorable
Court sustained the authority of the Commissioner of Civil Service to suspend
de la Rea from office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since <st1:date year="1967" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1967</st1:date> and up to the present, a
period of over one (1) year, de la Rea is actually out of the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In justice and equity, de la Rea should be
deemed to have fully satisfied the penalty of suspension from office imposed
upon him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His suspension from office for
six months can be compensated with the first six months starting <st1:date year="1967" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1967</st1:date> that de la Rea has been
out of the service illegally."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is, therefore, manifest that, as the Solicitor General says in
his motion for partial reconsideration, de la Rea has not served the sentence
thus imposed upon him but instead brought suit questioning its legality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, as he avers in his motion for
clarification, he has already been out of the service for a period of over one
year as a consequence of all these litigations in which he had become involved,
We deem it reasonable to have the six months suspension from office imposed by
the Commissioner of Civil Service as compensable with the first six months of
the period during which de la Rea has actually been kept out of the service by
reason of pertinent decision and orders of the Commis­sioner of Civil Service.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>THUS MODIFIED</b>, the decision rendered heretofore in the above-entitled
cases is affirmed in all other respects.</p>
