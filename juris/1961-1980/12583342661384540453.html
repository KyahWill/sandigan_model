<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In accordance with the compromise 
agreement the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> 
rendered the following decision of December 12, 1959: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The parties in this case 
assisted by their respective attorneys, submit to this Court the following 
compromise agreement which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"’Now come the parties, assisted 
by their respective attorneys, and to this Honorable Court respectfully submit 
the following agreement and settlement of this case:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"'1. That the defendants herein 
admit having been indebted to the plaintiffs in the amount of P6,475.26 and 
hereby confess judgment thereto in favor of the 
plaintiffs;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"'2. That herein defendants agree 
and covenant to effect payment of said obligation on the following terms: "'(a) 
That the sum of P1,000.00 should be paid by the defendants to the plaintiffs on 
or about January 20, 1959; "'(b) That the defendants likewise should pay to the 
plaintiffs the sum of P475.26 on or about March 20, 1959; "(c) That the 
remaining balance of P5,000.00 shall be paid by the defendants to the plaintiffs 
within a period of one (1) year at 12% interest from March 20, 1959 in equal 
monthly installments with corresponding interest as 
computed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"'3. That to secure the faithful 
compliance and performance of said obligation defendants herein, by these 
presents, cede and convey by way of security, free from any lien the following 
real properties which are owned by them, and all and whatever proprietary 
rights, interest, or participation which they have therein. (Here follows a 
description of the parcels of land.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"’4. In the event defendants fail 
to pay the above-mentioned obligation under the term herein set forth, or in 
default of two of the installments, whatever balance remaining shall immediately 
become due and payable and herein plaintiffs can secure the immediate execution 
of the judgment in the case, and the defendants waive whatever right a mortgagor 
may have short of foreclosure proceedings. A penal clause is inserted in this 
agreement to the effect that if defendants fail to perform their obligation an 
additional 10% shall be charged, in addition to the interest, agreed upon, to 
cover damages of plaintiffs.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"This agreement is hereby 
approved and it is hereby ordered that the parties are enjoined to comply with 
the terms of the agreement."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As only the first installments of 
P1000.00 and P475.26 were paid, the plaintiffs sought the execution of the 
judgment. A writ of execution was issued but it expired <span class="SpellE">unserved</span>. An alias writ of execution was issued the validity 
of which was challenged but upheld by this Court in L-18405, September 30, 1963, 
wherein We ordered execution to be first directed against the mortgaged lands 
before levy on other properties of defendants. Upon remand to the lower court a 
second alias writ of execution was issued on December 4, 1963 ordering the 
provincial sheriff to levy on the three parcels of land mortgaged to satisfy the 
balance in the indebtedness of P5,000.00 "plus the sum of P300 representing the 
interest on said sum of P5,000 from March 20, 1959 to September 20, 1959 and the 
further sum of P500 representing 10% of the same amount as penalty." The 
plaintiffs, claiming that the writ did not conform with the decision of December 
12, 1959, moved ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> on December 5, 1963 to amend 
the writ to read thus: "plus 12% per annum on the sum of P5,000 from March 20, 
1959 until the sum is fully paid and the further sum of P500 representing 10$ of 
the same amount as penalty." The court granted, the following day, the amendment 
prayed for but not in so far as the interest was to be paid "until the whole sum 
is fully paid” declaring that the penalty takes the place of the 
interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">From denials of their two motions 
for reconsideration, plaintiffs took this present appeal directly to Us, there 
being no dispute as to the facts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Should We order the amendment of 
the writ to allow interest to run until the whole sum Is fully 
paid?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Our substantive law on the matter 
provides: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In obligations with a penal 
clause, the penalty shall substitute the indemnity for damages and the payment 
of interests in case of non-compliance, if there is no stipulation to the 
contrary. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[1]</span></sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As correctly observed by the 
defendants, paragraph 2(c) of the decision of December 12, 1959 provides for 
payment "within a period of one (1) year at 12% interest from March 20, 1959 in 
equal monthly installments with corresponding interest as computed." Paragraph 4 
of the same however further provides that "a penalty clause is inserted in this 
agreement to the effect that if defendants fail to perform their obligation, an 
additional 10% shall be charged, in addition to the interest, agreed upon, to 
cover damages of plaintiffs." We believe that this part of the decision, 
particularly the phrase We underscored above, provides the exception sanctioned 
by the Civil Code. For clearly the intent of the parties is to allow recovery of 
both the penalty and the interest, the latter to run, as agreed upon, that is, 
until full payment of the debt. The cases where the penalty takes the place of 
the interest are those where no stipulation to the contrary is provided for. 
Such are the instances in the authorities advanced by the defendants but such is 
not the case herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We cannot accept as tenable the 
argument that the amendment sought would also amend the decision of December 12, 
1959. The writ issued was to comply with the judgment. If the writ does not 
conform to the judgment, We fail to see why We cannot order its amendment so 
that the judgment may be properly satisfied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the appealed orders are 
reversed and the amendment of the alias writ of execution dated December 4, 1963 
is hereby granted to include recovery of 12% interest per annum from March 20, 
1959 until the whole debt is fully paid and the further sum of P500.00 
representing 10% of the same amount as penalty. No costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">SO ORDERED.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
