				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Respondent Isidro Tugade is a tenant of the petitioners over a
parcel of riceland with an area of 26,640 square meters, more or less,
located at Amangbangan, Alaminos, Pangasinan. In October of 1959, a
complaint was instituted against Tugade in the agrarian court by the
land-lords-petitioners (appellants) seeking payment of alleged unpaid
rentals, payment of costs of cultivation in petitioner's use of farm
machinery, accounting of income derived from secondary crops, for an
order directing respondent to follow proven farm practices pending
termination of the case, and for imposition of penalties under Section
57 of Republic Act No. 1199. The complaint likewise prayed for the
ejectment of the respondent from the landholding on the following
grounds:<p></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> (1) failure to pay completely the agreed rentals of
13 piculs of palay at 115 kilograms per picul, or a total of 1,495
kilograms of palay, per agricultural year; <br>
  (2) voluntary surrender; <br>
  (3) petitioners' intention to farm the land by themselves or by machinery; <br>
  (4) respondents' acceptance of a landholding belonging to another without the knowledge and consent of petitioners; and <br>
  (5) failure to adopt the "Masagana" system of cultivation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> After trial, the agrarian court dismissed the case, together with
the counterclaim; whereupon, the petitioners interposed the instant
petition for review.</p>
<p> The agrarian court found that the land is second class, and that
the respondent worked the land under the lease-hold tenancy system.
Since he was constituted as tenant—lessee in 1953-54, he had never paid
in full the agreed rentals of 1,495 kilos and palay a year,
notwithstanding demands made upon him. Nevertheless, the claim for
unpaid rentals was denied and the existence of deficiency rejected as a
ground for ejectment by the trial court, for the reason stated in its
decision that "the court cannot fix up the right rentals to be paid, as
there is no concrete basis for it to fix the same." The court below
concluded that the respondent had substantially complied with his
obligations, citing Article 1235 of the new Civil Code, and further
added: "Anyway, the petitioners have been already accustomed (to)
receiving less rental every year during the duration of their
relationship."</p>
<p> We agree with petitioners that acceptance under protest of the
short payments of rental does not justify the application of the
substantial performance rule of the Civil Code. But the decision was
correct because not only was there no evidence of the exact rental
agreed upon but the amounts claimed by appellants are in excess of the
maximum allowed by law.</p>
<p> The pertinent provisions of the tenancy laws provide:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> SEC. 46. <em>Consideration for the Use of Land</em>.— (a) The consideration for the use of ricelands, shall not be more than thirty <em>per centum</em>
of the gross produce for first class lands and not more than
twenty-five per centum for second class lands. Classification of
ricelands shall he determined by productivity: first class lands being
those which yield more than forty cavanes per hectare and second class
lands being those "which yield forty cavanes or less, the same to be
computed upon the normal average harvest of the three preceding years."
(Republic Act No, 1199)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p> There is no question that the land has an area of 26,640 square
meters, more or less, and that it is second class land. The finding
that the land is second class presupposes that the normal average
harvest of the three preceding years is not over 40 cavanes per
hectare, the productivity of the land being, under the law, the only
criterion for classification. The maximum rental of the land is,
therefore, 26.64 cavanes (arrived at by multiplying the area of 2,664
hectares by 40 cavanes to find out the maximum gross produce, which is
106.56 cavanes, and then by multiplying this result by the legal limit
of 25%). If it should be true, as the landlords contend, that the
agreed rental is 1,495 kilograms of palay, dividing said quantity by
the official weight of a cavan of palay (See Section 20, RA No. 1199),
fixed at 44 kilograms by C.A. 617 and ACCFA Circular 6-A of January
1957, results in a rental of almost 34 cavanes, which exceeds the
maximum allowed under Republic Act No. 1199, even with respect to the
harvest covered before its amendment; hence, the rental claimed cannot
be enforced.</p>
<p> For the same reasons respondent's failure to pay in full the agreed rentals may not be a ground for the removal.</p>
<p> As to the alleged voluntary surrender, it is shown that sometime in
April 17, 1957 petitioners tractored the land, and although respondent
Tugade saw it, he did not protest. Petitioners alleged that they did so
because said respondent already surrendered the landholding to them;
respondent countered by denying having surrendered the land and by
explaining that he did not object to the tractoring because the land
belongs to the petitioners, The respondent court, in its decision,
passed upon sub silentio the factual issue as to whether or not there
was actually a surrender of the landholding, but in its answer to the
present petition, it reasoned out that granting there was voluntary
surrender, the tenancy relationship between the parties was
re-established when the petitioners allowed the respondent tenant to
work again the land in, that year and up to the time they commenced the
present suit on November 12, 1959. To this reasoning we agree.</p>
<p> Under date of May 13, 1957 , the petitioners notified the
respondent tenant of their intention to cultivate the landholding
themselves. Said notice is not a sufficient ground to dispossess the
respondent of the landholding; the law fixes certain requisites which
were not complied with in the case before us. Petitioners showed no
certifications from the agricultural tenancy commission and the
national resettlement and rehabilitation administration (or from the
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, as required by Republic
Act No. 1199).</p>
<p> On the issue that the tenant engaged in cultivation of another
parcel of land owned by Mrs. Paulina Castro, it is enough to state that
appellants do not point out evidence indicating whether or not this
second holding was acquired by the tenant after Act 1199 came into
effect on August 30, 1954 . This deficiency in proof is fatal, for the
punitive or disabling provisions of Act 1199 can not be given
retroactive effect, and doubts must be resolved in favor of the tenant.
In addition, as the Court a quo found, there is no satisfactory
evidence that in cultivating the other parcel appellee-tenant neglected
that of appellants'. While he did not apply the "Masagana" system, his
failure to do so acquires no significance in the absence of showing
that the land was suited to that method of cultivation.</p>
<p> Finally, the landholder also claims for the first time in this
appeal the consitutionality of the provisions of Republic Act No. 1199
on security of tenure. The question not having been properly raised in
the pleadings filed in the court below, it was not within the issues
for trial, and need not be considered by us (Macondray &amp; Company
vs. Benito, 62 Phil., 140).</p>
<p> The decision under review is hereby affirmed. Costs against petitioners-appellants.</p>

<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> It is well to note that
since 1959, this section was amended by Republic Act No. 2263, reducing
the lessor's percentage and altering the basis of computation:
<blockquote> "SEC. 46. <em>Consideration for the Use of Land</em>.— (a) The fixed consideration for the use of ricelands shall not be more than the equivalent of twenty-five <em>per centum</em>
in case of first class land and twenty per centum in case of second
class land of the average gross produce, after deducting the same
amount of palay used as seed and the cost of harvesting and threshing
of the past three normal harvests. In case of disagreement the court
shall determine the reasonable increase in rental. Classification of
ricelands shall be determined by productivity; first class lands being
those which yield more than forty cavans per hectare and second class
lands being those which yield forty cavans or less, the same to be com—
upon the normal average harvest of the three preceding years."</blockquote></div>
