				<H3>REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. THE MANILA PORT SERVICE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.

				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>The Manila Port Service, as a subsidiary of the Manila Railroad Company, 
entered on February 29, 1956, into a management contract with the Bureau of 
Customs wherein it was granted the exclusive right or privilege to receive, 
handle, care for and deliver all merchandise, imported or exported, passing over 
the Philippine government wharves and piers in the Port of Manila, and to charge 
and collect the cenrastre charges provided for in Section 11 of Republic Act No. 
1371, subject to the terms, conditions, and restrictions stated in said 
management contract. Although it engaged in said arrastre business for sometime, 
the Manila Port Service has not paid the corresponding fixed and percentage 
taxes imposed by Sections 1S2 and 191 of the National Internal Revenue Code on 
arrastre contractors. Neither has it filed the returns required by Section 183 
of the same code. </p>
<p>When he discovered that the Manila Port Service has not been paying the taxes 
due from it as an arrastre contractor, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, on 
June 10, 1957, sent to it an assessment letter demanding payment of the amount 
of P138.903.93 as fixed tax for 1956 and 1957 and percentage tax on its gross 
receipts for the period from August 24, 1956 to February 28, 1957, plus the 
additional amount of F300.00 as compromise penalty allowed in extrajudicial 
settlement of violations of penal provisions of the National Internal Revenue 
Code. </p>
<p>On July 17, 1957, the Manila Port Service wrote the Commissioner of Internal 
Revenue denying its liability for the taxes in question on the ground that its 
mother company, the Manila Railroad Company, is exempt therefrom pursuant to 
Subsection 12 of Section 1 of Act No. 1510, and requesting withdrawal of the 
assessment. On February 10, 1958, the Commissioner answered refulinE the claim 
of the Manila Port Service of tax exemption and reiterating its previous demand 
for payment of the taxes, which demand was further reiterated in n letter dated 
March 6, 1958. </p>
<p>On July 9, 1958, the Manila Railroad Company appealed to the Secretary of 
Finance the assessment of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, which appeal was 
referred for comment to the Commissioner who, in a letter dated September 20, 
1958 reiterated his stand that the Manila Port Service is liable to pay the 
taxes in question as arrastre contractor. On February 13, 1959, the Commissioner 
of Internal Revenue wrote a final letter to the Manila Port Service demanding 
once more payment of the assessment of P138.903.93 within 10 days from receipt 
with the warning that if the amount is not paid within the aforesaid period 
judicial action would immediately be taken against it. </p>
<p>Nothing that the Manila Port Service had no intention of paying the taxes 
assessed against it notwithstanding the fact that the assessment had already 
become final and executory, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue commenced the 
present action on November 22, 1960 before the Court of First Instance of Manila 
seeking payment from the Manila Fort Service of the amount of P138.903.93 as 
fixed and percentage taxes, including the 25% surcharge prescribed by law for 
late payment. </p>
<p>After trial, the court <i>a quo</i> rendered decision dismissing the 
complaint on the ground that the assessment of the taxes which plaintiff seeks 
to recover is erroneous, even if such assessment had become final and executory 
in view of the defendant's failure to appeal within the reglementary period. In 
due time, plaintiff has appealed. </p>
<p>It is now contended, among other errors, that the court <i>a quo</i> erred 
(1) in not holding that the assessment involved in this case had long become 
final and executory and couM no longer be disputed by appellee, and (2) in not 
holding that, as internal revenue assessments can be disputed only in the Court 
of Tax Appeals, it has no jurisdiction to take cognizance of appellee's defense 
that the assessment is erroneous. </p>
<p>Under Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125, the Court of Tax Appeals is given 
exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal decisions of the 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue in cases involving disputed assessments, 
refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees of other charges, flr other matters 
arising under the National Internal Revenue Code. And pursuant in Reel inn 11 of 
the same Act, any person or entity adversely affected by the decision of the 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue shall appeal to the same court within SO days 
after the receipt thereof, and if the assessment of the Commissioner, or his 
decision thereon, is not appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals within the 
aforesaid period, such assessment become final, demandable and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </p>
<p>Here the assessment has already become final precisely because appellee has 
failed to appeal as required by law thereby making indisputable the decision of 
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Thus, the original assessment of the taxes 
in question was contained in a letter sent to the Manila Port Service on Juno 
10, 1957 which was refuted by said entity on July 17, 1057. On February 10, 
1958, the Commissioner reiterated his previous assessment and demand. On July 9, 
1958, the Manila Railroad Company appealed the assessment to the Secretary of 
Finance who in turn referred it to the Commissioner for comment. And on 
<i>February 13, 1959</i>, the Commissioner wrote the Manila Railroad Company 
reiterating once more his decision and demanding payment of the taxes within 10 
days from receipt with the warning that if payment is not made within the 
aforesaid period judicial action would immediately be taken. However, neither 
the Manila Port Service, nor the Manila Railroad Company, took any step to 
appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals as required by law. It is evident that the 
assessment has already become final and, therefore, it can no longer be disputed 
in the present case. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The facts involved in the present case me very similar to, if not on all 
fours with those involved in the case of Republic of the Philippines us. Enrique 
Magalona, Jr. et al., G. R. No. L-15002, promulgated on September 30, 1960, 
where we held that upon the facts before the Court, the income tax assessment in 
question therein was a final assessment in the income tax liability of the 
Magalonas for the calendar year 1950; that they had 30 days to dispute said 
assessment by appealing to the Court of Tax Appeals in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 11, Republic Act No. 1125; that having failed to do so, 
the assessment became final, executory and demandable, </p>
<p>"In the present case, therefore, after receiving the denial of his protest 
(Exhibit D) against the deficiency tax assessment made against him, appellant 
should have appealed therefrom within 10 days from June 21, 1955, his failure to 
do so having caused said assessment to become final, executory and demandable. 
Therefore, when on February 4, 1947, the action for collection was commenced, 
appellant was already barred from invoking any defense that would reopen the 
question of his tax liability on the merits. * * *"(Republic of the Philippines 
<em>vs.</em> Albert, <i>supra</i>) </p></blockquote>
<p>The claim that there is no proof showing that appellee ticlually received 
]ilniuti(T's letter of February 13, 1959 containing his last decision (Exhibit 
II) is of no moment, it appearing that such matter was alleged in the complaint 
and the allegation was not denied in the answer. The answer merely confine 
itself to disputing the validity of the assessment on the ground that it is 
erroneous. </p>
<p>Neither do we find merit in the claim that the assessment cannot become final 
because it is contrary to law for such is a mere defense which appellee should 
have set up before the proper court. As already stated, appellee failed to do so 
when it failed to appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals within the time prescribed 
by law. </p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed. </p>
<p>Appellee is hereby ordered to pay appellant the sum of P138.903.93 as fixed 
tax for 1956 and 1957 and percentage tax on its gross receipts from August 24, 
195G to February 28, 1957, inclusive of 25% surcharge for late Payment, with 
costs against appellee. </p><i>Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, Paredes,
