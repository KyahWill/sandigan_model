				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On September 3, 1959, Jesus L. Crisostomo was charged before the Court of 
First Instance of Bulacan, with the crime of estafa, described and punished 
under Articlle 316, par. 2 of the Revised Penal Code, in an information worded 
as follows—
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about the 16th day of September, 1946, in the municipality of 
Malolos, province of Bulacan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this 
Honorable Court, the said accused with intent to defraud, did then and their 
wilfully and feloniously, sell, transfer and convey, by way of absolute sale 
unto the spouse Teodoro Faustino and Regina Pangan for P15,000.00, Philippine 
Currency, by executing a public instrument duly recorded with the Register of 
Deeds, over a parcel of land containing an area of three (3) hectares, more or 
less, situated in Bugyong, Calumpit, Bulacan, stating in the said deed of sale 
that the said property was free from all liens and encumbrances of whatever 
nature, knowing that said statement was false, as the property was (already) 
previously encumbered by way of mortgage, to one Antonio Villarama, said 
mortgage still valid and subsisting at the time of the dale aforementioned, and 
which fact came to the knowlege of the said spouses only in 1953, thereby 
defrauding and damaging said spouses in the sum of P15,000.00 as the property 
was later sold at public auction as a consequence of a foreclosure proceedings 
against the accused Jesus L. Crisostomo, to the damage and prejudice of the said 
spouses in the amount of P15,000.00, Philippine Currency."</p></blockquote>
<p>On October 18, 1959, the accused, moved to quash the information, on the 
ground that the offense had already prescribed. On November 21, 1959, after an 
exchange of pleadings by the prosecution and defense, the trial court issued an 
order, the pertinent portions of which are reproduced hereunder—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * *. The motion to quash and the opposition thereto in effect raise two 
questions, first, the starting point for the computation of the prescriptive 
period, and second, the length of such prescriptive period.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>* * *. The defendant contends that the offense charged prescribe in 5 years, 
it being punishable with <i>arresto mayor</i> (Art. 90, paragraph 3, Revised 
Penal Code.) On the other hand, the prosecution contends that the offense 
charged prescribes in 15 years because aside from the penalty of <i>arresto 
mayor</i>, the law also imposes a fine of not less than the value of the damage 
caused and not more than three times such value, which in this case would be a 
minimum of P15,000.00. The prosecution fortifies its contention with the Supreme 
Court's decision in People vs. Basalo, 101 Phil., 57; 53 Off. Gaz., [15] 
4814).</p>
<p>After a review of the motion and the opposition thereto and the memorandum 
filed by the parties, the court believes that defendant's position is the 
correct one and that the prosecution's reliance on People vs. Basalo, 
<i>supra</i>, is misplaced. In the Basalo case, the defendant was charged with 
violation of the Chattel Mortgage Law, penalized by Article 319, paragraph 2 of 
the Revised Penal Code with <i>arresto mayor</i> or a fine amounting to twice 
the value of the mortgage personal property. In computing the prescriptive 
period of the offense, the Supreme Court, sustaining the contention of the 
Solicitor General, took as the basis, not the penalty of <i>arresto mayor</i> (a 
correctional penalty under Article 25 of the Revised Penal Code, which 
prescribes in 5 years) but the fine of P640.00 representing twice the value of 
the mortgaged property, which fine is a <i>correctional</i> penalty under 
Article 26 of the same Code. Thus, the Supreme Court said the following: </p>
<p>'In conclusion, we hold that to determine the prescriptibility of an offense 
penalized with a fine, whether imposed as a single or as an alternative penalty, 
such fine should not be reduced or converted into a prison term, but rather it 
should be considered as such fine under Article 26 of the Revised Penal Code; 
and that for purposes of prescription of the offense defined and penalizd in 
Article 319 of the Revised Penal Code, the fine imposable therein if 
correctional of afflictive under the terms of Article 26, same Code, should be 
made the basis rather than that of <i>arresto mayor</i>, also imposable in said 
Article 319.' (People vs. Basalo, 101 Phil., 57; 53 Off. Gaz., [15], 4814, 
4818).</p>
<p>It will be noted from the foregoing citation that the Supreme Court took the 
fine imposable as the basis for computing the prescriptive period of the offense 
for two reasons, firstly, because the fine there imposable was prescribed by law 
as an alternative penalty, and secondly, because the said fine was correctional. 
In other words, a fine may be taken as the basis for computing the prescriptive 
period of an offense when such fine is imposed as a single or as an alternative 
penalty and when it is either correctional or afflictive under the provisions of 
Article 26 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>
<p>In the instant case the offense charged is also punishable with a fine which 
is afflictive in nature (Article 26, Revised Penal Code), but such fine is not 
imposed either as a single or as an alternative penalty, but is imposed in 
conjunction with <i>arresto mayor</i> in its minimum and medium periods. For 
this reason, the court is of the opinion that the afflictive fine imposable 
should not be taken as the basis for computing the prescriptive period, but that 
such computation can be based only upon the penalty of <i>arresto mayor</i> in 
its minimum and medium periods.</p>
<p>The foregoing conclusion of the court finds support in the very text of 
Article 26 of the Code itself. Thus, the Code says, 'A fine, whether imposed as 
a single or as alternative penalty, shall be considered * * *.' (Article 26). In 
other words, the classification of fine into afflictive, correctional or light, 
under Article 26, should be made only when a fine is imposed either as a single 
or as alternative penalty; and that no such classification should be made where 
the fine is imposed in conjunction with, another penalty (See Reyes, the Revised 
Penal Code, 1956, Vol. I, p. 293).<br></p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, this case is not maintainable because of prescription of the 
offense charged, and the same will be, as it is hereby dismissed, with costs 
<i>de oficio</i> and the cancellation of the bond filed by defendant for his 
provisional release."</p></blockquote>
<p>The people appealed from the above order on two counts, both of which pose 
the question as to "When does a crime punishable under Article 316, par. 2, of 
the Revised Penal Code, prescribe"?</p>
<p>The provisions of the Penal Code which are necessary for the resolution of 
the issue at bar, are hereunder reproduced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ART. 316. <i>Other forms of swindling</i>.—The penalty of <i>arresto 
mayor</i> in its minimum and medium periods and a fine of not less than the 
value of the damage caused and not more than three times such value, shall be 
imposed upon:</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>2. Any persons who, knowing that real property is encumbered, shall dispose 
of the same, although such encumbrance be not recorded."</p>
<p>ART. 26. <i>Fine</i>.—<i>When afflictive, correctional, or light 
penalty</i>.—A fine, whether imposed as a single or as an alternative penalty, 
shall be considered an afflictive penalty, if it exceeds 6,000 pesos; a 
correctional penalty, if it does not exceed 6,000 pesos but is not less than 200 
pesos; and a light penalty, if it be less than 200 pesos."</p>
<p>ART. 90. <i>Prescription of crimes</i>.—Crimes punishable by death, 
<i>reclusion perpetua, or reclusion temporal</i> shall prescribe in twenty 
years,</p>
<p>Crimes punishable by other <i>afflictive penalties</i> shall prescribe in 
<i>fifteen years</i>.</p>
<p>Those punishable by a correctional penalty shall prescribe in ten years; with 
the exception of those punishable by <i>arresto mayor</i>, which shall prescribe 
in five years.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>When the penalty fixed by law is a compound one, the <i>highest penalty</i> 
shall be made the basis of the application of the roles contained in the first, 
second, and third paragraphs of this article."</p></blockquote>
<p>Contrary to the conclusions of the learned trial court, We are of the opinion 
that the present case conies within the aegis of the Basalo case, (supra), where 
this Court declared that there is no legal justification for converting or 
reducing the fine into a prison term in case of insolvency "and that for the 
purposes of prescription of the offense, define and penalized in Article 319 of 
the Revised Penal Code, <i>the fine imposable therein if correctional or 
afflictive under the terms of article 26, same code, should be made the basis 
rather</i> than that <i>of arresto mayor</i>, also imposable in said article 
319".</p>
<p>But the accused-appellee contends that in the Basalo case, the penalty 
provided is "<i>arresto mayor or</i> fine (Art. 319 par. 2, Rev. Penal Code), 
while in the case at bar, the penalty imposable is <i>arresto mayor</i> and 
fine" (Art. 316, par. 2, same Code), which carry two different juridical 
concepts altogether. In other words, the accused-appellee and the trial court 
contend that in the computation of the period of prescription, <i>arresto 
mayor</i>, the penalty attached to the offense and which prescribe in five (5) 
years, shoulid be made the basis, disregarding the fine which ranges from 
P15,000.00, at least, to P45,000.00, imposable upon the accused in this 
particular case. Upon the other hand, the State maintains that the fine, which 
Article 26 classifies as <i>afflictive</i>, since it exceeds P6,000.00, and 
which prescribes in fifteen (15) years (article 90), should be made the medium 
of the computation.</p>
<p>The interpretation and construction made by the trial judge on the pertinent 
provisions of the penal code, as heretofore reproduced, can not but lead to 
absurb results. If a fine, standing alone as a principal penalty and for an 
amount less than that embezzled by herein appellee (say P640.00 like the Basalo 
case, <i>supra</i>), the offense prescribes in 10 years, there is no sense in 
holding that in the case of tiie accused-appellee, where the penalty, if found 
guilty, is imprisonment (arresto mayor) and fine for P15,000.00 to P45,000.00, 
would only prescribe in five (5) years. Apparently, article 26 points out that 
it is only when a fine is imposed as a single penalty or as an alternative one, 
as provided in article 319, par. 2, Rev. Penal Code (Basalo case), that 
classification thereof into afflictive, correctional or light penalties may be 
made. However, whatever doubt said article 26 might engender, is cast away by 
the last paragraph of Article 90, which provides that, "When the penalty fixed 
by law is a compound one, <i>the highest penalty shall be made the basis of the 
application of the rules</i> contained in the first, second and third paragraphs 
of this article" (See also People vs. Rufo Cruz, 108 Phil., 255; 58 Off. Gaz. 
[13] 2679). Under the facts alleged in the present information, the fine is a 
higher penalty than arresto mayor, because by virtue of its amount P15,000.00 to 
P45,000.00), it is <i>afflictive</i>; while <i>arresto mayor</i> is merely 
<i>correctional</i>. Certainly, article 26 provides the classification, while 
article 90 indicates when such classification should be applied.</p>
<p>The trial court reasoned out "that when a fine is imposed as an alternative 
penalty, the presumptive intention of the legislature is to consider the fine to 
be at least of the same gravity as the other penalty and the court <i>has a 
choice</i> whether to impose the fine or the penalty, whereas when a fine is 
imposed in conjunction with another penalty (like the present), the fine is 
considered merely as an <i>additional penalty and is subordinated to the main 
penalty</i>, and the court <i>has no choice</i> and must impose the fine in 
conjunction with the other penalty". The position of the trial court is 
untenable. The same is not warranted by the language of article 26, which 
declares without qualification, that a fine is either afflictive, correctional 
or light penalty. The Revised Penal Code contains no provision which states that 
a fine when imposed in conjunction with an imprisonment is subordinate to the 
main penalty. In conjunction with imprisonment, a fine is as much a principal 
penalty as the imprisonment. Neither is subordinate to the other. On the 
contrary, in the instant case, the fine is higher than the imprisonment because 
it is <i>afflictive</i> in view of the amount involved and as stated heretofore, 
it is the basis for computation to determine the prescriptive period. We 
conclude, therefore, that where the Revised Penal Code provides a penalty 
consisting of imprisonment <i>and</i> fine, whichever penalty is the higher, 
should be the basis in computing the period of prescription.</p>
<p>The cases cited by the accused-appellee and the trial court, in support of 
the order of dismissal (People vs. Dinsay, 40 Off. Gaz. 12 Supp., 50 People vs. 
Maneja, 72 Phil. 256; People vs. Yuhaia Haya, 99 Phil., 725; People vs. Aquino, 
et al., G. R. Nos. L-9357-70, Aug. 21, 1956), are not applicable in the case at 
bar, for not only are the facts at variance, but the issues therein raised are 
also different.</p>
<p>The period of prescription of offense charged in the case at bar, is, 
therefore, fifteen (15) years. And from whatever date the computation may start, 
whether from September 16, 1945, the date of the fraudulent transaction, or from 
1953, the year the offended parties gained actual knowledge of the fraud, the 
fifteen years had not prescribed when the information was filed on September 3, 
1959.</p>
<p>Conformably with all the foregoing, the Order appealed from should be, as it 
is hereby reversed and another entered, remanding the case for appropriate 
proceedings. No costs.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,
