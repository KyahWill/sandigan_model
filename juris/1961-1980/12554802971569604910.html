				<H3>ERNESTO R. RODRIGUEZ, JR., PETITIONER VS. CARLOS QUIRINO, RESPONDENT. <BR><BR>DECISION</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petition for <i>quo warranto.</i>
<p>The petitioner, Ernesto Rodriguez,  Jr., claims the right
    
to hold  the  position  of Director  of Public  Libraries, and
    
assails the validity of the appointment of the respondent,
    
Carlos  Quirino, to  said office.</p>
<p>The  verified pleadings and  supporting documents show
      
that the  petitioner  was  on 1  June 1961,  appointed  <em>ad
      
interim </em>to  the  position in question by then  President
      

       of the Philippines,  Carlos  P.  Garcia.  However, no  commission or  paper  evidencing  the appointment was ever
      
 released.  Nonetheless, in a letter dated 26 December 1961
      
 to the Commission on Appointments,  but received by it on
      
 29  December 1961,  the  former  President submitted for
      
 confirmation numerous  appointments, one of them being
      
 for:
      
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Mr.  Ernesto Rodriguez, Jr., as Director of Public Libraries,
            
 date of  appointment;, June 1, 1961."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At 5:20 p.m. of 30  December  1961,  the  petitioner was
          
 notified by telegram that an <em>ad  interim</em> appointment was
          
 extended to him by the President, that the appointment
          
 will be  submitted to the Commission on Appointments  in
          
 due time,  and congratulating him.  The  sender of the
          
 telegram appears after the body of "the message as "SEC
          
 GALLARES".  On  5 January 1962, the petitioner took
          
 an oath of office as <em>ad interim </em>appointee before a notary
          
 public,  whose commission admittedly has expired previously, but  the  oath does not appear  to  have been recorded  in
          
the proper  government office.</p>
<p> After the promulgation of the resolution by the Supreme
            
 Court in the case of Aytona <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Castillo, G.R. No. L-19313, 19 January 1962  (refusing to interfere  with the President's
            
 recalling Administrative Order No. 2), the Auditor General disauthorized the payment of the  petitioner's salary.
            
 Protesting  the disauthorization, the petitioner wrote two
            
 (2) letters, dated 1  and 2 February 1962, respectively, to
            
 the Auditor General, furnishing  copy to the  Secretary of
            
 Education,  the Auditor, and the Cashier and Disbursing
            
 Officer  of  the Bureau of  Public Libraries, wherein he
            
 explained that his appointment did not come within the
            
 purview of the "midnight  appointments",  and that  even
            
 if it did, the fact was that he had  not taken his oath of
            
office by reason of  said appointment.</p>
<p> On 27 April  1962,  the Commission  on  Appointments,
              
 acting on former President  Garcia's  letter of 26 December
              
 1961, confirmed the appointment of the  petitioner.  But
              
 prior to the confirmation, on 10 April 1962, the petitioner
              
 received a letter from the Office of the President informing him that the respondent,  Carlos  Quirino, had  been
              
 designated  as  Acting  Director  of  Public Libraries by
              
 President Diosdado  Macapagal,  and advising  petitioner
              
to turn  over the office to the said  respondent.  Over
              

              
petitioner's refusal to  vacate the position, the respondent
              
assumed the  duties of the position just the  same, and so
              
the petitioner sought redress before this Court.</p>
<p>We find no merit in the petition.</p>
<p> In  the first place,  while the  petitioner's <em>ad interim </em>appointment  appears dated on the first of  June 1961,  it
                
was not communicated to him until the 30th of December
                
of that year, and  nothing in the record indicates that its
                
existence was made known to any one before the last days
                
of  1961.  It  can be inferred from  this  secrecy that the
                
appointing power did not desire to make the  selection final
                
and operative until the last day of President  Garcia's term.
                
Consequently, this  petitioner's  appointment  should  be
                
regarded as  part  and parcel of  the  300 and more "midnight" appointments referred to in our decision in Aytona
<span style="font-style: italic;">                
vs</span>. Castillo, G. R.  No.  L-19313, and is covered by the  rule
                
laid down therein.</p>
<p> A second  and stronger reason,  in the opinion of the
                  
writer, militates  against the petitioner's contention.   It
                  
is that his appointment <em>ad interim v</em>iolates the intent and
                  
spirit  of the Constitution.  It must be remembered that
                  
an  <em>ad interim</em> appointment contradicts the theory of checks
                  
and balances of the fundamental charter in that it permits
                  
the Executive <i>alone</i> to make an appointment permanent
                  
and effective in character without  the  previous  scrutiny
                  
and concurrence of the legislative power, acting through
                  
the Commission on Appointments.   While  the  power  to
                  
appoint ad interim when the legislature is not sitting has
                  
been expressly  granted  by  the  Constitution  [Article
                  
VII,  section   8  (4)],  its exceptional character  is nonetheless apparent, and  the grant  is justifiable only on the
                  
theory of an existing clear  and  present  urgency caused
                  
by  an impending obstruction or paralyzation of the functions assigned to  the  office  to be filled  if  no  immediate
                  
appointment  is made.  To my knowledge, no other reason
                  
has ever been attributed to such a grant of  authority
                  
to the Executive that permits him to dispense with the
                  
              
                  

                  
previous concurrence of the Commission on  Appointments,
                  
reciprocally  circumscribing the  latter, if opposed  to the
                  
Executive's  selection,  to  merely terminate  the  <em>interim </em>appointment, but without affecting its effectiveness or the
                  
validity of any action  taken by the appointee. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"If the text of the Constitution  be taken  literally, no municipal
                        
officer  could be appointed  by the President alone to  a  vacancy not
                        
originating in the recess of the Senate.,  It appears, however, that
                        
under  the  sanction  of the maxim, <em>qui  haeret in litera hearet in
                        
cortice,' and of the  'argumentum ab  inconvenienti </em>of the power  has
                        
been understood to  extend,  in cases  of  necessity or  urgency,  to
                        
vacancies happening to  exist in the  recess of  the Senate.  In the
                        
case, for example, of an appointment to a vacancy by the President
                        
and Senate of a person dead  at the  time, but not known to be so till
                        
after the adjournment and dispersion of the Senate, it has been deemed
                        
within the reason of the  constitutional provision that  the vacancy
                        
should be filled by the President alone, <em>the object of the  provision
                        
being  to prevent a  failure  in the execution of  the  laws, </em>which
                        
without such a scope to the power must very  inconveniently happen,
                        
more  especially  in  so extensive a country.  Other cases of  like
                        
urgency may  occur,  such  as an appointment by the President  and
                        
Senate rendered abortive  by a refusal  to accept it." (Madison's
                        
Writings, Vol. 4,  351, cited in 2 Watson on  the Constitution,  995)
                        
(Italics supplied)</p>
  <p> <em>'Its sole  purpose was  to render it certain that at all times</em> there
                        
should be,  whether  the Senate was  in session or not, an officer
                        
for every office, entitled to discharge the duties thereof.</p>
  <p align="center"> *&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * </p>
  <p>"The framers of the Constitution were providing against a real
                            
danger to  the public interest,  not an imaginary one. They had
                            
in mind <em>a  period of time  during which it would be  harmful if an
                            
office were  not filled;</em> not a constructive, inferred or imputed recess,
                            
as opposed to an actual one." (Senate Judiciary Committee Report,
                            
cited in 2 Watson on the Constitution, 993-994)   (Italics supplied)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It thus follows  that  in the absence of an exigency that
                            
made  the appointment urgent or  peremptory, the latter
                            
constitutes an abuse of power on the part of the Executive.
                            
Of  course, the determination of the need and urgency of
                            
the <span style="font-style: italic;"> interim  </span>appointment   corresponds  primarily  to   the
                            
President making the appointment, and it is to be presumed
                            
that an <em>ad interim </em>appointment was made because it  was
                            

                            

                            
needed; but  in  the  petitioner's case now before us, the
                            
fact that  his  appointment was  made as  early as 1  June
                            
1961, but was neither made public  nor  even notified to
                            
the appointee for the space of  six  months thereafter, is
                            
conclusive proof  that  no paralyzation,  or blocking,  of
                            
functions  impended  that could justify and call forth the
                            
<em>ad interim</em>  appointing power.  This  conclusion is made
                            
more evident when account is taken of the fact that petitioner himself was  already  discharging the functions of
                            
the office  covered by  the  appointment by virtue  of his
                            
prior designation  as Acting  Director of Public Libraries.
                            
What acts was  the  <em>de jure</em>  Director  of  Public Libraries
                            
urgently  required to  perform that  the  Acting Director
                            
could not do, before  the  Legislature  convened and the
                            
Commission on  Appointments was organized?</p>
<p>Much less can  it be said that urgent  necessity arose
                              
on the last day of the Garcia administration that made
                              
it impossible  to  postpone  the  choice to a  later occasion,
                              
since the  three succeeding days (December 30 to January
                              
1)  were non-working days.</p>
<p>From all these circumstances, no conclusion is derivable
                                
but that in the making of the petitioner's appointment the
                                
purpose and spirit of the Constitution were violated; hence,
                                
the appointment was  <em>ab initio</em> void, and it could  not be
                                
validated  by its subsequent confirmation.</p>
<p>There  are other  features in  the  case  before us that
                                  
emphasize the irregularity of petitioner's  position.   Not
                                  
only was  the notice to him given only after President
                                  
Macapagal had  assumed  office at noon of 30 December,
                                  
and petitioner's oath  of office taken on 5  January  1962,
                                  
days  after the new President had  issued  and published
                                  
his Administrative  Order No.  2 recalling appointments
                                  
made by  his  predecessor under  circumstances  similar to
                                  
those surrounding petitioner's;  but the  latter's oath of
                                  
office was actually void because the notary public's commission had expired, and had not been renewed.  And instead
                                  

                                  
of attempting to cure the invalidity by another qualifying
                                  
oath, petitioner  Rodriguez, in  his letters to the Auditor
                                  
General, copies of which were furnished  to  the  Secretary
                                  
of Education and other officials, asserted and insisted that
                                  
he  was occupying the  office  in an  acting  capacity,  a
                                  
conduct that evidenced  non-acceptance of the <em>ad interim </em>Appointment now being  asserted.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, and  no  clear title having
                                    
been shown by petitioner Rodriguez to the office of Director of Libraries, the writ of <em>quo warranto </em>should be, and
                                    
is, denied.  No costs.</p>

<p> I  concur in the conclusion  that in the  circumstances of
                                        
the  case, petitioner Rodriguez has not shown a  clear title
                                        
to the  office of  Director of Libraries, and  hence, in the
                                        
denial of his petition for a writ of <em>quo warranto.</em></p>
<p> I  am not prepared, however,  to go as far  as to say that
                                          
this  Court  could inquire  into  the  necessity  of  filling vacancies in the government service and decide, upon our
                                          
own determination of the presence or lack of that necessity,
                                          
on the legality of ad interim appointments of the executive
                                          
specially in the executive department.   The citations from
                                          
Watson quoted in the majority opinion precisely  state the
                                          
reason for the authority to make <em>ad interim </em>appointments to be the prevention of a failure in the execution of the
                                          
laws.  And  the execution of the laws  is  primarily the
                                          
responsibility of the executive.  If <em>ad interim</em> appointments
                                          
may  thus be  judicially scrutinized,  the  executive may
                                          
find it necessary  to  resort  to  appointments in  acting
                                          
capacity,  a practice more susceptible to abuse and  more
                                          
fraught with unwholesome effect.</p></div>
