<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Philippine Constitution 
Association , a non-stock, non-profit association duly incorporated and 
organized under the laws of the Philippines, and whose members are Filipino 
citizens and taxpayers, has filed in this Court a suit against the former Acting 
Auditor General of the Philippines and Jose Velasco, Auditor of the Congress of 
the Philippines, duly assigned thereto by the Auditor General as his 
representative, seeking to permanently enjoin the aforesaid officials from 
authorizing or passing in audit the payment of the increased salaries authorized 
by Republic Act No. 4134 (approved June 10, 1964) to the Speaker and members of 
the House of Representatives before December 30, 1969. Subsequently, <span class="SpellE">Ismael</span> <span class="SpellE">Mathay</span>, present Auditor 
General, was substituted for <span class="SpellE">Amable</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Aguiluz</span>, former Acting Auditor General.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Section 1, paragraph A, of 
Republic Act No. 4134 provided, <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">inter 
<span class="SpellE">alia</span></span></em>, that the annual salary of the 
President of the Senate and of the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall 
be P40<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> each; that of the Senators and members of 
the House of Representatives, P32,000.00 each (thereby increasing their present 
compensation of P16,000.00 and P7,200.00 per annum for the Presiding officers 
and members, respectively, as set in the Constitution). The section expressly 
provides that "the salary increases herein fixed shall take effect in accordance 
with the provisions of the Constitution". Section 7 of the same Act provides 
"that the salary increase of the President of the Senate and of the Speaker of 
the House of Representatives shall take effect on the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the salary increase of Congressmen and 
Senators. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Thus showing that the 1965-1966 
Budget (R. A. No. 4642) implemented the increase in salary of the Speaker and 
members of the House of Representatives set by Republic Act No. 4134, approved 
just the preceding year 1964. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The petitioners contend that such 
implementation is <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of Article VI, Section 14, 
of the Constitution, as amended in <span class="GramE">1940, that</span> provides 
as follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">

Senators and the Members of the House of Representatives shall, unless otherwise 
provided by law, receive an annual compensation of seven thousand two hundred 
pesos each, including per diems and other emoluments or allowances, and 
exclusive only of traveling expenses to and from their respective districts in 
the case of Members of the House of Representatives, and to and from their 
places of residence in the case of Senators, when attending sessions of the 
Congress. <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">No increase in said

Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall each receive an 
annual compensation of sixteen thousand pesos." (Emphasis supplied) 
<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The reason given being that the 
term of the eight senators elected in 1963, and who took part in the approval of 
Republic Act No. 4134, will expire only on </span><st1:date month="12" day="30" year="1969"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 30, 
<span class="GramE">1969</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> ;</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> while the term of the members of 
the House who participated in the approval of said Act expired on 
</span><st1:date month="12" day="30" year="1965"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 30, 
1965</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> . 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">From the record we also glean 
that upon receipt of a written protest from petitioners (Petition, Annex "A"), 
along the lines summarized above, the then Auditor General requested the 
Solicitor General to secure a judicial construction of the law involved (Annex 
"B"); but the Solicitor General evaded the issue by suggesting that an opinion 
on the matter be sought from the Secretary of Justice (Annex "C", Petition). 
Conformably to the suggestion, the former Acting Auditor General endorsed the 
PHILCONSA letter to the Secretary of Justice on November 26, 1965; but on or 
before January, 1966, and before the former Justice Secretary could act, 
respondent <span class="SpellE">Aguiluz</span>, as Acting Auditor General, 
directed his representative in Congress, respondent Velasco, to pass in audit 
and approve the payment of the increased salaries within the limits of the 
Appropriation Act in force; hence the filing of the present action. The answer 
of respondents pleads first the alleged lack of personality of petitioners to 
institute the action, for lack of showing of injury; and that the Speaker and 
Members of the House should be joined parties defendant. On the merits, the 
answer alleges that the protested action is in conformity with the 
Constitutional provisions, in so far as present members of the Lower House are 
concerned, for they were elected in 1965, subsequent to the passage of Republic 
Act 4134. Their stand, in short, is that the expiration of the term of the 
members of the House of Representatives who approved the increase suffices to 
make the higher compensation effective for them, regardless of the term of the 
members of the Senate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The procedural points raised by 
respondent, through the Solicitor General, as their counsel, need not give 
pause. As taxpayers, the petitioners may bring an action to restrain officials 
from wasting public funds through the enforcement of an invalid or 
unconstitutional law (cf. PHILCONSA vs. <span class="SpellE">Gimenez</span>, G.R.

<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The rule that a taxpayer can

Representatives' increased salaries, and not the collection or receipt thereof, 
only respondent auditors were indispensable or proper parties defendant to this 
action.<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">These preliminary questions out 
of the way, we now proceed to the main issue: Does Section 14, Art. VI, of the 
Constitution <span class="GramE">require</span> that not only the term of all the 
members of the House but also that of all the Senators who approved the increase 
must have fully expired before the increase becomes effective? Or, on the 
contrary, as respondents contend, does it allow the payment of the increased 
compensation to the members of the House of Representatives who were elected 
after the expiration of the term of those House members who approved the 
increase, regardless of the non-expiration of the terms of office of the 
Senators who, likewise, participated in the approval of the increase? 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is admitted that the purpose 
of the provision is to place "a legal bar to the legislators yielding to the 
natural temptation to increase their salaries. Not that the power to provide for 
higher compensation is lacking, but with the length of time that has to elapse 
before an increase becomes effective, there is a deterrent factor to any such 
measure unless the need for it is clearly felt" (<span class="SpellE">Tañada</span> &amp; Fernando, Constitution of the Philippines, Vol. 
2, p. 867). <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Significantly, in establishing 
what might be termed a waiting period before the increased compensation for 
legislators becomes fully effective, the constitutional provision refers to "all 
the members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives" in the same 
sentence, as a single unit, without distinction or separation between them. This 
unitary treatment is emphasized by the fact that the provision speaks of the 
"expiration of the full term" of the Senators and Representatives that approved 
the measure, using the singular form, and not the plural, despite the difference 
in the terms of office (six years for Senators and four for Representatives), 
thereby rendering more evident the intent to consider both houses for the 
purpose as indivisible components of one single Legislature. The use of the word 
"term" in the singular, when combined with the following phrase "all the members 
of the Senate and of the House", underscores that in the application of Article 
VI, section 14, the fundamental consideration is that the terms of office of all 
members of the Legislature that enacted the measure (whether Senators or 
Representatives) must have expired before the increase in compensation can 
become operative. Such disregard of the separate houses, in favor of the whole, 
accords in turn with the fact that the enactment of laws rests on the shoulders 
of the entire Legislative body; responsibility <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> is not <span class="SpellE">apportionable</span> 
between the two chambers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is also highly relevant, in 
the Court's opinion, to note that, as reported by <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span> (Framing of the Constitution, Vol. 1, p. 296, et. 
seq.), the committee on legislative power in the Constitutional Convention of 
1934, before it was decided that the Legislature should be unicameral in form, 
initially recommended that the increase in the compensation of legislators 
should not take effect until the expiration of the term of office of all members 
of the Legislature that approved the increase. The report of the committee read 
as follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The Senators and Representatives 
shall receive for their services an annual compensation of four thousand pesos 
including per diems and other emoluments or allowances and exclusive of <span class="SpellE">travelling</span> expenses to and from their respective residences 
when attending sessions of the National Legislature, unless otherwise fixed by 
law: Provided. <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">That no increase in this 
yearly compensation shall take effect until after the expiration of the terms of 
office of all the Members of the Legislature that approved such 
increase."</span></em> (Emphasis supplied) <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The spirit of this restrictive 
proviso, modified to suit the final choice of a unicameral legislature, was 
carried over and made more rigid in the first draft of the constitutional 
provision, which read: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Provided, That any increase in 
said compensation shall not take effect until after the expiration of the term 
of office of the Members of the National Assembly who may be elected <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">subsequent to the approval of such 
increase</span></em>." (<span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>, 1, p. 297) 
<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As recorded by the Committee on 
Style, and as finally approved and enacted, Article VI, section 5, of the 
Constitution of the Commonwealth, provided that: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"No increase in said compensation 
shall take effect until after the expiration of the full term of the Members of 
the National Assembly elected subsequent to the approval of such increase." 
<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Finally, with the return to 
bicameralism in the 1940 amendments to our fundamental law, the limitation 
assumed its present form: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"No increase in said compensation 
shall take effect until after the expiration of the full term of all the Members 
of the Senate and of the House of Representatives approving such increase." 
<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is apparent that throughout 
its changes of phraseology the plain spirit of the restriction has not been 
altered. From the first proposal of the committee on the legislative power of 
the 1934 Convention down to the present, the intendment of the clause has been 
to require expiration of the full term of all the members of the Legislature 
that approved the higher compensation, whether the Legislature be unicameral or 
bicameral, in order to circumvent, as far as possible, the influence of 
self-interest in its adoption. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Solicitor General argues on 
behalf of the respondents that if the framers of the 1940 amendments to the 
Constitution had intended to require the expiration of the terms not only of the 
Representatives but also of the Senators who approved the increase, they would 
have just used the expression "term of all the members of the Congress" instead 
of specifying "all the members of the Senate and of the House". This is a 
distinction without a difference, since the Senate and the House together 
constitute the Congress or Legislature. We think that the reason for specifying 
the component chambers was rather the desire to emphasize the transition from a 
unicameral to a bicameral legislature as a result of the 1940 amendments to the 
Constitution. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is also contended that there 
is significance in the use of the words "of the" before "House" in the provision 
being considered, and in the use of the phrase "of the Senate and of the House" 
when it could have employed the shorter expression "of the Senate and the 
House". It was grammatically correct to refer to "the members of the Senate and 
(the members) of the House", because the members of the Senate are not members 
of the House. To speak of "members of the Senate and the House" would imply that 
the members of the Senate also held membership in the House. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The argument that if the 
intention was to require that the term of office of the Senators, as well as 
that of the Representatives, must all expire the Constitution would have spoken 
of the "terms" (in the plural)" of the members of 3 the Senate and of the 
House", instead of using "term" in the singular (as the Constitution does in 
section 14 of Article VI), has been already considered. As previously observed, 
the use of the singular form "term" precisely emphasizes that in the provision 
in question the Constitution envisaged both legislative chambers as one single 
unit, and this conclusion is reinforced by the expression employed, "until the 
expiration of the<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> full term of 
ALL</span></em> the members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives 
approving such increase". <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is finally urged that to 
require the expiration of the full term of the Senators before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the increased compensation would subject the 
present members of the House of Representatives to the same restrictions as 
under the Constitution prior to its amendment. It may well be wondered whether 
this was not, in fact, the design of the framers of the 1940 constitutional 
amendments. For under either the original limitation or the present one, as 
amended, a maximum delay of six (6) years and a minimum of <span class="GramE">four(</span>4) is necessary before an increase of legislators’ 
compensation can take effect. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">If that increase were approved in 
the session immediately following an election, two assemblymen’s terms, of 3 
years each, had to elapse under the former limitation in order that the increase 
could become operative, because the original Constitution required that the new 
emolument should operate only after expiration of the term of assemblymen 
elected subsequently to those who approved it (Art. VI, sec. 5), and an 
assemblyman's term <span class="GramE">was</span> then 3 years only. Under the 
Constitution, as amended, the same interval obtains, since Senators hold office 
for six (6) years. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On the other hand, if the 
increase of compensation were approved by the legislature on its last session 
just prior to an election, the delay is reduced to four (4) years under the 
original restriction, because to the last year of the term of the approving 
assemblymen the full 3-year term of their successors must be added. Once again, 
an identical period must elapse under the 1940 amendment: because one-third of 
the Senators are elected every two years, so that just before a given election 
four of the approving Senators' full six-year term still remain to run. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">To illustrate: if under the 
original Constitution the assemblymen elected in, say, 1935 were to approve an 
increase of pay in the 1936 sessions, the new pay would not be effective until 
after the expiration of the term of the succeeding assemblymen elected in 1938; 
i.e., the increase would not be payable until December 30, 1941, six years after 
1935. Under the present Constitution, if the higher pay were approved in 1964 
with the participation of Senators elected in 1963, the same would not be 
collectible until </span><st1:date month="12" day="30" year="1969"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 30, <span class="GramE">1969</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> ,</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> since the said Senators' term 
would expire on the latter date. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">But if the assemblymen elected in 
1935 (under the original Constitution) were to approve the increase in 
compensation, not in 1936 but in 1938 (the last of their 3-year term), the new 
compensation would still operate on December 30, 1941, four years later, since 
the term of assemblymen elected in November of 1938 (subsequent to the approval 
of the increase) would end in December 30 of 1941. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Again, under the present 
Constitution, if the increase is approved in the 1965 sessions immediately 
preceding the elections in November of that year, the higher compensation would 
be operative only on December 30, 1969, also four years later, because the most 
recently elected members of the Senate would then be Senators chosen by the 
electors in November of 1963, and their term would not expire until December 30, 
1969. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This coincidence of minimum and 
maximum delays under the original and the amended constitution can not be just 
due to accident, and is proof that the intent and spirit of the Constitutional 
restriction on Congressional salaries has been maintained unaltered. But whether 
designed or not, it shows how unfounded is the argument that by requiring 
members of the present House to await the expiration of the term of the 
Senators, who concurred in approving the increase in compensation, they are 
placed in a worse position than under the Constitution as originally written. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The reason for the minimum 
interval of four years is plainly to discourage the approval of increases of 
compensation just before an election by legislators who can anticipate their 
reelection with more or less accuracy. This salutary precaution should not be 
nullified by resorting to technical and involved interpretation of the 
constitutional mandate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In resume, the Court agrees with 
petitioners that the increased compensation provided by Republic Act No. 4134 is 
not operative until </span><st1:date month="12" day="30" year="1969"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 30, <span class="GramE">1969</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> ,</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> when the full term of all 
members of the Senate and House that approved it in </span><st1:date month="6" day="20" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 
20, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
will have expired. Consequently, appropriations for such increased compensation 
may not be disbursed until </span><st1:date month="12" day="30" year="1969"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 30, 
<span class="GramE">1969</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> .</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> In so far as Republic Act No. 
4642 (1965-1966 Appropriation <span class="GramE">Act</span>) authorizes the 
disbursement of the increased compensation prior to the date aforesaid, it also 
violates the Constitution and must be held null and void. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">IN VIEW OF THE

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">CONCURRING 
OPINIONS:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">BENGZON, J.P., <i>J</i>.: 
</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Fully concurring with the <span class="SpellE">ponencia</span> of Justice J.B.L. Reyes, I should like only to 
mention a few thoughts related to some points contained therein. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As stated in the majority 
opinion, it is argued by respondents that if it was intended that the increase 
should take effect at the same time, the provision of the Constitution could 
have been phrased as follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"No increase in said compensation 
shall take effect until after the expiration of the full term of all the Members 
of the Congress approving such increase." <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">They maintain that in specifying 
"the Senate" and "the House" instead of just using the word "the Congress" the 
body obviously considered that inasmuch as the terms of the Representatives and 
Senators under the legislature provided for, would not necessarily coincide, the 
effective date of the increased salary of the Representatives could also be 
different from that of the Senators <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The fact that "Congress" is not 
used in the provision in question, in my opinion, is rather an argument for the 
petitioner herein. "Congress" is not used, obviously because after every four 
years the Congress is dissolved. On the other hand, the term of a member of the 
Senate, being six years, goes beyond the duration of one Congress and extends to 
that of the next Congress. In other words, while the term of the members of the 
House of Representatives coincides with the lifetime of the Congress, the term 
of a member of the Senate goes beyond the existence of one Congress. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Constitution, instead, uses 
(1) "Senate" and "House of Representatives" and (2) adds "all" before "the 
Members", clearly Intending that no increase in the compensation therein 
provided for shall take effect until after the expiration of the term of the 
most junior among the members of the Senate at the time the increase was 
approved. Precisely, therefore, because the Constitution speaks of "Senate" and 
"House of Representatives" instead of "Congress", the prohibition against <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> continues even after the end of the Congress 
which approved the measure and, which amounts to the same thing, even after the 
end of the term of the members of the House of Representatives approving the 
increase. In specifying "the expiration of the full term of all the Members of 
the Senate and of the House of <span class="GramE">Representatives 
approving</span> such increase", the Constitution leaves no doubt that until 
after the condition is met as to the Senate, no Increase in the compensation 
laid down for Senators and Representatives shall take effect. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is also contended by 
respondents that the Constitution in using "term" instead of "terms" shows the 
clear intention to consider the "term" of the Senators independently from that 
of the Representatives. The contention is untenable. The provision clearly uses 
"term" in the general sense. For, otherwise, even in referring to members of the 
Senate alone, it .should have used "terms" since the Senators had originally 
different terms of office (two, four and six years), as provided for in Section 
3 of Article VI of the Constitution, a provision contemporaneous with the one 
involved herein. Yet just the same, the Constitution uses the word "term" 
(singular) to cover all these different terms of office. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">I am of the opinion therefore 
that no other course is open to the Supreme Court in this case but to apply the 
provision of the Constitution restricting the increase of salaries of Senators 
and Representatives by subjecting it to a period of waiting. To forestall the 
view that the Supreme Court thereby offends equity, because the other 
Constitutional officers - including the members of said Court - are already 
receiving their increased salaries under Republic Act 4134, suffice it to bear 
in mind that it was within the hands of the legislators themselves, if they had 
so desired, to have provided that the salary increases of the aforesaid other 
Constitutional officers take effect at the same time as their own. In other 
words, if they had thought it would be inequitable to grant salary increases to 
others before they could receive their own salary increase - an argument which, 
I am glad to note, has not been advanced - they could have easily provided that 
the salary increases therein given be effective December 30, 1969* as in their 
case. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">I consequently reiterate my 
concurrence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Republic Act 4134, increasing the 
salary of all the members of Congress was approved on </span><st1:date month="6" day="20" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 
20, <span class="GramE">1964</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> .</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> In the light of the 
constitutional prohibition or limitation embodied in section 14 of article VI of 
the Constitution, when does such increase in salary take effect? Shall <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> be this year 1966 for the members of the House 
of Representatives, considering that the full term of the members thereof who 
participated in the approval of the salary increase has expired? Even if the 
full terms of all the members of the Senate, as composed in 1964, have not 
expired? Or shall <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> be only on 
</span><st1:date month="12" day="30" year="1969"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 30, <span class="GramE">1969</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> ,</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> after the expiration of the full 
term of the senators elected in 1963? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">I fully adhere to and support the 
position taken by my esteemed brethren, Justices J. B. L. Reyes, Jose P. <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span> <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>. Their thoroughgoing treatment of the issue 
effectively exploits logical, <span class="SpellE">historical</span> and empirical 
considerations leading quite Inevitably to the firm conclusion that the salary 
Increase provided for by Congress in 1964 can take effect, for any and all 
members of Congress, only after the expiration of the full term of the senators 
elected in 1963, that is to say, only after December 29, 1969. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">There is, however, a vital aspect 
of the problem that, in my view, requires not only projection but emphasis as 
well. This is the language of the pertinent constitutional prohibition or 
limitation which by itself forcefully compels the very conclusion arrived at by 
the majority of the Court. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We cannot overemphasize the 
essential role of language. It is one of the distinctive qualities of man, 
especially of modern thinking man. Man does feel and analyze his intellectual 
and material experiences; but more than this, he has the ability to articulate, 
and through articulation he manages synthesis and brings forth the creation and 
evolution of culture, literature, science and law. In the process, the unceasing 
effort is to say what is meant and to mean what is said. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Now, then, is the constitutional 
prohibition or limitation on congressional salary increases stated? "No increase 
in said compensation shall take effect until after the expiration of the full 
term of all the members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives 
approving such Increase." This statement has a literal message of striking 
clarity. The phrase "No Increase in said compensation shall take effect" 
establishes the character of the provision as a prohibition or limitation, as 
can be seen from the unqualified words "no increase". The words "until after the 
expiration of the full term" impart the period of time during which the 
prohibition or limitation operates, after which period the Increase in 
compensation can take effect. Whose full term must first expire before the 
increase can take effect? It is the full term “of the members of the Senate and 
of the House of Representatives approving such increase." The immediate as well 
as lasting Impact of these words is that what must first expire is the full term 
of the members of both houses of Congress approving the increase. It cannot be 
the full term of the members of either house, nor yet the full term of the 
members of the Senate, or that of the members of the House of Representatives. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The key word is the particle 
"and" "And" is a conjunction pertinently defined as meaning "together with," 
"Joined with" (Punk and <span class="SpellE">Wagnalls</span> New Standard 
Dictionary of the English Language, p. 105); "along or together with," "added to 
or linked to," used to conjoin word with word, phrase with phrase, clause with 
clause (Webster’ s New International Dictionary, p. 98). The word "and" does not 
mean "or"; it is a conjunction used to denote a <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> or union, "binding together," "relating the one to 
the other" (See 3 Words and Phrases, 569-571.). <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As understood from the common and 
usual meaning of the conjunction "and," the expiration of the full term of all 
the members of the Senate is inseparable from the expiration of the full term of 
all the members of the House of Representatives. From the perspective of 
semantics, it is undeniably perceived that those who framed the constitutional 
provision, when they utilized the word "and," stated what they meant and meant 
what they stated. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">There is, to be sure, a specific 
rule of interpretation that would allow "or" to be interchanged with "and," in 
which event a negation of the concept of <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> would 
ensue. But this is the exception rather than the general rule. The exception is 
resorted to only when a literal Interpretation would pervert the plain intention 
of the writer or draftsman as gleaned from the overall context of the writing 
and/or from external factors. This does not obtain in the provision under 
discussion. Indeed, a departure from the general rule and a resort to the 
exception would pervert section 14 of article VI. Note the parity of 
compensation of the senators and the members of the House of Representatives. If 
the expiration of the full term of the members of the Senate would be considered 
as separable from the expiration of the full term of the members of the House of 
Representatives, despite the conjunction "and," then the result would be to 
allow members of the House of Representatives to enjoy the increase in 
compensation ahead of the senators, thereby producing a disparity of 
compensation. Furthermore, if the framers of the provision were concerned with 
the realities of the term of office of the senators and that of the 
representatives, more than with the reality of the parity of compensation, then 
they should have staggered the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of 
entitlement to the increased salary and allowed the first group of senators 
elected after the approval of the increase to enjoy such increase. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The prohibition or limitation may 
be stated <span class="SpellE">elsewise</span>: "The full terms of all the members 
of the Senate and of the House of Representatives approving such Increase must 
first expire before an increase in compensation can take effect." Would the 
literal meaning of the provision still be in doubt? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The framers of the constitutional 
provision under discussion certainly were not wanting of competent legal 
stylists. With much more reason, then, must they be regarded as having achieved 
a unity of intention, statement and <span class="GramE">meaning.</span> These 
experienced stylists could have so easily phrased the provision differently to 
conform to a different intention. For example, it could have been: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> 
<span class="SpellE">x</span> until after the expiration of the full term of all 
the members of the Senate or of the House of Representatives approving such 
increase, as the case may be,” But this was not done, and we cannot deviate from 
what able stylists have plainly stated in the plain 
language.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

writing the opinion of the Court in the case now before Us, interpreting the 
<span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> clause in paragraph A, Section 1 of 
Republic Act 4134 in relation to the pertinent provision of Article VI, Section 
14, of the Constitution, hereinabove quoted, says that the increased 
compensation provided by Republic Act 4134 for the Senators and Members of the 
House of Representatives will not take effect until December 30, 1969. I concur 
with this opinion because it will not be until </span><st1:date month="12" day="29" year="1969"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 29, 
1969</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> when 
the full term of all the Members of the Senate and of the House of

agree with the opinion that in so far as Republic Act No. 4642 (Appropriation 
Law for the fiscal year 1965-1966) authorizes the disbursement of the increased 
compensation for the Members of the House of Representatives prior to

1940 were the provisions regarding (1) the establishment of a bicameral 
legislature composed of a House of Representatives and a Senate, to take the 
place of the then existing unicameral legislature known as the National 
Assembly; (2) the change in the term of the office of the President of the 
Philippines, and the Vice-President, which formerly was for a period of six 
years, to that of four years, with the proviso that no person shall serve as 
President for more than eight consecutive years; and (3) the creation of the 
Commission on Elections. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is regrettable that the 
deliberations of the Second National Assembly on the 1940 amendments to the 
Constitution were mostly done in caucuses behind closed doors, and the 
discussions were not recorded. It was during the first special sessions of the 
Second National Assembly in September, 1939 when discussions on proposed 
amendments to the Constitution were held. It was only after the proposed 
amendments had been approved in caucuses when the amendments were embodied in a 
resolution and submitted to the National Assembly in open session. The 
amendments as approved in caucuses were embodied in Resolution No.38 and adopted 
on </span><st1:date month="9" day="15" year="1939"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 15, <span class="GramE">1939</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> .</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> However, during the second 
regular sessions in 1940 Resolution No. 38 was amended by. Resolution No. 73 
which was adopted on </span><st1:date month="4" day="11" year="1940"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 11, <span class="GramE">1940</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> .</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> That is how the amendments came 
to be known as the 1940 Amendments. Those amendments were approved in a 
plebiscite that was held on </span><st1:date month="6" day="18" year="1940"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 18, <span class="GramE">1940</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> .</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">I still have vivid recollections 
of the important points brought up during the deliberations in caucus over 
proposed amendments and of the agreements arrived at. I remember too the 
influences that worked, and the pressures that were brought to bear upon the 
Assemblymen, in the efforts to bring about agreements on very controversial 
matters and thus secure the- insertion of the desired amendments to the 
Constitution. The discussions on the proposed amendments affecting the 
legislative branch of the government were <span class="GramE">specially</span> of 
interest to us then because we were in some way personally affected, as most of 
us were interested in running for reelection. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is not my purpose here to 
impose on anyone my recollections of matters that were brought up during our 
caucuses then, but I only wish to emphasize the fact that my concurring opinion 
in the decision of the case now before Us has for its basis my honest and best 
recollections of what had transpired, or what had been expressed, during the 
caucuses held by the Members of the Second National Assembly in the 
deliberations which later brought about the 1940 amendments. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">I distinctly remember that the 
proposed amendment to change the legislature from unicameral to that of 
bicameral, just as the proposal to change the term of office of the President 
from six years without reelection to that of four years with one reelection, at 
first met very strong opposition by a considerable group of Assemblymen. But 
somehow the opposition was finally subdued, so to say. In the case of the 
legislature, the basic idea of having two chambers of the legislature - one 
chamber serving as a check to the other - was accepted. It was then considered 
as a wise idea to have the Senate as the upper chamber, to be composed of 
members who would be elected at large, and it was expected that those who would 
be elected to the Senate would be men of national prestige; prestigious because 
of their known integrity, in their record and experience as a public servant, or 
in their prominence as a successful member of his profession. It was even said, 
then, that the Senate would be a training ground for future Presidents of the 
nation. And so, when it was agreed that a bicameral legislature would be 
provided in the Constitution, the next matter that had to be considered was the 
tenure of office of the members of each of the two chambers of the legislature. 
As far as the term of the members of the lower chamber, to be known as the House 
of Representatives, there was no disagreement over the idea that their term be 
for a period of four years, to coincide with the term of the President. But as 
far as the term of office of the members of the upper chamber, to be known as 
the Senate, there was at first a divergence of opinion. There was a group that 
supported the idea that the term of the members of the upper chamber be four 
years, similar to that of the House of Representatives, so that in the national 
elections that would take place every four years there would be elections for 
President, Vice-President, and all the members of the Congress of the 
Philippines. However, there was a very strong advocacy on the part of top 
political leaders at that time that the Senate should be made a continuing body, 
such that the complete membership of that chamber should not be elected during 
the national elections that would take place every four years. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Finally, it was agreed that the 
members of the Senate, which was decided to be composed of twenty-four, would 
have a term of six years, one-third of which number would be elected every two 
years. The idea of having elections of one-third of the membership of the Senate 
was adjusted to the situation that in between two national elections there were 
the elections for local officials. The question regarding the term of office of 
the Members of the first Senate to be elected under the Constitution as amended 
was settled by inserting a proviso that the first senators elected should, in 
the manner provided by law, be divided equally into three groups: the senators 
of the first group to serve for a term of six years, those of the second group 
to serve for a term of four years, and those of the third group for a term of 
two years (Article VI, Section 3). And for the purposes of the first elections 
under the amended Constitution Commonwealth Act No. 666 was enacted by the 
National Assembly providing, as far as the first Senate was concerned, that "The 
Senate shall, within ten days after it shall have been organized with the 
election of its President, determine by lot which of the elected Senators shall 
belong to the group who shall serve six years, which to the group who shall 
serve for four years, and which to the group who shall serve for two years." 
(Section 9, Com. Act Ho. 666) <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">When the matter regarding the 
compensation of the members of both chambers came up for deliberation, there 
were proposals that the Senators be given more compensation than the Members of 
the House of Representatives, and a number of proposals were presented regarding 
the amount of compensation that would be paid to the Senators or to the 
Representatives, as the case may be. This matter was the subject of long 
discussions. It was finally agreed that the amount of compensation for the 
Senators and for the Members of the House of Representatives be the same, and it 
was fixed at P7,200.00 per annum each, including per diems and other emoluments, 
exclusive only of traveling expenses in going to and returning from the 
sessions. There was an increase of P2<span class="GramE">,200.00</span> over the 
P5,000.00 per annum that the Members of the National Assembly were receiving at 
the time. It is thus seen that in the matter of compensation the sense of the 
Members of the Second National Assembly who amended the Constitution in 1940 was 
to provide for an equal compensation for the Members of the Senate and to the 
Members of the House of Representatives. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">When the matter regarding the 
increase in the compensation of the Senators and of the Representatives came up 
for consideration, there was unanimity among the Assemblymen in support of the 
idea that members of the Congress of the Philippines may approve a law 
increasing their compensation, but that no Member of the House of 
Representatives or of the Senate that approved the law increasing the 
compensation should receive the increased compensation, during their term of 
office when the increase was approved. I remember that the question as to when 
the increase of compensation as approved by the Members of the Congress of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> should take effect was the 
subject of a prolonged and heated discussion. Many Members of the National 
Assembly wanted to continue with the provision of Article VI, Section 5 of the 
original Constitution that "No increase in said compensation shall take effect 
until after the expiration of the full term of the Members of the National 
Assembly elected subsequent to the approval of such increase." I have taken note 
that no less than eighteen members of the Second National Assembly in 1940 were 
members of the 1934 constitutional convention that drafted the original 
Constitution, and it was this group of Assemblymen that were zealous in 
maintaining the idea that one full term of a member of the legislature 
subsequent to the approval of the increase in compensation should be made to 
lapse before the increase shall take effect. But this idea could not be insisted 
upon because while that was feasible in the case of Members of the National 
Assembly which was a unicameral body, that idea could not be adopted in a 
bicameral body where the term of office of the members of one chamber was not 
the same as that of the members of the other chamber. I recall that it was 
finally agreed to simply adopt the constitutional precept that no Senator or 
Member of the House of Representatives may receive any increase in compensation, 
as approved by the House and the Senate of a particular Congress, before the 
expiration of the term of all the members of the House of Representatives and of 
the Senate that approved the increase. Inasmuch as the term of the Members of 
the House of Representatives is shorter than that of the Senators, it was 
understood that the expiration of the term of the Members of the Senate that 
approved the increase should be awaited before the increase in compensation 
would take effect. As finally worded by the Committee on Style of the Assembly, 
and that Committee on Style was headed by the illustrious and indefatigable 
Assemblyman Gregorio Perfecto, who later became a worthy member of this Court, 
that <span class="SpellE">constitutional</span> precept which be-became part of 
Section 14, Article VI of the amended Constitution was worded as follows: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"No increase in said compensation 
shall take effect until after the expiration of the full term of all the Members 
of the Senate and of the House of Representatives approving such increase." 
<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It should be noted that the 
above-quoted portion of Section 14, Article VI of the Constitution talks of the 
"expiration of the full term of all the Members" then followed by the words "of 
the Senate and of the House of Representatives approving such increase." This 
proviso contemplates not the Representatives or the Senators who voted in favor 
of the increase, but the Senate and the House of Representatives as a body that 
approved the increase. And so, because the understanding of the amending 
Assemblymen was that the effectiveness of the increase should take place after 
the expiration of the term of the Senators with the longest term among the 
Members of the Senate that approved the increase the constitutional proviso was 
so worded "shall take effect until after the full term of all the Members of the 
Senate and of the House of Representatives approving such increase." It will be 
noted that this Section 14 starts with using the words "Senators and Members of 
the House of Representatives" in referring to the compensation to be received by 
each, they are considered individually, But in the matter of determining the 
time when the increase is to take effect they are considered as collective by 
the use of the phrase "all the Members of the Senate and of the House of 
Representatives approving such increase." The use of the word all includes every 
Member of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, regardless of whether 
or not he or she voted affirmatively for the increase. It is the House and the 
Senate that approved the increase. And so because the effectiveness of the 
increase depends on the expiration of the term of all the members of both 
chambers it stands to reason that all the members of the two chambers were taken 
into consideration, and because when the increase was approved by the Senate and 
the House of Representatives there were members of the Senate whose term of 
office was longer than that of some other Members of the Senate and of the 
Members of the House of Representatives it is the term of the Senators which was 
the longest that should first expire before the increase should take effect. 
That is how I understood then that portion of Section 14, Article VI of the 
Constitution, and I sincerely believe that that was also how most if not all of 
my colleagues understood it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The question precisely was raised 
whether under that constitutional proviso, as above-quoted, the Members of the 
House of Representatives who are elected during the elections subsequent to the 
approval of the increase by the Congress of the Philippines could receive the 
increased compensation inasmuch as the term of those Members of the House that 
had approved the increase had already expired. I remember that it was the 
understanding of the Members of the National Assembly that those Members of the 
House of Representatives who would be elected subsequent to the approval of such 
increase could not immediately receive the increased compensation as approved 
during the preceding Congress; and neither could the eight Senators who would be 
elected along with those Representatives in the same elections. To allow those 
newly elected Representatives and Senators to receive the increased compensation 
would give rise to a situation whereby the Members of the House of 
Representatives and eight Senators would be receiving <span class="GramE">a 
compensation</span> higher than that received by at least sixteen Members of the 
Senate, including the President of the Senate, as the case might happen. That 
would be inconsistent with the basic idea adopted by the Members of the National 
Assembly that the compensation of the Members of the House of Representatives 
and those of the Senate should be the same; and it is only logical that when we 
say that the compensation of the Members of the House and of the Members of the 
Senate is the same, that compensation should be the same not only in amount but 
also at the same time within their respective terms of office. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It was envisaged by the Members 
of the National Assembly that the salary increase, under the constitutional 
proviso now in question, would become effective after the lapse of two years, or 
four years, as the case may be, after the commencement of the term of office of 
those Members of the House of Representatives that are elected in the elections 
subsequent to the approval of the increase. In the case of the lapse of four 
years, which we have just stated, it would mean that it would be the Members of 
the House of Representatives who would be elected in the second elections 
subsequent to the approval of the increase who would receive the increased 
compensation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As I have stated, it was the 
sense of the Members of the Second National Assembly that approved the 
constitutional amendment in 1940 that the increase in the compensation for 
Members of the House of Representatives and of the Senate would take effect only 
until after the expiration of the full term of the senators who were Members of 
the Senate that approved the increase. It is my recollection that the main idea 
of the Members of the National Assembly in adopting the proviso in question was 
to maintain the equality of the compensation of the Members of the House of 
Representatives and of the Senate at all times. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Three situations were anticipated 
to happen by the amending Assemblymen under the constitutional proviso in 
question: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">1. This is the first situation. 
Let us take the case of the First Congress of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> which was elected in November, 
1941 already under the Constitution as amended in 1940. This Congress was 
composed of a House of Representatives whose members were elected for a term of 
4 years, to expire on December 29, 1945; and of a Senate composed of eight 
senators with a term of 6 years to expire on December 29, 1947; eight senators 
with a term of 4 years to expire on December 29, 1945, and eight senators with a 
term of 2 years to expire on December 29, 1943. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">If a law increasing the 
compensation of Members of Congress was passed during the sessions in 1942, 
supposing that there was no war, the increase would take effect on 
</span><st1:date month="12" day="30" year="1947"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 30, <span class="GramE">1947</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> ,</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> after the expiration of the term 
of the eight senators who were elected in the elections in November, 1941 who 
served for a term of six years. The term of the eight senators who were elected 
in 1941 and who would have served for only two years would have expired on 
</span><st1:date month="12" day="29" year="1943"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 29, <span class="GramE">1943</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> ;</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and the term of the eight 
senators who would have served for four years would have expired on 
</span><st1:date month="12" day="29" year="1945"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 29, 
1945</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> . 
The term (4 years) of the Representatives who were elected in November, 1941 
would also have expired on </span><st1:date month="12" day="29" year="1945"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 29, 
<span class="GramE">1945</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> .</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> But in November, 1943 elections 
for eight senators who would serve for a regular term of 6 years would have 
taken place; and likewise elections for a full House of Representatives and for 
another set of senators to serve for a full term of six years would have taken 
place in November, 1945. If the war did not upset the national affairs a new 
Congress would have convened in January, 1946, already composed of a House of 
Representatives and a Senate whose members would all have been elected for a 
term of six years each. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">So, on December 30, 1947 when the 
increase in the compensation would take effect, the increased compensation would 
be uniformly enjoyed by all members of Congress (Senators and Representatives 
alike) - those Senators who were elected in the 1943, 1945 and 1947 elections, 
and by the Members of the House of Representatives who were elected in the 1945 
elections. Under that situation, the Members of the House of Representatives who 
were elected in 1945 would have waited for two years before they could receive 
the increased compensation that was approved in the 1942 sessions of Congress. 
And this is so, because it is on December 29, 1947, when the six-year term of 
the eight Senators who were Members of the Senate that approved the increased 
compensation in 1942 (along with the then existing House of Representatives) had 
expired. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">2. Now let us take the second 
situation. Let us take the case of a Congress that is normally constituted. When 
I say "normally constituted" I mean a Congress composed of a House of 
Representatives whose members had been elected for a term of four years, and a 
Senate that is composed of Members who had each been elected for a term of six 
years, although at different elections, as provided in the Constitution. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We make the Third Congress of the 
Republic of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> as an example. This Congress 
covered the period of four years from January, 1954 to December, 1957, 
inclusive. During the first two years (or two regular sessions) this Congress 
was composed of the House of Representatives whose members were elected in the 
elections of November, 1953 and whose term would expire on December 29, 1957; 
and twenty-four senators: eight who were elected in November, 1953 whose term 
would expire on December 29, 1959; eight who were elected in November, 1951 and 
whose term would expire on December 29, 1957; and eight who were elected in 
November, 1949 and whose term would expire on December 29, 1955. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">If a law increasing the salary is 
passed, say in the first regular session of the Third Congress in May, 1954, 
then the increase provided for in this law would take effect on </span><st1:date month="12" day="30" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 30, <span class="GramE">1959</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> .</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> Why? Because that law was 
approved by the House of Representatives (the term of whose members ended on 
</span><st1:date month="12" day="29" year="1957"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 29, <span class="GramE">1957</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> )</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and by a Senate at least eight 
of whose members were elected in November, 1953 and whose term of office would 
expire on </span><st1:date month="12" day="29" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 29, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> . 
That means that the members of the House of Representatives who were elected in 
the elections of November, 1957 (many of whom may be members of the Third 
Congress who voted for the law in May, 1954) would have to wait for two years 
before they could receive the increased compensation. In other words, beginning 
</span><st1:date month="12" day="30" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 30, <span class="GramE">1959</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> ,</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the Members of the House of 
Representatives and all the Members of the Senate (those elected in the 1955, 
1957 and 1959 elections) would all be uniformly getting the increased salary. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">3. Let us take the third 
situation. We still use the Third Congress of the Republic of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> as an example. Let us suppose 
that the law increasing the compensation was passed in the third regular session 
of the Third Congress in May, 1956. This time the Third Congress is composed of 
the same members of the House of Representatives who were elected in November, 
1953, but the Senate has a different composition. The Senate would already be 
composed of eight new Senators who were elected during the elections of 
November, 1955 and whose term of office would expire on </span><st1:date month="12" day="29" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 29, <span class="GramE">1961</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> ,</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the remaining eight Senators 
elected in 1953 and eight Senators who were elected in 1951. If the law 
increasing the compensation is passed during the regular session of 1956 this 
law would be approved by the House of Representatives and by the Senate that had 
eight new members whose term would expire on </span><st1:date month="12" day="29" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 29, <span class="GramE">1961</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> .</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> Since the term of these new 
eight Senators would expire on </span><st1:date month="12" day="29" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 29, 
<span class="GramE">1961</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> ,</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> then the increased compensation 
would take effect on </span><st1:date month="12" day="30" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 30, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> . 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In November, 1957 there were 
elections and a new House of Representatives was then elected, and the term of 
office of the members of the new House would expire on </span><st1:date month="12" day="29" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 29, <span class="GramE">1961</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> .</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> Likewise, a new set of eight 
Senators were elected whose term would expire on December 29, 1953 . Those 
Members of the House of Representatives who were elected in November, 1957, 
among whom perhaps were Representatives who voted for the increase during the 
1956 sessions, would not enjoy the increased compensation because their term 
would expire on December 29, 1961 - the very same date of the termination of the 
term of the eight Senators who were elected in 1955 and who were Members of the 
Senate that approved the increase during the session of 1956. In this case the 
increased compensation would be received by the Members of the House of 
Representatives who were elected in the elections of November, 1961, along with 
the <span class="GramE">Senators</span> who were elected in November, 1961 and the 
remaining Senators who were elected in 1959 and 1957. They would all be 
receiving the same compensation and at the same time while they are in office 
during the term for which they were elected. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As far as the House of 
Representatives is concerned, the situation as portrayed in this third case is 
the same situation as that which was contemplated by the framers of the original 
Constitution of 1935 when it was provided in the Constitution as adopted that 
the increase in salary should not take effect "until after the expiration of the 
full term of the Members of the National Assembly elected subsequent to the 
approval of such increase." In the example we have given, the increase in 
salaries of the Members of the House of Representatives which was approved by 
the Members of the House in the third regular session of the Third Congress did 
not take effect until after the expiration of the full term of the Members of 
the House who were elected subsequent to the approval of such increase. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The case now before <span class="GramE">Us</span> is similar to Case No. 3 that we have portrayed above. 
Republic Act 4134 was approved during the regular session of the Fifth Congress 
of the Republic of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> in May, 1964 and signed into law 
by the President on </span><st1:date month="6" day="20" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 20, <span class="GramE">1964</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> .</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> As I have stated earlier, the 
increase provided in this law was approved by the House of Representatives whose 
members were elected in November, 1961, and whose term of office expired on 
December 29, 1965; and by the Senate composed of eight Senators who were elected 
in November, 1963 whose term would expire on December 29, 1969, eight Senators 
who were elected in November, 1961 whose term would expire on December 29, 1967, 
and eight Senators who were elected in November, 1959 whose term had expired on 
December 29, 1965. Inasmuch as the increase would take effect at the expiration 
of the term of the Senators who were elected in November, 1963 - which is on 
</span><st1:date month="12" day="29" year="1969"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 29, 
1969</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> - 
the Members of the present House of Representatives cannot receive this 
increased compensation during their present term of office. It will be the 
Members of the House of Representatives who will be elected in November, 1969, 
along with the Senators elected in 1965, 1967 and 1969, who will receive this 
increased compensation. They will then all be receiving the same compensation 
during the time that they are in office. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">I have endeavored to make a 
discourse of facts as I know them, because I sincerely believe that the 
interpretation embodied in the opinion penned by my esteemed colleague, Mr. 
Justice J.B.L. Reyes, of the pertinent provision of Article VI, Section 14 of 
our Constitution is in consonance with the facts and circumstances as I remember 
them, and as I know them. As I have stated at the early part of this concurring 
opinion, it is not my purpose to impose on anyone my recollection of what 
transpired, or of what had been discussed about, or of what had been agreed 
upon, by the Members of the Second National Assembly during the deliberations 
which brought about the 1940 amendments to our Constitution. My perception and 
my memory are as frail as those of any other human being, and I may have 
incurred myself in error. It just happened that the facts and the circumstances 
that I have herein narrated, as I remember them, have engendered in my mind an 
opinion, nay a conviction, which dovetails with the opinion of my illustrious 
colleague that has penned the opinion for the majority of the Court in this 
case. <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote></div></div>
