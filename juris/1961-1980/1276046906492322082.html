				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Rizal 
in its Criminal Case No. 3023, finding appellants Oscar Castelo, Bienvenido 
Mendoza alias Ben Ulo, Jose de Jesus y Lingat alias Peping, Hipolito Bonifacio y 
de Guzman alias Pol, Domingo Gonzales y Salvacion alias Doming &amp; Jockey 
Salvacion, Felix Miray y Gutierrez alias Pile, Pedro Enriquez alias Pedring 
Pasig alias Busog, and Augusto Melencio alias August, guilty of murder and 
sentencing them to death. These eight defendants, together with eight others, 
were charger with having murdered Manuel P. Monroy in the night of June 15, 
1953. During the course of the proceedings, however, the case was dismissed for 
lack of evidence, as against Adelaida Reyes, Dra. Herminia Castelo-Sotto, Felix 
Tamayo and Leonardo Caparas. Rogelio Robles turning state witness, was 
discharged. The three others - Salvador Realista, Rading Doe and John Doe - were 
still at large. A joint trial was held at which about 150 witnesses testified 
and more than one thousand documentary exhibits were introduced. The Hon. Emilio 
Rilloraza, Judge, in a long and exhaustive decision (186 printed pages) 
convicted the herein mentioned appellants. </p>
<p>About a week after the promulgation of the decision, state witness Rogelio 
Robles executed an affidavit dated April 16, 1955 (Exh. 1-New Trial) wherein he 
repudiated all he had testified to, branding it to be a series of falsehoods. 
This prompted Castelo to move for a new trial, which was granted by vacation 
judge Juan L. Bocar, because Judge Rilloraza who had penned the original 
decision was then on vacation. The Solicitor-General questioned the Bocar order 
by certiorari in G.R. No. L-9050. However, we sustained His Honor's decree. A 
new trial was had only with respect to Castelo, as the seven other appellants 
had already perfected their appeal. After the re-hearing, again Castelo was 
found guilty and sentenced as before; but he was in addition required to 
indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of P3,000.00. </p>
<p>During the pendency of this appeal, Castelo filed a motion for bail and new 
trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence; and the seven other appellants 
likewise filed a motion for new trial on identical grounds. These two motions 
were acted upon in our Resolution of July 15, 1957, to the effect that "action 
on the motions for bail and for new trial filed by appellants' counsel is 
deferred until the time when the appeal is considered upon the merits." 
Thereafter, several motions for reconsideration and for bail were one after 
another, filed by Castelo, which were repeatedly denied. </p>
<p>Considering now the appeal on the merits, it appears that the prosecution has 
established the following:</p>
<p>FACTS: In January 1953, appellant Oscar Castelo, then a Judge of the Court of 
First Instance of Manila, became Secretary of Justice; and on March 1st of that 
year, he was designated to act as Secretary of National Defense in addition to 
his duties in the Justice Department. He held these twin positions until the end 
of the year 1953. </p>
<p>Sometime in April, 1953, Bienvenido Mendoza alias Ben Ulo, a police character 
and an ex-convict, got acquainted with Secretary Castelo at the Country Club in 
Baguio through Capt.Alejo, his aide. Both being from Nueva Ecija, the ex-convict 
apprised the Secretary of his enemies (those he had sent to jail as judge) and 
this aroused Castelo's interest. So he invited Ben Ulo to "help him" and the 
latter became his trusted bodyguard. </p>
<p>On April 29, 1953, Senator Claro M. Recto, now deceased, aired on the floor 
of the Senate charges against Castelo for bribery and extortion, allegedly 
perpetrated when Castelo was still Manila judge. The following month and at the 
instance of Secretary Castelo, Senator Recto found himself a defendant, in a 
bigamy case in the Court of First Instance of Bulacan. Recto countered with a 
disbarment charge, and the feud between them gained wide publicity, involving as 
it did two prominent public officials. Recto's charges were investigated by the 
Senate Blue Ribbon Committee, with Monroy as Recto's star witness<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> - to the chagrin or irritation of both 
Gastelo and Ben Ulo whohad exerted efforts to prevent him from so testifying. 
Moreover, Monroy was likely to be again a witness in the disbarment proceedings 
- instituted by Recto - before the Supreme Court,which rested on the same charge 
of bribery.</p>
<p>With this background, and not long after Ben Ulo had become the personal 
bodyguard of Secretary Castelo, one early morning in the latter part of May, 
1953, Ben Ulo sent for his"boys" Rogelio Robles and Florentino Suarez alias 
Scarface. When these arrived at his house at the corner of Perla andSande 
streets, Tondo, Ben Ulo told them that Senator Recto andSecretary Castelo were 
mutually suing each other (nagdedemandahan); and so he wanted his said "boys" to 
kill Monroy; both agreed. Ben Ulo then told them to wait downstairs. The trio 
left in Ben Ulo's jeep driven by Felix Miray and headed for Castelo's residence 
at Sampaloc Avenue, Quezon City, arriving there after eight that same morning. 
Ben Ulo introduced Robles and Scarface to Secretary Castelo in the balcony or 
porch of the house saying, "These are my boys," Castelo nodded and smiled. 
Forthwith, in the presence of and within the hearing of Robles and Scarface, 
Castelo told Ben Ulo, kailangan mapatay si Monroy" (Monroy must be killed), to 
which Ben Ulo nodded in quiet assent. Thereupon, Castelo and Ben Ulo went 
inside. Five minutes later, Ben Ulo came out and told Robles and Scarface to 
wait in the yard where Ben Ulo's "other boys" were idling by; namely, Domingo 
Gonzales, Jose de Jesus, Pedro Enriquez and Salvador Realista, all of whom were 
confidential agents of the Department of National Defense, appointed by Castelo 
- at the recommendation of Ben Ulo. Later that same morning, Ben Ulo, Robles and 
Scarface rode in a P.I. jeep driven Felix Miray and, together with the "other 
boys" riding in another jeep, escorted Secretary Castelo to his office at Camp 
Murphy. Castelo and Ben Ulo entered the office while Robles Scarface remained 
outside. When Ben Ulo came out, he told Robles to come back on June 1st to get 
his appointment as special agent of the Department of National Defense. </p>
<p>Came June 1st, Robles and Scarface went back to CampJ4)rphy where Ben Ulo 
handed Robles the latter's appointment as confidential agent, signed by Castelo. 
At eleven o'clock that noon, Castelo went home to Sampaloc riding in Car No. 6, 
followed by Ben Ulo, Robles and Scarface in a jeep driven by Miray, and by 
another jeep occupied by the other "boys" Peping de Jesus, Domingo Gonzales, 
Salvador Realista and Pedro Enriquez. Once in the house, Castelo and Ben Ulo had 
a huddle inside, while Robles and Scarface remained at the balcony. Later Ben 
Ulo came out and sat beside the two. Shortly afterwards, Castelo joined the trio 
in the balcony and told them, "Gusto kong mapatay si Monroy pagkaalis ko" (I 
want Monroy killed after my departure), to which Ben Ulo replied in Tagalog, "I 
will take care of it." </p>
<p>On June 8, 1953, Secretary Castelo left for Korea; but before boarding the 
plane at the airfield, he called his nephew Augusto Melencio (who was also agent 
of the Defense Department) and Ben Ulo and told them, "Huwag lang hindi ninyo 
mapatay si Monroy bago ako dumating" (Don't fail to kill Monroy before my 
return) to which Ben Ulo replied, "Huwag kang magalaala, halos patay na siya" 
(Don't you worry, he is as good as dead.) </p>
<p>About two days after Castelo had left, Ben Ulo gathered his "boys" at his 
house in Tondo and discussed the killing of Monroy. In the evening, the group 
headed by Ben Ulo, went to Pasay looking for Monroy, but he could not be found. 
They decided to postpone the killing and agreed to watch Monroy's habitual 
movements, taking turns in this observation day and night. In the morning of 
June 13th, Robles and Scarface using Ben Ulo's jeep, went to Pasay and again 
reconnoitered in the vicinity of Monroy's place, but they did not see him. They 
reported the negative results to Ben Ulo. </p>
<p>Then in the afternoon of June 15th, about two or three hours before the 
actual killing, and in furtherance of their conspiracy, Ben Ulo and his "boys" 
Enriquez, Realista, Miray, Gonzales amPeping de Jesus, gathered again, this time 
at the Happy Valley in Quezon City, and there finalized their plans. They agreed 
i ouse three motor vehicles: two cars and an AC jeep, Ben Uloenjoining them that 
should there be any opposition or untoward incident, they should shoot it out. 
After everything had been set, the group proceeded to Camp Murphy to get car No. 
6 and fetch Caparas. They went to Pasay in two cars, as follows: Ben Ulo, 
Enriquez, Melencio, Caparas, Felix Tamayo in car No. 6, and Jose de Jesus, 
Gonzales, Miray and Realista in a Plymouth car bearing plate No. P.I. 1176. On 
the other hand, and upon previous understanding, Robles, Scarface and Hipolito 
Bonifacio went in an AC jeep directly from Tondo to Camp Murphy where they were 
supposed to meet Ben Ulo, but upon finding that he and the "boys" were not 
there, they proceeded to Pasay and parked their jeep near the corner of Harrison 
and David streets. It was dark already. Car No. 6 and the Plymouth arrived 
later. Ben Ulo briefly asked Scarface whether Monroy was there, and the latter 
answered affirmatively. Ben Ulo then gave hurried instructions to Gonzales, 
Enriquez, De Jesus, Scarface and Realista, after which he, attired in coat and 
tie, went back to Car No. 6 and sped towards Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> At least five men in the group were armed: 
Hipolito Bonifacio had a Thompson sub-machine gun; Robles and Enriquez had a .45 
caliber gun each; Scarface had another gun; and Jose de Jesus had a super .38 
caliber automatic pistol. In addition,there were spare guns in the cars. </p>
<p>At the time Ben Ulo was giving last-minute instructions to his "boys", Manuel 
P. Monroy was unconcernedly playing "majong" with his wife, Mario Bautista and 
Donato Baras at the ground floor of No. 18-C Gamboa Apartments occupied by Paula 
Montes, Monroy's neighbor. These apartments were located inside a compound and 
consist of twin buildings facing each other, separated by a wide blind alley or 
"pasillo", the only entrance or exit being from David Street. The Montes 
apartment was well lighted with fluorescent bulbs and the game could be seen 
from the door. It was then about 7:30 in the evening. </p>
<p>After Ben Ulo had left and pursuant to bis instructions, Scarface, De Jesus, 
Gonzales, Enriquez and Realista walked along David Street. Scarface who was 
supposed to be the triggerman, showed some hesitation, so De Jesus<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> entered the "pasillo" and went towards the 
apartment where Monroy was playing. De Jesus tarried a while pretending to watch 
the game from the door, almost blocking the way, in such a manner that when 
William Clemens, a neighbor, entered to deliver the cigarettes he had bought for 
one of the players, he had to ask De Jesus to allow him to get in. When Clemens 
was already inside, De Jesus suddenly fired three successive shots at Monroy 
who, clutching his belly, exclaimed, "Pinatira ako" (Someone had me 
shot).Commotion ensued and De Jesus, gun in hand, retraced his steps towards 
David, thence to Harrison, and then boarded a passing passenger jeep which was 
beading towards Manila. </p>
<p>Alerted by the shots, Pablo Canlas and Jose Moratalla (a Quezon City 
policeman off-duty) who were listening to another neighbor strumming a guitar at 
the entrance of the "pasillo", spotted and tried to chase de Jesus but lost him. 
</p>
<p>Monroy was taken to the hospital where he soon died, and upon autopsy 
performed by Dr. Pedro Solis of the NBI the following day, he was found to have 
received three gunshot wounds, one of which was fatal (Exh. A-3). </p>
<p>Immediately after the shooting, Robles, Scarface and Bonifacio boarded their 
AC jeep and returned to Tondo, while those in car No. 6 and in the Plymouth No. 
PI -1176 proceeded to the house of Adelaida Reyes, Castelo's mistress, taking 
different routes. Meanwhile, gunman De Jesus alighted from the passenger jeep at 
Taft Avenue near La Salle College, took a taxi, and headed also for Adelaida's 
place where he found the two cars already there as well as Ben Ulo and the 
"boys". Later that night, they disbanded and returned to their respective homes. 
</p>
<p>The Pasay police soon started its investigation and Chief Antonio C. Amor 
requested the NBI (National Bureau of Investigation) and the Manila police to 
have a conference with him so as to coordinate police work, as it was believed 
that the culprits were from Manila; and this request was confirmed by him in a 
letter to Mayor Lacson (Exh. KK). </p>
<p>Castelo returned from Korea on June 26th. On hand to greet him in the airport 
were Ben Ulo and Melencio, and a picture was taken of the occasion (Exh. RRR). 
The following morning, Ben Ulo and the "boys" were again at Castelo’s house. In 
a gay mood and fingering his bow tie, Castelo tapped Ben Ulo's shoulder and 
said, "Mabuti wala na tayong iintindihin ngayon; pero, Ben, natitiyak mo kayang 
walang nakakita?" (Good, now we have nothing to worry about; but, Ben, can you 
be sure nobody saw?) Ben retorted, "Wala; malinis na malinis ang 
trabajo"(Nobody; the job was very neatly done). </p>
<p>Pursuant to the request of Chief Amor of Pasay, the Manila police made its 
own investigation, and on June 26th, Scarface and Robles were arrested. At this, 
Ben Ulo's "boys"became so apprehensive and jittery that he had to calm themdown 
saying, "Hindi be sinabi ko sa inyo na kaya ng matanda iyan, maski anong asunto. 
Puede ba tayong iwanan ng matanda (Secretary Castelo) ay kasama siya diyan." 
(Didn't I tell you already that the old man (Castelo) can take care of any case? 
Can the old man desert us when he is in it himself?) </p>
<p>Scarface and Robles were later set free, but were under police surveillance. 
</p>
<p>Some days after, while Ben Ulo and this "boys" were hanging around Castelo's 
office at Camp Murphy, Ben Ulo told Melencio, "Tila merong masamang nangyari. 
Babaliktad na si Scar-face, pick apen natin. Kailangan makausap ng matanda (It 
seems that something went wrong. Scarface is about to turnaround. Let's pick him 
up. It's important that the old man talk to him). </p>
<p>Consequently, in the evening of July 13th, Scarface found himself in the 
Shellborne Hotel with Ben Ulo, Miray, Enriquez,Gonzales and De Jesus (Exh. JJJ). 
Castelo, who had a suite inthe fifth floor, was also there and knew that 
Scarface was wit!the "boys" in the second floor. </p>
<p>Mayor Lacson of Manila likewise knew that both Castelo and Scarface were in 
the hotel that night. The Mayor, accompanied by armed policemen, photographers 
and newspapermen (whom he had alerted earlier in the afternoon promising them 
that something "big" would be coming) went to the Shellborne Hotel at about 
eight o'clock that evening and posted himself and his men at the Ambassador 
Hotel nearby, presumably waiting for some signal for them to rush to the 
Shellborne Hotel and take pictures of Castelo and Scarface while talking and, if 
possible, get a tape recording of their conversation (Exh. 57-A-Castelo to 
57-U-Castelo) . Informed that Lacson and some thirty "armed hoodlums" were 
looking for him, Castelo observed from his suite and noticed that really there 
were armed men around the Shellborne. Alarmed, Castelo directed that some 
constabulary soldiers be sent to the hotel for his protection. (Remember, he was 
Secretary of National Defense). Inasmuch as the constabulary was slow in coming, 
Castelo directed his confidential assistant to telephone Capt. Alejo, the 
Secretary's aide at Camp Murphy, to send Army troops. Thirty enlisted men and 
two officers under Capt. Orestes Montano, "in full combat gear," were dispatched 
posthaste to the Shellborne Hotel, riding in two weapon carriers, a scout car 
and a jeep. Capt. Montano found Castelo in his suite "pale and jittery" 
thereupon Castelo ordered the Captain to arrest Mayor Lacson, but the Captain 
failed to meet the latter after looking for him in several places, including the 
Mayor's house. Meantime, Col. Antonio Sayson, Deputy Chief of the constabulary 
(who was also called by Castelo), arrived with twelve men and two officers at 
ten o'clock that evening. Sayson was likewise ordered by Castelo to arrest Mayor 
Lacson and to provide security for Scarface in the second floor of the hotel. 
Col. Sayson went down, saw the Mayor and informed the latter that he was being 
arrested upon orders of the Secretary. Asked whether the Colonel had a warrant 
of arrest, Sayson answered in the negative; whereupon Mayor Lacson said that if 
the Colonel would insist in arresting him, he would have to do it over Lacson's 
dead body. Sensing that the situation was tense, there being two opposing armed 
groups standing by, Sayson desisted and reported back to Castelo. Then Generals 
Vargas and Selga, Cols. Velarde and Cabal arrived. Castelo at last lifted his 
order, and the incident was closed. Upon suggestion of Capt. Gayares, Scarface 
was taken to Camp Crame for better security instead of leaving him in the hotel 
under the Captain’s protection (Exhs. BBBB, BBBB-2, BBBB-3, BBBB-4, BBBB-5, 
BBRB-6, BBBB-7, BBBB-11). </p>
<p>One month after the Shellborne incident, Castelo went to the United States, 
but before his departure, he told Ben Ulo in the presence of Melencio, "Ben, ang 
mga bata, ikaw ang bahala sa kanila. Siguruhin mo lang na walang magsasalita at 
delikado tayo" (Ben, take care of the boys; be sure nobody talks as we would be 
in danger). </p>
<p>On October 20, 1953, three months after the Shellborne incident, Robles and 
Scarface were called to Ben Ulo's house where the latter handed a super .38 
caliber pistol (Exh. 6) and a magazine to Scarface, saying "Iyan daw ang ginamit 
pagpatay kay Monroy" (That's said to be the one used in killing Monroy). 
Scarface and Robles left. Ten minutes later, both went to Robles’ house and 
there Scarface wondered where they could hide the gun and the bullets. Scarface 
then dismantled the gun the handle and the bullets (Exh. G-3, to G-2-L; G-3 to 
G-3-14) were wrapped by Scarface. Both bundles were hidden by them in two 
places: one was buried in the ground, seven inches deep, under the "papag" bed 
in the house of Robles’ aunt, and the other (Exh. H-6, H-7, H-8 and H-9) in the 
house of Robles' sister. </p>
<p>Five days later, Scarface was found dead, with multiple stab wounds. His 
death still remains a mystery. </p>
<p>It appears that the day after Monroy's murder, Francisco Villa, an agent of 
the N.B.I, was assigned to make the corresponding investigation. He contacted 
Clemens and thru him, ascertained the identity of the killer Peping de Jesus. 
Having known the latter's connection with Ben Ulo and his "boys", the 
authorities cautiously proceeded and having been informed by Floring Cabanatuan 
that Pile (Felix Miray) was probably the least tough of the gang, they took the 
latter into custody (the NBI) on December 18th for questioning. He confessed, 
and his narration was tape-recorded and later reduced to writing in five pages 
(Exh. 2). He did not sign it until he obtained the assurance from the NBI that 
he would be given adequate protection. In his statement, Miray named Ben Ulo, 
Peping de Jesus, Domingo Gonzales, Robles, Pedro Enriquez, Salvador Realista and 
a certain Rading as among the conspirators. This revelation resulted in several 
apprehensions. Enriquez was arrested on December 24, 1953. He confessed, and his 
statement was tape-recorded and later written and subscribed before Atty. Arturo 
Xavier of the N.B.I. </p>
<p>Domingo Gonzales was arrested on the 28th, and his narration was likewise 
tape-recorded, then reduced to writing. During said tape-recording, Miray was 
listening to it in another room, - unknown to Gonzales - and Miray assured the 
NBI that what Gonzales had said was all true. In his statement Exh. BB, Gonzales 
linked Enriquez, De Jesus, Realista, Scarface, Tamayo and Rading to the murder 
and conspiracy. Gonzales even made corrections with his initials, on pages 2 and 
4 of his written statement. </p>
<p>The N.B.I. on December 30th, picked up Ben Ulo but he denied everything, and 
refused to make any declaration. </p>
<p>The Manila Police, on its part, arrested on December 29, Peping de Jesus who 
executed statement Exhibit EE describing how he shot Monroy, and the conspiracy 
with Ben Ulo, Enriquez, Realista, Miray, Gonzales and Melencio in the manner 
already stated. </p>
<p>Hipolito Bonifacio was likewise taken into custody by the Manila Police; and 
he also made the confession Exh. DD, naming Ben Ulo, De Jesus, Domingo Gonzales, 
Scarface and Robles. </p>
<p>Rogelio Robles was then apprehended and questioned. He confessed too; and 
upon his indication, the police recovered the gun parts hidden by him as well as 
the bullets, which were turned over to the NBI and then to Major Cabe, the 
ballistics expert of the Armed Forces. The three slugs (Exh. K, K-l and K-2) as 
well as the three empty shells (Exh. J, J-l and J-2) found on the night of June 
15th by Patrolman Matias Soriano of the Pasay Police on duty at Harrison at the 
time of the shooting, were likewise turned over to Major Cabe who, upon 
laboratory tests, concluded that the three slugs came from the three empty 
shells which, in turn, were fired from that gun (Exh.G). </p>
<p>Miray, Gonzales, Enriquez and Ben Ulo were turned over by the NBI to the 
Manila Police where, except Ben Ulo, they again made confessions (Exh. GG, GC 
and FF). </p>
<p>Augusto Melencio voluntarily surrendered to the police. Then on May 24th and 
26th, 1954 (Exh. JJ and HH-1) while out on bail and when the case was already 
being heard, he made the revelations later to be quoted herein. </p>
<p>All these statements or confessions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3-a]</sup> relate, with some variations as to minor 
details, the story of the assassination, the motives thereof and the names of 
the raiding parties. </p>
<p>DEFENSES: Appellants set up the defense of alibi, even as they claimed that 
the statements they gave to the NBI and the Manila Police had been extorted from 
them by means of violence,and that the contents thereof were not true. Their 
alibi consisted in the following: </p>
<p><em>Jose de Jesus</em>.- The night Monroy was killed (June 15, 1953), he was 
playing "cuajo" in the house of Rizalina de la Rosa in Calle Asuncion, Manila; 
he started playing from about two or three o'clock in the afternoon up to five 
o'clock the following morning, having taken his supper at Rizalina’s house. </p>
<p><em>Pedro Enriquez</em>.- After receiving his salary at three o'clock in the 
afternoon of June 15th, he went to La Loma where he took a siesta with his 
common-law wife Andrea Marifosque; at about dark, one Remedios Tagle came and 
had supper with them; and there after, he went to bed and never left the house 
that night. </p>
<p><em>Felix Miray</em>.- He stayed the whole day, June 15th, at home at 707 
Pablo Carreon, Manila, nursing a toothache. </p>
<p><em>Domingo Gonzales</em>.- After taking a siesta on June 15th, he trained 
his fighting cock with other roosters until he was called for supper; then he 
read comics and retired at about eight or nine o'clock. </p>
<p><em>Hipolito Bonifacio</em>.- He was in his house at 1247 Interior 9, Juan 
Luna, on June 15th, because his wife had a severe attack of asthma, which lasted 
up to June 17th; and between six and eight o'clock on the night of June 15th, he 
was Massaging his wife's back on account of her ailment. </p>
<p><em>Ben Ulo</em>.- He escorted Mrs. Castelo from six o'clock in the evening 
of June 15th, to a party at the Jai-Alai with friends, such as Mrs. Gianzon, 
Mrs. Leuterio, and others, and stayed there until early hours in the morning 
when he conducted Mrs. Castelo home. </p>
<p>He denied all the imputations of Robles, admitting, however, that he was not 
forced to make a statement nor subjected to any physical violence by the police, 
although he was somehow threatened; and that Lacson had offered to give him 
-10,000 if he would turn witness against Castelo, which offer he refused. </p>
<p><em>Augusto Melencio</em>.- In the afternoon of June 15th, he went to 
Cabanatuan City with Major Vina of the Quezon City Police on a robbery case 
which they were investigating; that they rode in a jeep driven by Patrolman 
Maximo Francisco, arriving there at about seven o'clock; that they returned from 
Cabanatuan the following morning, June 16th. He further said that on January 5, 
1954, after learning from the newspapers that he was included in the 
information, he voluntarily surrendered to Mayor Lacson and that his statements 
Exh. JJ and HH-1 were not given by him voluntarily, as the contents thereof were 
merely <em>dictated</em> by Fiscal Andres Reyes to stenographer Miss Paredes; 
and that he merely cajoled into making said statements. </p>
<p><em>Oscar Castelo</em>.- He was in Korea on June 15th, having left Manila on 
the 8th and returned on the 26th. </p>
<p>He denies having told Ben Ulo, on the last week of May, in the presence of 
Robles and Scarface, to kill Monroy because, having been a fiscal and a judge, 
he could not have committed the gross indiscretion of telling such serious 
matter in the presence of strangers, as Scarface and Robles, whom he did not 
know; adding that if he really ever wanted to do away with anybody, he could 
have just told his brother to shoot the victim without the need of anybody 
else's help, because his brother is a sharpshooter of note and is a worthy 
representative of the Philippines in international shooting competitions; 
besides, his catholicity does not permit him to entertain such a wish to kill. 
He further said that it would have been better for him to have Monroy alive 
because it was Monroy who could precisely vindicate him from the accusations of 
Senator Recto; because, after having testified before the Blue Ribbon Committee, 
Monroy, accompanied by his cousin, Atty. Cacnio, purposely came to see him on 
May 21st, wept, embraced him, and asked for forgiveness for having so testified; 
that he and Monroy made up since then, Monroy promising that at some subsequent 
time, he would retract what he had testified before the Committee and would 
issue a statement to that effect in the press. </p>
<p>Castelo likewise denied the imputation of Robles that on June 1st, he 
instructed Ben Ulo, in the presence of witness Robles and Scarface, that Monroy 
be killed after he had left for Korea; he swore that this is a lie because he 
did not go to his office that morning as he had a cruise on board a navy vessel 
around Manila Bay with prominent persons such as Commodore and Mrs. Francisco, 
Clarita Tan Kiang, Fiscal Milagros German, Mr. and Mrs. Gianzon and others, and 
that after the cruise he attended a BZSCOM meeting, then went to the Philippine 
National Bank at the Escolta to act on some important papers, after which he 
went to V. Luna Hospital for dental treatment. </p>
<p>He similarly branded as false the insinuation in Melencio’s written statement 
that before he boarded the plane for Korea he (Castelo) called Ben Ulo and 
Melencio aside and reminded them that Monroy should be killed before his return. 
He also denied another Melencio insinuation that after his arrival from Korea he 
asked Ben Ulo in the presence of Melencio how was the "job" done and if anybody 
saw it done; that it was likewise false that before he left for the United 
States in August, he told Ben Ulo take care of the "boys" and see to it that 
they do not talk. </p>
<p>DISCUSSION: We shall first take up the case of the six defendants against 
whom the People recommends conviction. Afterwards, we shall consider that of 
both Melencio and Castelo, whose acquittal the Solicitor-General recommends. 
</p>
<p>The defense of alibi set up by Miray, Gonzales, Enriquez, Hipolito and De 
Jesus deserves little attention for its flimsiness, bearing in mind that Manila 
is just 15 to 20 minutes drive to the scene of the crime. Besides, it 
contradicts their individual confessions wherein each mutually names one another 
as his partner in crime, each describing his own participation therein, and each 
corroborating or supplementing one another's narration of material facts, and 
all mentioning Ben Ulo as their leader. These confessions unfurl a picture of 
conspiracy amongst themselves and other persons to snuff out the life of Monroy, 
De Jesus actually firing the fatal shots and the others lending him support 
while posted at strategic places. De Jesus was positively identified by William 
Clemens, a disinterested witness, and by Canlas who singled him out in a police 
line-up. </p>
<p>Their claim that their confessions were extorted by means of force and 
violence may not be taken at its face value. Ben Ulo himself refutes them on 
this score when he testified that he was never subjected to any indignity; on 
the contrary, he stated that he was even offered P10,000 by Mayor Lacson if he 
would testify against Castelo - which he rejected. He even declined to make any 
statement before the NBI and the Manila Police - and was not bothered at all. If 
torture were the standard police practice in obtaining statements, it surely 
strikes us why Ben Ulo, the acknowledged leader of the group, should have been 
spared from such ordeal. We are, therefore, reluctant to believe that these five 
appellants had no other choice but to make statements. They could have refused, 
same as Ben Ulo. Moreover, it is hard to believe that the NBI and the Manila 
Police could have added incidental details to said confessions without the 
declarants having furnish them themselves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p>
<p>With respect to Ben Ulo, the positive testimony of Robles conclusively shows 
that this appellant was the active leader of the plot, from its inception down 
to its actual accomplishment. It was he who broached the subject of killing 
Monroy to Robles and Scarface, and introduced his "boys" to Castelo, who 
immediately confirmed that “Monroy must be killed;” it was Ben Ulo who planned 
the whole strategy of the rub-out; and it was he who delivered the lethal gun 
Exh. G to Scarface and Robles for them to hide. The testimony of Robles is amply 
corroborated not only by the confessions of Miray, De Jesus, Bonifacio, 
Enriquez, Gonzales and Melencio - all of whom point to Ulo as the leader and 
moving spirit - but also by the mass of evidence on record, that leaves no room 
for doubting his guilt. To cap it all, his flight while under detention betrayed 
a guilty conscience<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>. Note further, 
that as proved by the prosecution, he left the scene of the crime at about 6 
p.m. already well-dressed. So he could have gone from there directly to 
accompany Mrs. Castelo, as he claimed, to lay the basis for his alibi. </p>
<p>Elaborating on the contention that the interlocking contentions of De Jesus, 
Enriquez, Gonzales, Miray and Hipolito had been extracted thru violence, their 
attorney-de-officio calls attention to the several days they had been under 
detention before they signed the corresponding confessions (before the police). 
But it is of record that Enriquez was arrested of December 24, 1953, the 
National Bureau of Investigation and <em>on the same day</em>, confessed his 
participation; and that Domingo Gonzales was taken into custody by the NBI on 
December 28, 1953, and <em>on the same day</em>, he too confessed. This point, 
besides refuting the defense's contention that it was Mayor Lacson and the 
Manila Police who had framed up this prosecution and extracted the confessions, 
lends special credence to the People's theory, because the NBI operates under 
the Department of Justice, and it is very unlikely that the officials of that 
Bureau <em>would lend themselves to any moves to frame up their boss</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> In fact, and this is significant, the 
original information did not include Castelo. </p>
<p>At this juncture, it may be stated that Mayor Lacson's participation and 
interest was due to the request for help from the Pasay police, and partly 
perhaps, to his natural apprehension that the police officers might be slow or 
reluctant to pursue the "lead" implicating an official of the highest level, a 
member of the Cabinet - holding two pivotal portfolios at that. </p>
<p>But not all confessions are attacked as having been obtained thru violence. 
Melencio never claimed that the police laid violent hands on him. </p>
<p><em>Melencio</em>.- He merely said he confessed because he was afraid yet he 
made his confession while he was at liberty under bail. And many details could 
not have appeared therein unless he had given them out himself voluntarily.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p>
<p>This confession has a very peculiar value, because he is the nephew of 
Castelo and was his confidential agent at the time. Here are pertinent parts 
thereof: </p>

present, were you not?<br>"A.- Yes, sir .</p>
<p>"Q.- After Robles testified, why did you not think of testifying?<br>"A.- I 
had been thinking of my uncle, ex-secretary Oscar Castelo.</p>

<p>"Q.- When was that you saw him there for the first time?<br>"A.- In the

<p>"Q.- What was Robles doing in the house of Castelo during the latter part of 
May?<br>"A.- When I saw Rogelio Robles there in the house of Castelo, I can 
remember that I asked the guard in the house. He told me that is the companion 
of Ben. When I learned that, I asked Miray who is that small fellow and Miray 
answered: 'Matigas na bata ni Ben yan' and since then I saw him once in a while 
going with us to escort the secretary. </p>

<p>"Q.- Did you hear about the name of Manuel Monroy again?<br>"A.- Yes, sir, 
the latter part of May.</p>
<p>"Q.- On what occasion?<br>"A.- When we were in Camp Murphy. Ben Mendoza told 
me to go with him in company of Gonzales and Felix Miray to survey the place 
where Manuel Monroy lives.</p>
<p>"Q.- Did you ask Ben Mendoza why he wanted to survey the place?<br>"A.- 
Certainly, sir, he told me that the Secretary desired that Monroy be 
silenced.</p>
<p>"Q.- What was your reaction when Ben Mendoza told you that?<br>"A.- I felt a 
little nervous. </p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>"Q.- Do you know the reason why Castelo wanted to silence Monroy?<br>"A.- 
Because Ben Ulo told me that Castelo was double crossed by Monroy, they tried 
all their efforts to prevent him from testifying and in spite of that he 
testified.</p>
<p>"Q.- Now, did you verify or later on did you find out if it was really the 
desire of Castelo to silence Monroy?<br>"A.- I cannot call it verify because 
when Castelo was leaving for Korea, when we escorted him on the plane, he called 
Ben and me in a place where we will not be heard by any body and he told us in a 
hurried manner, he told Ben in Tagalog in my presence: ‘Huwag lang hindi ninyo 
mapatay si Monroy bago ako dumating’, and then the reply of Ben was, ‘Huwag kang 
magalala, halos patay na siya’.</p>
<p>"Q.- What were you doing there near Castelo?<br>"A.- We are leading the 
Secretary to the plane.I was even carrying his portfolio.</p>
<p>"Q.- Did you see him (Castelo) after he arrived from Korea?<br>"A.- Yes, sir. 
</p>

<p>"Q.- Who was with you when you saw him?<br>"A.- The gang but we left them 
outside and we went inside.</p>
<p>"Q.- Who was 'we'?<br>"A.- Ben Ulo and myself.</p>
<p>"Q.- Why did you not bring the gang?<br>"A.- They just stayed outside.</p>
<p>"Q.- What did you do then?<br>"A.- We waited for the Secretary to come 
because he was dressing when we arrived. We were then in the sala of his house 
when he came down. He was very happy, and holding his bowtie he tapped the 
shoulder of Ben and said 'Mabuti, wala na tayong intindihin ngayon, pero Ben, 
natitiyak mo kaya walang nakakita?' and Ben said, ‘Wala, malinis na malinis ang 
trabajo.’ </p>
<p>"Q.- What was the reaction of Ben Ulo when he learned that Scarface was 
arrested?<br>"A.- Ben Ulo further stated: 'Kaylangan maareglo ito baka 
bumaliktad ito'.</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>"Q.- What happened?<br>"A.- While we were conversing, Ben Ulo came out 
excited from the Office of the Secretary and he called me personally and told 
me: ‘Tila merong masamang nangyari. Babaligtad na si Scarface. Pick apen natin. 
Kaylangan makausap ng matanda’.</p></blockquote>
<p>In connection with this confession, the Solicitor- General's Office appears 
to have taken a peculiar stand. It says "We are not prepared to admit as true 
everything stated" In it because he was "wheedled" by the Police Department to 
testify for the prosecution. "Wheedled" means coaxed by soft words, flattery, 
etc. We do not think such "wheedling" could invalidate the confession. And then, 
that prosecuting arm of the Government would seem to reject the confession in so 
far as it affects Castelo and Melencio, but would apparently consider it as 
against the other co-defendants. What is the difference? At least, in so far as 
Melencio was concerned, was it not a confession that, interlocked with the 
confessions of the other defendants and must accordingly be considered with such 
confessions? Specially because unlike the other defendants, Melencio never 
claimed to have been physically harmed by the Police; and, furthermore, was out 
on bail when he signed it.</p>
<p>And there is one decisive consideration. Unlike the other confessions of the 
accused (De Jesus, Gonzales, Miray, Enriquez, and Bonifacio), which were merely 
"subscribed and sworn to" before Fiscal Andres Reyes, the confession of Melencio 
contains this certification signed by two women stenographers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> "We hereby certify that this is a true and 
correct transcription of the stenographicnotes taken during the preliminary 
investigation conducted on May 26, 1954 by Asst. Fiscal Andres Reyes.</p>
<p align="right">"(Sgd.) JULIETA HERRERA<br>"Clk-Stenographer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="right">"(Sgd.) ESTER P. PAREDES<br>"Clk-Stenographer" </p>
<p>Which certification shows the answers given by Melencio had been given before 
said two women - not the police - and taken down stenographically by them, in an 
ordinary investigation by the Fiscal. </p>
<p>All of which means: the confession of Melencio like those of De Jesus, et 
al., must be accorded full evidentiary value. It must be observed that said 
confessions were presented a joint trial of all the accused.</p>
<p>Coming now to Castelo, the only direct evidence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> against him is the testimony of Robles, 
who swore: (1) that when he and Scarface were introduced by Ben Ulo one morning 
in May, 1953, Castelo told the latter in the presence of both Robles and 
Scarface that there was NEED to kill Monroy; and (2) that on June 1st, Castelo 
again suggested to Ben Ulo, Scarface and witness that Monroy should be killed 
AFTER he had left for Korea. In addition to this, Melencio mentions in his 
confession (3) that before Castelo boarded the plane for Korea on June 8th, 
Castelo called him and Ben Ulo aside, and urged that Monroy be killed BEFORE his 
return; (4) that a day after his return on June 26th, Castelo, in a gay mood 
patted Ben Ulo's back to say, "Good, we have nothing to worry about; but, Ben 
are you sure nobody saw?" to which Ben Ulo replied, "Nobody; it was a clean 
job." and (5) that before Castelo left for the United States in August, Castelo 
admonished; Ben Ulo in the presence of Melencio, "Ben, take care of the boys; be 
sure nobody talks, otherwise, we would be in a bad fix." </p>
<p>However, Castelo's counsel and the Solicitor-General strenuously insist that 
the lone testimony of Robles, which should be received with caution, is 
insufficient to warrant conviction; that Melencio's confession is utterly 
incompetent as against Castelo, for being double hearsay, to say nothing of 
Melencio's repudiation thereof; and that considering Robles' recantation, no 
proof remains in the record against Castelo who, a. <em>fortiori</em>, must be 
acquitted. This, then, requires examination of the testimony of Robles in both 
the original and the new trials, to deter-mine which of his conflicting stories 
reflected the true facts.</p>
<p>We have carefully examined his lengthy testimony during the original trial 
and have come to the conclusion that the fad-3narrated therein, although quite 
unusual, are not improbable considering the situation as a whole. Noteworthy it 
is that when subjected for several weeks to a searching and unrelenting 
cross-examination by several defense lawyers, this witness stood firm and 
steadfast in his assertions and answered his questioners with straightforward 
alacrity, and apparent spontaneity<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9-a]</sup>. 
On the other hand, his recantation at the new trial, alleging mistreatment and 
coercion, has been so completely rebutted by Feliciano Lazaro, Francisco 
Espiritu, Enrique A. Morales and Adolfo Arguelles of the Manila Police, as well 
as by Mayor Lacson, Fiscal Andres Reyes and newspaperman Primitivo Mijares, that 
we do not hesitate to hold it to be a mere afterthought, designed to rescue his 
former co-defendants and to deliver Castelo from the hands of the law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9-b]</sup>. This, apart from our wariness and 
skepticism in matters of retraction of prosecution witnesses made after a 
judgment of conviction. (Cf. U.S. vs. Valdes, 30 Phil.293 U.S. vs. Cu Unjieng, 
61 Phil. 906; U.S. vs. Dacir, 26 Phil. 503.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, the testimony of Robles linking Castelo with the conspiracy does 
not stand alone, as claimed, for it finds adequate support, and confirmation not 
only in the collective confessions of Miray, De Jesus, Bonifacio, Gonzales, 
Enriques, and Melencio and the finding of the gun parts in his possession, but 
in the totality of the evidence. These confessions are so intimately interwoven 
that it is hard, if not impossible, to draw a line with a view to sifting the 
individually admitted facts. In the absence of collusion among the declarants, 
their confession should be read together, in order to form a complete picture of 
the whole situation, and to consider them collectively merely at corroborative 
and/or confirmatory of the evidence independent therefrom. Thus, it is not 
improbable that Castelo and Ben Ulo had previously discussed between themselves 
the elimination of Monroy before Ben Ulo ever broached the subject to Scarface 
and Robles one morning. Neither is it improbable that when Ben Ulo introduced 
them later that same morning as his "boys", Castelo must have understood that 
they could be trusted; and so he was outspoken in suggesting Monroy's 
destruction, either, perhaps, to impress upon the "boys" that Ben Ulo was not 
joking, or to show that he, Castelo, was backing them up to the hilt with his 
double barrelled power as head of both the Justice Department and the Armed 
Forces of the country.</p>
<p>It is unbelievable, the defense contends, that Castelo should be so imprudent 
as to speak out his liquidation order to Mendoza <em>in the presence of 
strangers</em>. In the light of the confessions and the testimony, there are at 
least two additional reasons to explain this apparent "imprudence". First, he 
was issuing orders to a loyal subordinate or to would-be-subordinates; and the 
Shellborne incident shows him to be capable of carelessness - if not haughtiness 
- when he directed a colonel to arrest the Mayor of the City of Manila without 
any judicial warrant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>; Second, having 
been a fiscal, he assumed nobody would believe any witness who would testify to 
such recklessness of a Cabinet member. And third, his experience foresaw an 
airtight alibi should Monroy be killed <em>while he was in Korea</em>.</p>
<p>At this point, this thought occurs to us: if this prosecution were a mere 
concoction of Mayor Lacson and his police - as defense insinuates - how did they 
know that on June 1 (date when he made the order to kill Monroy during his 
absence), he had already made up his mind to proceed to Korea? (Castelo, 
himself, during the trial admitted that before June, he had made plans to travel 
abroad.) And why should the operatives of the NBI- subordinates of Castelo - 
cooperate in getting confessions reflecting against their boss? Not to mention 
the three fiscals - also under Castelo- who vigorously handled the 
prosecution.</p>
<p>Castelo argued that if he had wished to eliminate Monroy, iecould have asked 
his brother who was a sharpshooter - instead of employing so many accomplices. 
Yet it is not certain that his brother would be willing to expose his own neck. 
And this mode of reasoning does Castelo no credit, because besides assuming that 
his brother would do it, it reveals him as a man who would not hesitate to 
endanger the life or liberty of his own brother to further his ends.</p>
<p>The defense insists that contrary to the prosecution's theory, Castelo did 
not want Monroy to die; because the latter had voluntarily promised to retract 
his testimony given before the Blue Ribbon Committee. But knowing him as a 
"blackmailer", and double-crosser<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>, 
Castelo had reasons to distrust such promise, supposing it was made; and so, 
partly in revenge and partly to silence him forever, Castelo chose violent death 
having as he had, hardy henchmen to bring it about. The Blue Ribbon 
investigation could only produce removal from office. But disbarment will 
scuttle his means of support; and a rap for bribery could lead to prison. So 
"kailangan mapatay si Monroy," as he said.</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General regards Ben Ulo as the central figure in the 
conspiracy, <em>sans</em> Castelo, and suggests that he killed Monroy merely to 
curry Castelo's favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11-a]</sup> This view is 
highly speculative, for it is not likely that one would take another man's life, 
place his head on a silver platter and give it as a present to his master merely 
for a pat in the back. The evidence shows that none of Castelo’s co-appellants 
had any motive for desiring Monroy's demise. It was only Castelo, who had such 
motive. Monroy, whom he knew as a man "without scruples and capable of swindling 
his own mother," had testified in the Senate imputing bribery to him. Castelo's 
reputation and career, which were being trampled upon by a mere "police 
character", had to be protected; so that even though Monroy had already 
testified, there was still time to avert any further harm, i.e. disbarment and 
jail. And so, liquidation of Monroy appeared to be the only solution. And his 
trip to Korea offered a favorable coincidence.</p>
<p>His agents acted swiftly and surely. And as instructed, they kept their 
mouths shut. Even the MPD which was in the right track when it arrested Robles 
and Scarface ten days after the crime failed in its efforts because of the 
stubborn silence of both; and released them. Robles later explained that he did 
not confess anything at that time because he and Scarface enjoyed a certain 
degree of immunity, Ben Ulo being still "strong" and Castelo powerful. So the 
MPD had to release them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> This is an 
indication that - contrary to defense's theory - the police were not bent on 
obtaining confessions, by hook or by crook.</p>
<p>But truth will always out. The Shellborne incident occurring three weeks 
thereafter marked the beginning of the revelation. It confirmed that Castelo and 
Scarface were not, after all, strangers to each other. The MPD watching 
Scarface's movements must have known when he was actually "picked up"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and brought to the Shellborne Hotel where 
Castelo had his suite. This accounts for Mayor Lacson's leading the press, 
photographers and policemen to the Shellborne in order to take pictures of 
Castelo and together and/or to tape-record their conversation. Given his guilty 
connection with Scarface, Castelo's reaction to this could not be other than 
fright. So he had to summon the Constabulary and the Army to come to his aid, 
fearing that his complicity with the Monroy murder would at last be uncovered. 
He was "pale and jittery" (quoting Captain Montano) and, brushing aside his 
knowledge of the law and forgetting that he had been a fiscal and a judge, he 
ordered, without warrant, the arrest of Lacson, only to be frustrated by the 
Mayor's presence of mind. Melencio's confession furnishes a very plausible 
explanation why Scarface was in the hotel; he states that Ben Ulo had told him 
that they would pick up Scarface for confrontation with the old man (Castelo) 
because Scarface was about to spill the beans (babaliktad). Castelo must have 
been apprised of this, and thus his reaction and pronounced interest in keeping 
Scarface out of the reach of the police<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> - conduct which is certainly incompatible 
with his innocence. And a few weeks later, the potential squealer was killed 
mysteriously, and, what a coincidence - while Castelo was abroad, again.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION: To summarize, the following sufficiently show beyond reasonable 
doubt, the guilt of all the appellants: </p>
<p><em>Bienvenido Mendoza</em>.- All the confessions point to him as the 
mastermind, directing his "boys" in the slaying expedition. He in turn had 
received orders from Castelo: Rogelio Robles so declared in court. There is no 
doubt, he was the trusted bodyguard of Castelo - and a known killer. </p>
<p><em>Jose de Jesus.-<br>Hipolito Bonifacio.-<br>Domingo Gonzales.-<br>Felix 
Miray.-<br>Pedro Enriquez</em>.-</p>
<p>... Their confessions, wherein admitting their own participation in the 
crime, they indicated the other members of the liquidating squad. They were all 
pointed out at the trial by Rogelio Robles. Jose de Jesus shot Monroy<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>, while the others were located at 
strategic places nearby ready to shoot it out if necessary and/or to furnish 
means of retreat. Felix Miray drove one of the cars that carried the group to 
David Street, Pasay. At that time, Gonzales, Enriquez, Robles, Melencio and De 
Jesus were special agents of the Department of National Defense (recommended by 
Ben Ulo, his "boys"). And shortly after the death of Monroy, Bonifacio was 
appointed agent too - by Castelo naturally.</p>
<p>De Jesus as the triggerman, was seen by William Clemens and by Canlas, both 
of whom identified him in court. And Pedro Enriquez’ confession corroborated 
their assertions.</p>
<p><em>Augusto Melencio</em>.- His confession, parts of which have been 
transcribed above. The testimony of Robles linking him with the[liquidation 
squad. The confessions of his co-accused describing his participation.</p>
<p><em>Oscar Castelo</em>:- His desire and interest to eliminate Monroy. The 
testimony of Robles as to his orders to kill. The confession of Melencio as to 
such orders too. He had subservient bodyguards or Agents to do his bidding. The 
confessions of such agents. On top of all this, his conduct at the Shellborne 
Hotel revealed his culpable connection with the assassination plot. In fine, the 
case of the People is so strong against him, that it would be unjust to set him 
free and yet imprison his seven subordinates who merely carried out his 
commands. </p>
<p><em>Motion for New Trial.</em>- There is pending here a motion for new trial, 
for the purpose of proving that others killed Monroy. The Solicitor-General 
recommending conviction of six appellants, impliedly disagrees with the motion. 
So, given our findings, and our rulings in the matter, such motion is denied. 
(Cf. People <em>vs</em>. Hernandez, May 23, 1952, L-3391; People <em>vs</em>. 
Buluran, May 24.1964, L-5849; People <em>vs</em>. Manadi, 52 Off. Gaz. 2010.) 
</p>
<p>Wherefore, the conviction for murder – qualified by premeditation - of all 
the herein accused-appellants is affirmed. There are aggravating circumstances, 
like night-time, aid of armed men, etc. but for lack of sufficient votes, they 
are all sentenced to life-imprisonment and to indemnify the heirs of Monroy, 
jointly and severally, in the sum of six thousand pesos (P6,000.00), and to pay 
costs. </p>
<p>So ordered. </p><em>Bengzon, C. J., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala,</em> and <em>Makalintal, 
JJ.,</em> concur. <br><br><br>
