				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The assignment of respondent Judge to conduct the trial for the
crimes of arson as well as of <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> for which
petitioner Alfredo C. Ignacio was indicted started the train of events that led
to this proceeding for certiorari.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner was convicted of arson and sentenced to suffer a penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<u>temporal</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In the decision of respondent Judge in the arson case, he stated the
following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"For instance, it had
been duly established that <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> Ignacio and
Francisco Lara were among those consistently present in the meetings or
conferences called by Alfredo Ignacio wherein his personal problems such as his
substantial shortage and <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> case were
mentioned and discussed, during which meetings or conferences, they agreed to
burn the provincial capitol building of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in
order to destroy all evidences (<u>sic</u>) that may be used against him in his
<span class="SpellE">malversation</span> case and to prevent discovery of his
shortage in his accounts which amounted to P200,000.00, more or less.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motive for the burning of the capitol
building by the accused Alfredo Ignacio and his henchmen had been duly
established not only by the written statement of <span class="SpellE">Romualdo</span>
Santiago but also by his testimony in court and also by the logical and
inescapable conclusion that because of the big shortage of Alfredo Ignacio in
his accounts and his <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> case, he had
conceived and nurtured, even premeditated on the idea of burning all the
evidences of said shortage and his <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> case
as his last recourse to escape financial accountability and criminal liability <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *
Actually, however, thirty (30) of the forty (40) checks issued by accused
Alfredo Ignacio had been <span class="SpellE">encashed</span> to himself and Mr.
Pedro Flores, paying them from Government Funds under their respective custody,
thereby giving rise to his (Alfredo Ignacio's) <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say, these facts and
circum­stances are mute but eloquent proofs that Alfredo Ignacio and his
cohorts among whom are his own son <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> Ignacio
and Francisco Lara had resorted to the burning of the Provincial Capitol
Building so that all evidences (<u>sic</u>) kept therein and intended to be
used against him in his shortage and his <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>
case may all be destroyed and totally suppressed, and at the same time prevent
the discovery of the shortage in his accounts as Cashier III of the District
Engineer's Office of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Province."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">It was mainly on the basis of the above statement that petitioner
moved for the inhibition of respondent Judge "praying that respondent
Judge voluntarily inhibit himself from trying the said <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>
cases pursuant to the second paragraph of Section 1, Rule 137 of the Revised
Rules of Court which provides that 'a judge may, in the exercise of his sound
discretion, disqualify himself from sitting in a case, for just or valid
reasons other than those mentioned above.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
He further stated "that because of the above findings made by His Honor in
the arson case, it would be highly improbable to expect his Honor to view the
evidence that petitioner may present in the <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>
cases objectively and impartially inasmuch as whatever evidence petitioner may
present to show his innocence of the charge of <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>,
His Honor, influenced by his earlier pronouncement that the <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>
was the motive for the arson, would find it difficult to reverse the basis of
his judgment of conviction in the arson case, considering that 'however upright
the judge, and however free from the slightest inclination but to do justice,
there is peril of his unconscious bias or prejudice (Del Castillo v. <span class="SpellE">Javelona</span>, et al., L-16742, Sept. 29, 1962, 6 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 146, 149-151), and that 'any former opinion * * * may
still linger to affect unconsciously his present judgment, or lest he may be
moved or swayed unconsciously by his knowledge of the facts which may not be
revealed or stated at the trial, or cannot under the rules of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No effort of the will can shut out memory;
there is no art of forgetting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot
be certain that the human mind will deliberate and determine unaffected by that
which it knows, but which it should forget in that process * * *' (Gutierrez v.
Santos, L-15824, May 30, 1961)."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Such petition for inhibition was denied by respondent Judge.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Immediate recourse was taken to this Court as a motion for reconsideration
would be useless and to no avail as respondent Judge had made the parties
understand that his denial was irrevocable.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court required respondent Judge as well as the other
respondent, the People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
to comment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the Comment submitted by
Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span> P. Mendoza,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
he alleged "that the actuations of the respon­dent Judge in the <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> cases against petitioner do not, by
themselves, constitute sufficient and indubitable grounds to disqualify said
judge from further trying and hearing said cases, * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Nonetheless, they submitted that "in view of the close causal connection
between Criminal Cases Nos. 569 to 594 against petitioner for <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> and Criminal Case No. 559 also against the
latter for arson, and wherein the respondent judge, in convicting petitioner of
said crime of arson, found that the motive of petitioner and his co-accused in
burning the provincial capitol building of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> was
precisely to destroy all evidences threat that could be used against said
petitioner in the <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> cases against him, are
constrained to agree with petitioner that sufficient reasons exist for him to
entertain serious doubts and misgivings as to the degree of objectivity and
neutrality with which the respondent judge can continue to try, and eventually
decide, said <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> cases against him,
considering that 'however upright the judge, and however free from the
slightest inclination to do justice, there is peril of his unconscious bias or
prejudice' (Del Castillo v. <span class="SpellE">Javelona</span>, 6 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 146), so that to insure compliance with the demands of
due process, to which every accused is entitled, and in order that it may be
said that every effort is always exerted to attain the ideal of an impartial
administration of justice, the better alternative under the circumstances would
be for the respondent judge to inhibit or disqualify himself from further
continuing with the trial of said <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> cases,
thus assuring petitioner 'the cold neutrality of an impartial judge' (Gutierrez
v. Santos, 2 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 249); * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">petitory</span>

recommended that an order be issued by this Honorable Court reversing the order
of the respondent judge denying petitioner Alfredo Ignacio's petition for
inhibition in Criminal Cases Nos. 569 to 594 for <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>;
ordering said judge to desist from further hearing and trying the aforesaid <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> cases; and further ordering that said cases be
