				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These are two cases instituted by the Solicitor General for the
Commissioner, of Immigration:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>G. R. No.
L-24844, is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of</p>

<p class="BODY">Manila in Civil Case No. 61824 for a writ of <u>Habeas Corpus</u>,
declaring as null and void the warrant issued by appellant Immigration
Commissioner, for the exclusion from this country of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>,
and ordering the immediate release of the latter from the custody of
immigration authorities; while G. R. No. L-24853 is a petition for certiorari
and prohibition, in which petitioner Commissioner of Immigration assails as in
excess of jurisdiction and with grave abuse of discretion, the issuance by the
same court of first instance of the aforementioned order .to release Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> from detention and of the permanent injunction
against his arrest, exclusion or deportation.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute as to the following facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 25, 1961, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>, a
minor, arrived at the Manila International Airport aboard a Cathay-Pacific
Airways plane, together with four other persons supposedly his father (Jose <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>), an aunt and two brothers, and sought entry as
a Filipino citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not satisfied with
his papers, the immigration officer referred the case of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> to the Special Board of Inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">This body, after due
hearing, rendered decision on July 6, 19 61 (in I. C. Nos. 61-2108-C to 61-2114-C)
admitting Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> and seven others, as
Filipino citizens.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Submitted to
the individual members of the Board of Commissioners, the decision was marked
'noted' by Commissioners <span class="SpellE">Talabis</span> and De la Rosa on July
14 and 26, 1961, respectively, while Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>
voted to "exclude" the persons subject of the decision, on Aug­ust
21, 1961.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1961</st1:date>,
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> was issued Identification
Certificate No. 16132 by the immigration authorities, attesting to his
admission as citizen of the Philippines as per decision of the Board of Special
Inquiry dated July 6, 1961.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1962</st1:date>,
the Secretary of Justice, as department head, issued Memorandum Order No. 9,
directing the Immigration Commissioners to review all cases where entry was allowed
on the ground that the entrant was a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(Records, p. 37).</p>

<p class="BODY">In July, 1962, the Board of Commissioners, allegedly after review
of the entire proceedings had before the Board of Special Inquiry, reversed the
decision of the latter body and ordered the exclusion of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>, for being improperly documented (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subject of
the decision was accordingly notified of the Commissioners' ruling through his
counsel (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 6).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But, although the warrant for his exclusion was issued in July, 1962,
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> was taken into custody by the
immigration authorities only on June 6, 19 65 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>
7).</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 21, 1965, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Arocha</span>, on behalf of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>,
petitioned the Court of First Instance of Manila for a writ of, <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>
(<span class="SpellE">Civ</span>. Case No. 61824), claiming that the detention of
<span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>, a Filipino, by the Immigration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Commissioner,</span> is <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of said petitioner's constitutional rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents immigration officials countered
that the exclusion order was issued Pursuant to the decision of the Board of
Commissioners dated July 6, 1962, finding Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>
to have failed in proving the allega­tion that he is a Filipino citizen.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the trial, the issues in controversy centered on the
actual date of rendition of the Commissioners' decision, revers­ing that of the
Special Board of Inquiry; and the validity of that Commissioners' decision,
admittedly issued <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>
and without affording petitioner opportunity to be heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was therein petitioner's contention that
the decision was originally dated July 20, 1962, which date was erased and
superimposed with another figure to read July 6, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, respondents alleged that
the erasures were made to correct clerical mistakes.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision of July 31, 1965, the court sustained
petitioner's theory that the decision of reversal of the Board of Commissioners
was antedated and issued beyond the prescribed one-year period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Holding that the decision of the Special
Board of Inquiry, admitting the Philippine citizenship of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> had already become final, the Court ordered his
immediate release from detention and enjoined respondents, permanently, from
arresting, deporting and otherwise depriving him of his liberty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the strength of a writ of <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>,
issued by the Court, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> was released
from custody of the immigration authorities at 9 o'clock in, the evening of
August 3, 19 65.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notified of the abovementioned decision of the lower Court,
respondents filed notice to appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, on
August 3, 1965, and this appeal was docketed in this Court as G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-24844.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition,
the Commissioner of Immigration also came to this Court on August 9, 1965, for
writs of certiorari and prohibition (G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-24853, by
charging the Court below with grave abuse of discretion in ordering the
immediate release of <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> notwithstanding the
perfection of an appeal from the decision of said court, contrary to the
provisions of Section 20, Rule 41 of the Revised Rules of Court.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The cause of petitioner and appellant Commissioner of Immigration
in this Court hinges on the issue of the correct date of promulgation of the
decision of the Board of Commissioners reversing that of the Special Board of
Inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For if, indeed, the re­versal
was made on July 20, 1962, as asserted by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
and respondent <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>, instead of July 6, 1962,
as maintained by herein appellant and petitioner, then the admission on July 6,
1961 by the Special Board of Inquiry of the fact of <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian's</span>
Philippine citizenship would have become final and, therefore, his detention by
the immigration authorities would be unlawful.</p>

<p class="BODY">The parties are agreed that pursuant to Section 27(b) of
Commonwealth Act 613, as amended by Republic Act 503, the decision of the Board
of Special Inquiry shall become final unless reversed on appeal by the Board of
Commissioners, or in the absence of en appeal, unless reversed by the Board of
Commissioners after a re­view by it, <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>, of the entire proceedings <u>within one
year from the promulgation of the said decision</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant cases, the <span class="GramE">decision of the Board
of Commissioners (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 5), the notification to <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> counsel that such decision was rendered (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 6), and the warrant of exclusion (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
7), bear</span> the date July 6, 1962, or within one year from the reviewed
decision of the Board of Special Inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is contended, however, that in all of these documents, the date of
promulgation of the decision appeared to have been originally written as July
20, 1962, but the number "20" was erased and superimposed by
"6".</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Commissioner of Immigration insists that these erasures
and substitutions were corrections made only to rectify clerical mistakes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, according to appellant, there is
proof that the decision was actually rendered on July 6, 1962, pointing to a
certification of the Secretary to the Board of Commissioners that the said body
voted to exclude the applicants in I.C. Cases Nos. 61-2113-0, 2114-C and
2110-C, Gloria <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> et al., on July 6, 1962 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 5-A); and to the minutes of the meeting of that Board
indicating that the matter of admission of Gloria <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>
et al. was taken up on July 6, 1962 (Annex F, to L-24853).</p>

<p class="BODY">As previously stated, the Court of First Instance agreed with the
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> that the erasures indicated that the
original date was July "20", but that the figures had been erased and
retyped as "6"; and concluded that the Commissioners’ decision and
the warrant of exclusion had been antedated, in order to bring the decision
within the one-year term fixed by Section 27(b) of Commonwealth Act 613, as
amended, wherein the proceedings before the Board of Special Inquiry may be
reviewed and revoked, either upon ap­peal or <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> by the Board of Immigration
Commissioners. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The Court below held,
therefore, that the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry, declaring Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> to be a Filipino citi­zen had become final and
definitive.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not believe that the mere fact of a retyping of dates an
the face of the documents, without further evidence of record, suffices to
convict the three members of the Board of Immigration Commissioners of
maliciously antedating their decision, considering the presumption of
regularity in official actuations, and the serious implications of the charge,
which amounts to no less than falsification of official documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an offense cannot be lightly inferred;
but must be clearly proved beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, the accusation is <span class="SpellE">negatived</span>
by the official minutes of the Board's proceedings (Exhibit 5-<span class="GramE">A</span> in case G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-24844 and Annex F,
in case G. R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-24853), which clearly show that
the resolution to exclude was adopted on July 6, 1962.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>No alteration in dates appear; in these
Exhibits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it goes without saying
that the operative date of the Commissioners’ action is that when the
resolution of exclusive was voted and adopted by them as a Board, regardless of
the date when the decision <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>extenso</u></span>
was prepared, written and signed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, the alterations observed by the Court below are susceptible of the
explana­tion that the date July 20 was originally placed by the stenographer or
typist because it was then that the reasoned and extended decision was
typewritten in final form, but that it was corrected to July 6, the date it was
voted, because the decision <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>extenso</u></span>
must relate back to the day the resolution to exclude was actually
adopted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily, the extended
opinion had to be posterior to the day when the Commissioners voted and
resolved to reverse he findings of the Board of Special.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inquiry, The Secretary's certificate (Annex
F, L-24853) shows that the Board of Immigration Commissioners acted upon not
less than eight immigration cases (including that of the <span class="SpellE">Gatchalians</span>)
on July 6, 1962; and it was of course impracticable to prepare and sign fully
reasoned decisions in all these cases on the same day.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, it would have been senseless for the Board of
Immigration Commissioners to have taken a vote and decided the <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> cases on July 20 (and there is no evidence that
they ever did so), because the Commissioners were familiar with the law and
knew that such a decision would be useless, as the period of review had already
lapsed since July 6.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is argued for the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> that the
minutes in <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 5-A refer only to the cases of
Gloria, Francisco and Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the designation of the case is
"Gloria <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> et al." No reason is
shown why the case of these three should be considered and voted upon
separately, considering that the claims to citizenship and entry of all were
based on the same circumstances, applicants being the descendants of one
Santiago <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>, a Filipino, and that all their
applications for entry were in fact jointly resolved by the Board of Inquiry in
one single decision (Annex I, petition, G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-24844).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, conclude that the Court below erred in finding and
declaring that the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry in the case of
petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had become final and <span class="SpellE">unreviewable</span>, and that its review and revocation by the
Commissioners of Immigra­tion was null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> also argues that the decision
of the Inquiry Board had become non-<span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> since
1961 because of its confirmation by the majority of the proceeding Board of
Commissioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is pointed out that
two members of the latter board (<span class="SpellE">Talabis</span> and De la
Rosa) in reference to said decision had marked "Noted" over their own
signatures, while only the third Commissioner made of record his adverse
opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such argument is untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">First, even disregarding the ambiguity of the term
"Noted" the former Immigration Commissioners appeared to have acted
individually in this particular instance and not as a Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is shown by the different dates affixed to
their signatures that they did not actually meet to discuss and vote on the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was officially made of record
by the Secretary of Justice in his Memorandum Order No. 9, of January 24, 1962,
wherein he stated</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">that</span> for the
past several years , the Board of Commissioners of Immigration <u>has not
met<span style="">&nbsp; </span>collectively</u> to discuss and
deliberate in the cases coming before it." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 3, Rec. p. 37, C. F. Inst. Case No. 61824, G. R. No.</span>
L?24844)" (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Individual action by members of a board plainly renders nugatory
the purpose of its constitution as a Board.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Legislature organized the Board of Commissioners precisely in order
that they should deliberate collectively and in order that their views and ideas
should be exchanged and examined before reaching a conclusion (See Ryan vs.
Humphries, LRA 1915F 1047).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This process
as of the essence of a board's action, save where otherwise provided by law,
and the salutary effects of the rule would be lost were the members to act
individually, without benefit of discussion.</p>

<blockquote>"The powers and duties of boards and commissions may not be
exercised by the individual members separately.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their acts are official only when done by the members convened in
session, upon a concurrence of at least a majority and with at least a quorum
present." <span class="GramE">(42 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. 389,
sec.74).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Where the action needed is not of the individuals composing a
board but of the official body, the members must be together and act in their
official capacity, and the action should appear on the records of the
board." <span class="GramE">(Penn. R. Co. vs. Montgomery Co. Pass.</span> R.
Co., 167 P 2d. <span class="GramE">62, 27 LRA 766).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Where a duty is entrusted to a board,
composed of different individuals, that board can act officially only as such,
in convened session, with the members, or a quorum thereof, present."</span>
(State vs. Kelly, 21 ALR 156).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, in consonance with the foregoing principles, the
aforementioned Memorandum Order of the Secretary of Justice, issued in the
exercise of his powers of control and supervision as Department Head, (Adm.
Code, sec. 79[c]), expressly declares that –</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">the</span> public
interest so requiring, it is hereby ordered that all decisions purporting to
have been rendered by the Board of Commissioners on appeal from or on review <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> of
decisions of the Boards of Special Inquiry, are set aside."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">and</span> this
nullification included the alleged 1961 decision which the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
now invokes and upon which he relies.</p>

<blockquote>Finally, it is well to note that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
did not traverse the allegation of appellant Commissioners in their return to
the writ of <u>Habeas</u> <u>Corpus</u> that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> gained entry on the strength of a
forged cablegram, purportedly signed by the former Secretary of Foreign Affairs
<span class="SpellE">Felixberto</span> Serrano, and apparently authorizing <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> documentation as a Filipino (par. 3[a] of
Return, C.F.I. Rec., pp. 15-16).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
failure to deny imports admission of its truth by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
and establishes that his entry was irregular.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither has he appealed the decision of the Commissioners of Immigration
to the Department Head.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Proceeding on another tack, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> stresses that he was not heard by the Board of
Commissioners, and invokes Commissioner of Immigration vs. Fernandez, L-22 696,
May 29, 1964, as ruling that an applicant is entitled to be heard in-review by
the Board of Commissioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever was
said in that sense in the <u>Fernandez</u> case is pure <u>obiter</u> <u>dictum</u>,
since the issue therein was the power and right of the Court of Appeals, to
grant bail to a detainee whose case was pending therein on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the right to hearing declared in
the <u>Fernandez</u> case was recognized in connection with the attempt of a
Board of Commissioners to review a ruling of the preceding Board that had
previously affirmed the findings of the Board of Special Inquiry, where the <u>validity
of the first ruling was not questioned</u>; while in the present case, as has
been shown, there is no valid confirmatory decision of the preceding Board of
Immigration Commissioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reality,
the right to representation by counsel before the Immigration Commissioners is
only granted by the Immigration Law (sec. 27(c) of C. A. 613) in cases of
appeal by the alien from an adverse decision of the Board of Inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"(c) An alien <u>excluded</u> by a board of special inquiry or
a dissenting member thereof <u>may appeal</u> to the Board of Commissioners,
whose decision in the case shall be final.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The decision on appeal shall be put in writing and promulgated not less
than seven days from the time the case is submitted for decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>In appeal cases</u>, the alien shall have
the <u>right to be represented</u> by an attorney or counsel who shall have
access to the record of the board of special inquiry in the particular case on
appeal." (Come Act 613, as amended by Rep. Act 503).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Plainly, the quoted provision does not by its terms apply to a
review <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>propio</u></span>
by the Board of Immigrations Commissioners of decision admitting an alien, as
in the case at bar; for in such eases, the reviewing Board only passes on the
sufficiency of evidence already produced before the Board of Special
Inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alien, having been already
heard by the latter, is not entitled to further hearing unless the law so
provides.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is particularly true in
administrative proceedings (<span class="SpellE">Cornejo</span> vs. Gabriel, 41
Phil. 193, quoted and followed in Bishop vs. <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>,
L-18365, May 31, 19 63).</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing facts and <span class="GramE">considerations,</span>
clearly prove, in our opinion, that the decision appealed from was erroneous on
the facts and the law; and considering the powers vested by statute in the
Immigration authorities, the order of release issued by the Court below was
unwarranted and improper, and should be set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is likewise unavoidable to conclude, that the enforcement of
the order to release <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>, notwithstanding the appeal interposed by the
Immigration Commissioner from the decision under review, was in plain violation
of section 15, Revised Rule <span class="GramE">102 ,</span> and in patent excess
of jurisdiction.</p>
