				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On 17 April 1957, the plaintiff-appellant Republic of the
Philippines filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo
(docketed there­in as its Civil Case No. 4368) for the expropriation of certain
parcels of land needed for the widening and improvement of the Iloilo South
Road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Simultaneously, it took possession
of the properties involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> Jose C. <span class="SpellE">Tayengco</span>
and Alicia <span class="SpellE">Schmid</span> Echols, who owned the lands, did
not contest the plaintiff's right to expropriate, but objected to the amount of
compensation which they contended should be P60.00 instead of P17.00 per square
meter.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1958" day="17" month="1">17 January 1958</st1:date>,
<st1:place><st1:placename>plaintiff</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Republic</st1:placetype></st1:place>
deposited with the City Treasurer the sum of P12<span class="GramE">,149.22</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon application by the defendants, the trial
court, in an order on <st1:date year="1958" day="25" month="1">25 January 1958</st1:date>,
authorized them to withdraw the deposited amount, apportioned as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose C. <span class="SpellE">Tayengco</span>,
P2<span class="GramE">,117.86</span>; Alicia <span class="SpellE">Schmid</span>
Echols, P10,131.36.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding the reasonable value of the properties to be P35.00 per
square meter, as evaluated by the commissioners, the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span>rendered judgment ordering the plaintiff to pay Jose C. <span class="SpellE">Tayengco</span> the total sum of P4,360.30 and to Alicia <span class="SpellE">Schmid</span> Echols the total sum of P20,652.80 "<span class="SpellE">mas</span> <span class="SpellE">sus</span> <span class="SpellE">intereses</span>
<span class="SpellE">legales</span> a <span class="SpellE">razon</span> de 6% al <span class="SpellE">año</span> <span class="SpellE">desde</span> el 17 de <span class="SpellE">abril</span> 1957, <span class="SpellE">pero</span> <span class="SpellE">debiendo</span> <span class="SpellE">acreditarse</span> a favor de
la <span class="SpellE">demandante</span> <span class="SpellE">las</span> <span class="SpellE">cantidades</span> <span class="SpellE">recibidas</span> <span class="SpellE">respectivamente</span> <span class="SpellE">por</span> <span class="SpellE">los</span> <span class="SpellE">demandados</span> en <span class="SpellE">virtud</span> de la <span class="SpellE">Orden</span> de 25 <span class="SpellE">enero</span>, 1958, <span class="SpellE">como</span> <span class="SpellE">pagos</span> <span class="SpellE">parciales</span> a <span class="SpellE">cuenta</span> del valor de sus respectivos terrenos." <span class="GramE">(Decision, Rec. on App. p. 66).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff Republic moved to reconsider the decision, such that
the interest should be imposed only on the balance after deducting the amount
of the deposit from the total compensation; upon denial, it appealed to the
Court of Appeals, which court, resolving the case as one involving purely a
question of law, certified the same to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff-appellant urges that since it had deposited the
amount of P12,149.22 on 17 January 1958, the 6% interest should be limited only
to the balance after deducting this amount from the total award of P25,013.10,
a method of payment claimed to be in accord with Republic vs. Lara, et al., 96
Phil. 170.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing proposition, although apparently valid, is, in
fact, partially incorrect because in the present case, the appellant deposited
the sum of P12<span class="GramE">,149.22</span> not at the time it filed the
complaint on 17 April 1958 nor at the time it took possession of the
properties, but only nine (9) months later, on 17 January 1958, while in the <u>Lara</u>
case, the plaintiff deposited the provisional amount at the commencement of the
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proposition fails to
recognize that interests had accrued from the time of taking of the condemned
properties or from the time of filing of the complaint to the time the
plaintiff made a deposit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Applying to the facts at hand, the doctrine enunciated in
Philippine Railway Co. <span style="">vs. </span>Solon,
13 Phil. 34; Philippine Railway Co. vs. Duran, 33 Phil. 163; and Manila Railway
Co. <span style="">vs. </span>Attorney-General, 41
Phil. 161, reiterated in the cases of Capitol <span style="">Subdivision, </span>Inc. vs. Province of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental, G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-16257, </span><st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="1"><span class="GramE">31 Jan. 1963</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> and Republic vs. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>, G.R. No.</span>
L-13684, 26 July 1960, that owners of expropriated lands are entitled to
recover interest from the date the <span class="SpellE">condemnor</span> takes
possession of the lands and the amounts granted by the court shall cease to
earn interest only from the moment they are paid to the owners or deposited in
court, and following the method applied in the foregoing cases, including the <u>Lara</u>
case, the defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayengco</span>
and Echols should be paid legal interest on their respective awards of
P4,360.30 and P20,625.80 from 17 April 1957; however, the amount of P12,149.22
(or P2,117.86 to <span class="SpellE">Tayengco</span> and P10,131.36 to Echols)
shall cease to bear interest as of the date it was deposited on 17 January
1958.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the foregoing
premises</span>, the appealed decision is hereby affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
