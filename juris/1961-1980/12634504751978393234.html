				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In his petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (<span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City),
filed January <span style="">6, 1961, </span>Manuel To
<u>alias</u> Manuel <span class="SpellE">Toh</span> alleges that he was born on
June <span style="">6, </span>1937 at <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, although he
has been residing in the City of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> since 1955;
that he is single and a citizen or subject of the Republic <span style="">of </span>China; that he speaks and writes
English and <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>; that he <span style="">is </span>an employee of Elite Textile
Company with an average annual income of P3,<span style="">600.00; </span>that he is exempt from filing a declaration <span style="">of </span>in­tention because he <span style="">was </span>born in
the Philippines and received his primary and secondary education in schools
recognized by the Philippine Government and not limited to any race or
nationality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner further alleges
that he believes in the principle underlying the Philippine Constitution; that
he has conducted himself in a proper and irreproach­able manner during the
entire period of his residence in the Philippines; that he has mingled socially
with the Filipinos and evinced a sincere desire to embrace their cus­toms,
traditions and ideals; that he is not opposed to or­ganized government nor does
he uphold and teach any doctrine <span style="">opposing all organized governments; that he is not a
polygamist nor a believer in polygamy; that he has never been convicted of any
crime involving moral turpitude; that he is not suffering from mental
alienation or any incurable contagious disease.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In short, petitioner claims that he has all the qualifications and none
of the disqualifica­tions to be </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">Filipino citizen as provided in the Naturalization
Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition <span style="">is </span>accompanied
by the joint affidavit of two character witnesses, namely <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
M. <span class="SpellE">Mauleon</span> and William C. Limos. After the required
publication of the petition in the <u><span style="">Official</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>Gazette</u> and in a newspaper <span style="">of general
circulation (Daily Mirror), trial on the merits was held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="9" month="1"><span style="">January
 9, 1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> rendered judg­ment finding petitioner
qualified for Philippine citizenship and granted his prayer to be admitted as <span class="GramE">a</span> citizen of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In due time the Solicitor General interposed the present appeal
and submits, among others, that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> <span style="">err</span>ed: (a) in not finding that
petitioner does not have a lucrative occupation; and (b) in not finding that
the two character witnesses have not sufficiently known peti­tioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon careful examination of the record, we find this appeal to be
meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">To establish his financial qualifications, petitioner claims to
be receiving an average annual income of P3<span class="GramE">,600.00</span>, <u>more</u>
<u>or</u> <u>less</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In his income tax return for the calendar year 1961 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> H-5), it appears that P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
of that amount is in the nature of a bonus.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It has been repeatedly held by this Court that for purposes of
determining whether or not applicant has a lucrative occupation bonuses cannot
be taken into consideration, since they are by nature indefinite and contingent
(Ng vs. Republic L-21179, January 22, 1966; <span class="SpellE">Pe</span> vs.
Republic, L-20375, January 31, 1966; Kong vs. Republic, L-20505, February 28,
1966; Book vs. Republic, L-20712, February 28, 1966; Sam vs. Republic, L-20812,
September 22, 1967).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
petitioner's average annual income should properly be considered <span style="">as </span>P2<span class="GramE">,600.00</span>
only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This smaller amount cannot be
considered lucrative, considering the present high standard of living and the
low purchasing power of money.</p>

<blockquote>"Lucrative employment means a gain­ful employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is
</span>not only that the person having the employment gets enough for his
ordinary necessities in life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be
shown that the employment gives one an income such that there is an ap­preciable
margin of his income over his expenses as to be able to provide for an adequate
support in the event of unemploy­ment, sickness, or disability to work and thus
avoid one's being becoming the object of charity or public charge." <span class="GramE">(Tan vs. Republic, L-19580, April 30, 1965).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">Besides, in <u>Tan vs.
Republic</u> (G. R. No.</span> L-22077, <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="2">February
 18, 1967</st1:date>) we did not consider an unmarried man earning P300.00 a <span style="">month, plus </span>an annual bonus of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> from <span style="">his </span>employer,
as having satisfactorily established possession of lucrative income as required
by law.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The attesting witnesses here, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
M. <span class="SpellE">Mauleon</span> and Mt. William C. Limos, say they have
known petitioner since 1951, and testified as to his good behavior
thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the requisite
qualifications for naturalization is that petitioner "must have conducted
himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during the <u>entire</u> period
of his residence in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>"
(Sec. 2, CA 473).</p>

<p class="BODY">The attesting witnesses must be in a position to establish this
circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case, petitioner's
witnesses admit that their contact with him consisted of isolated meetings
during vacation time, when petitioner would spend a day or two with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such occasional meetings are not sufficient
to enable them to observe petitioner's behavior, or to know his character, his
beliefs, <span style="">his </span>social contacts
and associations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, they
are not in a position to know whether or not petitioner has the qualification
of pro­per and irreproachable conduct "during the entire period of his
residence." <span class="GramE">(See <span class="SpellE">Seng</span> vs.
Republic, G. R. No.</span> L-23936, <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="9">September
 13, 1967</st1:date>.)</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is reversed and the
petition is denied with costs against petitioner.</p>
