				<H3>THE GEORGE W. LOFT COMPANY, INC., PETITIONER, VS. NGO GUAN AND DIRECTOR OF PATENTS, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align=""><div align="justify"><br><p>This is a petition for review of a decision and a resolution of the Director 
of Patents.</p>
<p>Petitioner, George W. Luft Co., Inc. — a foreign corporation organized under 
the lavs of the State of New York — is the owner of the trademark "Tangee", 
which it has allegedly used since February 28, 1928, and is covered by Certifi- 
cate of Registration No. 2178-S of the Philippine Patent Office, dated February 
21, 1950. On January 22, 1959, Ngo Guan applied for the registration of the 
trademark "Tango", which he claims to have used since June, 1958. Petitioner 
objected thereto alleging that "Tango" is likely to be mistaken for "Tangee", 
upon the ground that the two trademarks are confusingly similar.</p>
<p>After appropriate proceedings the Director of Patents rendered a decision 
overruling said opposition and granting Ngo Guan's application. A 
reconsideration of this decision having been denied, petitioner brought the mat 
ter before this Court for a review of said decision and of the resolution 
denying a reconsideration thereof.</p>
<p>The only issue for our determination is whether or not the "Tango" trademark 
is confusingly similar with the "Tangee" trademark, as contended by petitioner 
herein, as to be likely to be mistaken for the latter by the unsuspecting 
public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Petitioner, which has the 
burden of proving its contention, has not, however, done so.</p>
<p>To begin with, one of the factors essential therefor is whether or not there 
is a general similarity <em>in the appearance</em> of the trademarks in 
question, which can not be determined with reasonable certainty without a 
physical examination and comparison thereof. Petitioner has rendered such 
examination impossible, by not introducing any evidence whatsoever as to the 
appearance of the "Tangee" trademark. What is more, such omission suggests that 
its appearance is not analogous to that of respondent's "Tango", for, otherwise, 
petitioner would not have failed to present a sample of its trademark, for 
comparison with that of respondent Ngo Guan.</p>
<p>Moreover, the word "Tango" has a well established meaning, for it describes a 
particular dance that is well known in the Philippines. In fact, respondent's 
label includes the picture of a man and a woman dancing. Again, "Tango" is used 
by Ngo Guan for <em>no other</em> product than <em>hair pomade</em>, in which 
petitioner does not deal. Upon the other hand, petitioner's trademark is used 
for specified chemicals, medical and pharmaceutical preparations— namely: 
"lipstick, creme rouge, compact rouge, cleansing cream, day cream, night cream, 
massage cream, face lotion, astringent, face powder, powder compacts, cosmetics 
for lashes, brows, and halt, hair pencils, nail polish, perfumes, and toilet 
waters — and it is not claimed that Ngo Guan uses or intends to use its "Tango" 
trademark on articles of this kind.</p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision and the resolution appealed from are hereby 
affirmed, with costs against petitioner, George W. Luft Co., Inc.</p>
<p><strong>IT IS SO ORDERED</strong><b>.</b></p><em>Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, 
Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez</em>, and <em>Ruiz 
Castro, JJ</em>., concur.<br><br><br>
