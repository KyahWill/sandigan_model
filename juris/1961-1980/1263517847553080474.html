				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner Luzon Surety
Co., Inc., far from reconciled with the prospect of having to comply with the
writ of execution dated September 27, 1966 issued by the clerk of court of
respondent Judge Eduardo D. Enriquez of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, for the satisfaction of the amount of
P8,732.23, a liability allegedly imposed on it without its right to procedural
due process having been respected, filed this special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>
with a writ of preliminary injunction on November 22, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More specifically, it would seek to nullify
such a writ as it was not in accordance with a previous order of respondent
Judge on which it was presumably based, allegedly issued without petitioner
having been heard, a matter of more than ordinary significance as there was a
previous order <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> the two bonds executed by
it for respondent executor Pastor <span class="SpellE">Quebrar</span>, handed
down as early as October 20, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">movants</span>, </span><span class="SpellE">Leovegilda</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> <span class="SpellE">Beson</span> as well as <span class="SpellE">Cocepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Beson</span> de Gutierrez, herein after referred to as Bosons<span style="">, </span><span class="GramE">were</span> also

</span><span style="">surety </span><span style="">firm, the Manila Surety &amp; Fidelity Co.,

 11, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, subscribed
to an executor's bond with respondent Pastor <span class="SpellE">Quebrar</span>
for exactly the above amount of</span><span style=""> P

is whether, on the facts as above summarized, to be hereafter set forth </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">detail, petitioner is entitled to the writ prayed for.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The order of August 6,
1966 of respondent Judge, on which the assailed writ of execution is made to
rest, had its origin in a motion, filed on July 18, 1966 by the <span class="SpellE">Besons</span>, for the confiscation of the executor's bond,
wherein it was alleged that in a previous order of June 25, 1966 respondent
Judge directed the executor to reimburse the two estates, the </span>proceedings
for the <span style="">settlement </span>of which were
held jointly, the <span style="">amount of P8<span class="GramE">,732.23</span> within ten days from receipt thereof, otherwise the
bond would be confiscated and that though more than fifteen days had since
elapsed, such an order was not complied with.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> To such </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">motion, there was an
opposition filed by respondent Manila Surety &amp; Fidelity Co., Inc., dated
July 25, 1966, to the effect that as of the time of the approval of such
accountability, the executor of the estate was bonded by the petitioner in the
sum of P15,000.00, that upon motion of the executor, there was indeed an order
of October 20, 1962 <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> such bond although as
of that time its liability had already attached, and that respondent Manila
Surety &amp; Fidelity Co., Inc., without any knowledge of such existing and
previous accountability of the executor, did execute the new bond in the
aforesaid amount, but only subject to the conditions therein stated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It therefore prayed for the denial of the
motion for the confiscation of its bond on the ground that it had only a
prospective effect, its conditions not expressly or impliedly covering the
liability of the executor previously incurred.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There was, on <st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="9">September
 14, 1966</st1:date>, a motion filed again by respondents, the <span class="SpellE">Besons</span>, for the specification of the particular surety
company which should reimburse the aforesaid estates such amount of P8<span class="GramE">,732.23</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time,
though, a copy of such motion apparently was sent the same day to peti­tioner's
office in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename>

Respondent Judge thus had the opportunity to assure that petitioner was duly
heard, but failed to do so.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then on <st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1966</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Besons</span> <span style="">filed an ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span>

</span>Without the matter having gained the required precision, there being no
clarification as to which surety firm should be made to respond, came the writ
of execution, herein challenged, dated September 27, 1966, made to rest on the
previous order of August 6, 1966, worded in this wise: "Como se <span class="SpellE">pide</span> <span class="SpellE">por</span> el <span class="SpellE">abogado</span>

<p class="BODY">Not only did it fail to specify which surety firm was liable, but
also, it added to such uncertainty by the nebulous reference to "la <span class="SpellE">compania</span> <span class="SpellE">aseguradora</span> <span class="SpellE">que</span> era al <span class="SpellE">tiempo</span> en <span class="SpellE">que</span> se <span class="SpellE">dicto</span> la <span class="SpellE">sentencia</span> <span class="SpellE">dictada</span> <span class="SpellE">por</span> la Corte de <span class="SpellE">Apelaciones</span>."
As already mentioned, in the very opposition of respondent Manila Surety &amp;
Fidelity Co., Inc., the appellate court affirmed the lower court order only on <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1964</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It is to be remembered that as early as October 20, 1962, respondent Judge,
acting on a motion of respondent executor, for the cancellation or reduction of
his bond and praying in the alternative for the filing of a new bond in the
amount of P8,732.23, did issue this order: "Acting upon the Motion for
cancellation and/or reduction of Executor's bond, dated October 17, 1962, filed
by counsel for the Executor, <span style="">the Court
hereby orders the cancellation of the executor's bond and the filing of a new
bond in the amount of P8,732.23, in lieu thereof to be presented to this court
for approval.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It would thus appear on the </span><span style="">face </span><span style="">of the petition that as far back as </span><st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="10"><span style="">October 20, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, there was a cancellation of the bond
executed by petitioner and that a new bond for such amount of P8<span class="GramE">,732.23</span> was not filed until </span><st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="11"><span style="">November 11, 1965</span></st1:date><span style=""> and by another surety firm, respondent
Manila Surety &amp; Fidelity Co. , Inc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner did file a motion to quash such writ of execution and

Its motion for reconsideration stressed that it had ceased to <span style="">be </span>a party to the proceedings upon the
cancellation of its bond as far back as <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="10">October 20, 1962</st1:date> and that moreover it "was not given

the writ of execution amounted to a "deprivation of property without due process

<p class="BODY">The petition on its face, impressed with more than its share of
plausibility, this Court, on <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="11">November
 28, 1966</st1:date>, required respondents to answer, a writ of preliminary
injunction likewise being issued upon petitioner posting a bond of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>. Two answers were filed, one by respondent Manila
Surety &amp; Fidelity Co. Inc. on <st1:date year="1966" day="10" month="12">December
 10, 1966</st1:date> and the other by respondents, the <span class="SpellE">Besons</span>,
on <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily, the answer of the former was not
as explicit as that of the <span class="SpellE">Besons</span> in view of <span style="">its being involved much later in the
proceedings before respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was an explicit admission, except for the insistence that the
challenged writ of execution of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="27" month="9"><span style="">September 27, </span><span style="">1966</span></st1:date><span style=""> was </span><span style="">issued pursuant to the order of respondent
Judge of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="6" month="8"><span style="">August </span><span style="">6, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">in the answer of the <span class="SpellE">Besons</span> of the
allegations of the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, on the above facts, must prevail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is entitled to the writ prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The denial of procedural due process was
quite manifest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for the
confiscation of the bond filed by the <span class="SpellE">Besons</span>
evidently was not aimed at petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span style="">amount sought was precisely
that assumed in the bond of re­spondent Manila Surety &amp; Fidelity Co., Inc.,
which moreover did feel alluded to as it filed an opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that the <span class="SpellE">Besons</span>
must have had </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">second thought and would ascertain from the
lower court in a later pleading whether petitioner could likewise be a party
still subject to liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
Judge, without being too clear in his order, must have enter­tained such
belief, as attested by the writ of execution now assailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If such indeed were his state of mind, he
should have, at the very least, granted petitioner the opportunity to be
heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was the more reason for
such indispensable step as he apparently was no longer aware of a previous
order canceling petitioner's bond issued as far back as four years previously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When his attention was subsequently called to
the grave defect in the procedure adopted by him, both in a motion to quash the
writ of execution and a motion to reconsider filed by petitioner, he was not
even sufficiently impressed to devote some degree of attention on the
matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He satisfied himself with a curt
order of denial in both cases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It thus appears
indisputable that the lower court was quite insensible to the demands of
procedural due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the
circumstances then, the writ of execution cannot survive the attack launched
against it by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The due
process requirement is not a mere formality that may be dispensed with at
will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its disregard is a matter of
serious concern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a constitutional
safeguard of the highest order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a
response to manes innate sense of justice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It demands that governmental acts, more <span class="GramE">specially</span>
so in the case of the judiciary, be not infected with arbitrariness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be satisfied unless the elementary
requirements of fairness are met.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More
specifically, when as in this case, the imposition of a pecuniary liability was
far from clear, with petitioner apparently not lacking in defenses that, to say
the least, could not just be summarily brushed aside, it certainly was entitled
to be heard.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

thought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A surety, as pointed out by us
in a recent decision, must be given "an opportunity * * * “</span>to be
heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, in the categorical
language of Justice <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, who penned the opinion,
"the writ of execution issued <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> [is]
void<span class="GramE">. "</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>

Considering, moreover, that even when execution is proper, the party against
whom it may be directed could show facts that had developed subsequently that
would make it unjust or inequitable, the in­dispensable character of a hearing
before such writ could issue becomes even more undeniable.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>
