extensive efforts to have the deceased defendant substituted by any of his
heirs or the executor or administrator of his estate, which were to no avail,
this Court appointed the Clerk of Court of the Court of First Instance of

<blockquote>1. A question of transcendental importance which necessarily
involves an inquiry into procedural due process is whether summons in a suit <u>in</u>
<u>personam</u> against a resident of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
temporarily absent therefrom may be validly effected by substituted service
under Section 8, Rule 14 (formerly Section 8, Rule 7) of the Rules of
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A head-on collision of views
becomes inevitable considering the diametrically opposing positions taken by
plaintiffs, on the one hand, and defendant, on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, plaintiffs make the point that even with
defendant temporarily abroad, substituted service is valid under Section 8 by
leaving a copy of the summons "at the defendant's dwelling house or
residence with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs argue that if the ordinary method prescribed by the
rules, that is, personal service under Section 7, Rule 14, is not feasible,
then the substituted service in Section 8 aforesaid comes into play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 8 says:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 8. <u>Substituted</u> <u>service</u>. - If the defendant
cannot be served within a reasonable time as provided in the preceding section,
service may be effected (a) by leaving copies of the summons at the defendant's
dwelling house or residence with some person of suitable age and discretion
then residing therein, or (b) by leaving the copies at defendant's office or
regular place of business with some competent person in charge thereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, defendant advances the theory that in a
situation like the present, where defendant was temporarily abroad, the sole
and exclusive method of service of summons in a case in <u>personam</u> is that
set forth in Section 18, Rule 14 of the Rules (for merely Section 18, Rule 7),
which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 18. <u>Residents</u> <u>temporarily</u> <u>out</u> <u>of</u>
<u>the</u> <u>Philippines</u>. - When an action is commenced against a
defendant who ordinarily resides within the Philip­pines, but who is
temporarily out of it, service <u>may</u>, by leave of court, be effected out
of the Philip­pines, as under the preceding section."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> </blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Section 17 referred to in Section 18
(Section 17, Rule 7 in the old Rules) in turn states:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 17. <u>Extraterritorial</u> <u>service</u>. - When the
defendant does not reside and is not found in the Philippines and the action
affects the personal status of the plaintiff or relates to, or the subject of
which is, property within the Philippines, in which the defendant has or claims
a lien or interest, actual or contingent, or in which the relief demanded
consists, wholly or in part, in excluding the defendant from any interest therein,
or the property of the defendant has been attached within the Philippines,
service may, by leave of court, be effected out of the Phil­ippines by personal
service as under section 7; or by publication in a newspaper of general
circulation in such places and for such time as the court may order, in which
case a copy of the summons and order of the court shall be sent by registered
mail to the last known address of the defendant, or in any other manner the
court may deem sufficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any order
granting such leave shall specify a rea­sonable time which, shall not be less
than sixty (60) days after notice, within which the defendant must
answer."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Historically, in its common-law origin, the jurisdiction of
courts to render judgments <u>in</u> <u>personam</u> was grounded on their <u>de
facto</u> power over defendant's person.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Jurisdiction was based on the power to seize and imprison defendant.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a defendant was absent from the territory,
the fact that he was a citizen would not enable the court's officers to seize
him and service could not represent this power.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, his presence within the territorial juris­diction was a prerequisite to
the rendition of a judgment personally binding against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anglo-American law then emphasized the power
concept of jurisdiction.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Continental law, however, was somewhat different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had two fundamental principles of Roman
origin:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in suits <u>in</u> <u>personam</u>
and those relating to movables, courts of the domicile of the defendant have
general jurisdiction - <u>actor</u> <u>rei</u> <u>forum sequitur</u>; and (2)
in actions concerning immovables, the courts of the <u>situs</u> have exclusive
jurisdiction.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the development of the law, the variance between anglo­-american
law and continental law became "less and less clear-cut" because
"American law has had to yield to the increasing necessity of enlarging
more and more the catalogue of forums available to the plaintiff."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus it is, that American cases forged the doctrine, now long
recognized, that domiciliaries of a state, though temporarily out of its
territorial jurisdiction, are always amenable to suits <u>in</u> <u>personam</u>
therein.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this precept is the foundation for the
American rule that declares substituted service binding on absent
residents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The leading case of <u>Milliken</u>
<u>vs.</u> <u>Meyer</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
furnishes the <u>rationale</u>:"<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>“x x x the authority of a state over one of its citizens is not
terminated by the mere fact of his absence from the state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The state which accords him privileges and
affords protection to him and his property by virtue of his domicile may also
exact reciprocal duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Enjoyment of
the privileges of residence within the state, and the attendant right to invoke
the protection of its laws, are inseparable' from the various incidences of
state citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x x x The
responsibilities of that citizenship arise out of the relationship to the state
which domicile creates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
relationship is not dissolved by mere absence from the state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attendant duties, like the rights and
privileges incident to domicile, are not dependent on continuous presence in
the state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>One</u> <u>such</u> <u>incident</u>
<u>of</u> <u>domicile</u> <u>is</u> <u>amenability</u> <u>to suit</u> <u>within</u>
<u>the</u> <u>state</u> <u>even</u> <u>during</u> <u>sojourns</u> <u>without</u>
<u>the</u> <u>state,</u> <u>where</u> <u>the</u> <u>state</u> <u>has provided</u>
<u>and</u> <u>employed</u> <u>a</u> <u>reasonable</u> <u>method</u> <u>for</u> <u>apprising</u>
<u>such</u> <u>an</u> <u>absent</u> <u>party of</u> <u>the</u> <u>proceedings</u>
<u>against</u> <u>him</u>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There should be no doubt, therefore, that in suits <u>in</u> <u>personam</u>,
courts have jurisdiction over residents temporarily out of the country.</p>

<p class="BODY">This brings us to the question of procedural due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sub­stituted service such as one contemplated
in Section 8 upon a tempo­rarily absent resident, it has been held, is wholly
adequate to meet the requirements of due process.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The constitutional requirement of due process
exacts that the service be such as may be reasonably expected to give the
notice desired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once the service
provided by the rules reasonably accomplishes that end, the requirement of
justice is answered; the traditional notions of fair play are satisfied; due
process is served.</p>

<p class="BODY">In American jurisprudence, whether a defendant be in another
state under the federal system or is abroad in Europe,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
sub­stituted service is still considered to be valid.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The language in <u>Milliken</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Meyer,</u>
<u>supra</u>, is expressive:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"Its
adequacy so far as due process is concerned is dependent on whether or not the
form of substituted service provided for such cases and employed is <u>reasonably</u>
<u>calculated</u> to give him actual notice of the proceedings and an
opportunity to be heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it is, then
traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice (McDonald vs. Mabee, <u>supra</u>)
implicit in due process are satisfied."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">When the framers of our Rules adapted Section 8, it is to be
implied that they intended to give the provision the same meaning shaped out by
the jurisprudence of the jurisdiction from whence it was patterned. Section 8
is to be viewed in the same context it is understood in the American legal
system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The word "defendant"
in that provision is to be construed as including <u>any</u> resident of this
country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By comparative construction,
Section 8 is to be applied to all resident defendants - without distinction as
to whether he is physically present in this country or not.</p>

<p class="BODY">Chief Justice Moran shares this view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Commenting on Section 18, Rule 14, he
states:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Since the defendant is
residing in the Philippines, jurisdiction over his person may be acquired by
Philippine courts by substituted service of summons <u>under section</u> <u>8</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But extraterritorial service is allowed <u>also</u>
by leave of court according to the above provision [Section 18]."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Justice Martin regards the word "residence" in Section 8 as "the
place where the person named in the summons is living at the time when the
service is made, even though he may be temporarily out of the state at the
time."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This construction is but fair.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is in accord with substantial justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The burden on a plaintiff is not to be
enlarged with a restrictive construction as desired by defendant here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the rules, a plaintiff, in the initial
stage of suit, is merely required to know the defendant's "dwelling house
or residence" or his "office or regular place of business" - and
no more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is not asked to inves­tigate
where a resident defendant actually is, at the precise moment of filing
suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once defendant's dwelling house or
residence or office or regular place of business is known, he can expect valid
service of summons to be made on "some person of suitable age and
discretion then residing" in defendant's dwelling house or residence, or
on "some competent person in charge" of his office or regular place of
business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the terms of the law,
plaintiff is not even duty-bound to see to it that the person upon whom service
was actually made delivers the summons to defendant or informs him about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law presumes that for him.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is immaterial then that defendant does not in fact receive
actual notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This will not affect the
validity of the service.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the defendant may be charged by
a judgment <u>in</u> <u>personam</u> as a result of legal proceedings upon a
method of service which is not personal, "<u>which</u> <u>in</u> <u>fact</u>
<u>may</u> <u>not</u> <u>become</u> <u>actual</u> <u>notice</u> <u>to</u> <u>him</u>,"
and which may be accomplished in his lawful absence from the country.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, the rules do not require that papers be
served on defendant per­sonally or a showing that the papers were delivered to
defendant by the person with whom they were left.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Reasons for the views just expressed are not wanting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A man temporarily absent from this country
leaves a definite place of residence, a dwelling where he lives, a local base,
so to speak, to which any inquiry about him may be directed and where he is
bound to return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where one temporarily
absents himself, he leaves his affairs in the hands of one who may be
reasonably expected to act in his place and stead; to do all that is necessary
to protect his interests; and to communicate with him from time to time any
incident of importance that may affect him or his business or his affairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is usual for such a man to leave at his
home or with his business associates information as to where he may be
contacted in the event a question that affects him crops up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he does not do what is expected of him,
and a case comes up in court against him, he cannot in justice raise his voice
and say that he is not subject to the processes of our courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cannot stop a suit from being filed
against him upon a claim that he cannot be summoned at his dwelling house or
residence or his office or regular place of business.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not that he cannot be reached within a reasonable time to enable
him to contest a suit against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
are now advanced facilities of communication.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Long distance telephone calls and cablegrams make it easy for one he
left behind to communicate with him.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing, we find ourselves unwilling to
concede that substituted service provided in Section 8 may be down­graded as an
ineffective means to bring temporarily absent residents within the reach of our
courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we go back to the case at hand, there is the temporarily
absent defendant who was a parish priest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Summons upon him was served upon Fr. Bautista who lived in the same
convent where defendant resided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fr.
Bautista, we must assume, is a responsible person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Service upon him is effective.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. The view we take of this case sweeps away defendant's argument
that Section 18 is the sole provision that governs summons upon a defendant
temporarily absent in an action <u>in</u> <u>personarm</u>, as here. Indeed,
defendant's posture strikes at the very language employed by this reglementary
provision cited by him. The word "may" - in the statement in Section
18 that "service <u>may</u>, by leave of court, be effected <u>out</u> of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,"
as under Section 17 - will not support the deduction, without more, that
Section 18 is the only provision controlling in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the phrase­ology of the rule
is a recognition of the fact that substituted service - out of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
- under Section 17 is but one of the modes of effective service to bring a
defendant in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And upon the basic
concepts under which our rules governing processes operate, the normal method
of service of summons on one temporarily absent is by substituted service set
forth in Section 8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, because
personal service outside the country and service by publication are not
ordinary means of summoning defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">In practical terms, we perceive that - in suits <u>in</u> <u>personam
</u>the more circuitous procedure delineated in Sections 17 and 18 is resorted
to by a plaintiff if defendant's dwelling house or residence or place of
business in this country is not known; or, if known, service upon him cannot be
had thereat upon the terms of Section 8.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here, since personal service is impossible, resort to substituted
service becomes a necessity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
comparison between the service in Section 8 and that in Sections 17 and 18 is
beside the point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They both provide for
substituted service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, as <u>Goodrich
</u>observed: "[I]f a substitute is to be made where an actual personal
service is impossible, 'the best is none too good.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3. The judgment has long since become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It enjoys the presumption of regularity. It
is, unless stricken down, entitled to respect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Non</u> <u>quieta</u> <u>movere</u>. Because "[p]ublic policy
and sound practice demand that, at the risk of occasional errors, judgments of
courts should become final at some definite date fixed by law."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The norm of conduct observed by defendant would not, we believe,
tilt the scales of justice in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We go to the background facts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Logic and common sense tell us that Fr. Bautista who received the
summons and <u>who</u> <u>took</u> <u>interest</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>case</u>
must have informed defendant, one way or another of the suit, at the latest
upon his return in October, 1958.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>By</u>
<u>then</u> <u>there</u> <u>was</u> <u>still</u> <u>time</u> for him to move to
set aside the default order of <st1:date year="1958" day="20" month="9">September
 20, 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant did not
move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well to remember also that
judgment by default was not rendered against defendant until <st1:date year="1959" day="8" month="6">June 8, 1959</st1:date>, or almost nine (9)
months after the default order was issued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, defendant did nothing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to defendant, he learned of that judgment on <st1:date year="1959" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The full impact of the judgment totalling
P34,000 must have by then left an indelible mark in his mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A judgment of a court of justice is no
piddling matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should not be
trifled with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Especially so when the
amount is big, as it is here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That same
day -December 20 - his attorney took a hand on the matter, wrote back
plaintiffs refusing payment of the claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first writ of execution was served on defendant on January 14, 1960,
That time he did not' pay, because according to the Sheriff's return, defendant
then stated that he was "financially hard up."</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant did not bestir himself until <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1962</st1:date>, i.e., not less than two years
and two months after he learned - by his own admission - of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, that was shortly after levy was made on
his house in <st1:city><st1:place>Caloocan</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in this factual environment that then
CFI Judge Magno Gatmaitan, in his order of <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1962</st1:date>, correctly observed that "the Court
once again believes that this solution (denial of the motion to reconsider the
appealed order) is just because of the apparent intentional inaction of
defendant since <st1:date year="1959" day="20" month="12">20 December, 1959</st1:date>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, it was not right that defendant should have supinely sat
on the decision, and deliberately disregarded the import thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither was it correct for him to have waited
so long, slept on his rights, and only put plaintiffs to task when his own
property was threatened because of the levy and execution thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision below may not thus be annulled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs may not be compelled to file a
fresh suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, prejudice to
plaintiffs, which could have been avoided by defendant, will become a
reality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The additional expense, trouble
and anxiety need not be essayed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accident took place on <st1:date year="1957" day="16" month="12">December 16,
 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court's
decision made mention of two eyewitnesses and two doctors of medicine who
testified as to injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To bring back
those witnesses to court becomes a serious problem.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs will have to search for them and
if found, they may not be able to present to the court a narrative as
accurately as they had done before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Time
has an unfortunate tendency of obliterating occurrences from a witness' memory.
Recollections are apt to be blurred.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Human memory can even be treacherous.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lapse of time may also carry with it dissipation of other evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, there is great validity to the
statement that the march of time is truth in flight.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>These, in broad outlines, give life to the
