				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City, in Civil Case No. 1440, denying the petition
of Marcos <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span> to annul the order of the
Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City, in Civil Case No.
1433, dated August 11, 1964, directing the sheriff of Mountain Province to
place <span class="SpellE">Abdon</span> <span class="SpellE">Delenela</span> and
Guillermo Perez in possession of a parcel of land <span class="GramE">occupied</span>
by the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedents of the controversy which culminated in this
appeal are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">About the year 1908, Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span>
staked a mining claim known as the "<span class="SpellE">Bua</span> Fraction
Mineral Claim" over a parcel of land in <span class="SpellE">Tuding</span>, <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Mountain</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype></st1:place>, with an area of 76,809
square meters, more or less.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
exploration works in the mining claim did not last for long, for he abandoned
it, and stopped the exploration, but he continued to live in the house he built
on a portion of the land with his wife, broth­ers and sisters.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the year 1918, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span> also settled on a portion of the land with an area
of about one (1) hectare, for residential and agricultural purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After his death, his daughter, <span class="SpellE">Fabiana</span> <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span> Perez remained
to live in the house built by her father on the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still later, other relatives of the old
Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span> settled and built their own houses
over other portions of the land, one of which houses was acquired by <span class="SpellE">Abdon</span> <span class="SpellE">Delenela</span> who now resides on
the land with the other <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span> heirs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Surface rights over the area embraced in the ori­ginal <span class="SpellE">Bua</span> Fraction Mineral Claim of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span>
soon became the subject of litigation in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City (Civil Case No. 250 - Action to Quiet Title,
instituted by the heirs of Guillermo, <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span>,
Julian, <span class="SpellE">Timoteo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Melecio</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Macario</span>, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span>,
against appellant herein Marcos <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span> who claimed
to have bought the rights and interest of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span>
in the old mining claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a decision
rendered in said case No. 250, dated <st1:date year="1952" day="26" month="11">November
 26, 1952</st1:date>, the court dismissed both claims of ownership of the
plaintiffs and the defendant and declared the area public land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court, however, recognized the possession
of the parties over certain specified portions of the area, among which was an
area of about one and one-half (1-1/2) hectares in possession of Marcos <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span>, which has been declared for taxation purposes in
his name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This decision was affirmed by
the Court of Appeals in CA- G.R. No. 11157-R on <st1:date year="1955" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1955</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the same year, the 1-1/2 hectares of land occupied by Marcos <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span>, then declared under Tax Declaration No. 4771 in
his name, was levied upon and sold at public auction by the sheriff of Mountain
Province to satisfy a judgment for a sum of money obtained by the spouses Jose
Coloma and Eugenia <span class="SpellE">Rumbaoa</span> against Marcos <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span> in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, in Civil Case No. 1433.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment creditors were the purchasers at
the auction sale, and a certificate of sale was executed in their favor by the
sheriff on <st1:date year="1957" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1957</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the mealtime, an application for lode patent covering the <span class="SpellE">Bua</span> Fraction Mineral Claim was filed with the Bureau of
Mines. <span class="SpellE">Abdon</span> <span class="SpellE">Delenela</span> and
his co-heirs filed their opposition to the application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pending the controversy before the Bureau of
Mines, <span class="SpellE">Delenela</span> and his co-heirs instituted an action
for determination of their rights on the land in the Court of First Instance of
<span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City, docketed as Civil Case No. 735.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties submitted an amicable settlement
recognizing co-ownership among <span class="GramE">themselves</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Bua</span> Mineral Claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In a decision rendered in said Case No. 735, dated <st1:date year="1958" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1958</st1:date>, the court awarded one-half in
undivided share in the mineral claim in favor of Marcos <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span>,
and the other half also in undivided share in favor of <span class="SpellE">Ab­don</span>
<span class="SpellE">Delenela</span> and co-heirs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Later, in the exercise of their right as co-owners, <span class="SpellE">Abdon</span> <span class="SpellE">Delenela</span> and Guillermo
Perez, with the knowledge and conformity of Marcos <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span>,
redeemed and bought from the Colons spouses, the latter's rights, title,
interest and claim to the 1-1/2 hectares of land acquired under the certificate
of sale thereof executed in the latter's favor by the sheriff on June 1,
1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This redemption sale took place on
<st1:date year="1958" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1958</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 9, 1959, the Director of Mines recommended the
issuance of a lode patent over the <span class="SpellE">Bua</span> Mineral Claim
in favor of Marcos <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Delenela</span>,
and the other claimants in the proportion of one-half (1/2) in undivided share
in favor of Marcos <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span>, and the other one-half
(1/2) also in undivided share In favor of <span class="SpellE">Delenela</span> and
the other heirs in pursuant to the decision of March 3, 1958, aforementioned,
in Civil Case No. 735.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 12, 1959, upon motion of <span class="SpellE">Abdon</span>
<span class="SpellE">Delenela</span> and Perez, who have thus acquired and
succeeded to the rights of the Coloma spouses on the 1-1/2 hectares, the
Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City issued a writ of
possession in their favor directing the sheriff of Mountain Province to evict
Marcos <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span> and his wife from the 1-1/2 hectares
of land sold in the execution sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a petition for certiorari with preliminary in­junction filed
in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City,
docketed as Civil Case No. 897, Maxima Nieto de <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span>,
wife of Marcos <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span> questioned the power of the
Municipal Court to issue said writ of possession on two grounds, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that conjugal property had been levied
upon and sold in the execution sale, and her share therein is affected; and (2)
that there can be no severance of surface rights over a mineral claim located
under the Philippine Bill of 1902, and petitioner argued that the sheriff could
not have validly sold the surface rights in the execution sale of June 1,
1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1961</st1:date>, the court rendered a decision in said
case, holding that the writ of possession issued by the respondent Municipal Judge
was within his competence and jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">On appeal to the Supreme Court, docketed as G. R. No.</span>
L-18897, a decision was rendered on <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="3">March
 31, 1964</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
which is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"For the foregoing considerations the judgment appealed from
is hereby affirmed insofar as it denies the petition of Maxima Nieto de <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span> to exclude from the sale, or annul the sale on
execution of the residential lot formerly owned by her husband, of 1-1/2
hectares covered in the final certificate of sale; but that part of the
appealed decision holding that the sale at public auction included the 1-1/2
undivided share of Marcos <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span> to the <span class="SpellE">Bua</span> Mineral Claim, is hereby set aside and said mineral
rights of Marcos <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span> are hereby declared free from
the execution or sale on execution."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The decision having become final, <span class="SpellE">Abdon</span> <span class="SpellE">Delenela</span> and Guillermo
Perez reiterated their motion in the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City in Civil Case No. 1433, praying that an alias writ of possession be issued
to evict Marcos <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span> and his wife from the 1-1/2
hectares of land in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1964</st1:date>, over the objection
of Marcos <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span>, the court issued the writ prayed
for.</p>

<p class="BODY">For a second time, a petition for certiorari and mandamus with
preliminary injunction was instituted by Marcos <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span>
in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City seeking
the annulment of the order granting the alias writ of possession in favor of <span class="SpellE">Delenela</span> and Perez, and again the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> threw out the petition in its order dated
October 22, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court expressed
its views in the following rationale:</p>

<blockquote>"The one and one-half hectares of land referred to therein (S.
C. decision) is the same parcel of land and house above-described which was
already sold at public auction to the respondents, Guillermo Perez and <span class="SpellE">Abdon</span> <span class="SpellE">Delenela</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The said judgment is <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">adjudicata</span> and the consequent execution, and the writ of
possession is but its necessary consequence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"All the authorities cited by the petitioner were no longer of
any value because they were necessarily passed upon and disposed of in the
course of finally deciding the case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Wherefore, the petition for certiorari is hereby
denied."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Marcos <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span> is now before <span class="GramE">Us</span> on appeal from this last decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant contends that the lower court erred in denying his
petition on the ground of <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">adjudicata</span>,
arguing that it was his wife Maxima Nieto de <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span>,
and not he, the, party in the former case appealed to the Supreme Court in G.
R. No. <span class="GramE">L-18897.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, it is claimed, one of the requisites of <span class="SpellE">res</span>
adjudicate is lacking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no merit
in the argument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As husband and wife and
before the dissolution of their marital union, their interest in the said
property is one and the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact
that the wife was the party in the former case while it is now the <span class="GramE">husband</span> who is the pe­titioner in the instant case, when
admittedly both actions were instituted for the protection of their common
interest therein, is no argument to the proposition that there is no identity
of parties in these cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such identity
of interest is enough to hold that they are privy to one another, having a
common interest in the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither
is it to able to contend that the <span class="GramE">issue involved in the two
cases are</span> not identical. It cannot be disputed that in both cases, the
main relief sought is the annulment of writs of possession issued by the <st1:place><st1:placename>Municipal</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Court</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>of</st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
directing the sheriff concerned to evict the spouses <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span>
from the land, and the questions involved in both cases pertain to the legality
or validity of those writs aforementioned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the decision in L-18897, this Court sustained the validity of the
execution sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be no doubt,
therefore, that the judgment in the former case is binding in the instant
proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is argued further by the appellant that the final certificate
of sale conveying the land described in Tax Declaration No. 4771 to the
purchasers in the execution sale is not a valid disposition of a portion of the
public domain, and specially in view of the subsequent issuance of a mineral
lode patent over the <span class="SpellE">Bua</span> Mineral Claim by the
Director of Mines (Patent issued on November 7, 1966) whereby full ownership
not only of the minerals therein but also of the surface ground have been
conveyed to the patentee thereof, and, there­fore, the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City may no longer eject them from the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree with the contention of the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has not overlooked the doctrines heavily relied upon by
the appellant that the moment the locator discovered a valuable mineral deposit
on the land located, and perfected his location in accordance with the
provisions of the Philippine Bill of 1902, the power of the Government to
deprive him of the exclusive right to possession of the located claim was gone,
the land had become mineral land and they were excepted from the lands that
could be granted to any other person (McDaniel v. <span class="SpellE">Apacible</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Cuisia</span>, 42 Phil. 749, 756); and that when a <span class="SpellE">Iocation</span> of a mining claim is perfected under said law, it
has the effect of a grant by the United States of the right of present
possession, with the right to the exclusive enjoyment of all the surface ground
as well as of all the minerals within the lines of the claim (Gold Creek Mining
Corporation vs. Rodriguez, 66 Phil. 259).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are also cognizant of the rule invoked by the appellant that when
circumstances have arisen subsequent to the remanding of the record from the
Supreme Court to the trial court, a stay of execution may be allowed on grounds
which are in their nature peculiarly equitable, as for instance, to give
defendant an opportunity to set off a claim against plaintiff (Chua A. H. Lee
v. <span class="SpellE">Mapa</span>, 51 Phil. 624); or when after judgment has
been rendered and it has become final, facts and circumstances transpire which
render its execution impossible and unjust, the interested party may ask the
court to alter or modify the judgment to harmonize the same with justice and
the facts (De la Costa v. <span class="SpellE">Cleopas</span>, 67 Phil. 686; <span class="SpellE">Realiza</span> v. Duarte, L-25027, 20528 &amp; 20529, August 31,
1967); and this remains true, notwithstanding <span class="SpellE">affir­mance</span>
of the judgment by the Supreme Court, which imparts no higher quality than to a
final judgment un appealed from, except that it cannot he questioned or reviewed
(Chua A. H. Lee v. <span class="SpellE">Mapa</span>, supra).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, these authorities, by no means,
render the argument of herein appellant unassailable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are factual differences in the settings
of the case cited and the one at bar, the equities of which require the application
of a different rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, the 1-1/2 hectares portions of the <span class="SpellE">Bua</span> Fraction Mineral Claim described in Tax Declaration No.
4771 in the name of herein appellant was levied upon and sold at public auction
to satisfy the money judgment against him in Civil Case No. 1433 of the Mu­nicipal
Court of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City, and the corresponding certificate
of sale was issued in favor of the judgment creditors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Interest acquired under like certificates of
sale alone has been described as more than a lien on the property, more than an
equitable estate, <span class="GramE">an</span> inchoate legal title to the
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(21 Am. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Jur</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> section 264, p.
133).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The validity of that sale was
questioned when the Municipal Court ordered the eviction of appellant from the
land sold on execution, and the Supreme Court declared in L-18897 that the sale
was valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sale operated to divest
appellant of his rights to the land which vested in the purchasers at the
auction sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties herein
subsequently litigated their rights to the mineral claim in Civil Case No. 735
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City, and on
the basis of their amicable agreement (appellant was a party in the case), the
court declared the <span class="SpellE">Bua</span> Mineral Claim co-ownership
property of the parties thereto "<u>except the improvements existing
thereon</u>" (p. 9, appellant's petition).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no room for doubt, therefore, that the right to possess or own
the surface ground is separate and distinct from the mineral rights over the
same land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when the application for
lode patent to the mineral claim was prosecuted in Bureau of Mines, the said
application could not have legally included the surface ground sold to another
in the execution sales:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, We
have to declare that the pa­tent procured <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>,
at least with respect to the 1-1/2 hectares sold in execution, pertains only to
the mineral right and does not include the surface ground of the land in
question.</p>

<p class="BODY">Viewed from another perspective, <span class="GramE">We</span> have
arrived at the same conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In his letter to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources, dated February 9, 1959, recommending the approval of Mineral Lode
Patent No.</span> V-24, the Director of Mines said that applicants Marcos <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span>, et al. <u>had acquired vested rights on the <span class="SpellE">Bua</span> Fraction Mineral Claim before the Constitution of the
Philippines was approved on November 15, 1935</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the doctrines laid down in McDaniel v. <span class="SpellE">Apacible</span>, and in Gold Creek Mining v. Rodriguez, <u>supra</u>,
said vested rights include the ownership of both the minerals and the surface
ground; that such was the locator's right before as well as after the issuance
of the patent; and that such was vested property although fee remains in the
Government until patent issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
vested right of herein appellant passed to the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
under the sale on execution aforementioned of the 1-1/2 hectares portion of the
mineral claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The subsequent issuance
of the Lode Patent to the entire area of the <span class="SpellE">Bua</span>
Mineral Claim did not militate against that acquired rights, for <u>Sec.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>45 of the Philippine Bill of 1902 expressly
provides that nothing in said Act shall be deemed to impair any lien which may
have attached in any way whatever prior to the issuance of the patent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it is significant to note that the
very Lode Patent No. V-24 aforementioned expressly declares on its face that
"the mining premises hereby conveyed shall be held subject to all vested
rights and accrued rights</u>, the legal import of which is that the patentee
Marcos <span class="SpellE">Comilang</span>, shall hold the 1-1/2 hectares
portion of the area em­braced in the patent as described in the Tax Declaration
No. 4771, in trust for the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apart and independent of the statute, there is a rule in American
Law known as the "Doctrine of Relation", to the effect "that all
parts and ceremonies necessary to complete a conveyance shall be taken together
as one act, and operate from the substantial part by relation." This
"substantial part" is recognized as the "original act"
which is to be preferred, and to this all subsequent acts are to have relation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <u>doctrine of relation</u> appears to
have been often applied to the adjudication of real actions by American courts.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The case of <span class="SpellE">Landes</span> v.
Brant, 10 How.</span> 348, U. S. 13 Law ed., 449, broadly asserts this <u>doctrine
of relation</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, a Spanish
claim of land was acquired by <span class="SpellE">Clamorgan</span> under <span class="SpellE">Dodier</span>, the original claimant, by virtue of ten consecutive
<span class="GramE">years</span> possession prior to December 20, 1903.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such claim was authorized by the Act of
Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Clamorgan</span>
was entitled to a patent by virtue of a certificate of confirmation made by
commissioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His petition for such
confirmation was filed in December, 1805.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In 1808 judgment was recovered against <span class="SpellE">Clamorgan</span>,
the claim was sold, and the sheriff's deed executed to McNair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was held that the execution sale passed to
the purchaser all the title that could have passed from <span class="SpellE">Clamorgan</span>
to McNair by a quitclaim deed; that applying the <u>doctrine</u> <u>of</u> <u>relation</u>
and taking all the parts and ceremonies necessary to complete the title
together as one act, then the confirmation of 1811 and the patent of 1845 must
be taken to relate to the first act; that of filing the claim in 1805.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this assumption, intermediate conveyances
made by the <span class="SpellE">confirmee</span> or by the sheriff on his
behalf, of a date after the first substantial act, are covered by the legal
title and pass that title to the <span class="SpellE">alignee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on this ground, the deed made by the
sheriff to McNair is valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
doctrine has been applied in a great number of decisions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Applying the same rule to the case before <span class="GramE">Us</span>,
it is seen that the original act that ripened into Mineral Lode Patent No. V-24
was the location of the mineral claim and the recording thereof in the Mining
Recorder of Mt. Province sometime in 1922.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Vested right to the property accrued to the locator before 1935,
although patent was issued only recently November 7, 1966).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Patent cannot nullify the intermediate
conveyance of that right in the execution sale of 1958 to herein <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the argument that the proceedings for the issuance of a
writ of possession, as has been resorted to by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>,
is not the proper court procedure, the appellant intimating that it should be
by a proper action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention does
not deserve serious consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
corresponding rights of the parties to the property in question had been
ventilated in the various cases affecting it, and the decisions in those cases
have sustained the validity of the sale. It is now a matter of right on the
part of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> to be placed in pos­session of
the land by clear mandate of Sec. 35, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court which
requires that upon execution and delivery of the final deed of sale in
execution the possession of the property shall be given to the purchaser or
last <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span> unless a third party is actually
holding the property adversely to the judgment debtor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court said in Tan <span class="SpellE">Soo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Huat</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Ongwico</span>, 63 Phil.
747:</p>

<blockquote>"There is no law in this jurisdiction whereby the purchaser at
a sheriff's sale of real property is obliged to bring a separate and
independent suit for possession after the one-year period for redemption has
expired and after he has obtained the sheriff’s final certificate of sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is neither legal ground nor reason of
