				<H3>THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS, PETITIONER, VS. ESTEBAN ABAD, CLAIMANTS. BEATRIZ CASTAÑEDA, CLAIMANT, RESPONDENT AND APPELLEE, VS. LEONOR CASTILLO, THRU HER GUARDIAN TOMAS MANUEL, CLAIMANT, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal taken by appellant Leonor Castillo (thru her guardian Tomas 
Manuel) from the order of the Court of First Instance of Zambales (in Cad. Case 
No. 12, LRC. Cad. Rec. No. 377) adjudicating to appellee Beatriz Castañeda Lots 
Nos. 9102 and 9103 of the San Narciso (Zambales) Cadastre.
<p>The records disclosed that when Lots Nos. 9102 and 9103 of the San Narciso 
(Zambales) Cadastre were called for hearing on June 12, 1956, only 
claimant-appellee Beatriz Castañeda appeared, and so, an order of general 
default was entered by the court against the whole world and, thereafter, said 
claimant presented evidence in support of her claim of possession and ownership 
of said two lots.</p>
<p>On the following day (June 13), an answer was filed by Tomas Manuel, on 
behalf of minor Leonor Castillo, his grand-daughter, who also claimed ownership 
and possession of said lots.</p>
<p>On June 24, 1956, said Tomas Manuel, alleging to be the legal guardian of 
minor Castillo, thru counsel, filed a "motion to set aside the hearing made on 
June 12, 1956, or the order, if already issued, on Lots Nos. 9102 and 9103", 
alleging that claimant Beatriz Castañeda misrepresented that the two lots were 
in her possession although she fully knew that they were in the possession of 
claimant Leonor Castillo; that claimant Castañeda fully knew that said lots were 
sold by Maria Fontillas to Visitacion Aglibot, who in turn sold them to 
Castillo's mother; that on the morning of June 12, 1956, claimant Castañeda with 
Tomas Manuel were in the office of counsel (for Castillo) and were shown the 
deed of sale to the lots in favor of Castillo's mother; that claimant Castillo 
had been in possession of said lots since 1936 to the present continuously, 
peacefully, publicly, and with claim of ownership by Castillo's mother as well 
as hers; and that "the testimonies of claimant Castañeda and those of her 
witnesses were false and were misrepresentation of facts, coupled with fraud", 
so that the hearing on June 12, 1956 should be declared null and void and should 
be set aside.</p>
<p>Obviously acting on this petition, the trial court, on September 28, 1956, 
admitted the answer of Castillo and declared the two lots contested, in an order 
of this tenor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"ORDER</p>
<p>"There being an opposition filed by LEONOR MANUEL CASTILLO, thru her legal 
guardian, TOMAS MANUEL, on Lots Nos. 9102 and 9103; claimed by BEATRIZ 
CASTAÑEDA. Let this two lots be declared contested.</p>
<p>"SO ORDERED."</p></blockquote>
<p>Subsequently, on October 9, 1956, appellee Castañeda herself, in view of the 
preceding order of the court, filed a motion to set the case for hearing, which 
reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. That the above-stated two lots have been declared as contested, pursuant 
to an order of this Court dated September 28, 1956.</p>
<p>"2. That in order that title to the above-stated properties may fee settled, 
decided and adjudicated to the lawful, legal and rightful claimant, said 
petitioner-claimant, likewise, claiming to own and possess the above-stated 
lots, a hearing be had in order not to delay the disposition of this case.</p>
<p>"3. That claimant Beatriz Castañeda, therefore, petitions this Honorable 
Court that a hearing be conducted by this Honorable Court."</p></blockquote>
<p>For certain reasons, however, the case was not set for hearing. So, appellee 
Castañeda, on October 19, again filed a motion (the second) to set the case for 
hearing. The records do not show what action was taken by the court on this 
motion.</p>
<p>On December 10, 1956, appellee Castañeda reversing her former stand, filed a 
motion to dismiss the opposition (answer) of Tomas Manuel in representation of 
appellant Castillo, on the grounds, that Leonor Castillo is a minor; and that 
Tomas Manuel is not her guardian and, therefore, he has no personality or 
standing in court. On December 16, appellant Castillo, thru counsel, filed an 
opposition to said motion to dismiss, alleging that Tomas Manuel is her maternal 
grandfather; that an order of guardianship over her properties in San Marcelino, 
Zambales, was issued by the Court of First Instance of La Union; that there is, 
however, none on file in the clerk of court's office in La Union of Tomas 
Manuel's appointment as guardian of said properties, so that no copy thereof can 
be presented in court. Appellant, therefore prayed that Tomas Manuel be 
appointed as her guardian <i>ad-litem</i>, to represent her in the present 
cadastral case and that an appointment as guardian <i>ad-litem</i> be issued to 
said Tomas Manuel, so he could qualify.</p>
<p>On September 12, 1957, appellee Castañeda filed a supplemental motion to her 
motion to dismiss (of December 10, 1956) alleging as additional ground for the 
dismissal of Castillo's claim that said claim (or opposition) cannot prosper at 
all, because the same is not verified as required under Section 9 of Act No. 
2259 (Cadastral Law) and is also not accompanied with affidavits of merits as 
provided in Rule 38 of the Rules of Court.</p>
<p>On October 15, 1957, the trial court issued the order adverted to at the 
beginning of this opinion, which partly reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is observed from the records of this case the following: (1) that no 
adjudication yet has been made by this Court in favor of claimant Beatriz 
Castañeda, with respect to said Lots Nos. 9102 and 9103; (2) that the answer 
filed by Tomas Manuel on behalf of minor Leonor Castillo was made after the 
hearing of said two lots, during whch, evidence was presented by claimant 
Beatriz Castañeda in support of her claim; (3) that before the hearing, an order 
of general default was entered and the same has never been lifted because Tomas 
Manuel, alleged legal guardian of minor Leonor Castillo, or bis counsel, has 
never petitioned to the court to that effect, if he believed that there was 
meritorious ground to do so, and due to failure, the case could not be reopened 
for hearing; (4) that the motion dated June 24, 1956, of Tomas Manuel, on behalf 
of said minor Leonor Castillo, through counsel, is not verified or under oath, 
as provided in Section 9 of Act No. 2259 and in Rule 38 of the Rules of Court; 
and (5) that Tomas Manuel or his counsel, in spite of the lapse of more than 
sufficient time, has not taken up to the present the necessary step to comply 
with the said requirements of law and court rules, knowing very well as they do, 
that this case cannot be pending indefinitely for hearing in the court.</p>
<p>"IN VIEW OF ALL THS FOREGOING, it is the considered opinion of the court, 
that the said motion dated June 24, 1956, of Tomas Manuel, alleged legal 
guardian of minor Leonor Castillo, through counsel, should be, as it is hereby, 
denied and, considering the evidence submitted by claimant Beatriz Castañeda in 
the hearing, Lots Nos. 9102 and 9103 of the San Narciso (Zambales) Cadastre, 
should be, as it is hereby ordered adjudicated in favor of Beatriz Castañeda, of 
legal age, Filipino citizen, married to Exequiel Nodo, and residing at 1140 
Mabini St., Malate, Manila, as her paraphernal property.</p>
<p>SO ORDERED.</p></blockquote>
<p>Her motion for reconsideration of said order having been denied, appellant 
Leonor Castillo brought to us this appeal.</p>
<p>The appeal is well-taken. It is not disputed that on June 13, 1956, the day 
following the issuance of the order of general default and the reception of 
appellee Castañeda's evidence as to her ownership of the lots in question, 
apellant Castillo (thru her maternal grandfather and natural guardian Tomas 
Manuel) did file an answer duly verified by the trial judge. On June 24, 1956. 
appellant Castillo (thru her said guardian) did, likewise, file a motion to set 
aside the hearing made on June 12, 1956 (reception of Castañeda's evidence) or 
the order, if already issued, on said lots. Acting on said answer and motion 
fled by appellant the trial court, on September 28, 1956, issued an order 
declaring the lots <i>contested</i>. The legal effect of this order is the 
setting aside of the previous order of default insofar as appellant Castillo is 
concerned and the consequent admission of her answer claiming the lots in 
question and the recognition of her standing in court. Appellee Castañeda not 
only did not contest this order but expressly accepted it by submitting, in 
consequence thereof, two motions (on October 9 and 19, 1966) asking the court to 
set the case for hearing anew. Subsequently the two lots were set for hearing on 
October 22 and November 8, 1956, with notice to both Castañeda and Castillo. It 
does not appear from the records that any actual hearing took place on these 
dates or on any subsequent date.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, the action of the lower rourt in entering its order 
of October 15, 1957 appealed from, adjudicating the contested lots to appellee 
Castañeda without any further hearing and without giving appellant Castillo an 
opportunity to be heard and present her evidence in support of her claim 
constitutes a reversible error as it, in effect, set aside its own order of 
September 28, 1956 (already final and acquiesced by the parties) which, as 
stated, amounted to a partial lifting of the order of default, the admission of 
the appellants' answer and recognition of her standing in court.</p>
<p>On the whole, we believe that the interest of justice will be subserved if 
this case is remanded to the court <i>a quo</i> for further proceedings, giving 
appellant Castillo the opportunity to present her evidence of alleged ownership 
of the lots in question.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order appealed from is set aside, and the case is hereby 
ordered remanded to the court <i>a quo</i> for further proceedings, consistent 
with this decision. Costs agunst appellee Beatriz Castañeda. So ordered.</p> <i>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Paredes, 
Dizon, Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
