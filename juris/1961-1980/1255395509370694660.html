				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue from the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals (in
    CTA Case No. 175), ordering the withdrawal and cancellation of the deficiency percentage sales tax assessment
    against RAMCAR, INC., during the period of from 1953
    to the first quarter of 1954, in the total sum of P19,592.93.
    The facts of the case may be briefly stated, thus.    
		<p>Ramcar, Inc., a domestic corporation organized for and
    engaged in the importation, manufacturing, selling and
    dealing of automobiles, trucks and spare parts, had a contract with Rootes Limited of London, wherein the former
    agreed to assemble and sell locally for the latter "Hillman
    Minx" automobiles. On February 1, 1953, RAMCAR, Inc.,
    in turn entered into a contract with Henderson Trippe
    (Phil.) Inc., another domestic corporation, whereby the
    latter was designated the exclusive distributor of Hillman
    Minx automobiles in the Philippines. Pertinent provisions
    of said agreement are reproduced hereunder, to wit:</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p align="center">"AGREEMENT</p>
		  <p>
"* * * WHEREAS, the Company (RAMCAR INC.) has granted to the
DISTRIBUTOR (Henderson Trippe, Inc.) the exclusive distribution in
Philippines of the Hillman Minx Cars, assembled by the company in the
Philippines, and whereas the Distributor will take delivery of all
Hillman Minx assembled here, and has accepted and agreed to establish
and properly maintain Show Room, Sales Force, Agencies, or branches for
the adequate distribution of the said Hillman Minx cars in the
Philippines, NOW IT IS HEREBY AGREED between the parties hereto as
follows:</p>
		  <p align="center">*	*	*	*	*	*	*</p>
		  <p>"CLAUSE 2. TERRITORY. </p>
		  <p>"The
COMPANY reserves the right to withdraw, by giving two months' notice
any part of the Distributor's territory, if in their judgment the
Distributor fails to maintain satisfactory representation therein, and
on expiration of such notice and rights of the DISTRIBUTOR hereunder
shall cease as regards the territory or the part thereof to which the
notice relates. </p>
		  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
		  <p>"CLAUSE 4. PRICES AND DISCOUNTS.</p>
		  <p>"The
company shall invoice the vehicles to the distributor at a list
wholesale price established from time to time and prevailing at the
time of delivery, and nothing in this agreement shall entitle the
distributor to any discount, rebate or other deduction from such price.
</p>
		  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
		  <p>"CLAUSE 5. TERMS OF PAYMENT.</p>
		  <p>
"The Company agrees to deliver to the Distributor twelve (12) fully
assembled vehicles per month, and the Distributor shall pay the Company
for twelve (12) vehicles per month Cash on Delivery, and shall take
delivery as said vehicles are assembled by the company, should it be
mutually agreed by both the distributor and the company that the
distributor shall take delivery of more than twelve (12) vehicles per
month, such agreement in letter form shall be sufficient.</p>
		  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
		  <p>"CLAUSE 7. REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE SERVICE.</p>
		  <p>"It is also agreed that the Company will perform any repair or
                maintenance service which may be required on the Hillman Minx
                cars and on the products of ROOTES GROUP OF COMPANIES, at charges
                which are fair and reasonable. </p>
		  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
		  <p align="left">"COMPANY 8. POLICY.</p>
		  <p> "(a) The company reserves the option and the right to keep and
                  dispose at his convenience one (1) Hillman Minx car for every 
                  twelve (12) assembled. </p>
		  <p style="text-align: center;">* * * * * * *</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Pursuant to the above agreement, for the period of from
              the first quarter of 1953 to the first quarter of 1958, RAMCAR sold to Henderson Trippe twenty locally assembled
              Hillman Minx automobiles at the wholesale price of
              P4,950.00 per unit. The latter, in turn, sold the said cars
		              
		
											              
				
		              
		to third parties at prices ranging from P5,670.00 to
              P6,300.00 per unit.              </p>
		<p>For
these transactions with Henderson Trippe, RAMCAR paid tax at the rate
of thirty per centum (30%) of the wholesale price of P4,950.00 per
unit, in accordance with Section 184 (a) of the National Internal
Revenue Code. The Collector of Internal Revenue, however, ruling, after
investigation, that Henderson Trippe acted merely as agent of RAMCAR,
assessed and demanded of the latter a deficiency sales tax, based on
50% of the gross sales at from P5,670 to P6,300.00 per unit, the
selling price paid by the ultimate buyers in the total sum of
P18,592.83 exclusive of the compromise penalty of P1,000.00. RAMCAR'S
petition for reconsideration of said assessment having been denied, the
matter was appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals. </p>
		<p>After due hearing, the Tax
Court rendered a decision, as already stated, ordering the cancellation
and withdrawal of the disputed assessment, for the reason that the
contract between RAMCAR and Henderson Trippe being one of sale, and not
of agency as claimed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the
percentage sales tax due from said taxpayer should be based on the
wholesale price given to Henderson Trippe and not on the buying price
paid by the ultimate purchasers. It is from this decision that the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue interposed this appeal by way of a
petition for certiorari. Petitioner claims in this instance that the
agreement between RAMCAR and Henderson Trippe, Inc., is actually one of
agency and not of purchase and sale. To this end, he points to RAMCAR'S
failure to deliver a certain number of cars a month; the appointment of
other distributors in Iloilo and Baguio City; the failure of
Henderson-Trippe, to maintain a show room; the fact that although in
the receipts and sales invoices the cars appeared to have been sold by
Henderson-Trippe, the same were actually delivered by n respondent
RAMCAR direct to the ultimate buyers; that payments or deposits on
account of the cars were made by the ultimate buyers direct to
respondent RAMCAR; that the dates of the alleged sales by respondent to
Henderson-Trippe of the cars in question are the same as the 1 dates of
the alleged sales of the same cars by Henderson-Trippe to the ultimate
buyers. It is thus contended, that the percentage tax should have been
impossible on the buying price of the third parties (which would be 50%
thereof, said buying price being in excess of P5,000.00). </p>
		<p>Even
considering the foregoing contentions of petitioner, it is clear that
the issue in this case hinges on the determination of the nature of the
contract or agreement between RAMCAR find Henderson-Trippe. Taking into
account the terms and conditions of the aforesaid contract, reproduced
at the start of this opinion and the explanation given by respondent
which was satisfactory to the Tax Court, we also find no reason to
disturb the ruling made therein; For instance, with respect to
respondent's failure to deliver 12 cars a month, this was explained to
have been caused by the imposition of controls by the Central Bank on
certain importations. Non-compliance of this term of the agreement on
this point was therefore due to reasons beyond the control of the
parties. As to the alleged direct deliveries of the cars made by RAMCAR
to the ultimate buyers, what actually occurred was that because of the
inability of Henderson-Trippe to put up its own showroom after the
execution of the distribution contract, the parties had a temporary
arrangement by which the cars purchased by Henderson-Trippe were
displayed in the showroom of respondent. Consequently, the direct
buyers of Henderson-Trippe had to take the cars from the compound of
RAMCAR, and this took place for only six months. Mention was made, too,
of the receipt by RAMCAR of some deposits made by the ultimate buyers,
this, again, was satisfactorily explained by respondent by showing that
the said deposits were made in 4 of the 20 transactions involved
herein, and effected under special circumstances, because the buyers
happened to be friends of Mr. Ramon Caro. The fact that 2 other
distributors were appointed in Iloilo and Baguio City is not a
violation of the contract, because it was made in the exercise of
respondent's right to withdraw from the distributor's territory any
part thereof under conditions authorized by Clause 2 of the same
contract hereinabove quoted. As heretofore stated, these explanations
were found satisfactory by the Tax Court and insufficient to justify
the conclusion that the agreement in question which is one of purchase
and sale was a mere subterfuge to avoid payment of higher taxes. And,
we find no valid reason to disturb such ruling. </p>
		<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby, affirmed, without costs. So ordered. </p>
