				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is a petition for a writ of certiorari. The petitioners seek
the annulment of an order entered on 17 March 1959 (Appendix K) by the
Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental in civil case No. 2458
where the petitioners are the plaintiffs and the respondents except the
court are the defendants. Said order set aside a previous order entered
on 6 December 1958 requiring the respondents, defendants therein, to
file a bond in the sum of P500 to answer for the value of the palay to
be harvested in 1958 (Appendix H). The defendants in said case,
respondents herein, filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. As the
motion was denied, the defendants therein, respondents herein, filed a
petition for a writ of certiorari which was denied by this Court
(Remigio Pillado et al, <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> E. Francisco de Lasala 95 Phil., 490). In
the last mentioned case this Court found that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The land subject of said Civil Case No. 2458 was
purchased on April 9, 1952, by the plaintiffs from the Bacolod branch
of the Philippine National Bank. As a result Transfer Certificate of
Title No. T-9455 was issued by the Register of Deeds in the name of the
plaintiffs. The land was mortgaged on March 20, 1940, to the Philippine
National Bank by Luis Pillado, father of Remigio Pillado, to secure the
payment of a loan of P500. Upon failure of the mortgagor to pay the
indebtedness the land was sold on September 13, 1952, pursuant to the
provisions of Act No. 3135 and the purchaser at the sale was the
Philippine National Bank, Bacolod branch. Upon purchase of the said
property by Estela Francisco de Lasala and Vivencio Lasaia, three
different actions were instituted: </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Third. On August 29, 1952, Civil Case No. 2458 (the
case where the present order complained of was issued), for the
recovery of possession of the land from the defendants, the collection
of damages for the illegal occupation of said land, and for the
issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction during the pendency of the
action.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears that in Civil Case No. 2458, the Court of First Instance
of Negros Occidental ordered on 30 October 1952 that a writ of
preliminary injunction be issued to enjoin the defendants Remigio
Pillado and Pedro Sarnate from committing further acts of dispossession
against the plaintiffs spouses Vivencio Lasaia and Estela Francisco
upon the filing of the requisite bond (Appendix A). On 22 September
1954 the plaintiffs prayed that the bond of P1,000 they had filed be
approved and that a writ of preliminary injunction be issued (Appendix
B). On 30 September 1954 the court issued the writ commanding the
defendants and/or their agents, servants or others acting in their
behalf to "immediately desist from further committing acts of
dispossession against the plaintiffs over lot No. 283 of La Carlota
Cadastre, Negros Occidental, during the pendency of this action"
(Appendix C). On 28 July 1956 the plaintiffs moved for the appointment
of a receiver of lot No. 283 which was in the defendants' possession;
but instead of the appointment of a receiver, on 31 July 1956 the
defendants filed a bond in the sum of P500 to continue in possession of
the lot and to answer for the value of the palay to be harvested in
1956 (Appendix E). Upon the plaintiffs' motion, on 3 September 1957 the
court ordered the defendants to file another bond in the sum of P500 to
answer for the value of the palay to be harvested in 1957, with a
warning that in case of failure to file the bond the writ of
injunction issued on 30 September 1954 would be enforced (Appendix E).
On 16 September 1957 the bond was filed. On 10 January 1958 the court
approved the two bonds in the sum of P500 each filed by the defendants
on 1 August 1956 (31 July 1956) and 16 September 1957 (Appendix F). On
28 October 1958 the plaintiffs moved that the defendants be required to
file another bond in the same sum to answer for the value of the 1958
palay crop (Appendix G). On 6 December 1958 the court ordered the
defendants to file the bond prayed for (Appendix H). Instead of filing
the bond, on 13 March 1959 the defendants replied to the plaintiffs'
motion dated 28 October 1958 and prayed that the motion be denied
(Appendix I). On 17 March 1959 the plaintiffs filed a rejoinder to the
reply (Appendix J).</p>
<p>By an order entered on the last mentioned date, the respondent court
declared that the writ of preliminary injunction had been improvidently
issued, for the reason that the defendants, not the plaintiffs, were in
possession of the lot in litigation, and accordingly denied the
plaintiffs' motion to require the defendants to file a bond for the
1958 palay crop (Appendix K).</p>
<p>On 24 March 1959 the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration
(Appendix L), to which the defendants replied on 6 May 1959 (Appendix
M). On 13 January 1960 the motion was denied.</p>
<p>It is not true that the legality or validity of the writ of
preliminary injunction in question was passed upon by this Court in the
certiorari proceedings 95 Phil., 425, decided on 30 July 1954. This
Court said.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The alleged invalidity of the issuance of the writ
of preliminary injunction has not been insisted upon in the argument,
and it is not necessary for us to pass upon the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The purpose of a writ of preliminary injunction is to maintain or preserve the <span style="font-style: italic;">status</span> <em>quo</em> of the parties in relation to the subject matter litigated by them during the pendency of the action or case.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span></p>
<p>The respondent Remigio Pillado against whom the writ is issued has
been in possession of the litigated lot. Before him his parents had
been in possession of the same. The petitioners have never been in
possession thereof. Such being the case, the respondents' possession of
the lot pending judicial determination of the ownership thereof must
not be disturbed.<sup><span style="color: red;">[2]</span></sup></p>
<p>Whether a court has power to recall or modify a writ of preliminary
injunction previously issued by it is squarely answered by section 7 of
Rule 60 of the Rules of Court which expressly provides thatâ€”</p>
<p>After hearing the court may grant or refuse, continue, modify or
dissolve the injunction as justice may require, and as held by this
Court in Aquino <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Alvendia, G.R. No. L-13861, 8 August 1958:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>* * * After all, the issuance or <span style="font-style: italic;">recall </span>of a
preliminary writ of injunction is, as we have said, an interlocutorly
matter that remains Casenas <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Jandayan <span style="font-style: italic;">at all times within the
control of the Court</span>. * * * (Italics supplied.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied, with costs against the petitioners.</p>
