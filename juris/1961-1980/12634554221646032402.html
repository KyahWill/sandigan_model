				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from the order of <st1:date year="1956" day="2" month="5">May 2, 1956</st1:date>, the deci­sion of <st1:date year="1956" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1956</st1:date> and the order of <st1:date year="1956" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1956</st1:date>, all of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, in civil case 629.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The basic action is for specific performance, and damages resulting from
an alleged breach of contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1940 <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> Casteel filed a
fishpond application for a big tract of swampy land in the then <span class="SpellE"><u>sitio</u></span> of <span class="SpellE">Malalag</span> (now the
municipality of <span class="SpellE">Malalag</span>), <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Padada</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No action was taken thereon by the
authorities concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the Japan­ese
occupation, he filed another fishpond application for the same area, but
because of the conditions then prevailing, it was not acted upon either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1945" day="12" month="12">December
 12, 1945</st1:date> he filed a third fishpond application for the same area,
which, after a survey, was found to contain 178.76 hectares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon investigation conducted by a re­presentative
of the Bureau of Forestry, it was discovered that the area applied for was
still needed for firewood production.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, on <st1:date year="1946" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1946</st1:date>
this third application was disapproved.</p>

<p class="BODY">Despite the said rejection, Casteel did not lose interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He filed a motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While this motion was pending resolution, he
was advised by the district forester of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
that no further action would be taken on his motion, unless he filed a new
application for the area concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
he filed on <st1:date year="1947" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1947</st1:date>
his fishpond application 1717.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, several applications were submitted by other persons
for portions of the area covered by Casteel's application.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 20, 1946 <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Aradillos</span> filed his fishpond ap­plication 1202 covering 10
hectares of land found inside the area applied for by Casteel; he was later
granted fishpond permit F-289-C covering 9.3 hectares certified as available
for fishpond purposes by the Bureau of Forestry.</p>

<p class="BODY">Victor D. <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span> filed on <st1:date year="1946" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1946</st1:date> his fishpond
application 762 over a portion of the land applied for by Casteel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ale­jandro <span class="SpellE">Cacam's</span>
fishpond application 1276, filed on December 26, 1946, was given due course on
December 9, 1947 with the issuance to him of fishpond permit F-539-C to develop
30 hectares of land comprising a portion of the area applied for by Casteel,
upon cer­tification of the Bureau of Forestry that the area was likewise
available for fishpond purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1948" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1948</st1:date> Felipe <span class="SpellE">Deluao</span> filed his own fishpond application for the area
covered by Casteel's application.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of the threat poised upon his position by the above
applicants who entered upon and spread themselves within the area, Casteel
realized the urgent necessity of expanding his occu­pation thereof by
constructing dikes and cultivating marketable fishes, in order to prevent old
and new squatters from usurping the land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But lacking financial resources at that time, he sought financial aid
from his uncle Felipe <span class="SpellE">Deluao</span> who then extended loans
totaling more or less P27,000 with which to finance the needed improvements on
the fishpond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, a wide productive
fishpond was built.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, upon learning that portions of the area applied for by
him were already occupied by rival applicants, Casteel immediately filed the
corresponding protests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
two administrative cases ensued involving the area in question, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>DANR Case 353, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Fp</span>. <span class="SpellE">Ap</span>. No. 661 (now <span class="SpellE">Fp</span>. A. No. 1717), <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span>
Casteel, applicant-appellant versus <span class="SpellE">Fp</span>. A. No. 763, <span class="SpellE">Vic­torio</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span>,
applicant-appellant"; and DANR Case 353-B, en­titled "<span class="SpellE">Fp</span>. A. No. 661 (now <span class="SpellE">Fp</span>. A. No.
1717), <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> Casteel, applicant-protestant versus <span class="SpellE">Fp</span>. Permit No. 289-C, <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ara­dillos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Fp</span>. Permit No. 539-C,
Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Cacam</span>, <span class="SpellE">Permitees</span>-Respondents.
"</p>

<p class="BODY">However, despite the finding made in the investigation of the
above administrative cases that Casteel had already intro­duced improvements on
portions of the area applied for by him in the form of dikes, fishpond gates,
clearings, etc., the Direc­tor of Fisheries nevertheless rejected Casteel’s
application on October 25, 1949, required him to remove all the improvements
which he had introduced on the land, and ordered that the land be leased
through public auction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failing to
secure a favorable reso­lution of his motion for reconsideration of the
Director's order, Casteel appealed to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Re­sources.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the interregnum, some more incidents occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To avoid repetition, they will be taken up in
our discussion of the ap­pellant's third assignment of error.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 25, 1949 <span class="SpellE">Inocencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Deluao</span> (wife of Felipe <span class="SpellE">De­luao</span>)
as party of the first part, and <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> Casteel as
party of the second part, executed a contract - denominated a "contract of
service" - the salient provisions of which are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That the Party of the First Part in consi­deration of the
mutual covenants and agreements made herein to the Party of the Second Part,
here­by enter into a contract of service, whereby the Party of the First Part
hires and employs the Par­ty of the Second Part on the following terms and
conditions, to wit:</blockquote>

hereby financed the sum of TWENTY <span style="">SEV­EN

services for the construction and improvements of a fishpond at barrio <span class="SpellE">Malalag</span>, Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Padada</span>,
Province of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, Philippines;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That the Party of the Second Part will be the Manager and
sole buyer of all the produce of the fish that will he produced from said
fishpond;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That the Party of the First Part will be the administrator of
the same she having financed the construction and improvement of said fishpond;</blockquote>

entered into between the Parties sometime in the month of November, 1947, with
all the abovementioned conditions enumerated; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the same date the above contract was entered into, <span class="SpellE">Inocencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Deluao</span> executed a
special power of attorney in favor of Jesus <span class="SpellE">Donesa</span>,
extending to the latter the authority "To represent me in the
administration of the fishpond at <span class="SpellE">Malalag</span>,
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Padada</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, Philippines, which has been ap­plied for fishpond

of Fisheries, and to supervise, demand, receive, and collect the value of the
fish that is being periodically realized from it x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1949" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1949</st1:date>
the Director of Fisheries rejected the application filed by Felipe <span class="SpellE">Deluao</span> on <st1:date year="1948" day="17" month="11">November
 17, 1948</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Un­fazed by this
rejection, <span class="SpellE">Deluao</span> reiterated his claim over the same
area in the two administrative cases (DANR Cases 353 and 353-B) and asked for
reinvestigation of the application of <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> Cas­teel
over the subject fishpond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, by
letter dated March 15, 1950 sent to the Secretary of Commerce and Agriculture
and Natural Resources (now Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Re­sources), <span class="SpellE">Deluao</span> withdrew his petition for reinvestigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1950" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1950</st1:date>
the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources issued a decision in DANR
Case 353, the <span class="SpellE">dis­positive</span> portion of which reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In view of all the foregoing considerations, <span class="SpellE">Fp</span>. A. No. 661 (now <span class="SpellE">Fp</span>. A. No.

of <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span> shall
remain rejected."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the same date, the same official issued a decision in DANR
Case 353-B, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion stating as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, Fishpond Permit No. F-289-C of <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Sometime in January 1951 <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> Casteel forbade <span class="SpellE">Inocen­cia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Deluao</span> from further administering the fishpond, and
ejected the latter's representative, (<span class="SpellE"><u>encargado</u></span>),
Jesus <span class="SpellE">Donesa</span>, from the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alleging violation of the contract of service (exhibit A) entered

and <span class="SpellE">Inocencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Deluao</span> on
April 3, 1951 filed an action in the Court of First instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> for specific performance and damages against <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> Casteel and Juan <span class="SpellE">Depra</span>
(who, they alleged, instigated Casteel to violate his contract), praying, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, (a) that Casteel be ordered to respect
and abide by the terms and conditions of said contract and that <span class="SpellE">Inocencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Deluao</span> be al­lowed to
continue administering the said fishpond and collecting the proceeds from the
sale of the fishes caught from time to time; and (b) that the defendants be
ordered to pay jointly and severally to plaintiffs the sum of P20,000 in
damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 18, 1951 the plaintiffs filed an <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> motion for the issuance of a preliminary
injunction, praying among other things, that during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the case and upon their filing the requisite bond as may be fixed by the
court, a preliminary in­junction be issued to restrain Casteel from doing the
acts com­plained of, and that after trial the said injunction be made
permanent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court on <st1:date year="1951" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1951</st1:date> granted the motion,

law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Casteel raises the following issues:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"(1) Whether the lower
court committed gross abuse </span>of discretion when it ordered reception of
the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' evidence in the absence of the
appellant at the trial on May 2, 1956, thus depriving the appellant of his day
in court and of his property without due process of law;</blockquote>

discretion when it denied the verified petition for relief from judgment filed
by the appellant on May 11, 1956 in accordance wit Rule 38, Rules of Court; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(3) Whether the lower court erred in ordering the issuance ex
<span class="SpellE">parte</span> of a writ of preliminary in­junction against
defendant-appellant, and in not dismissing <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>'
complaint."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">1. The first and second issues must be resolved against the
appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record indisputably shows that in the order given in open
court on March 21, 1956, the lower court set the case for hearing on May 2 and
3, 1956 at 8:30 o'clock in the morning and emphatically stated that, since the
case had been pending since April 3, 1951, it would not entertain any further
motion for trans­fer of the scheduled hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">An order given in open court is presumed received by the parties
on the very date and time of promulgations,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and amounts to a legal notification for all legal purposes.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The order of <st1:date year="1956" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1956</st1:date>,
given in open court, was a valid notice to the parties, and the notice of
hearing dated <st1:date year="1956" day="21" month="4">April 21, 1956</st1:date>,
or one month there­after, was a superfluity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, as between the order of March 21, 1956, duly promulgated by
the lower court, thru Judge Fernandez, and the notice of hearing signed by a
"special deputy clerk of court" setting the hearing in another branch
of the same court, the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> order was the one
legally binding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is be­cause the
incidents of postponements and adjournments are controlled by the court and not
by the clerk of court, pursuant to sec­tion 4, Rule 31 (now sec. 3, Rule 22) of
the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Much less had the clerk
of court the authority to interfere<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>with
the order of the court or to transfer the case from one <span class="SpellE">sala</span>
to another without authority or order from the court where the case originated
and was being tried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had neither the
duty nor prerogative to re-assign the trial of the case to a different branch
of the same court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His duty as such
clerk of court, in so far as the incident in question </span>was <span style="">concerned, was simply to prepare the trial
calendar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this duty devolved upon
the clerk of court and not upon the "special deputy clerk of court"
who purportedly signed the notice of hearing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is of no moment that the motion for postponement had the
conformity of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The postponement of hearings does not depend
upon agreement of the parties, but upon the court's discretion.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The record further discloses that Casteel was represented by a
total of 12 lawyers, none of whom had ever withdrawn as counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notice to Atty. Ruiz of the order dated March
21, 1956 <span class="SpellE">intransferably</span> setting the case for hearing
for May 2 and 3, 1956, was sufficient notice to all the appellant's eleven
other counsel of record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a
well-settled rule in our jurisdiction.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was the duty of Atty. Ruiz, or of the other lawyers of record,
not excluding the appellant himself, to appear before Judge Fernandez on the
scheduled dates of hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parties and
their lawyers have no right to presume that their motions for postponement will
be granted.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
For indeed, the appellant and his 12 lawyers cannot pretend ignorance of the
recorded fact that since September 24, 1953 until the trial held on May 2,
1956, the case was under the advisement of Judge Fernandez who presided over
Branch I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was, therefore, no
necessity to "re-assign" the same to Branch II because Judge
Fernandez had exclusive control of said case, unless he was legally inhibited
to try the case - and he was not.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is truth in the appellant's contention that it is the duty
of the clerk of court - <u>not</u> of the Court - to prepare the trial
calendar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the assignment or
reassignment of cases already pending in one <span class="SpellE">sala</span> to
another <span class="SpellE">sala</span>, and the setting of the date of trial
after the trial calendar has been prepared, fall within the exclusive control
of the presiding judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant does not deny the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>'
claim that on May 2 and 3, 1956, the office of the clerk of court of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> was located directly below
Branch I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the appellant and his
counsel had exercised due diligence, there was no impediment to their going
upstairs to the second storey of the Court of First Instance building in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> on May 2, 1956 and checking if the case was scheduled
for hearing in the said <span class="SpellE"><u>sala</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant after all admits that on <st1:date year="1956" day="2" month="5">May 2, 1956</st1:date> his coun­sel went to the
office of the clerk of court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's statement that parties as a matter of right are
entitled to notice of trial, is correct.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But he was pro­perly accorded this right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was notified in open court on <st1:date year="1956" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1956</st1:date> that the case was
definitely and <span class="SpellE">intransferably</span> set for hearing on May
2 and 3, 1956 before Branch I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cannot
argue that, pursuant to the doctrine in <span class="SpellE"><u>Siochi</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Tirona</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
his counsel was entitled to a timely notice of the denial of his motion for
post­ponement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the cited case the
motion for postponement was the first one filed by the defendant; in the case
at bar, there had al­ready been a series of postponements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unlike the case at bar, the <span class="SpellE"><u>Siochi</u></span> case was not <span class="SpellE">intransferably</span>
set for hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, where­as the
cited case did not <span class="SpellE">pend</span> for a long time, the case at
bar was only finally and <span class="SpellE">intransferably</span> set for
hearing on March 21, 1956 - after almost five years had elapsed from the filing
of the complaint on April 3, 1951.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The pretension of the
appellant and his 12 counsel of record that they lacked ample time to prepare
for trial is unacceptable because between </span><st1:date year="1956" day="21" month="3"><span style="">March 21, 1956</span></st1:date><span style=""> and </span><st1:date year="1956" day="2" month="5"><span style="">May 2, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="">, they had one month and ten days to do
so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect, the appellant had waived
his right to appear at the trial and therefore he cannot be heard to complain
that he has been deprived of his property without due process of law.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Verily, </span>the <span style="">constitutional requirements of due process have been fulfilled in this
case:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the lower court is a com­petent
court; it lawfully acquired jurisdiction over the person of the defendant
(appellant) and the subject matter of the action; the defendant (appellant) was
given an opportunity to be heard; and judgment was rendered upon lawful
hearing.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2. Finally, the appellant contends that the lower court incurred
in error in ordering the issuance <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
of a writ of preliminary injunction against him, and in not dismissing the <span class="SpellE">appellee’s</span> complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We find this contention meritorious.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Apparently, the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> relied on exhibit A - the so-</span>called <span style="">"contract of service" - and the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>'
contention that it created </span>a <span style="">contract
of co-ownership and partnership between <span class="SpellE">Inocencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Deluao</span> and the appellant over the fishpond in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Too well-settled to
require any citation of authority is the rule that everyone is conclusively
presumed to know the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be
assumed, conformably to such rule, that the parties </span>entered into the
so-called "contract of service" cognizant of the mandatory and
prohibitory laws governing the filing of applica­tions for fishpond
permits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since they were aware of
the said laws, it must likewise be assumed - in fairness to the parties - that
they did not intend to violate them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This view must perforce negate the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>'
allegation that exhibit A created a contract of co-ownership between the
parties over the disputed fishpond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were
we to admit the establishment of a co-ownership <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
<span style="">of the prohibitory laws which will
hereafter be discussed, we shall be compelled to declare altogether the nullity
of the con­tract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would certainly
not serve the cause of equity and jus­tice, considering that rights and
obligations have already arisen between the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We shall therefore construe the contract as
one of partnership, divided into two parts - namely, a contract of partnership,
to exploit the fishpond pending its award to either Felipe <span class="SpellE">Deluao</span>
or <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> Casteel, and a contract of partnership to
divide the fishpond between them after such award.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first is valid, the second illegal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is well to note that
when the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Inocencia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Deluao</span> and the appellant entered into the so-called
"contract of service" on </span><st1:date year="1949" day="25" month="11"><span style="">November 25, 1949</span></st1:date><span style="">, there were two pending applications over
the fishpond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One was Casteel's which
was appealed by him to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources after
it was disallowed by the Director of Fisheries on </span><st1:date year="1949" day="25" month="10"><span style="">October 25, 1949</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
other was Felipe <span class="SpellE">Deluao's</span> application over the same
area which was likewise rejected by the Director of Fisheries on </span><st1:date year="1949" day="29" month="11"><span style="">November
 29, 1949</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">refiled</span> by <span class="SpellE">Deluao</span> and later on
withdrawn by him by let­ter dated </span><st1:date year="1950" day="15" month="3"><span style="">March 15, 1950</span></st1:date><span style=""> to the Secretary of Agriculture and Na­tural
Resources.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, although the
fishpond was then in the possession of Casteel, neither he nor Felipe <span class="SpellE">Deluao</span> was the hold­er of a fishpond permit over the
area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But be that as it may, they were
not however precluded from exploiting the fishpond pending resolution of
Casteel's appeal or the approval of <span class="SpellE">Deluao's</span>
application over the same area - whichever event happened first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No law, rule or regulation prohibited them
from doing so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, rather than let the
fishpond remain idle, they cultivated it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The evidence
preponderates in favor of the view that the initial intention of the parties
was </span>not to <span style="">form a co-ownership
but to establish a partnership - <span class="SpellE">Inocencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Deluao</span> as capitalist part­ner and Casteel as industrial
partner - the ultimate undertaking </span>of which was to divide into two equal
parts such portion of the fish­pond as might have been developed by the amount
extended by the plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, with the
further provision that Casteel should reimburse the expenses incurred by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> over one-half of the fishpond that would pertain
to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This can be gleaned, among <span style="">others, from the letter of Casteel to Felipe <span class="SpellE">Deluao</span> on </span><st1:date year="1949" day="15" month="11"><span style="">November 15, 1949</span></st1:date><span style="">, which states, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

latter to ask for a reconsideration of the order of the Director of Fisheries
disapproving his (appellant's) application, so that if a favorable decision was
secured, then they would divide the area.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Apparently relying on the
partnership agreement, the <span class="SpellE">ap<span style="">pellee</span></span></span> Felipe <span class="SpellE">Deluao</span> saw
no further need to maintain his petition for the reinvestigation of Casteel's
application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus by letter<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
dated March 15, 1950 addressed to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources, he withdrew his petition on the alleged ground that he was no longer
interested in the area, but stated however that he wanted his interest to be
protected and his capi­tal to be reimbursed by the highest bidder.</p>

<p class="BODY">The arrangement under the so-called "contract of
service" continued until the decisions both dated <st1:date year="1950" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1950</st1:date> were issued by the Secretary
of Agriculture and Natural Resources in DANR Cases 353 and 353-B.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This development, by itself, brought about
the dissolution of the partnership.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, subsequent events likewise reveal the intent of both parties
to terminate the partnership because each refused to share the fishpond with
the other.</p>

<p class="BODY">Art. 1830(3) of the Civil Code enumerates, as one of the causes
for the dissolution of a partnership, ". . . any event which makes it
unlawful for the business of the partnership to be carried on or for the
members to carry it on in partnership." The approval of the appellant's
fishpond application by the deci­sions in DANR Cases 353 and 353-B brought to
the fore several provisions of law which made the continuation of the
partnership unlawful and therefore caused its <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u>
dissolution.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Act 4003, known as the
Fisheries Act, prohibits the hold­er of a fishpond permit (the <span class="SpellE">permittee</span>) from transferring or subletting the fishpond
granted to him, without the previous consent or approval of the Secretary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>To the same effect is Condition No. 3
of the fishpond permit which states that "The <span class="SpellE">permittee</span>
shall not transfer or sublet all or any area herein granted or any rights
acquired therein without the pre­vious consent and approval of this
Office." Parenthetically, we must observe that in DANR Case 353-B, the
permit granted to one of the parties therein, <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span>
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">A</span>radillos</span>,
was cancelled not solely for the reason that his permit covered a portion of
the area included in the appellant's prior fishpond application, but also be­cause,
upon investigation, it was ascertained thru the admission of <span class="SpellE">Aradillos</span> himself that due to lack of capital, he allowed
one <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> <span class="SpellE">Estepa</span> to develop
with the latter's capital the area covered by his fishpond permit F-289-C with
the understanding that he (<span class="SpellE">Aradillos</span>) would be given
a share in the produce thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Sec. 40 of Commonwealth
Act 141, otherwise known as the Public Land Act, likewise provides that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The lessee shall not assign, encumber, or sublet his rights
without the consent of the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce, and the viola­tion
of this condition shall avoid the contract; <u>Pro­vided,</u> That assignment,
encumbrance, or sublet­ting for purposes of speculation shall not be per­mitted
in any case:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, <u>further</u>,
That nothing contained in this section shall be understood or construed to
permit the assignment, encumbrance, or subletting of lands leased under this
Act, or under any previous Act, to persons, corporations, or as­sociations
which under this Act, are not authorized to lease public lands."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finally, section 37 of
Administrative Order No. 14 of the Secre­tary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources issued in August 1937, prohibits a transfer or sublease unless first
approved by the Di­rector of Lands and under such terms and conditions as he
may prescribe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it states:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<u>When a transfer or sub-lease of area and improvement may
be allowed</u>. - If the <span class="SpellE">permittee</span> or lessee had,
unless otherwise specifically provided, held the permit or lease and actually operated
and made improvements on the area for at least one year, he/she may request
permission to sub-lease <span style="">or transfer the
area and improvements under cert­ain conditions.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(a) <u>Transfer subject to approval</u>. - A sub­lease or
transfer shall only be valid when first ap­proved by the Director under such
terms and condi­tions as may be prescribed, otherwise it shall be null and
void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A transfer not previously approved
or reported shall be considered sufficient cause for the cancellation of the
permit or lease and forfeiture of the bond and for granting the area to a
qualified applicant or bidder, as provided in subsection (r) of Sec. 33 of this
Order."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since the partnership had for its object the division into two
equal parts of the fishpond between the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> and
the ap­pellant after it shall have been awarded to the latter, and there­fore
it envisaged the unauthorized transfer of one-half thereof to parties other
than the applicant Casteel, it was dissolved by the approval of his application
and the award to him of the fishpond.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The approval was an event which made it unlawful for the business of the
partnership to be carried on or for the members to carry it on in partnership.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, however, argue that in
approving the appellant's application, the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources likewise recognized and/or confirmed their property right to one-half
of the fishpond by virtue of the contract of ser­vice, exhibit A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the <span class="SpellE">untenability</span>
of this argument would readily surface if one were to consider that the
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources did not do so for the simple
reason that he does not possess the authority to violate the aforementioned
prohibitory laws nor to exempt anyone from their ope­ration.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, assuming <u>in</u></span><span style=""> <u>gratis</u> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">argumenti</span></u></span><span style=""> that the approval of Casteel</span><span style="">'</span><span style="">s
application, coupled with the foregoing prohibitory laws, was not enough to
cause the dissolution <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u> of their partnership, succeeding
events reveal the intent of both parties to terminate the partnership by
refusing to share the fishpond with the other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant wrote on <st1:date year="1951" day="4" month="1">January

wherein the former expressed his determination to administer the fishpond
himself because the decision of the Government was in his favor and the only
reason why administration had been granted to the <span class="SpellE">Deluas</span>

administration of the fishpond to the appellant, stating as a ground his belief
"that only the competent agencies of the government are in a better position
to render any equitable arrange­ment relative to the present case; hence, any
action we may pri­vately take may not meet the procedure of legal order."</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as the erstwhile partners articulated in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> letters their respective resolutions not to
share the fishpond with each other - in direct violation of the undertaking for
which they have established their partnership - each must be deemed to have
expressly withdrawn from the partnership, thereby causing its dissolution
pursuant to art. 1830(2) of the Civil Code which provides, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that dissolution is caused "by the
express will of any partner at any time."</p>

<p class="BODY">In this jurisdiction, the Secretary of Agriculture and Na­tural

</span>Consequently, the lower court erred in issuing the preliminary mandatory

<p class="BODY">However, pursuant to our holding that there was a part­nership

to Casteel, this case should be remanded to the lower court for the reception
of evidence relative to an ac­counting from November 25, 1949 to September 15,
1950, in order for the court to determine (a) the profits realized by the
partner­ship, (b) the share (in the profits) of Casteel as industrial part­ner,
(c) the share (in the profits) of <span class="SpellE">Deluao</span> as
capitalist partner, and (d) whether the amounts totaling about P27,000 advanced
by <span class="SpellE">Deluao</span> to Casteel for the development and

<span class="SpellE">Inocencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Deluao</span> continued
in possession and enjoyment of the fishpond even after it was awarded to
Casteel, she did so no longer in the concept of a capitalist partner but merely
as cre­ditor of the appellant, and therefore, she must likewise submit in the
lower court an accounting of the proceeds of the sales of all the fishes
harvested from the fishpond from September 16, 1950 until Casteel shall have
been finally given the possession and enjoyment of the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the event that the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Deluao</span> has received more than her lawful credit of
