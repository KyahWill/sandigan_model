lack of jurisdiction to hear and determine the case, there being a failure to
file a declaration of intention on the part of the petitioner, acting on the
belief that he was exempt from such a requirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is not the case however, according to
the Republic, as there was no showing that he did receive his primary and
secondary education in public schools or schools recognized by the Government
and not limited to any race or nationality.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>If such

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There was no other

</span>"As stated, the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cebu</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placename><span style="">Chinese</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">High School</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> where applicant Felix Lim completed his

own testimony, was presented to show that said school <u>is not limited to a
particular race or nationality</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
our mind, his testimony, unsupported by other competent evidence, is
inadequate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The burden is on him to
present such competent evidence, he being the claimant of the exemption, and
since he failed to do so, he cannot be entitled to the exemption sought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And inasmuch as he filed no declaration of
intention, his petition for naturalization must be denied."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The above ruling is foreshadowed by what was held by us in Lee v.
Republic,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
where we stressed the following:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Considering that Section 6 of the Naturalization Law expressly
requires that to be exempt from filing declarations of intention
Philippine-born applicants must, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
have received both primary and secondary education in public schools or those
recognized by the Government and not limited to any race or nationality; that
there is no evidence that the Manila Chinese School (where petitioner received
primary education) was not limited to any race or nationality, but, on the
contrary, its name clearly imported that it was limited to Chinese students * *
*; and considering that the burden lies on applicant to satisfactorily show
that all schools attended by him are not limited to students of a particular
nationality, but are regularly attended by a sizeable number of Filipino
students from whom applicant could have imbibed Filipino customs and
traditions, we agree that petitioner should have filed in due time his
declaration of intention, and not having done so, his application was erroneously
granted." An excerpt from Ng v. Republic<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
is likewise relevant:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Besides, it
is now well settled that enrolment in Chinese (or other foreign) school raises
the inference that the applicant is subject to a disqualification, namely,
failure to evince 'a sincere desire to embrace our customs, traditions and
ideals.'"</p>

<p class="BODY">The case against the grant of citizenship in the light of the
foregoing seems to be particularly impressive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As far back as 1950, there has been a rejection of the liberal
construction of the above provision of the Naturalization Law.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It is easy to understand why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated
by us in Guy Co <span class="SpellE">Chia</span> v. Republic:<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
"This educational requirement is necessary not only to test the sincerity
of purpose of petitioner but to give him the proper perspective regarding the
ideals and principles of the citizenship he seeks to embrace."</p>

<p class="BODY">It would be to overturn then an impressive array of decisions
previously noted if we were to uphold the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not disposed to do so, as we adhere to
the basic concept that the grant of citizenship being a highly regarded
privilege, there must be a full and strict compliance with the requirements of
the law before its benefits can be enjoyed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under that fundamental postulate and with the lack of evidence to substantiate
his claim for exemption from filing a declaration of intention, the petition in
this case ought not to have been granted by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the view we take of this particular
jurisdictional objection, there is no need to inquire into the other grounds of
opposition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of <st1:date year="1965" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1965</st1:date> is reversed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With costs against petitioner.</p>
