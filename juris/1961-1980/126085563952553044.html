				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Juanito Suarez petitions for a writ of prohibition against the Honorable 
Damaso S. Tengco, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Batangas, to 
restrain him from compelling petitioner to testify in Civil Case No. 1058 of 
said court.
<p>It would appear that a jeep in which plaintiffs in the civil case (the other 
respondents herein De la Roca and Umali) were riding, had collided with an 
automobile driven by petitioner, and as a sequel thereto, Criminal Case No, 1458 
was filed against petitioner in the Court of First Instance of Batangas. On 
August 28, 1959, Civil Case No. 1058 was also filed against petitioner to 
collect damages allegedly suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of his reckless 
negligence in the same incident involved in the criminal case. On the first day 
of trial of the civil case, and while Criminal Case No. 1458 was also pending in 
the same court, plaintiffs therein required defendant Suarez (petitioner herein) 
to take the stand and testify as their first witness. Petitioner objected, 
averring that there wag a pending criminal case (Criminal Case No. 1458) against 
him for the very acts upon which the civil action was based; that the purpose of 
plaintiffs was merely to fish for evidence to be utilized in the pending 
criminal suit; and that for him to be compelled to testify in the civil case was 
violative of the constitution guaranty against self-incrimination. Petitioner's 
objections, which were later set in writing in a motion for reconsideration, 
were overruled by the respondent judge, who directed petitioner to take the 
stand and testify.</p>
<p>We think the lower court did not err in directing petitioner to take the 
witness stand. No legal impediment exists against a litigant calling any of the 
adverse parties to be his witness. In fact, Section 83, Rule 123 of the Rules 
providesâ€”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A party may interrogate any unwilling or hostile witness by leading 
questions. <i>A party may call an adverse party</i> * * *, <i>and interrogate 
him</i> by leading questions and contradict and impeach him in all respects as 
if he had been called by the adverse party, and the witness thus called may be 
contradicted and impeached by or on behalf of the adverse party also, and may be 
cross-examined by the adverse party only upon the subject-matter of his 
examination in chief." (Italics supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p>True, an accused in a criminal case may not be compelled to testify, or to so 
much as utter a word, even for his own defense (U.S. <i>vs</i>. Junio, 1 Phil., 
50; U.S. <i>vs</i>. Luzon, 4 Phil., 344; U.S. <i>vs</i>. Binayoh, 35 Phil., 23; 
Sec. 1 (c), Rule 111, Rules of Court). But while the constitutional guaranty 
against self-incrimination protects a person in all types of cases, be they 
criminal, civil, or administrative (Art. III, sec. 1, No. 18, Phil. 
Constitution; Bermudez <i>vs</i>. Castillo, 64 Phil., 483), said privilege, in 
proceedings other than a criminal case against him who invokes it, is considered 
an option of refusal to answer incriminating questions, and not a prohibition of 
inquiry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Except in criminal cases, there is no rule prohibiting a party litigant from 
utilizing his adversary as a witness. As a matter of fact, section 83 of Rule 
123, Rules of Court, expressly authorizes a party to call an adverse party to 
the witness stand and interrogate him. This rule is, of course, subject to the 
constitutional injunction not to compel any person to testify against himself. 
But it is established that the privilege against self-incrimination must be 
invoked at the proper time, and the proper time to invoke it is when a question 
calling for a criminating answer is propounded. This has to be so, because 
before a question is asked there would be no way of telling whether the 
information to be elicited from the witness is self-incriminating or not. As 
stated in Jones on Evidence (Vol. 6, pp. 4926-4927), a person who has been 
summoned to testify 'cannot decline to appear, nor can he decline to be sworn as 
a witness' and 'no claim of privilege can be made until a question calling for a 
criminating answer is asked; at that time, and, generally speaking, at that time 
only, the claim of privilege may properly be interposed.'" (Gonzales <i>vs</i>. 
Sec. of Labor, 94 Phil., 325; 50 Off. Gaz., 1080, cit. in Navarro, Criminal 
Procedure, p. 302).</p></blockquote>
<p>Here, petitioner invoked the privilege even prior to any question, and simply 
declined to take the witness stand. Note that in the Gonzales case, above-cited, 
the adverse party was directed to take the witness stand in proceedings to 
investigate an alleged failure to pay overtime compensation, which, under the 
corresponding special laws, carries a penal sanction. Here, petitioner was being 
directed to take the stand, not in a criminal case where he is an accused, but 
in an independent civil action which, although arising from the same facts 
involved in a criminal case pending before the same court, is still regarded by 
law as an "entirely separate and distinct" action, governed by a correspondingly 
different set of rules (Civil Code of the Phil., Art. 2177).</p>
<p>Wherefore, the petition to prohibit the respondent judge from directing 
petitioner to take the witness stand and testify is denied, without prejudice to 
petitioner's properly invoking the guaranty against self-incrimination when and 
as questions are propounded to him on the stand. Costs against 
petitioner.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, 
Paredes, Dizon, De Leon,</i> and <i>Natividad, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
