the decision in Civil Case No. 2043-P of the Court of First Ins­tance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, entitled "Emma R. <span class="SpellE">Geniza</span>,
et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> M. Garcia, et al." and the writ
of execution issued in pursuance of said order, as well as to restrain the
enforcement of both, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of this
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> D. <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,
- hereinafter referred to as Mrs. Santos, although she is, also, Mrs. Moreno -
was one of the defendants in said Civil Case No. 2043-P.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her co-defendants therein were <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> M. Garcia and her husband by second mar­riage, Miguel
Moreno.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three (3) of them are
hereinafter re­ferred to collectively as the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs in said case - private
respondents herein - were Emma R. <span class="SpellE">Geniza</span>, her
husband, Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Geniza</span>, her brother, <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> Rivera, the lat­ter's wife, Catalina <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span>-Rivera, and Lorenzo Rivera, father of Emma R. <span class="SpellE">Geniza</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> Rivera.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of them are hereinafter referred to
collectively as the plaintiffs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1964</st1:date>,
decision was rendered in said case sentencing the defendants to pay, jointly and
severally, to the plain­tiffs:</p>

<blockquote>“(1) P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, plus 12% interest
thereon from <st1:date year="1959" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1959</st1:date>,
up to the date of payment;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2) P97,000.00 as compensatory damage to Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Geniza</span> and Lorenzo Rivera, and P195,000.00 as compensatory
damage to Catalina <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(3) P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as moral damage;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(4) P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as exemplary damage;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(5) P25<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as attorney's fees and
costs of the suit."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From said decision the defendants appealed to this Court, in
which the case is docketed as G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-24071.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Owing to the failure of Garcia and <st1:city><st1:place>Moreno</st1:place></st1:city>
to file their briefs on time, their respective appeals were dismissed on <st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1966</st1:date>, thereby leaving Mrs.
Santos as the only appellant in that case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pending the perfection of defendants' appeal, or on <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="11">November 6, 1964</st1:date>, the plaintiffs
filed, with the lower court a motion for the immediate execution of its
decision, upon the ground that the appeal taken <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
was dilatory in nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite
defendants' opposition thereto, said court, then presided over by Honorable
Angel A. <span class="SpellE">Mojica</span>, Judge, now Associate Justice of the
Court of Appeals, issued an order, dated November 19, 1964 - or before the
approval of defendants' record on appeal, on December 23, 1964 - granting said
motion, "unless defendants file a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span>
bond in the amount of the judgment within ten (10) days from receipt" of
said order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such bond having been
filed, the corresponding writ of execution was issued on <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Acting in pursuance thereof, the Sheriffs of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city> and <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
levied upon various properties as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 16, 1965
- certain movables belonging to petitioner and her husband, and issued notice
that said movables would be sold at public auction on January 26, 1965 (Annex
"H");</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 18, 1965
- the rights, title, interest or participation which petitioner <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> D. Santos may have on the real properties and
improve­ments thereon covered by TCT No. 22744, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, and issued notice that said properties would be sold at public auction on
February 16, 1965 (An­nex “I”);</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 2, 1965 -
the <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> Sugar Mills, <span class="SpellE">Marilag</span>
Bldg., Ayala Blvd., <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
was served notice of Garnishment (Annex "K") of all goods, effects,
etc., and specifically the salaries, bonuses, per diems, and allowances of
herein peti­tioner in the possession or under the control of, or receivable
from, said company; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 3, 1965 - the
<span class="SpellE">Pasumil</span> Planters, Inc., 2930 Sta. Mesa Blvd., Manila,
was served notice of Garnishment (Annex "L") of 8,010 shares therein
registered in the name of herein petitioner evidenced by Stock Certificates
Nos. 430, 474 and 566."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The projected sheriffs' sales mentioned in paragraphs (1) and (2)
were, however, suspended on account of a third party claim filed by Luis D.
Santos and other heirs of <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Santos, and an
order, issued in an action, filed by the third party claimants, with the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, directing the
preserva­tion of the <u>status quo</u>, pending final determination of said
action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, Mrs. Santos had moved to lift the gar­nishment
referred to in paragraphs (3) and (4), insofar as it affected her salary and
per diems as treasurer of the <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> Sugar Mills
-hereinafter referred to as the PASUMIL - upon the ground that they are
necessary for her support and that of her children by her first husband, the
late <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Santos.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, these children filed a third party claim with respect to the
shares of stock described in said paragraph (4).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1965</st1:date>,
Mrs. Santos commenced the present action for certiorari with preliminary
injunction, against the plaintiffs in the main case and Judge <span class="SpellE">Mojica</span>, as well as the Sheriffs of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
and <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the filing of a bond in the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,000</span>, this Court issued said writ of preliminary injunction,
on <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mrs. Santos maintains that Judge <span class="SpellE">Mojica</span>
had gravely abused his discretion in ordering the execution of the decision in
the main case because, in the language of <span class="SpellE">Aguilos</span> vs.
Barrios:<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> If
the judgment is executed and, on appeal, the same is reversed, although there
are provisions for restitution, oftentimes damages may arise which cannot be
fully compensated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
execution should be granted only when these considerations are clearly
outweighed by superior circumstances demand­ing urgency, and the provision
contained in Rule 39, sec. 2, requires a statement of those circumstances as a
security for their existence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is further urged, on behalf of Mrs. Santos, that her
participation in and liability for the fraud allegedly practiced upon private
respondents herein is a matter divorced from the participation and liability of
Garcia and Moreno inasmuch as:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the proof
linking her to said fraud is not of the same nature or weight as that
introduced against her co-defendants in the main case; the decision therein
rendered was based upon allegedly spurious and non-existent preponderance of
evidence; her motion for new trial in the main case had been unjustly and
erroneously denied; and excessive dam­ages and damages not suffered have been
awarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say, however, these
arguments deal with the merits of the decision in the main case, which is the
subject-matter of G. R. No. L-24071 and cannot be passed upon in the present
action for certiorari, in which the issue is whether or not Judge <span class="SpellE">Mojica</span> had exceeded his jurisdiction in authorizing the
execution of said decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a review of the record, we are fully satisfied that peti­tioner
has not made out a case against respondents herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is well-settled that the question
whether or not a decision should be executed pending appeal is mainly addressed
to the sound discre­tion of the court, which appears to have properly exercised
it, for:</p>

<p class="BODY">(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The co-defendants of
Mrs. Santos do not seemingly have any property upon which the judgment against
them may be satisfied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other
hand, Mrs. Santos has a house and lot in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city> with a total assessed
value of P136<span class="GramE">,150</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This property is, how­ever, subject to a mortgage for P150<span class="GramE">,000</span>, in favor of the Philippine Trust Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, due to non-payment of interest, the
mort­gage debt aggregated, as of <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="10">October
 12, 1964</st1:date>, to P191<span class="GramE">,863</span>, which has probably
increased owing to the interest accruing subsequently thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, petitioner is in imminent
danger of insol­vency.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No other property
appears to be available for the satis­faction of said judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The movables described in the aforemen­tioned
paragraph (1) are the object of a third party claim of Luis D. Santos and other
alleged heirs of the late <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Santos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shares of stock above referred to are the
object of a similar claim, filed by the children begotten by Mrs. Santos to her
first husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then again Mrs. Santos
maintains that her salary and bonuses as treasurer of the PASUMIL are needed
for her support and that of her children.</p>

<p class="BODY">(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. Santos had a
plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law to forestall
execution of the decision against her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She could have filed a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the order complained of conditioned
the issuance of the writ of exe­cution upon the absence of said bond, which she
did not file within the period given in said order, or at any time
thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have repeatedly held that
failure to avail of such remedy is sufficient ground to deny a writ of
certiorari against an order authorizing the execution of a decision pending
appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The suit against the
defendants in the main case was for the recovery of damages resulting from
fraud allegedly committed by them against the plaintiffs therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter alleged and the lower court found
that, by fraudulently inducing them to believe that a barter license for
P16,000,000 in favor of Southern Luzon Coconut Producers Association, Inc. -
whom the defendants claimed to represent - had been approved and would be
released within two (2) weeks after payment of P100,000 as license fee, and
that Emma R. <span class="SpellE">Geniza</span> would get a commission of
P480,000 if she found a buyer of said license - which in fact had never been
approved - the defen­dants succeeded in persuading her, her husband and her
father to mortgage several parcels of land to one Henry <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
for P50,000, as well as in inducing Catalina <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span>-Rivera
and her husband to mortgage another parcel of land to the Asia Mercantile
Corporation for another P50,000, both sums payable within 40 days, and to de­liver
to the defendants, in the house of Mrs. Santos and her second husband, Miguel
Moreno, the aggregate sum of P100,000 thus bor­rowed, under promise on
defendants' part to pay it back within the same period of time, which promise
they did not fulfill, in view of which the mortgaged properties - with an
aggregate market value of P292,000<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> -
were foreclosed and title thereto eventually conso­lidated in the respective
mortgagees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mrs. Santos denied having performed the acts imputed to her by
the plaintiffs, as well as the genuineness of the signature purport­ing to be
hers on the promissory note allegedly signed by her when said sum of P100,000
was delivered, as above stated, to the de­fendants. Considering, however, the
evidence for the plaintiffs, including the testimony of a handwriting expert,
on the genuine­ness of the aforementioned signature of Mrs. Santos, and the
other circumstances surrounding the case, respondent Judge - after comparing
the questioned signature with standard signatures of Mrs. Santos - found the
evidence for the defendants unworthy of credence, and concluded that their
appeal had been "taken for the purpose of delay.” The record before us
does not warrant our disturbing this conclusion, which, in turn, is sufficient
ground to justify execution pending appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition herein is dismissed and the writ
