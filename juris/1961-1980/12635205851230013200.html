				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>
and prohibition with the prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary
mandatory injunction was filed by petitioner-appellant Francisco M. <span class="SpellE">Cucharo</span> by way of appeal (p. 144, rec.) from the order
dated July 20, 1966 respectively dis­missing the petition as well as denying
appellant's motion for summary judgment and from the order of August 4, 1966
denying the motion for reconsideration of the order of July 20, 1966 (pp. 128,
142, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is undisputed that petitioner-appellant Francisco M. <span class="SpellE">Cucharo</span> was formerly the principal of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Calinan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Elementary school</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Calinan</span> District, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1956" day="28" month="1">January
 28, 1956</st1:date>, a senior teacher (regular) examination was given by the
Civil Service Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he was
promoted as District Supervisor sometime in 1960 by virtue of his junior
teacher eligibility, he gave as additional qualification his senior teacher
(promo<span style="">tional) </span>eligibility,
claiming that he received on <st1:date year="1958" day="28" month="3">March 28,
 1958</st1:date> from the Civil service Commission a report of his rating
showing that he obtained a passing mark of 81.78% in the senior teacher
examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because he actually failed
in the said senior teacher examination, in a third <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>
dated august 27, 1962, the Commissioner of Civil service required him to
explain why "the notice of rating dated March 28, 1958 purporting to show
that he obtained a rating of 81.78% in the senior teacher (promotional)
examination xx <span class="SpellE">xx</span> contains certain unauthorized
erasures and insertions" which make it different from the notice as
originally issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a formal investigation at which he denied making the
alleged erasures and insertions, petitioner-appellant was found guilty of
serious misconduct consisting of falsification of a civil service rating card
in <span style="">A</span>dministrative Case No.
R-24579 of the Civil service Commission and was accordingly dismissed from the
service by the Civil service Commissioner effective on the last day of duty
with pay in a decision dated <st1:date year="1965" day="6" month="8">August 6,
 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same decision,
the Civil Service Commission likewise di­rected that the said decision be
executed immediately in the public interest(Annex A, petition, pp. 12-14,
rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Civil Service Commissioner coursed the aforesaid decision
through the respondent Director of Public Schools, who in turn transmitted the
same to the respondent superintendent of city schools of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
City in a letter dated September 30, 1965, directing that the decision of the
Civil Service Commissioner be executed immediately "<span style="">b</span>ut not beyond ten days from receipt
thereof" and requesting that three copies of the special order covering
the dismissal of petitioner-appellant from the service together with the advice
of the date he acknowledges receipt of the decision be fur<span style="">nished his </span>office (Director of Public
schools) by return <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> thereof (Annex B of
the petition, p. 14, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the aforesaid instructions of the Director of Public <span style="">schools, </span>the respondent superintendent
of city schools of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City issued Division Order
No. 677, s. 1965, dated December 1, 1965 making of record the separation of the
petitioner-appellant from the service pursuant to the order of dismissal by the
Commissioner of Civil Service effective that day, December 1, 1965 (Annex C of
the petition or <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2 – Motion, pp. 15, 173, rec.);
and transmitted the said Division Order No. 677 together with his first <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> dated December 1, 1965 to petitioner-appellant
inviting attention to the basic communication of the Director of Public Schools
and to the enclosed decision of the Commissioner of Civil Service, and
requesting that petitioner-appellant acknowledges receipt of the enclosed
decision of the Civil Service Commissioner by return <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1, Opposition, p. 172, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">In his second <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> dated
December 1, 1965, petitioner-appellant acknowledged receipt at 3 o'clock in the
afternoon of that day, December 1, 1965, "the said order of dismissal
entitled Division Order No. 677, series of 1965, together with a copy of the
letter of the Director of Public Schools, dated September 30, 1965, to the
Division Superin­tendent of Schools, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City, to
execute immediately the alleged decision of the Commissioner of Civil Service
in Administrative Case No. R-24579, a copy of which is attached to the said
letter", expressly stating therein that he is receiving the same
"UNDER PROTEST because the said copy of the decision is ordered executed
before he could receive it and before he could have the opportunity to read it,
thereby arbitrarily denying and preventing him from filing a motion for its
reconsideration or appealing the same xx <span class="SpellE">xx</span> "

<p class="BODY">In another letter also dated December 1, 1965 addressed to Mr. <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> Raquel, Principal of <span class="SpellE">Calinan</span>
Central Elementary School, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City, the
respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> superintendent of city schools
designated the former "as Principal in Charge of <span class="SpellE">Calinan</span>
District vice Mr. Francisco <span class="SpellE">Cucharo</span>, separated, effec­tive
immediately" and instructed him to receive all money and property
responsibility from Mr. <span class="SpellE">Cucharo</span>, herein
petitioner-appellant (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. Q, Motion, p. 168, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">In his letter-circular dated <st1:date year="1965" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1965</st1:date>, addressed to all principals/head
teachers, Principal In Charge <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> R. Raquel
quoted verbatim the letter of respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
superintendent of city schools dated <st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="12">December
 1, 1965</st1:date> for their information and guidance (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
R - Motion, p. 169, rec.); and on the same day as such principal-in-charge, he
issued another letter circular to all principals/head teachers and teachers-<span class="SpellE">in­charge</span> in the <span class="SpellE">Calinan</span> District
informing them that there will be a meeting on December 8, 1965 at 7:30 in the
morning (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. S, Motion, p. 170, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the decision, petitioner-appellant filed on
December 2, 1965 the present petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>
and <span style="">prohibition with writ of
preliminary mandatory injunction in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>; (1) to declare the Civil Ser­vice Commissioner with
having acted with grave abuse of discretion and without authority of law in
ordering his immediate dismissal; (2) to declare null and void the decision of
the Civil Service Commissioner dismissing him from the service; (3) to declare
the respondent superintendent of city schools as without authority of law in
issuing Division Order No. 677, series of 1965, as well as to declare said
order null and void; and (4) to declare respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Director of Public schools as having acted with grave abuse of discretion and
without authority of law in amending the decision of the Civil Service
Commission with respect to the execution thereof (pp. 1-21, rec.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1965</st1:date>,
the lower court issued ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> a writ of preliminary
injunction directing the respondents?<span class="SpellE"><span style="">appellees</span></span><span style=""> to refrain from executing the decision in
Adminis­trative Case No. R-24579 and to refrain from replacing
petitioner-appellant (pp. 22-23, 26-27, rec.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 27, 1965, petitioner-appellant filed a motion to
declare respondent division superintendent of city schools in contempt of court
for having designated the prin­cipal teacher of <span class="SpellE">Calinan</span>
Elementary School to assume the duties of District supervisor of <span class="SpellE">Calinan</span> District in violation of the preliminary
injunction, claiming that he never vacated the position, much less turned over
the same to the one desig<span style="">nated to
perform its duties (pp. 30-41, rec.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 27, 1965, the Civil Service Commission received
petitioner-appellant's motion for reconsideration of the decision of the Civil
Service Commissioner dated August 6, 1965, which motion was referred to the
Director of Public Schools by a first <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>
dated January 17, 1966 for comment and recommendation (par. 2[b] of
respondent's Answer dated January 21, 1966, pp. 83-84, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1965</st1:date>,
respondent superintendent of city schools filed a motion to quash preliminary
writ of injunction and an opposition to the motion to declare him in contempt
of court (pp. 45-47, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1966</st1:date>,
petitioner-appellant filed a motion to declare respondent superintendent of
city schools in default (p. 42, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1966</st1:date>,
the trial court, after hearing, issued an order dissolving the writ of
preliminary injunction issued on <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="12">December
 4, 1965</st1:date> and denied the motion to declare respondent superintendent
of city schools in contempt of court on the ground that respondent
superintendent of city schools had already accomplished the acts sought to be
restrained (p. 49, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In another
order issued on the same day, the lower court denied the motion to declare
respondent superintendent of city schools in default (p. 44, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="11" month="1">January 11, 1966</st1:date>,
petitioner-appellant filed an urgent motion for reconsideration of the two
orders dated <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1966</st1:date>
dissolving the writ of preliminary injunction and denying the motion to declare
respondent superintendent of city schools in default (pp. 50-59, 60-62, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 1, 1966, the date set for pre-trial, the lower court
issued an order granting respondent superintendent of city schools five days
within which to file a motion to dismiss the petition and petitioner-appellant
was given a similar period to file an opposition (p. 107, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="6" month="7">July
 6, 1966</st1:date>, a motion to dismiss was filed (pp. 109-111, rec.) and on <st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1966</st1:date>, petitioner-appellant
filed his opposition thereto with a counter-motion for summary judgment (pp.
112-121, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1966</st1:date>,
the lower court issued an order dismissing the petition and denied as without
merit petitioner-appellant's motion for summary judgment (p. 128, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1966</st1:date>,
petitioner-appellant filed a motion for reconsideration (pp. 130-138, rec.),
which was denied for lack of merit by the lower court in its order dated <st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="8">August 4, 1966</st1:date> (p. 142, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this appeal (p. 144, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner-appellant claims that the lower court erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) <span style="">in
not resolving </span>his urgent motion for reconsideration of the order dated
January 5, 1966 particularly the portion dissolving <span style="">the writ of </span>preliminary injunction, and the motion for recon­sideration
of the order dated January 5, 1966 denying his motion to declare respondent
superintendent of city schools in default before setting the pre-trial on July
1, 1966; (2) in dismissing the petition; and (3) in not granting the motion for
summary judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The three errors assigned by petitioner-appellant shall be
discussed jointly.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a major premise, it has been the repeated pronouncement of
this supreme Tribunal that the Civil Service Commissioner has the discretion to
order the immediate execution in the public interest of his decision separating
petitioner-appellant from the service, always subject however to the rule that,
in the event the Civil Service Board of Appeals or the proper court determines
that his dismissal is illegal, he should be paid the salary corre­sponding to
the period of his separation from the service until his reinstatement.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As elucidated <span style="">by Mr.
Justice <span class="SpellE">Ar<span style="">senio</span></span></span>
<span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> in the <span class="SpellE">Cabigao</span> case,
"although the decision of the Commissioner of Civil Service adverse to the
government employee under investigation is <span class="SpellE">appeal­able</span>
to the Civil Service Board of Appeals, the Commissioner has discretion to
enforce it and make it effective pending appeal, to protect public
interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the removal or the
continued suspension of the employee effected through the execution of the
appealed decision shall be considered as unjustified should said decision be
reversed by the Civil Service Board of Appeals and, in such case, as provided
for in section 35 of the Civil service Act of 1959, the employee 'shall be
restored <span style="">to </span>his position with
full pay for the period of suspension'."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner-appellant is indulging in euphemism when he states
that the decision dismissing him from the service cannot be executed
immediately before he could receive it and before he could have the opportunity
to read the same, thereby arbi­trarily preventing him from filing a motion for
reconsideration or appealing the same; because he actually received the copy of
the decision consisting only of two pages (see Annex A to the petition, pp.
12-13, rec.) which will not take him five minutes to read and comprehend its
contents.</p>

<p class="BODY">While he received only a copy of the decision, he does not impugn
its correctness or accuracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate,
he was fortunate that the decision dated <st1:date year="1965" day="6" month="8">August
 6, 1965</st1:date>, was executed only on <st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1965</st1:date> or over three months thereafter.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the Commissioner of Civil Service concluded that "the
facts of this case engender reasonable belief that respondent is guilty of the
charge" is only one way of expressing the idea that the facts support the
reasonable conclusion that peti­tioner-appellant is guilty of the charge
against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">As </span>to the intrinsic merits of the findings of facts of the Civil
Service Commissioner, the same would still depend on the appreciation thereof
by the Civil Service Board of <span style="">Appe</span>als.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As heretofore stated, should he be exonerated
by the Civil Service Board of Appeals or by the Civil Service Commissioner
himself acting on his motion for reconsideration, petitioner-appellant would be
entitled to recover back salaries.</p>

<p class="BODY">The basic ground that the petition states no cause of action,
upon which respondent superintendent of city schools predicates his motion to
dismiss before the lower court, which is also alleged as a special defense in
the Answer filed by the <span style="">Solicitor </span>General
(p. 85, rec.), is predicated on the fact that petitioner-appellant has not
exhausted admin­istrative remedies by filing a motion for reconsideration of
the decision filed with the Civil Service Commissioner (which he subsequently
filed on December 27, 1965) and an appeal to the Civil Service Board of
Appeals, before he can seek any remedy from the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the record indicating the
status of his motion for reconsideration of the decision of the Civil Service
Commissioner or whether he has filed an appeal with the Civil Service Board of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an omission to exhaust all
administrative remedies open to him under the law is fatal to his petition, for
it signifies lack of a cause of action. <a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Because the <span style="">order </span><span style="">of the trial court dated </span>August 6, 1966
dismissing the petition and denying his motion for summary judgment, after
considering the grounds invoked in the motion to dismiss as<span style=""> well as </span>the reasons advanced by
petitioner-appellant in opposition thereto and to support his counter-motion
for summary judgment, is proper and legal, there was no need for the lower
court to resolve petitioner?appellant's motion for reconsideration of the
order dated January 5, 1966 quashing the writ of preliminary injunction and the
order dated January 5, 1966 denying his motion to declare respondent
superintendent of city schools in default, which would merely be an exercise in
futility.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that exhaustion of administrative remedies is a
general rule, the case of the petitioner-appellant does not fall under anyone
the recognized exceptions thereto as enunciated by this Tribunal, some of which
are re-stated in Escalante vs. <span class="SpellE">Subicio</span>, supra.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner-appellant will not suffer irreparable injury or damage
by awaiting a final administrative action in his case;<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
because <span style="">he </span>can collect back
salaries should his dismissal be adjudged illegal.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The issues involved in the decision the Civil Service Commissioner separating
him from the service are not purely legal questions.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The act of the Commissioner of Civil Service is not patently devoid of any
color of authority or manifestly illegal; neither did the Civil Service Commis­sioner
act without or in excess of his jurisdiction nor commit a grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The case of <span class="SpellE">Guisadio</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>, et. al.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
does not apply <span style="">to </span>the case at
bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <span class="SpellE">Guisadio</span>
case, the execution of <span style="">the decision </span>was
enjoined by the trial court; because in said case, while the decision of the
Commissioner of Civil Service "consid­ered <span class="SpellE">Guisadio</span>
resigned from the service effective on (his) last day of service with
pay", it did not expressly direct that the said decision is immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span> in the public interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the respondent District Supervisor
therein who wanted its immediate execution, for he directed <span class="SpellE">Guisadio</span>
to turn over all his (<span class="SpellE">Guisadio's</span>) property
accountabilities before <span class="SpellE">Guisadio</span> received a copy of
the decision itself, which immediate implementation was enjoined by trial court
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, the
decision of the Civil Service Commissioner expressly directs its immediate
execution in the public interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
ruled in the <span class="SpellE">Guisadio</span> case that based "on the
facts presented to the trial judge", the trial judge "adopted the
proper view" and "did not err" in enjoining the immediate
execution of the deci­sion of the Civil Service Commissioner.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However that may be, the cases of <span class="SpellE">Yarcia</span>
vs. City of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Trocio</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>, Austria vs. Auditor General and <span class="SpellE">Cabigao</span> <span style="">v. </span>Del
Rosario, which were decided subsequently to the <span class="SpellE">Guisadio</span>
case, should be decisive of the case at bar since the relevant facts of the
aforesaid cases and of the instant case are analogous.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can petitioner-appellant properly invoke the case of <span class="SpellE">Abaya</span> vs. Villegas, et, al.,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>In the instant case, the decision of
the Civil Service Commissioner was promulgated after an administrative
investigation of the charges against appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In said <span class="SpellE">Abaya</span> case, the petitioner therein was
ordered dismissed from the service without prior inves­tigation or
hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <span class="SpellE">Abaya</span>
case, only a purely legal question was involved, and the order of dismissal
therein was patently illegal by reason of the fact that the petitioner therein was
denied due process, which issues removed the <span class="SpellE">Abaya</span>
case from being governed by the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative
remedies.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
