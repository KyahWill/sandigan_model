Branch IV, entitled "Associated Insurance and Surety Co., Inc., vs. <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Sta. Maria and Antonio R. <span class="SpellE">Banzon</span>",
judgment was rendered as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW WHEREOF, the court renders judgment condemning
defendants to pay jointly and severally unto plaintiff but for the benefit of

P14,811.42, all with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from date of the

benefit only of the plaintiff; and no pronouncement as to costs."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As the above decision
became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, the corresponding writ of
execution was issued and levy </span>was made upon the properties of the
judgment debtor Antonio <span style="">R. <span class="SpellE">Banzon</span> </span>covered by Transfer Certificates of Title
Nos. 39685 and 53759 issued in his name by the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first
covered a parcel of land containing an area of 650 square meters situated in
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Calaanan</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
and the second, another parcel of 650 square meters situated in the same barrio
of the same municipality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">After the </span>proceedings required by law
in connection with execution sales, the aforesaid properties were sold, the
judgment creditor, Associated Insurance and Surety Co., <span style="">Inc., having been the highest bidder, for </span>the total sum of P<span style="">41,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> issued in its favor the
corresponding certificate of sale dated </span><st1:date year="1957" day="27" month="6"><span style="">June 27, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="">, which was duly registered on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="30" month="6"><span style="">June 30,
 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the period of redemption expired on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="20" month="6"><span style="">June 20,
 1960</span></st1:date><span style=""> without the
judgment debtor, or any proper party having exercised it, the </span><span style="">judgment creditor </span><span style="">and purchaser obtained in due time the
corresponding final certificate of sale, which was likewise duly registered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, herein petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
made demands upon Antonio R. <span class="SpellE">Banzon</span> to deliver to it
the owner's duplicate of certificates of title Nos. 39685 and 53759 mentioned
heretofore, but the latter refused to do so.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a result it filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in Case No. 3885, G.L.R.O. Record No. 11267 a <span style="">petition for </span>an order directing
Antonio R. <span class="SpellE">Banzon</span> to present his owner's duplicate,
of certificates of title Nos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">39685 and <span style="">53759 </span>to the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
for cancellation, and for another <span style="">order
directing the </span>Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> to
cancel <span style="">said </span>duplicates
and to issue new transfer certifi­cates of title covering the properties in the
name of peti­tioner.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Banzon</span> filed his opposition to the
petition claiming mainly that (1) <span style="">the decision of the Court of First Instance of
Manila in Civil </span>Case No. 31237 was void as far as he was <span style="">concerned </span>because he had never been
summoned in connection therewith; and that (2) the levy and sale of the
properties <span style="">covered
</span>by the <span style="">petition
were likewise void </span>because <span style="">they </span>were
conjugal properties belonging to him and his wife, Rosa <span class="SpellE">Balmaceda</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a hearing on the motion and opposition mentioned above, the
lower court, on <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="2">February 17, 1961</st1:date>,
rendered a decision whose <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered in
favor of the petitioner granting the relief prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> are
hereby ordered to surrender to the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
the Certificate of Title in question for cancellation and let <span style="">a </span>new one be issued in the name of
the petitioner."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal interposed by them, the <span class="SpellE">Banzons</span>
seek a reversal of the above decision upon the same grounds relied upon in
their opposition filed in the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">This appeal is without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With
respect to appellants’ contention that Antonio R. <span class="SpellE">Banzon</span>
had not been duly served with summons in connection </span>with Civil Case No.
31237 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, it is enough for us to quote
here the pertinent portions of the well-considered decision of the lower court
-</p>

<blockquote>"With respect to the first contention of <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>,
the latter in effect contends that not having been served by summons, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Banzon</span> never became a party defendant to the aforesaid
civil case and hence not bound by, any judgment rendered therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is erroneous on the part of the petitioner
to contend that the objection <span style="">as </span>to
<span style="">lack of jurisdiction on </span>the
defendant's person has been waived for said waiver applies only when summons
has been served although defectively, such as one not served by the proper
officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the contention of the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> were true, that is, no summons <span style="">was </span>ever served upon him and that he
was completely unaware of the proceedings in the civil case aforementioned, the
properties in question could not be levied upon for that would amount to a deprivation
of <span class="SpellE">oppositor’s</span> property without due process of law.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"The
</span><span style="">burden, however, rests upon the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> to prove that there was in fact no service of
summons and this, the court </span>believes, the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
have failed to substantiate with sufficient evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a fundamental rule that the regularity
of all official actions and proceedings will be presumed until the contrary is
proved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said civil case <span style="">No. </span>31237, the records show,
particularly the answer and the motion to dismiss, that the proceedings were
conducted by counsel in behalf of all the defendants therein including the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Banzon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presumption therefore, of the regularity
of the proceedings as against said defendant will be maintained including the
fact that either summons was duly served or that the de<span style="">fendant <span class="SpellE">Banzon</span> voluntarily appeared in court
without </span>such summons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
therefore incumbent upon the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> to rebut this
presumption with competent and proper evidence such as the return made by the
sheriff who served the summons in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This, however, the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> have not met.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, the circumstances of the case all the more bear out
the strength of this presumption when is considered that the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> Antonio <span class="SpellE">Banzon</span> received
a notice of execution and levy of this properties and notice of the sale of the
same at public auction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> have been prejudiced by being deprived of due
process, they should have filed either a third party claim upon the property
levied or an injunction proceeding to prevent its sale at public auction, nor
would they have allowed the consummation of the sale end the lapse of one year
with which the redemption could have been exercised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These facts gravely militate against the
merits of the opposition, not only insofar as it strengthens the aforesaid
presumption of regularity, but also insofar as they are indicative of the fact
that the properties levied upon <span style="">ere </span>not conjugal property or even if they
were that the debt involved was one which redound to the benefit of the family
for which the conjugal partnership may be held liable."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' second contention namely, that the properties now in
question ere their conjugal properties, is belied by the record before us which
shows that Transfer <span style="">Certificates of
Title Nos. 39685 and 53759 were issued in the name of Antonio R. <span class="SpellE">Banzon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
there is no sufficient evidence in the record to show that the properties were
acquired during appellants' marriage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
