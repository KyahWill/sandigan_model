				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Suit was commenced on October 15, 1956 by <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span>,
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">Salinangan</span></span><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Moyang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Senduyan</span>, </span><span class="SpellE">Cellona</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abayon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Juaning</span>, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Manoba</span>, heirs of <span class="SpellE">Campa</span>-an (<span class="SpellE">Manobo</span>), against Sebastian Miranda in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> (civil case 2127).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs sought to recover from the
defendant the ownership and possession of a parcel of land of a little more
than 9 hectares in area, situated in <span class="SpellE">Malita</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, and covered by OCT 1652 issued on January 19<span class="GramE">,1937</span> in the name of the Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Campa</span>-an
(<span class="SpellE">Manobo</span>), to­gether with all the improvements
standing thereon, plus damages, actual and exemplary, attorney's fees <span style="">and </span>costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The
complaint </span>alleges in essence that they are the absolute co-owners of the
<span style="">land, and </span>that the defendant,
through gross <span style="">misrepresentations and
deceit, succeeded in 1936 in obtaining from the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Salinangan</span>
all the papers and documents ap­<span style="">pertaining
thereto, </span>and thereafter securing a certificate of <span style="">title in his </span>name without their
knowledge and consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his answer
with counterclaim, Miranda averred that he took posses­sion of the land
sometime in 1938, after acquiring it in an auction sale conducted by the
provincial treasurer of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Davao</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> <span style="">on </span></span><st1:date year="1938" day="13" month="5"><span style="">May </span><span style="">13,
 1938</span></st1:date><span style="">, and that since
then he had been in continuous ownership and possession thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After 17 postponements covering a period of almost four years,
the case was finally set for hearing on September 30, 1960, counsel of both
parties being duly notified thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span>the said date,
the counsel for the plaintiffs appeared in court, but neither the defendant nor
his counsel was present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs
thereupon prayed the court to allow them to pre­<span style="">sent their evidence <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>This prayer was granted, but only
after the trial judge had verified that the counsel of the de­fendant had been
duly notified of the hearing, and after wait­ing for about two hours for him to
put in his appearance.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1960</st1:date>,
the trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiffs, ordering the defendant
Miranda to vacate the <span style="">land and deliver </span><span style="">possession </span>thereof
together with all the im­provements thereon to the plaintiffs, and to pay the
latter P5<span class="GramE">,000</span> in damages <span style="">with legal </span>interest thereon from the date of the filing of the complaint,
plus costs.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A </span>copy of this
decision was received by the defendant's <span style="">counsel on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="20" month="1"><span style="">January 20, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span>the
following February 3, he <span style="">filed a motion
for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>This motion
was denied on <st1:date year="1961" day="26" month="5"><span style="">May 26, </span><span style="">1961</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notice </span>of <span style="">denial </span>was received by the defendant's <span style="">counsel on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="6" month="6"><span style="">June 6, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1961</st1:date> the court ordered the <span style="">issuance </span><span style="">of </span>a <span style="">writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span>July
26, 1961 the defend­<span style="">ant's counsel, in </span>a
<span style="">written manifestation, </span>informed
the <span style="">court that the defendant Miranda
had died in </span>the meanwhile on February <span style="">21, </span><span style="">1961, </span><span style="">leaving his wife <span class="SpellE">Estefania</span> </span>de Miranda and children as <span style="">heirs, and that he is in receipt of a </span>copy
of the plaintiff's mo­<span style="">tion </span><span style="">for </span>the
issuance <span style="">of a writ </span>of execution,
and stated that "we <span style="">submit to the
discretion </span>of the Honorable Court on the above-en­<span style="">titled case".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="8"><span style="">August 11, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>a writ of execution was <span style="">issued against </span>the defendant <span style="">Miranda, </span>but was served on his wife
"who refused to sign but <span style="">received </span>copy."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="8">August
 <span style="">16, 1961</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span><span style="">entry of judgment was made.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The record further shows </span>that
<span style="">on </span>August <span style="">30, 1961 </span>the court promulgated an
order stating that "since the defendant had died <span style="">after the rendition </span>of the <span style="">judgment
</span>the writ of execution already <span style="">issued
</span>against defendant may be enforced against his successor-in-­<span style="">interest (the heirs) </span>(Rule <span style="">39, </span>sec. <span style="">7, </span>Rules of Court)", and fur­<span style="">ther that "The petition for relief </span>from judgment is hereby de­<span style="">nied for </span>lack of <span style="">merits."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>The defendant's subsequent motion <span style="">for reconsideration was denied </span>on <st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="9">September 11, <span style="">1961</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">No appeal was taken by the heirs of the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, on <st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="4">April <span style="">3, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>almost <span style="">7 </span>months later, they filed the <span style="">present </span>petition with this Court, praying that all the
proceedings <span style="">had </span>in the court
below be annulled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They tender for
resolution two?<span style="">issues, namely,
(1) did the respondent judge incur in grave abuse of discretion amounting to
lack of jurisdiction in al­lowing the plaintiffs to introduce their evidence <u>ex</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>p</u><u><span style="">arte</span></u></span>
at the hearing on September 30, 1960, without reserving to the </span><span style="">defendant </span><span style="">Miranda the right to present evidence at a
later date? <span style="">&nbsp;</span>(2) <span class="GramE">having</span>
in view the provisions of section 7 of Rule 39, was the order of </span><st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="7"><span style="">July 17,
 1961</span></st1:date><span style=""> directing the
issuance of a writ of execution proper and legal although entry of judgment was
made long </span><u><span style="">after</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">the death of the
defendant Miranda?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the <u><span style="">first</span></u><span style=""> </span>issue, the petitioners contend that
the trial court gravely abused its discretion in not reserving to the defendant
Miranda the right to present evidence at a later date, arguing that the
plaintiff had been granted ten postpone­ments, while the defendant had been
granted only one postpone­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
contention is without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although it is true, as the petitioners aver, that trial had been
postponed ten times at the instance of the plaintiffs and only once at the
instance of the defendant, it is nonethe­less also true that trial had also
been postponed six times at the instance of the counsel of both parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, 17 postponements, all told,
were granted without objection from the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record does not reveal the ground or
grounds relied upon for each postponement granted, but we must assume that the
trial court correctly exercised its discretion in the matter of every
postponement granted by it, in the ab­sence of any evidence to <span style="">the </span>contrary.</p>

<p class="BODY">Focusing now our attention upon the incidents that transpired
anent the hearing on September 30, 1960, we <span style="">note that </span>it is not disputed by the petitioners that the <span style="">counsel of the de­fendant </span>Miranda not
only was duly notified <span style="">of the said
hearing </span>but as will that he did not ask for a postponement <span style="">thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The </span>judge waited <span style="">for </span>two
hours on that day for the <span style="">defendant's
coun­sel </span>to appear, and only after the latter had failed <span style="">to appear and </span>after the trial judge
had verified from the record <span style="">that the
defendant's </span>counsel had duly received notice <span style="">of the hearing did he </span><span style="">allow
the plaintiffs to introduce their evidence <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">We </span><span style="">are
not persuaded that in so doing the trial judge incurred </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">grave abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matter of continuances </span><span style="">is ever </span><span style="">addressed to the sound discretion of the
court, and its </span><span style="">action </span><span style="">thereon will not be
disturbed on review, save upon a patent and manifest abuse of discretion, which
is not shown here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners nevertheless argue that the court should have
reserved to the defendant his right to present his evidence at a later date
instead of declaring him in default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
fact of the matter is that the court did not declare the defendant in default,
but proceeded to render judgment on the evidence presented by the plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as to the alleged right of the defendant
to present his evidence at a later date, this Court has held that the
"failure of defendant to be present at the hearing" has the
"effect of depriving him of his right to present evidence" (<st1:city><st1:place>San­tiago</st1:place></st1:city>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Conde</span>, 105 Phil. 299).</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the <u>second</u> issue, the petitioners argue that because
section <span style="">7 </span>of Rule <span style="">39 </span>of the old Rules of Court provides
that "where a party dies <u>after</u><span style=""> </span>the entry of judgment or order, exe<span style="">cution thereon may issue, or one already
issued may be enforced </span><span style="">* * * against his executor or administrator or
successor-in-in­terest if the judgment be for recovery of real property * * *</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the writ of execution of August 11, 1961 was void as
the defen­dant had died en the previous February 21, and entry of judgment was
made only on August </span><span style="">16, </span><span style="">1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The syllogism of the petitioners </span><span style="">runs thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the </span><span style="">defendant died before, not after, the entry of judgment, therefore the
writ of execution issued is void.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot accept this argument.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The provision (section 7 of Rule 39) relied upon by the petitioners
cannot be so construed as to invalidate the writ of execution already issued in
so far as service thereof upon the heirs or successors-in-interest of the
defendant is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It merely
indicates against whom a writ of execution is to be enforced when the losing
party dies after the entry of judgment or order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing therein, <span class="GramE">nor</span>
in the entire Rule <span style="">39, </span>to our
mind, even as much as intimates that a writ of execution issued after a party
dies, which death occurs before entry of judgment, is a nullity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writ may yet be enforced against his
executor or administrator, if there be any, or his successor-in-interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, judgment was rendered on <st1:date year="1960" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1960</st1:date>, two months before
the death of the defendant. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Since
neither the defendant, nor his heirs after his death, appealed from the
judgment, the writ of exe­cution issued as a matter of course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matter of the death of the defendant was
communicated to the trial court for the first time on <st1:date year="1961" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1961</st1:date>, after the decision had become
final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in its order of <st1:date year="1961" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1961</st1:date>, the court clearly
commanded <span style="">tha</span><span style="">t the writ of execution already issued be
enforced against the </span>deceased defendant's <span class="GramE"><span style="">successor-in-interest,</span></span><span style=""> </span>and this because <span style="">the record does not at all show that there </span>has
been an executor <span style="">or administrator
appointed for the estate </span>of the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That </span>the writ<span style=""> </span><span style="">of
</span>execution was issued on <st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="8">August
 11, 1961</st1:date>, or five days before entry of judgment was physically
made, is a non-prejudicial error.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the foregoing considerations, the present petition is
patently without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">ACCORDINGLY</b><span style="">, the petition is </span>denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
