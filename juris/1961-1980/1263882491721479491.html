Defendant-Appellant", promulgated on <st1:date year="1970" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1970</st1:date>, affirming the judgment of the Court of First
Instance of Manila, Branch II, whereby <span class="SpellE">Albetz</span> <span class="SpellE">lnvestments</span>, Inc. was ordered to pay damages and attorney's
fees to the plaintiffs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts, as found by the trial court, and adopted by the Court
of Appeals, are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"This is an action for damages caused to the plaintiffs'
properties due to the alleged indiscriminate, negligent, and wanton demolition
of the house of the plaintiffs when the sheriff served the writ of execution
issued by the Municipal Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The <span class="SpellE">Calma</span> spouses were the lessees
of <span style="">that </span>lot described as Lot No.

Investments, Inc., the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, needing the premises
in order <span style="">to </span>construct
a new building, demanded delivery of the lot to it and upon refusal of the <span class="SpellE">Calma</span> Spouses, <span class="SpellE">Albetz</span>
Investments, Inc. brought an action of unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
against <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> <span class="SpellE">Calma</span>,
Civil Case No. 119712 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judgment by default was rendered by the
Municipal Court on March 30, 1964, ordering <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> <span class="SpellE">Calma</span> and all persons claiming under her to vacate the
premises and to pay the corresponding rentals (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

Atty. <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span>,
director and lawyer of <span class="SpellE">Albetz</span> Investments, Inc.,
filed a motion for execution (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was granted and the Municipal
Court issued the writ of execution, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2, on <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1964</st1:date>, commanding the Sheriff
to remove the defendants in the premises and to collect the damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Sheriff submitted his return of <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1964</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 12, informing the Court that on the date of the return
the defendant has not yet demolished her house and improvements or vacated the
lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> <span class="SpellE">Calma</span> and others filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
with pre­liminary injunction on September 7, 1964, in the Court of First

Aragon, etc. and <span class="SpellE">Albetz</span> Investments, Inc. (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C).<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon the
filing of this petition, counsel for <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> <span class="SpellE">Calma</span> filed a motion on <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1964</st1:date>, in the unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
case, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D, praying that all proceedings be
suspended until the termination <span style="">of </span>the
petition for <i>certiorari</i> with prohibition, Special Civil Action No.
58246.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Municipal Judge, acting upon
the said motion for suspension, issued on <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="9">September 17, 1964</st1:date>, the following order (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E):</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'In view of the special civil action for <i>Certiorari</i> and
Prohibition with preliminary and mandatory injunction filed by defendant in the
Court of First Instance of Manila bearing No. 58246, all the proceedings in the

shall have been finally resolved.'</p>

the said motion, the Municipal Judge entered an order on <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1965</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

authorizing and ordering the Sheriff to destroy, demolish or remove the house
which had been constructed by the defendants.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The appeal of the <span class="SpellE">Calmas</span> in the <i>certiorari</i>
case was dismissed by the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There­after, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Calma</span> filed an action
for specific performance with injunction against <span class="SpellE">Albetz</span>
Investments, Inc., Civil Case No. 63549, on <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1965</st1:date>, praying that <span class="SpellE">Albetz</span>
Investments, Inc. be ordered to sell <span style="">the

<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. O, and on February 19, or four days thereafter,
the Sheriff, at the instance of defendant <span class="SpellE">Albetz</span>
Investments, Inc., thru its lawyer, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span>,
demolished the house of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Calma</span> without any
new writ or order for demolition having been issued by the Municipal Court and
only on the strength of the order of June 21, 1965."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Alleging that the demolition was illegal because it was made
eight (8) months after the issuance of the demolition order, and that the
manner it was carried out was indiscriminate, causing damage to their personal
properties, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Calma</span>, owners of the house,
and the spouses <span class="SpellE">Umengan</span>, occupants of its ground
floor, commenced the instant action in the Court of First Instance of Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the principal grounds that the order of demolition was no
longer in force, having been issued eight (8) months before its enforcement,
and that the said spouses were not notified of the order of demolition, and
they demolished the house indiscriminately and the personal properties were
carelessly <span style="">placed, resulting </span><span style="">in </span>their being damaged, the Court <span style="">of First Instance rendered judgment in favor
of the plaintiffs and against the defendant, awarding them damages in specified
amounts, as well as attorney's </span>fees and <span style="">costs of suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant
appealed to the Court of Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals affirmed <i><span style="">en <span class="SpellE">toto</span></span></i><span style=""> </span>the decision of the Court of First Instance, saying that “it is
not disputed that plaintiffs were only notified of the order of demolition on
the day the Sheriff appeared at the place of plaintiffs in the morning of
February 19, 1966, with about 35 laborers to carry out the demolition of
plaintiffs' house", it further appearing that they had not as yet been notified
of the dismissal of their complaint for specific performance with injunction,
Civil Case No. 63549.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alleging that both the Appellate Court and the trial court erred
in declaring that an order of demolition, issued under section 13 (now section
14) of Rule 39 of the Rules, which is not implemented within sixty (60) days
becomes a nullity, petitioner has filed the present petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is very clear from the records that this case arose out of a
judgment in favor of the peti<span style="">tioner in
an </span>unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case, which <span style="">judgment had long been final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Writ </span><span style="">of </span>execution was not satisfied because
defendants <span class="SpellE">Calma</span> spouses refused to vacate the
premises subject matter <span style="">of the action </span>and
to remove their house <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From then on, a series of delays in the execution
was occasioned by the moves of the <span class="SpellE">Calma</span> spouses to
forestall the enforcement of the judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find, on the basis of the records, that the <span class="SpellE">Calma</span> spouses could not have been unaware of the order of
demolition prior to the date when their house was actually demolished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion of <span class="SpellE">Albetz</span>
Investments, Inc. for demolition which was filed on <st1:date year="1965" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1965</st1:date> was duly opposed by the <span class="SpellE">Calma</span> spouses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1965</st1:date>, the Municipal Judge
granted the said spouses a period of thirty (30) days within which to vacate
the premises and remove their house <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
otherwise an order of demolition would issue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The order of demolition of <st1:date year="1965" day="21" month="6">June
 21, 1965</st1:date> was issued only after the <i>certiorari</i> case in the
Court of First Instance was dismissed and after the <span class="SpellE">Calma</span>
spouses failed to remove their house within the period granted to them by the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must also be noted that <span style="">even </span>after the Municipal Court issued
its order of June 21, 1965, authorizing the Sheriff to demolish and remove the
house constructed thereon by the <span class="SpellE">Calma</span> spouses, the
latter sought to forestall the implementation <span style="">of </span>said order by filing another action, this time for specific
performance on December 2, 1965, after the dismissal of their <i>certiorari</i>
<span style="">case </span><span style="">by </span>this Court, which later action was
ultimately dismissed by <span style="">the </span>Court
of <span style="">First Instance </span><span style="">on February</span><span style=""> 15, 1966.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is also important to note that, by order of the Municipal Court
in the unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case, the proceedings
therein, specifically, the execution of the judgment, were suspended only until
after the special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> was finally resolved, and
the final resolution took place when the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal of
the <span class="SpellE">Calma</span> spouses thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is apparent, therefore, that the <span class="SpellE">Calma</span>
spouses were given more than sufficient time to comply with the order of the
Municipal Court to remove voluntarily their house from the premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not even necessary to await the order
of demolition to be served upon the said spouses before carrying out the writ
of demolition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated in <span class="SpellE"><i style=""><span style="">Acibo</span></i></span><i style=""><span style=""> </span>vs. <span class="SpellE">Macadaeg</span></i>:<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
"Since the order of demolition was not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>,
there <span style="">was </span>no point in waiting
until that order could be served on the adverse party before issuing the
corresponding writ of demolition.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The nature of forcible entry or unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
proceedings is that they are summary in character, "intended to provide an
expeditious means of protecting actual possession or the right to pos<span style="">session </span><span style="">of </span>property."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As aptly explained by Chief Justice Moran in <i style=""><span style="">Co </span><span class="SpellE">Tiamco</span>
v. Diaz</i>:<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"* * * Cases of forcible entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
are summary in nature, for they involve perturbation of social order which must
be restored as promptly as possible and, accordingly, technicalities or details
of procedure which may cause unnecessary delays should carefully be
avoided."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It is for this reason that when judgment
is in favor of the plaintiff, it should be executed immediately in order to
prevent further damages to him caused by the loss of his possession.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The theory of private respondents is inconsistent with the special, summary
character and purposes of an unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">There is no question that the Municipal
Court had full authority to order the demolition of the <span class="SpellE">Calma's</span>
house by the Sheriff in order to give effect to its judgment in the unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
not enough for the Sheriff, in the enforcement of a judgment for delivery or
restitution of property, to direct the defeated party to make such delivery or
restitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the duty of the
Sheriff to oust the defeated party from the property and make the restitution
by placing the winning party in possession of said property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If to accomplish this he has to remove an
improvement constructed by the defeated <span style="">party,
</span>he cannot effect such removal without special order of the court, which <span style="">order </span>can only be issued upon motion
of the prevailing party with notice and after hearing, and upon the defeated
party's failure <span style="">to remove the improvement
</span>within the reasonable time given to him by the court.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, Section 14, Rule 39, of the Revised Rules of Court,
specifically provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 14.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Removal of
improvements on prope</i><i><span style="">rty su</span>bject
</i><i><span style="">of </span>execution</i>. ?
When the property s<span style="">ubject of </span>the
execution contains <span style="">improvements
constructed or </span>planted by <span style="">the </span>judgment
debtor or his agent, the officer shall not destroy, demolish or remove said
improvements except upon special <span style="">order </span>of
the court, issued upon petition of the judgment creditor <span style="">after due hearing </span>and after the former
has failed to remove the same within a reasonable time fixed by the
court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This provision has been taken from
section 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 39, which states that: "The Provincial
Sheriff, in executing the decision of a competent court in <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
cases, shall not destroy, demolish, <span style="">or </span>remove
the improvements constructed or planted by the defendant <span style="">or </span>his agent or servant on the
premises, unless expressly authorized by the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court may authorize the Provincial Sheriff
to do so, upon petition of the plaintiff or his attorney, after due hearing,
and upon failure of the defendant to remove the after-mentioned improvements
within a reasonable time after being so ordered by the Court."</p>

<p class="BODY">Evident from the foregoing is the statutory purpose which is to
grant to the defeated party a reasonable time to remove his improvement from
the premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, any delay in
the implementation of the order of demolition accrues to the bene<span style="">fit </span>of the <span class="SpellE">deforciant</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The grant of such <span style="">a </span>reason able period to remove the improvements is predicated u<span style="">pon </span>reasons of fairness and justice to
enable the defeated party to look for another place wherein he can transfer his
improvements and personal effects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
law does not specify the period within which the order of demolition should be
carried out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason is obvious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There may be factors and circumstances which
would justify deferment of the implementation of the order of demolition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the manner in which the demolition was carried out,
however, We affirm the finding of the trial court and the Court of Appeals that
the same was indiscriminate, without due regard to the safety of the personal
properties belonging to the <span class="SpellE">Calma</span> and <span class="SpellE">Umengan</span> spouses, resulting in their destruction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As found by the trial court and the Court of
Ap­peals:</p>

<blockquote>“* * * In the course of the demolition, which was, according to the
evidence for the plaintiffs, indiscriminate, the personal properties were just
carelessly placed between the house and the fence, and the others were left in
the house and they were damaged by falling debris.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As there was no one to take care (of them),
many of the properties were lost."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that <span class="SpellE">Albetz</span>
Investments, Inc. <span style="">had </span>the legal
right to the surrender <span style="">to </span>them
of the parcel of land leased by the <span class="SpellE">Calma</span> spouses, <span style="">which could</span> only be achieved thru the
demolition of the house standing thereon, nevertheless, such right <span style="">should </span>not have been exercised in such
a manner as <span style="">to </span>unduly prejudice
its <span style="">owners.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Urged by </span>the lawyer<span style=""> of petitioner, the Sheriff, aided with peti</span>tioner's<span style=""> la</span>borers, wantonly, maliciously <span style="">and indis</span><span style="">criminately demolished the house, destroying in the process many of the
personal properties therein which belonged to the spouses <span class="SpellE">Calma</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Umengan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The extent of the damage has been determined by the trial court and
affirmed by the Court of Appeals, upon a finding that the same was not
contested by petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the provisions of the Civil Code on Human Relations
(Chapter 2) are applicable, specifically Article 19 which provides, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 19.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every person
must, in the exercise of his rights and in the performance of his duties, act
with justice, give everyone his due, and observe honesty and good faith."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Certainly, the demolition complained of in the case at bar was
not carried out in a manner consistent with justice and good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the instance of petitioner, it was done in
a swift, unconscionable manner, giving the occupants of the house no time at
all to remove their belongings <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No damage worth mentioning would have been
sustained by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Albetz</span> Investments, Inc. if
their men, led by the Sheriff, had been instructed to allow said occupants to
remove their personal properties, considering that this would not have taken a
considerable length of time.</p>
