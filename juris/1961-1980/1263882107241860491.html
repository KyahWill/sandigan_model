				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> to review the decision
of the Workmen's Compensation Commission in R04-WC Case No. 19748.</p>

<p class="BODY">Francisco <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span> was employed in La <span class="SpellE">Elegancia</span> Jewelry as a <span class="SpellE"><u>platero</u></span>
from 1961 to <st1:date year="1971" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1971</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During his employment he was treated for a
lung ailment, which <span class="GramE">however</span> did not prevent him from
continuing with his regular work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1971" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1971</st1:date>, he had his chest
X-Ray at the Philippine Tuberculosis Society, Inc., whose findings is:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Minimal infiltration, predominantly <span class="SpellE">fibrotic</span>, more on the <span style="">left."</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1971</st1:date>,
he signed a "voluntary resignation paper" which was duly accepted by
his employer effective on said date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1972" day="26" month="9">September 26, 1972</st1:date>, he filed a notice
of injury or sickness and claim for compensation before the regional office of
the Department of Labor, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Regional Office No. 4 found that the illness of the claimant
was directly caused or aggravated <span style="">by </span>the
nature of his work with the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But it denied the claim for compensation because "his claim for
disability for labor was filed during the period after the cessation of their
employer-employee relation."</p>

<p class="BODY">In affirming the decision of the Regional Office, the Workmen's
Compensation Commission stated that "this Commission cannot agree that
claimant's act of resig­nation was brought about by his illness, for his chest
x-ray which was that taken on September 9, 1971 or only about three (3) months
before resignation in December, 1971, showed that his PTB was already
predominantly <span class="SpellE">fibrotic</span>, indicating, more or less, the
presence of a healed PTB lesion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Such a finding likewise (belies) claimant's allegation of blood vomiting
sometime in that month of September, 1971.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an established fact in this case that
claimant had never been on sick leave on account of his above-named sickness
during his employment with the respondent." The Commission further stated
that claimant's resignation was voluntary in nature; consequently, even
granting that he was really sick of P.T.B., he can no longer claim for
disability benefit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision must be reversed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The findings of the Acting Referee of Regional Office No. <span style="">4 of the </span>Department of <span style="">Labor </span>that the illness of the claimant
was directly caused or aggravated by the nature of his work with respondent
undoubtedly makes the claim compensable under the Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that Section 2 of the Workmen's
Compensation Act requires as ground <span style="">for
</span>compensation, among others, is that the "employee x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> contracts tuberculosis or
other illness directly caused by such employment; or either aggravated by or
the result of the nature of such employment" (<span class="SpellE">Tecla</span>
<span class="SpellE">Magpantay</span>, etc., et al. vs. WCC, et al., L-43457,
Oct. 26, 1976).</p>

<p class="BODY">That the claim was filed after claimant was separated from the
service is not a fatal defect which will deprive the Workmen's Compensation
Commission of its jurisdiction to entertain the claim legally due to the
claimant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The compensation under the
Workmen's Compensation Act as amended is a liability vested by statute which
prescribes in 10 years pursuant to Article 1144 (2) of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule is especially true when there is no
showing that the employer sustained damage as a result of the delayed filing of
the claim (Domingo <span class="SpellE">Vallo</span> vs. WCC, et al., L-41816,
October 19, 1976).</p>

<p class="BODY">WE agree with the claimant that he was asked to resign because he
was already too weak to work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, were
it not for that reason, complainant would not have resigned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After claimant had resigned from the service,
he never engaged in any other employment, evidencing that he can no longer be
gainfully employed.</p>

COMPENSATION COMMISSION IS HEREBY REVERSED AND SET ASIDE AND RESPONDENT LA
