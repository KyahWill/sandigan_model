				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This appeal is by the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philip­pines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to seek reversal of the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> (in Nat. Case No.
53), involving the issue of when an applicant for naturalization may claim
exemption from filing a declaration of intention.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Gan</span> Y. Guan, also known as <span class="SpellE">Yguan</span> <span class="SpellE">Gan</span> or <span class="SpellE">Yguan</span>
G. <span class="SpellE">Gan</span>, applied for naturalization in the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>,
alleging that he is a Chinese citizen born in <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, on 5 December
1936; that he has always resided in <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span>,
except during the Japanese occupation when he stayed in Manila; that he is one
of the three members of the partnership operating a grocery store in <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span>, of which he is also the assistant manager and
purchasing agent, and from which occupation he derives an annual gross income
of P5,000.00 more or less; that he is single and has no issue, speaks and
writes English and the Philippine national language; that he owns real and
personal properties which, including his personal savings in the bank and
investments in business, have a total value of not less than P25,000.00; that
he has received the degree of Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering from
the <span class="SpellE">Mapua</span> Institute of Technology, and has attended
other government-recognized schools, like the Philippine Statesman College in <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span> City, where Philippine history and government
are taught as part of the curriculum; that he believes in the principles
underlying the Constitution; he is not opposed to organized government, does not
believe in polygamy, is not suffering from any incurable or contagious disease,
and has never been convicted of any crime involving moral turpitude.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not file a declaration of intention,
claiming exemption from this legal requirement because of his being born in the
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was duly accompanied by the
joint affidavit of 2 witnesses who will testify on his good moral character.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, the court rendered judgment on <st1:date year="1966" day="27" month="1">27 January <span style="">1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>granting the petition upon the
finding that petitioner possesses all the qualifications and none of the
disqualifications for Philippine citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Solicitor General, representing the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
thus interposed this appeal on the sole issue of jurisdictional defect in the
petition, for failure of petitioner to file a declaration of intention.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the appeal meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the Revised Naturalization Act, an applicant or petitioner can
claim exemption from filing a declaration of intention if he were born in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and had received primary and secondary education in public schools or private
educational institutions duly recognized by the government and not limited to
any race or nationality.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> himself declared in
court that he received his primary instructions at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Nueva</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ecija</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Chinese</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>School</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:place></st1:city>;<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
finished the elementary grades at the Philippine Chinese High School; completed
secondary education at the Philippine Statesman College in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:place></st1:city>, and received the
degree of Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering from the <span class="SpellE">Mapua</span> Institute of Technology.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Other than his bare unsupported assertion to the effect that the schools where
he finished the primary and elementary grades were attended also by Filipinos,
which declaration is inadequate to constitute evidentiary proof of compliance
with the requirement of the law,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
there is nothing in the records to <span style="">establish
that the <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>
Chinese School and the Philippine Chinese High School are actually institutions
of learning not limited to any race or nationality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact is that the very names of these
schools convey the idea that they are exclusive to Chinese students,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and there is no evidence that they were not
so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's attendance in those
schools, therefore, would not have served to exempt him from the provision of
the Naturaliza­tion Act, which is to give special consideration to applicants
for naturalization who, by their association with Filipinos in their youth,
could have assimilated and imbibed the cherished traditions and customs of this
country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A declaration of intention
being ne­cessary in the case, <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> failure to
file the same warrants a denial of the petition.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is another reason that goes against the granting of the petition:
incomplete publication of petitioner's <span style="">places
</span>of residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated in the
petition itself and reaffirmed by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and one of
his character witnesses on the witness stand, the former and his family left <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span> and lived in Manila during the Japanese occupation,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
which lasted three years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, the
petition as published did not contain the address of such <st1:place>Manila</st1:place>
residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court has repeatedly
declared, the omission of a former place of residence, even if petitioner was
still a minor when he stayed thereat, constitutes an infirmity fatal to the
petition.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>FOR THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS</b>, the de­cision appealed
from is hereby reversed and set aside, and the petition for naturalization is
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
