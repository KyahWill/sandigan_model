				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Felixberto</span> Gomez, Court
Interpreter, Court of Agrarian Relations, Fifth Regional District, Branch I, <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, has been
charged by Clerk of Court Rolando <span class="SpellE">Liwanag</span> of the same
court with having illegally claimed and collected traveling expenses and <i>per
</i><i><span style="">diems</span></i><span style=""> </span>in the amount of P265.00 for the
period from February 23 to <st1:date year="1976" day="31" month="3">March 31,
 1976</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on November 27, 1975, in CAR Case No. 1453-P'72
entitled "<span class="SpellE">Magno</span> <span class="SpellE">Sunga</span>,
et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Santos", respondent was
designated by the Agrarian Court as its representative and implementing officer
to supervise the cutting and hauling of the sugar cane crop (for the year 1975)
of the plaintiffs in their respective landholdings, including the milling of
said crop and the distribution of plaintiffs' shares in the net proceeds
thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1976</st1:date>,
the afore-mentioned case was dismissed by the court after the parties had
reached an amicable settlement in open court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The dismissal of the case notwithstanding, respondent continued to
discharge his duties as implementing officer of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1976" day="25" month="2">February
 25, 1976</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1976" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1976</st1:date>,
respondent went to the landholding in question, and in those occasions the
tenants were able to receive their shares from the proceeds of the sugar cane
harvested thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the period from
February 23 to <st1:date year="1976" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1976</st1:date>,
he collected traveling expenses and <i>per diems</i> in the amount of
P265.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent's aforesaid claim
was submitted to and passed upon by complainant Clerk of Court and the District
Judge, who recommended the approval of the voucher for payment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Acting Executive Judge of the Court of Agrarian Relations, to
whom this case was referred for investigation, report and recommendation, found
respondent to have filed his aforesaid claim for traveling expenses and <i><span style="">per diems</span></i><span style=""> </span>in good <span style="">faith</span> as
he was apparently not aware that the settlement of CAR Case No. 1453-P'72 on
January 22, 1976 terminated his authority.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to the Inquest Judge, respondent believed that he was entitled
to his claim as did the Clerk of Court and the Judge, who, despite the
termination of the case, recommended approval of respondent's claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of said <span style="">find</span>ing, the Inquest Judge recommended the exoneration of the
respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span>have carefully
examined the record and <span class="GramE">We</span> find the report and
recommendation of the Acting Executive Judge of the Court of Agrarian Relations
to be in order and amply warranted by the circumstances on record.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant administrative case is DISMISSED
and the respondent exonerated from the charge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, respondent is hereby directed to refund the amount of P265.00
which was paid to him by mistake, within ten (10) days fro<span style="">m</span> receipt of copy of this resolution.</p>
