				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance
of Cebu dated 4 December 1957, dismissing the petition for mandamus
filed by herein appellants. 
<p>The facts are stipulated. The individual respondents mentioned by
names in the caption were officials of the city government of Cebu who
assumed their respective positions on January 1, 1956. Sergio Osmeña
Jr. was the City Mayor, Ramon Duterte was the Vice-Mayor and the rest,
City Councilors. Sinforiano V. Urgelio (one of petitioners below but
apparently not appellant here) was a laborer in the office of the City
Mayor since June 1946 with compensation at the rate of P4.70 daily.
Appellants Jose V. Encabo and Jorge Villarin were also employed in the
same office as office helper and laborer, with compensation at the
rates of P4.80 and P4.50 daily, respectively. Encabo had been there
since May 1948; Villarin since April 1954. All three were performing
clerical duties and were members of the Government Service Insurance
System, showing the permanent character of their tenures. </p>
<p>On 5 January 1956 the Municipal  Board of the  City
          
of Cebu passed a resolution creating thirty five  (35) new
          
positions in  the office of the City Mayor, several of which
          
were for laborers, janitors and informers.  A little  over
          
a month later, or  on 10  February 1956, the Municipal
          
Board passed Ordinance No. 192, abolishing a number of
          
positions in the  same office, among them those held  by
          
petitioners.  On 23  February 1956 the Mayor sent them
          
written notices of the termination of their services, effective at the close of business hours on the following
          
March 15, in view of the abolition of their  positions under
          
Ordinance No.  192.   They protested  such termination in
          
letters to the Commissioner of the Civil Service and the
          
Executive Secretary, dated 6 August and 10 October 1956,
          
respectively.  No replies  were received by them;  and so
          
on 5 December 1956 they commenced the instant proceeding in the Court of  First Instance of  Cebu,  praying that
          
the abolition of their positions be declared void and without
          
force and  effect; that they be  reinstated; that they  be
          
paid their salaries from the date of their separation; and
          
that respondents be ordered to pay moral and exemplary
          
damages as well  as  attorney's fees.  By amended  petition
          
dated  27 June  1957,  the  City  of Cebu was included as
          
party-respondent.</p>
<p> The main ground alleged  in  the  petition  and  urged
            
by appellants in this appeal is that the abolition of their
            
positions was done  in bad faith and  in violation of the
            
law and Constitution.  There is no question that the municipal board  of the city of  Cebu had the power to legislate
            
in regard to fixing the number and  salaries  of  officials
            
and employees not provided for in the City Charter (Sec. 17, Commonwealth Act No. 58).  Appellants' positions not
              
 being among those  enumerated in the  charter, they were
              
 subject to the power thus granted. The exercise of  such
    
 power,  however, has a recognized  exception, namely, that
    
 the  abolition  of an office  or  position must  be  in good
    
faith and not characterized by fraud and improper motives.
    
 It cannot be resorted to  as a  means  to  remove the incumbents in violation of the civil  service law.<sup><font color="#ff0000">[1]</font></sup></p>
<p>The present case falls within the exception. </p>
<p>Ordinance No. 192 was ostensibly enacted for reasons of economy and
efficiency. But economy may be ruled out, because not only had 35 new
positions been created a little over a month prior to the enactment of
the said ordinance, but after appellants' positions were abolished
sixteen additional ones were again created and increases in salaries of
employees in the Mayor's office were provided for. If the intention
were not really to ease out petitioners from their positions they could
have been accommodated in the new items thus created. It can not be
said that their services were no longer needed, because as it appears
in the stipulation of facts submitted to the court <i>a quo,</i> the same duties they had been performing prior to their separation continued to be performed by other employees. </p>
<p>The same Ordinance No.  192 has  been the subject of
        
another  case similar to  the one at bar  and decided  by
        
this Court on  24  September 1958  (Concepcion Briones
        
et al. <i>vs.</i> Sergio Osmeña, Jr.,  et al., 104  Phil.,  588).   In
        
that  decision  we  found that "the   reasons  given  for
        
the abolition of the positions of the appellees (alleged to
        
be  economy and efficiency)  are untrue and constitute a
        
mere subterfuge for  the removal without cause  of  the
        
said appellees, in violation of the security of Civil Service
        
tenure as provided  by the Constitution."</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the judgment appealed from
            
is  reversed  and the  writ  prayed for is granted.  The
            
abolition of appellants' positions is declared null and void
            
and respondent City of Cebu is ordered to reinstate them
            
therein or to equivalent positions; to pay  them their back
            
wages or salaries since  the  date of their separation,  less
            
whatever  they  have  earned from other employment in
            
the interim, to be determined  upon proper hearing before
            
the court <i>a quo</i>.  Respondents are also  ordered to  pay
            
appellants the  sum of P1,000.00 as attorney's  fees, plus
            
costs.</p>

<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[1]</sup></font> The statues relating to
civil service have for their primary purpose economy and efficiency in
the public service. The secondary purpose is permanent tenure in office
for those employed in such service. The power to create a position in
the classified civil service includes the power to abolish such
position. Therefore any position in the classified civil service may be
abolished by the employing officer if such act is done in good faith
solely for purposes of economy and more efficient public service. In
State ex rel. Stine <i>vs.</i> McCaw, Chief of Divs. of Aid for Aged,
137 Ohio St., 13, 27 N.E. 2d 488, 489, Matthias, J., states the law as
follows: "An order abolishing a civil service position is ineffective
where a new appointee is named to perform the same duties; but where
there is a substantial merger of two positions for the purpose of
economy with no proof of ulterior motive or purpose on the part of the
employing officer, or discrimination upon political, religious or other
improper grounds, a writ of mandamus will not be granted to require
reinstatement of employee discharged as a result of such merger." State
ex. rel. Stoer <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Raschig, 49 N.E. 2d 56.
<p>In the last analysis the power of the Legislature to truncate the
incumbency of one who has been appointed for a fixed term will be found
to depend on the purpose for which it was done. On no other basis can
the various concepts of legislative power under constitutional
provisions such as ours be reconciled or fitted together with the power
given the executive. We shall endeavor to illustrate this thesis by
what follows:</p><p style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></p>
<p>If it abolishes one office and puts in its place another by the same
or a different name but with substantially the same duties, it will be
considered a device to unseat the incumbents. If on the other hand it
abolishes two or more offices with substantially the same duties or
different duties and bona fide combines the duties under an office with
the same name as one of the abolished offices or under a different name
or abolishes an office and distributes its duties among other offices
for reasons of economy or genuine reorganization, the abolition is
permissible.</p><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</div><p>If the newly created office has substantially new, different or
additional functions, duties, or powers, so that it may be said in fact
to create an office different from the one abolished, even though it
embraces all or some of the duties of the old office it will be
considered as an abolition of one office and the creation of a new or
different one. The same is true if one office is abolished and its
duties, for reasons of economy are given to an existing officer or
office.</p><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</div><p>But if the functions, duties, and powers are substantially those of
the office abolished, the abolition will be considered merely colorable
and the pretented new office be considered in actuality a continuation
of the old one. Consequently, where one office is purported to be
abolished and a new office purported to be set up the courts will
examine the entire transaction for purpose or motive. See Cusack vs. Board of Education, supra; State ex rel. Birdsey <i>vs.</i> Baldwin, supra; McChesney <i>vs.</i>
Trenton, supra. If the functions, duties or powers are substantially
the same it will be a strong indication that the purpose was to abolish
the officer and not the office, but where offices are abolished and new
ones set up in a general scheme of reorganization, abolition, merger,
rearrangement or consolidation genuinely based on reasons of economy or
efficiency, the court, if convinced that the purpose was that, will not
interfere even though officers in the affected reorganization evolve
with some offices whose function, duties, or powers are substantially
like those which were abolished. It is essentially a matter of good
faith. State ex rel. Hammond <i>vs.</i> Maxfield 132 P. 2d 660.</p>
<p>A municipal office is not property in the constitutional sense, and
the Legislature may abolish an office during the term for which the
incumbent was elected or appointed without violating any of his
constitutional rights. So also an office created by municipal ordinance
may be abolished by ordinance, and the incumbent ceases to be an
officer. Even when an officer by reason of having been appointed for a
definite term, or by special statutory provision, cannot be lawfully
removed except for cause after a full hearing, his office may be
summarily abolished whenever the proper municipal authorities deem it
advisable. In such case, however, the office must be abolished in good
faith, and if immediately after the office is abolished another office
is created with substantially the same duties and a different individual
is appointed, or if it otherwise appears that the office was abolished
for personal or political reasons, the courts will interfere. 19 R.C.
L. 936.</p>

<p align="center"><b>RESOLUTION</b></p>
<p align="right"> Feb. 28,  1964</p>
<p><b>MAKALINTAL, J.:</b></p>
<p> Respondents move for reconsideration of the Court's decision of
October 31, 1963 ordering respondent City of Cebu to reinstate
petitioners to their positions and to pay them back salaries since the
date of their separation, less whatever they have earned from other
employment in the interim, to be determined upon proper hearing before
the court of origin. </p>
<p>Respondents claim that petitioners should not be reinstated to their
former positions, first because they are not civil service eligibles;
and, second, because they are deemed to have acquiesced to the
termination of their services.</p>
<p>As has been stated in the decision, petitioners, though not civil
service eligibles, were members of the Government Service Insurance
System, which fact shows the permanent character of their tenure. It
does not appear that their appointments were temporary; indeed, their
separation was not based on that ground but on the abolition of their
positions, carried out in bad faith and solely for the purpose of
removing them.</p>
<p>Contrary to respondents' theory, the fact that petitioners received
their terminal pay cannot be considered as a waiver of their right to
question the termination of their services. The case of Magana <i>vs</i>.
Agregado, 107 Phil., 900, (58 Off. Gaz., No. 4, p. 654), relied upon by
movants, is not here applicable. The ruling in said case, adopting that
laid down in Lopez <i>vs</i>. Namarco, 101 Phil., 347, is that the
dismissed employee was estopped to question the validity of the
resolution abolishing his position because he had previously accepted
the gratuity provided for in the same resolution. But no such estopped
obtains in this case, as there was no gratuity provided for in the
resolution which petitioners here received or could have received. </p>
<p>Respondents also question petitioner's right to back salaries on the
strength of Section 5 of the Charter of the City of Cebu, C.A. No. 58,
as amended. The said provision does not apply in this case, because the
obligation of the City of Cebu to pay petitioners' back salaries is not
a liability "for damages or injuries to person or property arising from
the failure of the Mayor, the Vice Mayor, the Municipal Board, or any
other city officer, to enforce the provisions of the Charter, or any
other law or ordinance, or from negligence of said Mayor, Municipal
Board, or other officers while enforcing or attempting to enforce said
provisions."</p>
<p>The case of Faunillan<span style="font-style: italic;"> vs.</span> Del Rosario, G.R. No. L-9447 August 23,
1956, is cited by petitioners. But in a number of other cases,
involving also employees of the City of Cebu, this Court has invariably
granted back salaries to illegally dismissed employees. In three cases
prior to the Faunillan case ( Mission <i>vs.</i> Del Rosario (94 Phil., 483), 50 Off. Gaz., No. 4, p. 1571; Abella <i>vs.</i> Rodriguez (95 Phil., 289), Off. Gaz., No. 7, p. 3039; Uy <i>vs.</i>
Rodriguez (95 Phil., 493), 50 Off. Gaz., No. 8, p. 3574], the City of
Cebu was ordered to pay arrears in salary to detectives of the city
police department who had been illegally separated from the service.
And in two instances subsequent to that of Faunillan (Gacho <i>vs.</i> Osmena, 103 Phil., 837; and Briones <i>vs.</i>
Reyes, 104 Phil., 588), the same city was required to reinstate, with
back salaries, employees whose positions had been wrongfully abolished.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the motion for reconsideration is hereby denied.</p>
