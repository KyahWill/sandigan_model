				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Pedro <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span>, his son, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nazarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> were accused of murder alleged to have been
committed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about November 4, 1970, in the afternoon, in
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Bangilan</span>, Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Kabacan</span>,
Province of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, Philippines and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with a
gun, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping and aiding one another,
with treachery and evident premeditation, and with deliberate intent to take
the life of <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>,
<span class="SpellE">suddently</span>, unexpectedly and treacherously, attack,
assault and shoot the latter with said gun, hitting him in the left abdomen,
thereby inflicting upon said <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> mortal wound which immediately cause his
death."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>,
Branch III, found them guilty and sentenced them thus:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, and in view of all the foregoing, the Court hereby
finds, each of the accused, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span>, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nazarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, guilty beyond reasonable doubt as co-principals in
the crime of murder, and in accordance with Article 248 of the Revised Penal
Code, in relation to paragraph 1 of Article 64 of the same Penal Code, there
being neither mitigating nor aggravating cir­cumstance, the Court hereby
sentences each of the accused to each suffer the penalty of reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span> or life imprisonment, with all the accessory
penalties provided by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are
further sentenced to jointly and severally indemnify the heirs of the victim, <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>, in the sum of
P12,000.00 Philippine Currency in concept of moral and exemplary damages,
without any subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency; and to pay the cost
proportionately; that is, each of them should pay one-third (1/3) of the
costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">All three have appealed their conviction but in a resolution of <st1:date year="1978" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1978</st1:date>, we allowed the
withdrawal of the appeal of <span class="SpellE">Nazarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, upon his own motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus this decision concerns Pedro and Romeo <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span> only.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the afternoon of <st1:date year="1970" day="4" month="11">November
 4, 1970</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>,
the deceased, accompanied by his eight-year old son <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>,
Jr. took part in a "<span class="SpellE">pintakasi</span>" at the farm
of Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Regoyal</span> in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Bangilan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Kabacan</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cotabato</span></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A "<span class="SpellE">pintakasi</span>"
is a customary farm undertaking whereby the barrio farm hands collectively plow
the farm of another in consideration for an agreed share in the harvest.</p>

<p class="BODY">The farmers were plowing a clearing, bounded on the west and
south by cornstalks as tall as men of ordinary height.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the southern edge of the clearing, but
before the cornfield were tall cogon grasses or <span class="SpellE"><u>talahib</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A depression filled with water was situated
at the western side of the clearing, about twenty meters from the cornfield to
the south.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o'clock</st1:time>, <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> took his <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> to the depression and started to bathe it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Beside him was Martin <span class="SpellE">Goleng</span>,
barely three meters away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Somewhere
behind <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> were <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Narvas</span> who was about
forty meters away and <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>,
some thirty meters away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>, Jr. was busy cutting grasses inside the cornfield
at the western side of the clearing, upon instruction of his father.</p>

<p class="BODY">Suddenly, successive gunshots shattered the quiet of the
countryside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> was fired upon from the direction of the
cornfield in the south.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A bullet found
its mark on his left abdomen and the penetrating wound caused his almost
instantaneous death.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The police officers of <span class="SpellE">Kabacan</span>,
who went to the scene in the evening, recovered three empty cartridge shells,
said to have been fired from a .30 caliber <span class="SpellE">Garand</span>
rifle.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Based on their
investigation, the police arrested <span class="SpellE">Nazarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> and Romeo <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span>, the
following morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A charge for murder
was filed against them and a certain "John Doe" in the Municipal
Court of <span class="SpellE">Kabacan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The murder charge was later amended upon the arrest of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span> on <st1:date year="1970" day="15" month="11">November
 15, 1970</st1:date>, including him as defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All three accused waived their right to the
second stage of the preliminary investigation so the case was elevated to the
Court of First Instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the trial, Martin <span class="SpellE">Goleng</span> who at the
time of the shooting was nearest to the victim, testified that he heard three
gunshots but he was not able to ascertain the direction from where they fired,
because he dropped to the ground upon hearing the first shot, and ran for his
safety after the last shot.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>,
Jr. the eight-year old star witness of the prosecution testified in a different
tone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was his incriminating testimony
corroborated by those of <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Narvas</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>, younger
brother of the deceased, which resulted in the conviction by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>, Jr. testified that he went
with his father to the "<span class="SpellE">pintakasi</span>" that
fateful afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was cutting
grasses in the cornfield, west of the clearing, when he heard six gun­shots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared that "<span class="SpellE">Manong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Itong</span>" referring to <span class="SpellE">Nazarito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> and "<span class="SpellE">Manong</span>
Pat-<span class="SpellE">ti</span>" referring to Romeo <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span>
and a third person whom he did not recognize shot his father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that a long gun was used in the
shooting.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records include a sworn statement taken by Chief of Police
Arellano <span class="SpellE">Banaynal</span> on <st1:date year="1970" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1970</st1:date>, which purportedly signed by <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>, Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It stated in subs­tance that while <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>, Jr. was gathering grasses inside the cornfield, he
saw three persons aiming a gun at his father.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"<span class="SpellE">Itong</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>"
aimed and fired a gun at his father, once, and then fired at Boy <span class="SpellE">Gadia</span> and companions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"<span class="SpellE">Itong</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>"
was accompanied by "Pat-<span class="SpellE">ti</span> <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span>"
and third person whom he did not recognize.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Narvas</span>
who was about forty meters away from the deceased testified in the light of his
sworn statement of <st1:date year="1970" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that when he heard four gunshots, he
hid behind his <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was then facing the southern cornfield and
he ascertained that the gunshots were fired from that direction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the firing, he heard somebody shout
that three men were running away from the southern cornfield.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon he climbed a tree and saw the said
three men.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He recognized the two of them
as <span class="SpellE">Nazarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> and
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span>, from a distance of some eighty meters
but he did not recognize the third person.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He also saw a gun, as the three ran away.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>
who was about thirty meters away from the deceased who was his older brother,
testified that he did not see the person or persons who shot his brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he saw three persons in the direction
from where the shots were fired as they ran outside the adjacent cornfield to
the south.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span>
<span class="SpellE">Narvas</span>, he recognized only two of them, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nazarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span>, but
not the third one who turned out to be Romeo <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He executed a sworn statement on <st1:date year="1970" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1970</st1:date>, substantially
reciting the foregoing.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Narvas</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> further
testified that they had known the three accused for a long time because they
were from the same barrio.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found vendetta as the motive for the killing, on <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Narvas</span>' testimony that
there had been a misunderstanding between the deceased <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> on one hand, and the <span class="SpellE">Casiminas</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The misunderstanding, it is said, arose in
connection with two separate criminal cases involving a son of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span>, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span> and
a certain Federico <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first case, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span> and Federico <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> were
charged and convicted for theft of large cattle (<span class="SpellE">carabao</span>)
on a complaint brought by the deceased <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> and Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second case was for the murder of Ricardo
<span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>, for which Francisco <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span>
and Federico <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> were also convicted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> in the
theft case belonged to the deceased <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the murder
case, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>, the victim, was a brother of <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">This review hinges on the credibility of the prosecution's
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants impugn the
trial court's reliance on' the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>, Jr., particularly, on grounds of <span class="SpellE">incompetency</span> and unreliability; and, in giving credence to
the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Narvas</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> on ground
of improbability of their account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
likewise assail the trial court's appreciation of motive against the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They maintain that the defense
witnesses are more credible.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the appellants' exception to the competency and
reliability of <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>, Jr., well taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the Rules of Court, the competency of a
child-witness to testify depends not only on age but also on intelligence, the
capacity to receive correct impression of facts respecting which he is
examined, or of relating them truly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>[Rules of Court, Rule 130, Sec. 19 (c)].</p>

<p class="BODY">The determination of whether a child-witness has the re­quired
degree of <span class="GramE">intelligence,</span> rests primarily with the trial
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial judge may resort to any
examination which will tend to disclose the child-witness' capacity and
intelligence as well as his understanding of the obligation of an oath under
which he tes­tifies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As many of these
matters cannot be photographed in the record, the decision of the trial judge
will not be disturbed on review, unless from that which is preserved it is
clear that such decision was erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Buncad</span>, 25 Phil. 530).</p>

<p class="BODY">However, a close and careful examination of the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>, Jr., does not show that at the time he testified,
he could be deemed a child of average intelligence, i.e., capable of giving
responsive answers to the peripheral questions or capable of recollecting
occurrences and relating such recollections.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He could not tell in what municipality, the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Bangilan</span> is, nor the name of his province.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that he was in Grade II, but he did
not know the name of his teacher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
turned out that he was out of school, as he later testified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could not tell when his father was
shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said his father was still alive
on Christmas (of 1970), when in fact, his father was shot the <span class="SpellE">preceeding</span> November.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He did not know what All Saints Day is, <span class="GramE">nor</span> the
names of the months of the year.</p>

<p class="BODY">When cross-examined in connection with his sworn state­ment which
apparently formed the basis of his testimony, he denied having signed the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sworn statement was in the
usual typewritten question-and-answer form bearing his alleged signature and
dated <st1:date year="1970" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could not recall whether he was asked to
sign the statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to him, he
was taken by Police Chief Arellano <span class="SpellE">Banaynal</span> to the
latter's office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the police chief
did not talk to him at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He only saw <span class="SpellE">Banaynal</span> writing in longhand on a piece of paper, for about
an hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He slept at the house of the
police chief that evening and several more times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could not say how many more times, but he
said the police chief told him a lot of things during those times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When asked what the police chief had told
him, he answered, he could not remember.</p>

<p class="BODY">If there was anything elicited from the young <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>
and which he gave out in an apparently straightforward manner, it was his
testimony that they (referring to <span class="SpellE">Nazarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> and Romeo <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span> and
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span> whom he did not recognize at the time)
shot his father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the truthfulness of
this testimony had been placed in serious doubt in the cross examination so
ably propounded by the appellants' counsel, thus:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">But, still the prosecution failed to
explain how <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>, Jr. was able to see and
recognize the assailants under the cir­cumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was cutting grasses inside the cornfield
at the western side of the clearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
assailants were inside the cornfield at the southern side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, between them were clusters of
fruit-bearing cornstalks with wide leaves as could be expected in fully grown

<p class="BODY">Significantly, it is noted that while the sworn statement stated
that <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> Jr. was ten years old, he however said
during the trial that he was eight years old.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> purportedly stated therein,
that when presented to him he could recognize and identify the third person
whom he saw with <span class="SpellE">Nazarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
and Romeo <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But, he failed to identify Pedro <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span> when
the latter was presented to him in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently, the prosecution tried to make up for the failure of
young <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> to identify Pedro <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span>,
by presenting the other witnesses <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Narvas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>, who both testified that they recognized <span class="SpellE">Nazarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Narvas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> claimed that they
recognized Pedro <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nazarito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> at a distance of some eighty meters while the
latter were running away from the southern cornfield, with only their backs
visible to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under normal visibility
conditions, recognition at a distance of eighty or even one hundred meters is
probable, if the person whose back is towards the observer is sufficiently
familiar to the observer and where the latter's line of sight towards such
person is unobstructed.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is not however the case, it appearing that these witnesses
were on the clearing and the alleged assailants were running on the place
beyond the clusters of fully grown corn­stalks to the south of the
clearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The maze of tall and leafy
cornstalks must have impeded or obstructed the view of these witnesses
positioned on the clearing, so as to prevent them from seeing, much more from
recognizing the persons running beyond the cornstalks.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Narvas</span>
had to say during the trial that he had to climb a tree in order to see those
persons running beyond the southern cornfield.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He testified that he did so, when he heard one of the farmers on the
clearing shout that the assailants were running outside the cornfield.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It, of course, taxes credulity how one of
those farmers came to know that the culprits were running outside the cornfield
when such farmer was himself on the same plane with the others on the clearing,
at the other side of the cornfield.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Suprisingly</span>, the prosecution did not present that farmer
who shouted that the culprits were running outside the cornfield.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By itself, <span class="SpellE">Narvas</span>'
act of climbing a tree after the last gun report, purposely to observe the
fleeing assailants runs counter to usual human conduct and normal reaction in
times of danger and stress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A person who
is near another who has been shot will ordinarily scamper to safety and will
not expose himself to the assailants.</p>

<p class="BODY">On his part, <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>
testified on the unusual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be
noted that he categorically stated that he did not see the person or persons
who shot his brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet he claimed
that the accused were running outside the southern cornfield.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> betrayed
himself on cross-examination when he stated that while he saw them running, he
did not however see their entire backs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But, still he was able to recognize them, because, according to him, he
already knew their appearances.</p>

<p class="BODY">If, indeed, these witnesses had recognized and identified the assailants,
they would have reported the shooting and revealed the identity of the
culprits, to the police authorities, at the earliest possible opportunity, as
could ordinarily be expected of witnesses to a fatal shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, not one of them did so.</p>

<p class="BODY">The shooting was reported to the police by a certain <span class="SpellE">Sulpicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Umiten</span>, a public school
teacher in <span class="SpellE">Kabacan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the police authorities arrived at the scene, <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> claimed that they were among those
questioned by the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet none of
them singled out and named the accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They attempted to explain their inability to disclose the identity of
assailants, by claiming that they were afraid because it was already getting
dark, which explanation is too crude to be con­vincing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> added a lame
excuse, that questions asked of him did not extend to the identity of the
culprits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> testified that two days after the shooting
they were investigated, and that they separately executed sworn statements
wherein they named the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
surprisingly, their alleged sworn statements are both dated November. <span class="GramE">16, 1970, or twelve days after the shooting.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In fact Romeo <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nazarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> were arrested in
the morning of November 5, without any warrant of arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same is true with Pedro <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span>, who was arrested on November 15.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, they were arrested on mere
suspicion gathered by the police from the onlookers who could not name the
assailants and who merely theorized that because of a previous grudge between
the accused and the deceased, the former must have been the assailants.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the main, all that the prosecution had proved was the fact of
death of <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>,
but it failed to prove by outright, convincing and conclusive evidence that such
death was caused by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
evidence for the prosecution does not even show that attempts were made to
recover the <span class="SpellE">Garand</span> rifle allegedly used in the
shooting, or that any of the accused was in possession of a rifle at the time
of the shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not even appear
that formal and thorough investigation was made of the accused, more
particularly of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span> who appears to have
been hastily included in the murder charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The imputation of motive on the part of the accused has not made
the case any stronger for the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court's conclusion thereon is not warranted by its
findings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the theft case, the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> stolen, belonged to the <span class="SpellE">Pascuas</span>,
and in the murder case, the victim was a brother of <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>, the victim in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should there be an ax to grind, as between
the <span class="SpellE">Pascuas</span> and the <span class="GramE">accused,</span>
the same would reasonably be found on the part of the <span class="SpellE">Pascuas</span>,
considering that in both cases they were the aggrieved parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming <span class="SpellE">arguendo</span> that the accused had
a very strong motive to eliminate <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>, such motive cannot take the place of proof beyond
reasonable doubt, sufficient to over­throw the presumption of innocence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Proof beyond reasonable doubt is the mainstay of our accusatorial
system of criminal justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
reiterated in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Basuel</span>, No. L-2815, <st1:date year="1972" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1972</st1:date>, 42 SCRA 207, only
by proof beyond reasonable doubt which requires moral certainty a
"certainty that convinces and satisfies the reason and conscience of those
who are to act upon it" may the presumption of innocence be overcome.</p>

<p class="BODY">By reasonable doubt is meant "doubt engendered by an
investigation of the whole proof and an inability after such investigation to
let the mind rest easy upon the cer­tainty of guilt." <span class="GramE">(People
vs. <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span>, No.</span> L-17214, <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="6">June 12, 1965</st1:date>, 14 SCRA 297)</p>

<p class="BODY">Our minds cannot rest easy upon the certainty of guilt of the
accused in the light of the evidence for the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused offered the defense of alibi which by reason of the
proximity of the place where they were supposed to be to the place where the
shooting occurred is indeed a weak defense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the weakness of the defense does not relieve the prosecution of the
required burden of proof.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused need not prove their innocence, because that is presumed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In People vs. <span class="SpellE">Fraga</span>,
(109 Phil. 241, 250) this Court through Mr. Justice J. B. L. Reyes, spoke
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"An accused cannot be
convicted on the basis of evidence which independently of his alibi is weak,
uncorroborated and inconclu­sive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
rule that alibi must be satisfactorily proven was never intended to change the
burden of proof in criminal cases; otherwise we will see the absurdity of the
accused being put in a more difficult position where the prosecution's evidence
is vague and weak than where it is strong."</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we find that the guilt of Pedro and Romeo <span class="SpellE">Casimina</span> has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt and
accordingly the sentence against them is hereby reversed, with costs de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the view that the evidence is not sufficient for the
conviction of Romeo Casimina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, he
should be acquitted.</p>

<p class="BODY">I dissent as to the exoneration of Romeo's father, Pedro
Casimina, who is also the father of Francisco Casimina and is a relative of
Nazarito Aquino.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Francisco was convicted
of having stolen the carabao of the deceased Benigno Pascua and of having
murdered Ricardo Pascua, a brother of Benigno.</p>

<p class="BODY">Eyewitnesses Pacifico Narvas and Romulo Pascua identified Pedro
Casimina as one of the three assailants who shot Benigno.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pedro's complicity in the killing of Benigno
was established to a moral certainty.</p>
