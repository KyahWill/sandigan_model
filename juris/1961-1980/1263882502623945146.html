				<BR><STRONG>TEEHANKEE, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Court on the merits of the petition as strongly concurred in
by the Solicitor General on behalf of respondent People who joins petitioner in
asking for the granting of the relief sought, sets aside respondent court's
dismissal of petitioner's appeal (with its denial of a special extension of the
period for filing of his brief) and orders the reinstatement of his appeal from
the trial court's judgment of conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 6, 1975, respondent Court of Appeals granted
petitioner, accused-appellant in an <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> case
(together with his son) involving the amount of P2,517.00 representing a sum
allegedly received for the purchase of ornamental seashells, an extension of 90
days (instead of the requested 45 days) with warning of no further extension
for filing of his brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before expiration of the extended period, petitioner's counsel <span class="SpellE">Rodulfo</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Taneo</span> moved for a
second extension of 45 days because petitioner despite previous requests had
failed to deliver the neces­sary amount for the mimeographing of the brief and
because of three assistant lawyers, two had accepted employment in the
government and he alone had been left to do all the legal work in their law
office headed by <span class="SpellE">Salutario</span> J. Fernandez, who was kept
busy by his official functions as Vice-Governor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
Province.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No objection or opposition to
the requested second extension was made by the Office of the Solicitor General
on behalf of respondent People but respondent court in its resolution of <st1:date year="1976" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1976</st1:date> denied the extension
and forthwith dismissed the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copy
of the said resolution was received by petitioner's counsel on <st1:date year="1976" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1976</st1:date> and petitioner's
counsel filed the brief on <st1:date year="1976" day="7" month="2">February 7,
 1976</st1:date>, within the period of the requested second extension (45 days
from <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="12">December 25, 1975</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's counsel then filed on February 17, 1976 a motion for
reconsideration of the dismissal resolution, certifying under oath to the truth
and correctness of the grounds submitted in support thereof, explaining that
petitioner was in distant islands and barrios in <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> attending to his business of buy and sell
of assorted medicines to "make both ends meet" and therefore
belatedly brought P100.00 for expenses of the brief which had already been
filed, and submitting that the brief assigned and discussed several errors
committed by the trial court that would justify reversal of the conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent court however denied
reconsideration in its Resolu­tion of <st1:date year="1976" day="3" month="3">March
 3, 1976</st1:date>, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Resolved:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Because no decision appended to brief; and appellant received
notice to file brief within 30 days from <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1975</st1:date> (back of page 37, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had therefore until <st1:date year="1975" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1975</st1:date> to file same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon his motion asking only 45 days
extension, p. 38, he was granted 90 days extension from expiration of <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period per resolution dated <st1:date year="1975" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1975</st1:date> which expires <st1:date year="1975" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His second motion for the extension of 90
days previously granted which was however denied and appeal dismissed per
resolution of <st1:date year="1976" day="15" month="1">1-15-76</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This resolution was, according to appellant
in his urgent motion for reconsideration mailed on <st1:date year="1976" day="14" month="2">Feb. 14, 1976</st1:date> (p. 47, <span class="SpellE">rollo</span>)
received by appellant on <st1:date year="1976" day="30" month="1">January 30,
 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was
however filed 3 days late after the resolution dated <st1:date year="1976" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1976</st1:date> became final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, the brief mailed on <st1:date year="1976" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1976</st1:date> was one day late even
if appellant's motion for second extension of 45 days had been granted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view whereof, motion denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(p. 63, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">A second motion for reconsideration was
denied by respondent court as per its Resolution of <st1:date year="1976" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1976</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the petition at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">Required to comment on behalf of the State, the Office of the
Solicitor General through then Acting Solicitor General, now Associate Justice
of the Court of Appeals, Hugo E. Gutierrez, Jr., in an extensively prepared
18-page pleading filed on December 11, 1976 concurred with the merits of the
petition and urged that the relief sought be granted and petitioner's appeal
reinstated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among the meritorious
grounds mentioned in the said comment were the special reasons submitted for
the additional extension requested and the State's lack of objection thereto,
petitioner's prompt filing of the brief within the extended period requested,
petitioner's prompt compliance with respondent court's resolution of February
20, 1976 which required him to append to his brief copies of the trial court's
decision, contrary to the statement in the March 3, 1976 resolution denying
reconsideration that "no decision (was) appended to brief;" and the
imperatives of justice and equity invoked by petitioner for reinstatement of
his appeal, assuming that the brief was filed one day late (even though he had
in fact requested that the additional 45-day extension be counted from
Christmas Day, 1975).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General therefore concluded that "(W)<span class="SpellE">ith</span> all due respect to respondent court, we submit that the
(above) grounds relied upon by petitioner in his second motion for extension to
file brief as well as his motions for reconsideration for the reinstate­ment
and admission of his brief merits its approbation and therefore, we
respectfully submit that the Resolutions of January 15, March 3, May 5 and June
25, all in 1976 issued by the Court of Appeals should be set aside in the
interest of justice and the brief filed by petitioner on February 7, 1976 be
admitted and his appeal reinstated."</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the petition and the Solicitor General's comment in
support of the same to be meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">Suffice it to state that where there is no assertion or showing
whatsoever of any intent to delay on the part of appellant or of injury or
prejudice to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, and valid special reasons
are presented for the granting of an additional extension within which to file
the ap­pellant's brief which in fact is filed within the requested extended
period and such brief shows that it is not perfunctory but on the contrary
presents strong prima facie arguments for hearing the side of the appellant
instead of dismissing the appeal outright, the exer­cise of sound discretion
favors the granting of such extension of time in consonance with the settled
principle that judicial discretion must be exercised "wisely and
prudently, never capriciously, with a view to substantial justice."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As was aptly stressed in <u>Gregorio vs. Court of Appeals</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
"(T)he expiration of the time to file brief, unlike lateness in filing the
notice of appeal, appeal bond or record on appeal is not a juris­dictional
matter and may be waived by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even after the expiration of the time fixed for the filing of the brief,
the review­ing court may grant an extension of time, at least where no motion
to dismiss has been made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Late filing or
service of briefs may be excused where no material injury has been suffered by
the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> by reason of the delay or where there is
no contention that the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> cause was
prejudiced."</p>

<p class="BODY">And as the Court held in <span class="SpellE"><u>Obut</u></span><u>
vs. Court of Appeals</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
where compelling circumstances are cited by the appellant that would warrant an
examination and review by the appellate court as the reviewer of the findings
of fact made by the trial court, "a liberal application of the rules
becomes imperative and conversely an <span class="SpellE">overstrict</span> or
rigid enforcement of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period for the
filing of briefs, extensions of which for justifiable reasons are after all
addressed to the sound discretion of the court, is to be shunned and avoided
lest a grave miscarriage of justice be committed."</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the resolutions of respondent Court of
Appeals dismissing petitioner's appeal and denying reconsideration of such dismissal
are hereby set aside and petitioner's appeal is hereby ordered reinstated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case is remanded to res­pondent Court of
Appeals for further proceedings and determination of petitioner's appeal on the
merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since respondent People have
joined in praying for granting of the relief sought, this de­cision shall be
immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span> upon pro­mulgation.</p>
