				<H3>CHIN GUAN GO, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPONENT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by the State from a decree entered by the Court of First Instance of 
Sulu granting the petition of Chin Guan Go to become a naturalized citizen of 
the Philippines (case No. 17), on the ground that the applicant had not been a 
resident of the province of Sulu for at least one year immediately preceding the 
filing of his petition for naturalization as required by section 8 of 
Commonwealth Act No. 473, as amended by Republic Act No. 530.
<p>As the issue involved and the only ground relied upon by the State to set 
aside the decree appealed from is whether the Court of First Instance of Sulu 
had jurisdiction to hear and determine the case, a restatement of the evidence 
presented by the appellee in so far as his residence is concerned is 
necessary.</p>
<p>In his petition filed in the Court of First Instance of Sulu on 1 July 1958 
the appellee Chin Guan Go avers that he was born on 9 May 1928 at Walled City, 
Jolo, Sulu, of Chinese parents Go Ah Chee and Julia Chio Go; that he grew up in 
said place and since birth had continuously resided in and had never left the 
Philippines; and that he speaks and writes Tagalog, English, Chavacano and 
Taosug dialects. His only sister is Connie Go, who is married to Alexander 
Tandico, a Filipino resident of Jolo, Sulu.</p>
<p>The evidence shows that after his graduation from the Sulu High School on 21 
April 1958 (Exhibit W) he went to Manila to work as a salesman in the Young's 
Hardware Store owned by a naturalized Filipino citizen and located at 1411 
Azcarraga street, Santa Cruz, Manila. On 24 May 1953 he married Bonifacia 
Estrella Tan, a native-born Filipino resident of Jolo (Exhibit R) in a civil 
ceremony before Judge Ricardo Garcia in Jolo, Sulu. The couple repeated their 
marital vows in a rite of the Protestant faith solemnized by Reverend de Jesus. 
Out of the marriage the couple begot three children, namely, Edwin, Eric and 
Egberto, all surnamed Go and born in Manila on 20 April 1954, 12 July 1955 and 
11 March 1959, respectively (Exhibits V and V-1). Every December and May of each 
year he and his family vacationed regularly in Jolo, Sulu. From 1949 to 1950 he 
personally filed and paid his income taxes in Manila and from 1951 to 1958 his 
employer paid a withholding tax to the Government. Vicente Magno, former mayor 
of Jolo, Engineer Ceferino Burias of the Bureau of Public Highways in Sulu and 
Velia Carpio, employee in Jolo, testified as his character witnesses.</p>
<p>The only issue raised in this appeal is whether at the time of the filing of 
his petition for naturalization the appellee Chin Guan Go was a resident of Sulu 
one year prior to the filing thereof, as required by section 8 of Commonweatlh 
Act No. 473, as amended, which provides thatâ€”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Court of First Instance of the province in which the petitioner has 
resided at least one year immediately preceding the filing of the petition shall 
have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear the petition.</p></blockquote>
<p>In its brief, the appellant accepts as a correct resume of the evidence 
presented by the appellee the findings of fact set forth by the trial court in 
its decree, except the finding that the appellee had resided in the province of 
Sulu for at least one year immediately preceding the filing of his petition. It 
contends that the evidence presented during the trial shows that the appellee 
had been continuously residing in the city of Manila from 1948 when he started 
to work as a salesman in Young's Hardware store until he filed his petition on 1 
July 1958, argues that under the provisions of section 8 of Commonwealth Act No. 
473, as amended, the appellee had not been a resident of the province of Sulu 
for at least one year prior to the filing of his petition for naturalization, 
and concludes that the trial court erred in granting his petition for 
naturalization. It claims that the documentary evidence submitted by the 
appellee himself, to wit: clearance certificate issued on 23 February 1959 by 
the Court of First Instance of Manila stating that he resides at 1411 Azcarraga 
street, Manila (Exhibit CC); certificates issued by the Bureau of Immigration of 
Manila on 11 February 1959 and of Jolo, Sulu, that he is a resident of Manila 
(Exhibits EE and EE-1); alien certificate of registration of his wife, together 
with other related papers, where it appears that she is residing at 1855-C Sulu 
street, Manila (Exhibits S and S-1); appellee's alien certificate of 
registration No. A-16118 issued in Manila on 11 July 1950 (Exhibit D) in lieu of 
his former ACR No. 130890-V issued in Jolo, Sulu, on 25 November 1946, where he 
stated that his residence is 96 Doroteo Jose, Manila, clearly shows that he was 
no longer a resident of Jolo, Sulu, at least one year immediately preceding the 
filing of his petition for naturalization.</p>
<p>The State did not set up in its objection to the granting of the petition the 
fact that the appellee lacks the required residence but just lack of 
qualification. In ordinary civil cases the failure to object on the ground of 
venue improperly laid would be deemed a waiver, but in naturalization cases such 
rule cannot be invoked and applied. The petition alleges such residence and 
therefore objection for lack of the required residence could not be set up until 
all the evidence shall have been presented. The evidence shows indubitably that 
he was not a resident of Jolo, Sulu, at least one year immediately preceding the 
filing of his petition. The case of Cipriano King vs. Republic of the 
Philippines, 89 Phil., 4, does not help the appellee, because there the 
applicant absented himself from his residence and went to Manila "just for the 
purpose of studying" whereas here the appellee was employed and had a lucrative 
employment. The requirement of residence in the province at least one year 
immediately preceding the filing of the application is for the purpose of 
checking up the applicant's activities as regards the other requirements which 
could not be done if he stayed in a place other than that where he filed his 
petition.</p>
<p>Without prejudice to his filing a petition with the competent court, for the 
appellee appears to be qualified to become a naturalized citizen of the 
Philippines, the decree appealed from is set aside and appellee's petition 
dismissed without pronouncement as to costs.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, 
Paredes, </i>and <i>Makalintal, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
