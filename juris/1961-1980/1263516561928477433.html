Vinson who passed away before judgment could be reached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge Jose F. Fernandez penned the decision

defendants, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> and <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
Cruz, guilty thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were each
sentenced by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, to
indemnify jointly and severally the heirs of the deceased Tomas <span class="SpellE">Martir</span> in the sum of P6,000.00 without subsidiary

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="23">11:00 p.m.</st1:time> on <st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1961</st1:date> in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Masa</span>, a merchant, was on his way home from <st1:place><st1:placename>Max</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Restaurant</st1:placename></st1:place> where he bought food, <span class="SpellE"><u>pancit</u></span> and <span class="SpellE"><u>siopao</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He met Tomas <span class="SpellE">Martir</span>
alias <span class="SpellE"><u>Masing</u></span> at the corner of Washington-<span class="SpellE">Luzurriaga</span> Streets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Martir</span> was known to be a violent person, a police
character, and one not averse to liquor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Martir</span> called <span class="SpellE">Masa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter replied that he was in a hurry as
it was already late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Martir</span>
retorted:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"You are a fool.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, I am going to stab you".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without much ado, <span class="SpellE">Martir</span>
delivered a fist blow on the belly of <span class="SpellE">Masa</span> who
dropped to the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Martir</span> entered the <span class="SpellE">Caviteña</span>
Bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Masa</span>
picked up his things and started to go home.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, a police patrol jeep occupied by Patrolmen Rodolfo
Pico and Felipe <span class="SpellE">Aplasca</span> passed by and saw <span class="SpellE">Martir</span> going back and forth in front of the <span class="SpellE">Caviteña</span> Bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
stopped, heard <span class="SpellE">Martir</span> murmur that he would kill
somebody that evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Patrolman Pico
observed that <span class="SpellE">Martir</span> smelled of alcohol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two police officers were able to persuade
<span class="SpellE">Martir</span> to go home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They conducted him to the front of his house at <st1:street><st1:address>Smith
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead of going up, <span class="SpellE">Martir</span> joined the
conversation of some people in the street.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was about this time that defendants Ramon <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> Cruz, also of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
police force assigned with the Mayor's special squad, were on patrol in another
jeep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They saw Ramon <span class="SpellE">Masa</span>
standing at the corner of Washington and <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>
Streets <span class="SpellE">signalling</span> the patrol to stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Getting off the jeep, <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span>
inquired from <span class="SpellE">Masa</span> what it was all about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Masa</span> reported his
incident, shortly before, with Tomas <span class="SpellE">Martir</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> and Cruz
invited <span class="SpellE">Masa</span> to report the matter to the police
station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter suggested instead
that he would follow after taking home the food that he bought, which might get
cold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Masa's</span>
wife learned of the incident with <span class="SpellE">Martir</span>, she
prevailed upon <span class="SpellE">Masa</span> to stay home.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two defendants proceeded to the capitol shopping center, to
the place where <span class="SpellE">Masa</span> informed them that he was
manhandled by <span class="SpellE">Martir</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The two came upon Sgt. David <span class="SpellE">Sevillo</span> likewise
of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> police at the corner of <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> and Burgos Streets.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Sevillo</span> was on his way to report for duty and
got a ride from the two defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">Near the <st1:street><st1:address>bridge of Smith Street</st1:address></st1:street>,
the three came upon a group of six persons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> and Cruz alighted, inquired if those
people had any weapons, searched them, found none.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two defendants advised the group to break
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that group was Tomas <span class="SpellE">Martir</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> approached <span class="SpellE">Martir</span> and
told him that there was a complaint against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Martir</span> denied the
charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two defendant-policemen
sought the advice of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Sevillo</span> as to what to do
with <span class="SpellE">Martir</span> with respect to <span class="SpellE">Masa's</span>
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Sevillo</span>
answered that it would be best to take <span class="SpellE">Martir</span> along
to headquarters for investigation and record purposes.</p>

<p class="BODY">The three police officers took <span class="SpellE">Martir</span>
along.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At police head­quarters on <st1:street><st1:address>Smith
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Sevillo</span>
alighted, proceeded to his post.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendant police officers were then informed that there was no complaint
recorded against <span class="SpellE">Martir</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So they proceeded with Tomas <span class="SpellE">Martir</span> to the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
headquarters [of the Mayor's special squad] at City Hall on <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, they also found from their own blotter
that Ramon <span class="SpellE">Masa</span> had not yet reported the
incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Martir</span>
denied the charge against him, the two defendants decided to take him
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon nearing Florida Hotel in <st1:street><st1:address>San
  Juan Street</st1:address></st1:street>, they stopped and <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span>
entered the hotel.</p>

<p class="BODY">From here on, there is a sharp divergence of evidence between the
prosecution and the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
People's version which gained the nod of the court below is this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching the gate of the Florida
Nightclub, which was on the ground floor of Florida Hotel, accused Ramon <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> alighted and approached the watchman, Antonio
Santiago, and inquired about his brother Jesus <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span>
who was living inside the compound of the nightclub.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon being informed that Jesus was inside,
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> entered the gate and called out to his
brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While Ramon <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span>
was inside the nightclub com­pound, Tomas <span class="SpellE">Martir</span>
inquired from the accused <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> Cruz why they
stopped at the nightclub where his enemy, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span>,
was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Forthwith, <span class="SpellE">Martir</span>
jumped from the jeep, started to run away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accused <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> Cruz then went running to his
co-accused Ramon <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> shouting "Pare Ramon,
he has gone, he left away".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ramon <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> rushed to the watchman Antonio Santiago who was at
the gate and directed him to run after Tomas <span class="SpellE">Martir</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>
demurred, as he was watching the nightclub.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> angrily threatened to shoot <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>
if the latter disobeyed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon, <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>
ran after the fleeing man, collared him in front of the Sea Breeze Hotel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ramon <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> who
had followed them shouted to Antonio Santiago to keep distance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>
pushed Tomas <span class="SpellE">Martir</span> dashing him against the
wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Almost simultaneously, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span>, with his service revolver, shot Tomas <span class="SpellE">Martir</span> twice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
latter staggered towards the direction of the nearby Wonder Inn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But then, the accused <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
Cruz, also with his service revolver, shot Tomas <span class="SpellE">Martir</span>
once.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was followed by Ramon <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> with two shots.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Tomas <span class="SpellE">Martir</span> fell, sprawled face downward to
the ground alongside Sea Breeze Hotel in <st1:street><st1:address>San Juan
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> reached the dead man, he directed
Antonio Santiago to drop a knife which was handed to the latter by Segundo <span class="SpellE">Masa</span> (brother of Ramon <span class="SpellE">Masa</span>) near
the prostrate body of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Martir</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>
did so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Arcobillas</span> shoved the knife nearer to the body of the
deceased Tomas <span class="SpellE">Martir</span>, because Antonio Santiago did
not drop it close enough.</p>

<p class="BODY">The medico-legal necropsy report filed by Dr. Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Lamayo</span> of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Negros</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Provincial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
showed that five bullets found their mark on the body of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Martir</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of these,
the wound which entered the <span class="SpellE">parasternal</span> border was
pronounced fatal since it hit the lungs, the pericardium, the diaphragm, the
stomach, and the left border of the liver.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Lamayo</span> also found that the deceased
smelled of intoxicating drink which could either be whiskey or beer.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants' brief
pleaded self-defense in exculpation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants’ version of the incident follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the way to conduct Tomas <span class="SpellE">Martir</span> home, they passed by Florida Nightclub where Segundo
<span class="SpellE">Masa</span>, a brother of Ramon <span class="SpellE">Masa</span>,
had his job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> asked defendant Cruz who was at the wheel to stop
the jeep as he would inquire from Segundo <span class="SpellE">Masa</span> of the
whereabouts of Ramon <span class="SpellE">Masa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> went inside
the Florida Nightclub compound.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendant Cruz was left with <span class="SpellE">Martir</span> in the
jeep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cruz passed water in front of the
jeep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Martir</span>
suddenly and unexpectedly grabbed from behind Cruz’ service revolver which was
tucked in his waist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two grappled
for the possession of the gun.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Meanwhile, Cruz called <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> for help:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Pare Ramon, Pare Ramon, help
me".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the struggle, the gun
went off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It hit <span class="SpellE">Martir</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">Martir</span> held to
the gun, succeeded in wresting possession thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then that <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span>
arrived and shouted to Tomas <span class="SpellE">Martir</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Masing</span>, <span class="SpellE">Masing</span>, drop it".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Martir</span> did not heed the warning, instead faced
<span class="SpellE">Navarra</span>, pointed the gun at him, and said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"You also".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span>
sidestepped to his left and fired four successive shots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Martir</span> dropped the
gun, dizzily walked away about five arm stretches and fell face down.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Ansoyon</u></span>,
75 Phil. 772, 777, courts of justice have clung to the rule that for the plea
of self-defense to prosper, a defendant must rely on the strength of his own
evidence, not on the weakness of that for the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reason for this is that even if the People's
evidence were weak it would not be dis­believed after the defendants themselves
have admitted the killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not
propose to stray away from this salutary rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the standard forged in <span class="SpellE"><u>Ansoyon</u></span>,
we now analyze the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>First</u>
<u>and</u> <u>foremost</u> is the ballistic finding that four of the bullet
wounds were from the service revolver of <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> and
one from the service revolver of Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It cannot be true therefore that Cruz did not fire a shot as he, thru
his testimony, would want the court to believe.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Secondly</u>, it does not jibe with normal course of events that if
really the deceased Tomas <span class="SpellE">Martir</span> was able to wrest
Cruz’ revolver, <span class="SpellE">Martir</span> did not fire a shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The natural impulse would have been for <span class="SpellE">Martir</span> to do so.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What did he grab the revolver for?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Thirdly</u>, it would not seem credible, as the court below observed,
that Tomas <span class="SpellE">Martir</span> could have handled the gun so ably
and aimed it at Ramon <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Fourthly</u>, the balance of probabilities
is that, again as the lower court pointed out, if Tomas <span class="SpellE">Martir</span>
had the <span class="SpellE">upperhand</span> and was able to wrest the gun in
the process, that gun could not have misfired to hit <span class="SpellE">Martir</span>
himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Lastly</u>, it is improbable
anyway that <span class="SpellE">Martir</span> could have presented such a
spirited struggle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, at that time, he
was drunk.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that self-defense has not been proven.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge Jose F. Fernandez
declared the crime to be that of murder upon the finding that defendants took
advantage of superior strength within the meaning of paragraph 15, Article 14
of the Revised Penal Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judge is correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
deceased Tomas <span class="SpellE">Martir</span> was unarmed, under the
influence of liquor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was much smaller
than <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Navarra's</span> attack came after he (<span class="SpellE">Martir</span>)
was pushed to the wall by Antonio Santiago.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not content with this and after <span class="SpellE">Martir</span> tried
to escape, <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> Cruz fired at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was followed by two other shots from <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the
attack was unexpected, the aggressors were police officers fully armed, and the
deceased was defenseless and under the influence of liquor, a clear case of
abuse of superiority is present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two
took advantage of these circumstances to consummate the offense.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The performance of our
police officers since the not-too­-remote past leaves much to be desired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The catalogue of crimes into which our
policemen have fallen has galvanized the minds of our government leaders and
civic spirited citizens into the formula­tion of steps to decrease - not to say
to eliminate - the number of our policemen who debase their position, give
dishonor to their uniform, and who have become menaces to, rather than
protectors of, the community.</p>

<p class="BODY">A little more than two years ago, Congress enacted the Police Act
of 1966<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
with the end in view of upgrading the quality of our police officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The explanatory note to the bill that became
law as well as the law itself reflect a grave concern over the substandard
local police service in this country <span class="SpellE"><u>vis-a-vis</u></span>
the upsurge in crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contemporary
history notes the fact that police officers have not been insulated from
criminal acts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our concept of policemen is that they are peace officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The term "peace officers" suggests
their primary role in our society.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
are to uphold the law, not to break it; to protect citizens from crimes, not to
commit them; to induce respect from the citizenry, not their distrust; to
perform their duty to keep peace in the community, not to turn their backs on
crime and violence; to defend the people from murderers, not to murder
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The policemen then should be made
to understand that when they are found guilty of crimes which they themselves
are oath-bound to prevent, they shall receive the full measure of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present case before us is illustrative
indeed of how a law upholder has become a lawbreaker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants here were appropriately meted the
penalty imposed upon them by the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For the reasons given</span>,
the judgment under review is hereby affirmed.</p>
