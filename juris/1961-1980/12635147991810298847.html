				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by <i style="">certiorari</i> from
a decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The factual background, as found by said Court, is as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1931" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1931</st1:date>, the Director of Lands approved a
homestead application of <span class="SpellE">Albina</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> <span style="">–</span>
hereinafter referred to as <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> <span style="">–</span> covering
an <span class="SpellE">unsurveyed</span> portion of the public lands in <span class="SpellE">Tagum</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When said lands were surveyed on <st1:date year="1937" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1937</st1:date>, the portion applied for
by <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> was designated as Lot No.
879, with an area of 15.8648 hectares.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The order for the issuance of her patent was released on <st1:date year="1940" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1940</st1:date> and Homestead Patent No.
67930, covering said lot, was issued on <st1:date year="1941" day="26" month="6">June
 26, 1941</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Transmitted to the
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> on <st1:date year="1941" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1941</st1:date>, the patent was lost and never
registered on account of the war.</p>

<p class="BODY">Seven (7) years later, or on <st1:date year="1948" day="12" month="8">August 12, 1948</st1:date>, <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
filed, with the Bureau of Lands, a petition for amendment of her patent to
include therein an additional area of 8.44 hectares, to be taken from the
adjoining <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 880, so that her homestead may have an
aggregate area of 24 hectares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
adjoining lot, containing 15.8119 hectares, is close to Lot 1350, both of which
were covered, however, by Bureau of Fisheries Application No. 2266, filed over
six (6) months before, or on February 2, 1948, by Alejandro Rodriguez <span style="">–</span>
hereinafter referred to as Rodriguez <span style="">–</span> to whom Ordinary Fishpond Permit F-639-D
had, accordingly, been issued on July 6, 1948, or over a month prior to Santos'
petition for amendment of her patent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
Rodriguez occupied said lots in October, 1948, <span style="">and, upon the a</span><span style="">uthority </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">said </span>permit, started constructing
thereon a fishpond, Santos filed her protest thereto with the Bureau of
Fisheries, first on October 19, 1948, and then in July, 1949, alleging that Lot
880 was within the perimeter covered by her homestead application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an order, dated <st1:date year="1950" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1950</st1:date>, the Director of Fisheries
overruled the protest upon the ground that the homestead was limited to <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
879, and did not include Lots Nos. 880 and 1350, which are within a mangrove
reservation, as well as covered by the Fishpond Permit of Rodriguez.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 24, 1950, Santos moved for a reconsideration of this
order, but the Bureau of Fisheries held in abeyance its action on the motion,
because Santos had, on September 27, 1949 filed Civil Case No. 387 of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> <span style="">–</span> hereinafter referred to as the trial
court <span style="">–</span>
against Rodriguez, for a declaration to the effect that she had a better right
to the possession of said Lots Nos. 880 and 1350.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 9, 1955, the trial court rendered
a decision dismissing the complaint, but said decision was, on appeal taken by
Santos, reversed, on September 22, 1958, in CA-G.R. No. 18912-R of the Court of
Appeals, which ordered Rodriguez to surrender to Santos the possession of the
entire Lot 879 and 8.4365 hectares of Lot 880, in addition to paying damages
and the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rodriguez sought a review on <i style="">certiorari</i>
of the decision of the appellate court, but on <st1:date year="1959" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1959</st1:date>, the Supreme Court, in G. R. No. L-<span class="GramE">14727,</span> dismissed the petition for review upon the ground
that it involved questions of fact and was without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the motion filed by Santos with the Bureau of
Fisheries for a reconsideration of its order of February 16, 1950 <span style="">–</span> overruling
her objection to the fishpond permit of Rodriguez, insofar as it included Lots
Nos. 880 and 1350, upon the ground that the same are covered by her homestead
patent <span style="">–</span>
had not been resolved, in deference to the suit filed by Santos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the conclusion of said litigation, or on
<st1:date year="1959" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1959</st1:date>, the
Director of Fisheries acted on said motion and denied the same, upon the ground
that only <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 879 was covered by the homestead patent of
<st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>, and that Lots Nos. 880 and
1350, are encompassed by the fishpond Permit of<span style=""> </span>Rodriguez.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as eight (8) days prior thereto the Supreme Court had
refused to review the decision of the Court of Appeals favorable to <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,
the latter asked the trial Court to issue the corresponding writ of
execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite the opposition
thereto of Rodriguez and the Government, said Court issued the writ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, on <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1963</st1:date>, the Commissioner of Fisheries and
Rodriguez commenced case CA-G. <span class="GramE">R. No. 32970-R, of the Court
of<span style=""> </span><span style="">Appeals, for "prohibition with
preliminary injunc</span>tion," to restrain the enforcement of the
decision in CA-G.</span> <span class="GramE"><span style="">R. No. 18912</span>-R.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
due course, said appellate court rendered a decision treating the petition in
said case CA-G. R. No. 32970-R as one for <i style=""><span style="">certiorari</span></i><span style="">, and annulling the aforementioned writ of execution, "insofar only </span>as
it seeks to deliver now a portion of 8.4365 hectares of lot 880 from Alejandro
Rodriguez to <span class="SpellE">Albina</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>."
The latter now seeks a review on <i style="">certiorari</i>
of the last decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Santos maintains that the appellate court had no jurisdiction
over the present case, because its original jurisdiction is limited to
auxiliary writs and processes in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, and there <span style="">is, </span>she claims, no case now pending in
the trial court, so that there can be no appellate jurisdiction in connection
therewith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that there is no
case <u>pending decision on the merits</u> in the trial court; but, <u>there is</u>
therein a case pending <u>execution of the decision</u> therein rendered on the
merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said court had to pass upon the
issue <span style="">–</span>
raised by the motion of <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> for
execution of the decision in CA-G. R. No. 18912-R (recognizing her right to
possess a po<span style="">r</span>tion of Lot 880, <u>pending
determination of the question</u> whether or not the same is covered by her
homestead patent) and the opposition of Rodriguez and the Government to said
motion <span style="">–</span>
whether or not it should order the execution of said decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complained writ or order of the trial <span class="GramE">Court,</span> constituted its decision on that issue, for it
settled the same in a manner that would become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
unless appropriate steps were taken to prevent it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rodriguez could have appealed from said order
to the Court of Appeals, had he chosen to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not do so, however, because an appeal would
not have been a plain, adequate and speedy remedy in the ordinary course of
law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We have already held,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> that, for the Court of Appeals to have
original jurisdiction, it is not necessary that the party initiating the case
therein shall have actually appealed, or be about to appeal, from a decision of
the court of first instance, and </span>that <span style="">it is enough if it appears that, had the petitioner wished to appeal
from the action taken by the lower court, such appeal would have been within
the jurisdiction of said appellate court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">What is more, it is settled that the fact that a decision or
order of a court of first instance has become final does not negate the
original jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to issue writs of <i style="">mandamus</i>, prohibition or <i style="">certiorari</i>, in connection with orders or
processes issued by the trial court incidentally to the execution of said final
decision or order.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, otherwise, those adversely affected by action taken by the trial court
would be left without any relief, even if its processes or orders had been
issued improperly or erroneously.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is next urged that the appellate court erred in taking into
account, in the decision appealed from, the following documents, which, Santos
alleges, have been neither marked nor presented as exhibits, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) an "alleged order of the Director of
Fisheries, dated February 27, 1959;" 2) an "alleged letter" of
the same officer, dated May 28, 1959; and 3) his alleged wire to District
Fishery Office of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, dated October 7, 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Santos can not ques­tion the propriety of
considering these documents in the case at bar, for <u>it was she</u> who cited
them in her Memorandum in the appellate Court, dated March 4, 1964, and
appended them thereto as Exhibits E, F and G.</p>

<p class="BODY">Santos further impugns the decision of the appellate Court, in
the present case, upon the ground:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1)
that it nullifies its decision in CA-G.R. No. 18912-R; and 2) that the proper
remedy for Rodriguez is "not a petition for prohibition but an ordinary
action in the lower court for the recovery of possession by the Government
after execution of the judgment sought to be annulled."</p>

<p class="BODY">Viewed in the right perspective, there is no conflict, however,
between the <span class="GramE">decision</span> in CA-G. <span class="GramE">R. No.
18912-R and the ap­pealed decision in CA-G.</span> <span class="GramE">R. No.
32970-R.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first settled the
question as to who was <span style="">entitled </span>to the <u>possession</u> of the disputed portion of Lot
880, <u>pending determination</u> of the question whether the same part of the
Homestead of Santos, or of the area cover­ed by the fishpond permit of
Rodriguez, whereas CA-G.R. No. 32970-R enforced the <u>subsequent</u> decision of
the proper adminis­trative authorities, holding that said portion is covered,
not by the homestead patent, but by the fishpond permit, apart from referring
to the right of possession <u>after said question had been de­cided</u> in
favor of Rodriguez.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was right and just that the possession of <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
be respected <u>prior</u> to said determination or decision, for she was the <u>first
to hold</u> the disputed portion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>One
of the conditions</u> contained in her own homestead application <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> was, however, that she <u>agreed to "future
delimitations and survey</u>" and would "<u>accept a grant for such
area as may be determined by the survey and final grant to be suitable for the
purposes of the application</u>, or which could be put by the applicant into
beneficial use and cultivation." Consistently with this provision of her
application, a survey was made and the disputed portion was <u>not</u> included
in the area covered by the homestead patent issued to her, <u>said portion
being deemed more suitable for fishpond purposes</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">At the time of the rendition of the decision in
CA-G.</span> R. No. 18912-R, the question whether or not said portion was to be
part of her homestead had not as yet been definitely settled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, it became necessary to determine
in that case who shall <u>meanwhile</u> be in possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aforementioned question was <span style="">finally </span>decided in favor of Rodriguez,
in the order of the Director of Fisheries, dated <st1:date year="1959" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Thereafter</u>
he is, therefore, the party entitled to <span class="GramE">said</span>
possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the decision
in CA-G.R. 18912-R may no longer be executed, not because the decision in
CA-G.R. 32970-R has annulled it, but because of events subsequent to the first
decision, which events have changed materially the situation between the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in Hernandez vs. <span class="SpellE">Clapis</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court, speaking through then Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Par<span style="">a</span>s</span>, said:</p>

<blockquote>“In our opinion the present appeal is merito­rious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the decision in the forcible entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case is final, <u><span style="">it can no longer</span> be executed</u> at least in so far as the
possession of the land in question is concerned, because, under section 4 of
Commonwealth Act No. 141, the Director of Lands has direct executive control of
the survey, classification, lease, sale or any other form of concession or
disposition and management of the lands of the public domain, and <u>his </u><u><span style="">decisions as to questions of </span>fact are
conclusive when approved by the Secretary of Ag</u><u><span style="">riculture;</span></u><span style=""> </span>and
because the latter had already cancelled the right of plaintiff Maria L.
Hernandez to administer the land in question and rejected both her sales
application and that of her husband, plain­tiff Antonio Hernandez, at the same
time giving the defendants the preferential right to apply for said land in
virtue of the provisions of Republic Act No. 65.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The correctness of the final decision of the
Secretary of Agriculture is not herein involved, but it is valid and binding
until reversed in a proper proceeding by the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">The
situation is not that the judgment in the forcible entry </span>and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case has lost its <span class="SpellE">virtuality</span>,
but that the plaintiffs had subsequently ceased to be entitled to the relief
awarded by said </u><u><span style="">j</span>udgment</u>."
(Underscoring supplied.)<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As early as Molina vs. De la Riva<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the principle has been laid down that, when, after judgment has become final,
facts and circumstances transpire which render its execution impossible or
unjust, the interested party may ask the court to modify or alter the judgment
to harmonize the same with justice and the facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">For this reason, in <span class="SpellE">Amor</span> <span style="">vs. </span>Judge Jose,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
we used the following language:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court cannot refuse to issue a writ of execution upon a
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment, or quash it, or order
its stay, for, as a general rule, parties will not <span style="">be </span>allowed, after final judgment, to object to the execution by
raising new issues of fact or of law, <u>except when there had been a change in
the situation of the parties which makes such execution inequitable</u>; or
when it appears that the controversy has never been submitted to the judgment
of the court; or when it appears that the writ of execution has been
improvidently issued, or that it is defective in substance, or issued against
the wrong party, or that judgment debt <span style="">has
</span>been paid or otherwise satisfied; or when the writ has been issued
without authority."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since, events posterior to the rendition of the decision <span style="">in </span>CA-G.R. 18912-R have reversed the
legal position of the parties therein, the trial Court committed a grave abuse
of discretion, amounting to <span style="">excess </span>of
jurisdiction in issuing the writ of execution complained of, insofar as Lot 880
is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rodriguez committed,
therefore, no error in commencing the present action in the Court of Appeals,
which properly considered it as one for <i style="">certiorari</i>.</p>
