				<BR><BR><div align=""><div align="justify"><br><p>Between the night of November 30 and the early morning of December 1, 1961, 
Demetrio Pepito, a crew member of m/v P. Aboitiz, disappeared therefrom while 
said vessel was on voyage.</p>
<p>On December 26, 1961, petitioner received from respondent Vivencia Ando 
Pepito a letter dated December 21, 1961, stating —</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You are hereby notified that one of your employees, Mr. Demetrio Pepito, a 
crew member of M/V P. Aboitiz, one of your vessels, was reported missing as per 
record of the Deck Log Book of the M/V P. Aboitiz while said vessel was 
navigating from Surigao to Tandag. It is our belief that Mr. Pepito is already 
dead. A diligent search has been made but the same is rendered 
futile."</p></blockquote>
<p>On January 12, 1962, Vivencia Ando Pepito, for herself and in behalf of her 
children, the other respondents, filed with Regional Office No. 8, Department of 
Labor, Cebu City, a notice and claim for compensation, asking for death 
benefits, and describing the circumstances of the alleged death of Demetrio 
Pepito on the night of November 30, 1961 in the following manner, <em>viz</em>: 
"While the vessel was navigating from Surigao to Tandag, the herein deceased was 
lost or reported missing as per record of the deck log of the M/V P. 
Aboitiz".</p>
<p>Having received on February 15, 1962 from the chief, labor operations section 
of said regional office, a letter enclosing the foregoing claim, petitioner, on 
February 16, 1962, sent to that office the employer's report of accident or 
sickness, controverting the claim for compensation and alleging that Demetrio 
Pepito was found missing on December 1, 1961 and giving its own version of the 
incident as follows: "Pepito disappeared while off duty, and when the vessel was 
near Bucas Grande Island while the ship was in navigation on a calm sea arid 
good weather. We do not know if he purposely jumped and awam ashore".</p>
<p>On March 21, 1962, <i>without hearing</i>, the Regional Administrator issued 
an award for death benefits to respondents, planted upon the ground that "the 
right to compensation of the claimant has not been controverted by respondent 
within the period provided for by law".</p>
<p>Motion to reconsider was of no avail. Petitioner sought review from the 
Workmen's Compensation Commission. In a decision dated March 8, 1963, said 
Commission affirmed. The reconsideration sought was thwarted in the Commission's 
<i>en banc</i> resolution of April 5, 1963.</p>
<p>We are now called upon to review on certiorari the Commission's decision of 
March 8, 1963 and its resolution of April 5, 1963.</p>
<ol><li>There should be no quarrel as to the fact that petitioner came to know of 
the disappearance of Demetrio Pepito on December 1, 1961, Petitioner so admits 
in its report of accident or sickness. And then, on December 26, 1961 petitioner 
received from respondent Vivencia Ando Pepito a letter informing it of the fact 
that Demetrio Pepito was reported missing on December 1, 1961, as per record of 
the deck log book of m/v P. Aboitiz. 
<p>Decidedly, the purported controversion — filed on February 16, 1962 — was 
made beyond the periods set forth in the law and the rules and regulations of 
the Workmen's Compensation Commission, namely, 14 days from the date of accident 
or 10 days from knowledge thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
</li><li>Logically, the next problem we face is the scope of the non-controversion 
which may be clamped upon petitioner. 
<p>By Section 2, Rule 7 of the Rules of the Workmen's Compensation Commission, 
"[A]ll the general rules of procedure in the Courts of First Instance shall be 
suppletory to the Rules of the Workmen's Compensation Commission but the 
commission shall not be bound by the technical rules of procedure".</p>
<p>We go deep into the recitals of the notice and claim for compensation. It 
simply says that while the vessel was navigating, "the herein deceased was lost 
or reported missing". This claim was filed on January 12, 1962, or barely 42 
days after the event took place. At that time, no presumption existed that 
Demetrio Pepito was dead. The boat was not lost. This opens up a number of 
possibilities. Because nothing is certain. Nobody knows what has happened to 
him. He could have transferred to another vessel or watercraft. He could even 
have swam to safety. Or he could have died. Or worse, he could have taken his 
own life. Legal implications — such as right to compensation, succession, the 
legal status of the wife — are so important that courts should not so easily be 
carried to the conclusion that the man is dead.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The result is that death cannot be taken 
as a fact.</p>
<p>Non-controversion in compensation cases, as in the case of pleadings in 
ordinary civil cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> simply means 
admission of facts, not conclusions of law.</p>
<p>As applied to the case before us, the mere failure to controvert the 
statement that Demetrio Pepito is believed to be "dead" or "deceased" because he 
"was lost" or was "reported missing", does not import an admission that the man 
is actually dead, but that he was just lost or missing.</p>
<p>We, therefore, rule that petitioner's non-controversion admits but the fact 
that Demetrio Pepito was lost or missing, but certainly is not an admission of 
the actual fact of death.</p>
</li><li>But petitioner was directed to pay compensation without inquiry into the 
fact and circumstances of death. This trenches upon petitioner's right to due 
process enshrined in Section 1(1) of Article III of the Constitution that "[N]o 
person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of 
law." The award having been made before petitioner was given an opportunity to 
be heard on the debatable fact and circumstances of death, that award has no leg 
to stand on. We nullify that award as a violation of a constitutional 
proscription.<br><br>
</li><li>But the Commission would want to downgrade petitioner's cry of denial of due 
process by a reference to a certain investigation report dated January 12, 1962, 
made — barely 42 days after the incident — by one Anselmo M. Morales, a 
constabulary sergeant, to the effect that Demetrio Pepito was "on board said 
boat on her maiden voyage to Tandag, Surigao del Sur; that at about 2:00 o'clock 
a.m. on December 1, 1961, Francisco Ygot, a watchman on duty, noticed that 
Demetrio Pepito was not in the crews' sleeping quarters; that when a thorough 
search of the boat failed to locate the missing crew member, the boat's course 
was reversed upon instruction of its captain in order to look for him; that 
because no trace of Demetrio Pepito or his body could be found, the search was 
abandoned and the boat then proceeded to Tandag; and that <i>no one knew what 
happened to Demetrio Pepito because he disappeared at midnight on a rough 
sea</i> (big waves)".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> This report does 
not prove death. At best, it confirms a known fact — disappearance, with the 
circumstance that "no one knew what happened to Demetrio Pepito". Besides, said 
report was not brought up at any hearing. It was but the result of an 
investigation. Whatever the investigator said would not rise above the level of 
hearsay twice removed. By Section 7 of the Workmen's Compensation Law "[A]ll 
<i>ex parte</i> evidence received by the Commissioner shall be reduced to 
writing and any party in interest shall have the opportunity to examine and 
rebut the same". Petitioner was not afforded an opportunity to as much as 
examine or contradict this report. It thus results that said report is of no 
value as evidence.<br><br>
</li><li>The employer-employee relationship is conceded. The event arose out of, and 
took place in the course of, employment. It matters not that the disappearance 
occurred, as alleged by petitioner, while Demetrio Pepito was off-duty. For, 
that incident happened while the boat was on a sea voyage. He had no choice. He 
had to be in the vessel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]<br><br></sup>
</li><li>From the time the event took place, i.e., from the night of November 30, 
1961, to this date, more than 4 years have elapsed. It is because of this that 
we approach this problem with a practical end in view. By this time, it cannot 
be gainsaid that the case of the disappearance of Demetrio Pepito could come 
within the coverage of paragraph 3, Article 391 of the Civil Code, which reads: 
<blockquote>"ART. 391. The following shall be presumed dead for all purposes, 
including the division of estate among the heirs: x x x x x x (3) A person who 
has been in danger of death under other circumstances and his existence has not 
been known for four years."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>With the known facts, namely, that Demetrio Pepito was lost or missing while 
the boat was navigating, he could have been in danger of death. But of course, 
evidence must be taken that his existence has not been known for four years or 
thereafter. </p></li></ol>
<p></p><strong>UPON THE VIEW WE TAKE OF THIS CASE</strong>, we vote to set aside 
the appealed decision of March 8, 1963 and the resolution of April 5, 1963, and 
to direct that the record hereof be returned to the Workmen's Compensation 
Commission with instructions — 
<ol><li>To hold a hearing, with notice to the parties, to determine (a) whether 
Demetrio Pepito is alive; or (b) whether he should be presumed dead, under the 
provisions of paragraph 3, Article 391 of the Civil Code; and (c) the 
circumstances of death if it be found or presumed that he died; and<br>
</li><li>To render judgment accordingly. No costs. </li></ol>
