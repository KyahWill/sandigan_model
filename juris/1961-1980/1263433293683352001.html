<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts as found by the
Hearing Examiner are </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A charge of unfair labor practice was filed <span style="">against <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> </span><span class="SpellE">Keh</span> <span class="SpellE">Beng</span>, proprietor of a basket
factory, for <span style="">discriminatory </span>acts
within the meaning of Section 4(a), <span style="">sub</span>-<span style="">paragraph (1) and (4), </span>Republic Act
No. 875,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
by dismissing on September 28 and 29, 1960, respectively, Carlos N. Solano and
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Tudla</span> for their union activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <span style="">pre­</span>liminary
investigation was conducted, a case was <span style="">filed
in </span>the Court of Industrial Relations for and in <span style="">behalf of the </span>International Labor and Marine Union of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and two of its members, Solano and <span class="SpellE">Tudla</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his answer, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Dy</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Keh</span> <span class="SpellE">Beng</span> contended
that he did not know <span class="SpellE">Tudla</span> and that Solano was not
his employee because the latter came to the establishment only when there was
work which he did on <span class="SpellE"><u>pakiaw</u></span> basis, each piece
of work being done under a separate contract.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> <span class="SpellE">Keh</span> <span class="SpellE">Beng</span> countered with a special defense of simple extortion
committed by the head of the labor union, <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Onayan</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After trial, the Hearing
Examiner prepared a report which was subsequently adopted <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> by the Court of Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An employee-employer relationship was found
to have existed between <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> <span class="SpellE">Keh</span>
<span class="SpellE">Beng</span> and complainants <span class="SpellE">Tudla</span>
and Solano, although Solano was admitted to have worked on piece basis.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The issue therefore centered on whether
there existed an employee-employer relation between petitioner <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> <span class="SpellE">Keh</span> <span class="SpellE">Beng</span>
and the respondents Solano and <span class="SpellE">Tudla</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">According to the Hearing
Examiner, the evidence for the complainant </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style=""> tended to show that Solano and <span class="SpellE">Tudla</span> became employees of <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> <span class="SpellE">Keh</span> <span class="SpellE">Beng</span> from </span><st1:date year="1953" day="2" month="5"><span style="">May 2,

of illness, their work with the establishment was continuous although their
services were compensated on piece basis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Evidence likewise showed that at times the establishment had eight (8)
workers and never less than five (5); including the complainants, and that
complainants used to receive P5.00 a day, sometimes less.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">According to <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> <span class="SpellE">Keh</span> <span class="SpellE">Beng</span>,
however, Solano was not his employee for the following reasons:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">According to petitioner, these facts show that respondents Solano
and <span class="SpellE">Tudla</span> are only piece workers, not <span style="">employees under Republic Act 875, where an
employee</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> is referred to as<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"shall include any employee and shall not be limited to the
employee of a particular employer unless the Act explicitly states otherwise
and <span style="">shall </span>include any individual
whose work has ceased as a consequence of, or in connection with any current
labor dispute or because of any unfair labor practice and who has not obtained
any other substantially equivalent and regular employment."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">while
an employer</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"includes any person acting in the interest of an employer,
directly or indi­rectly but shall not include any labor organization (otherwise
than when acting as an employer) or anyone acting in the capacity of officer or
agent of such labor organization."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner really anchors
his contention of the nonexistence of employee-employer relationship on the
control test.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He points to the case of
Madrigal Shipping Co., Inc. v. Nieves <span class="SpellE">Baens</span> del
Rosario, et al., L-13130, October 31, 1959, where the Court ruled that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The test ... of the existence of employee and employer
relationship is whether there is an understanding between the parties that one
is to render person­al services to or for the benefit of the other, and
recognition by them of the right of one to order and control the other in the
performance of the work and to direct the manner and method of its
performance."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Petitioner
contends that the private respondents "did not meet the control test in
the light of the ... definition of the terms employer and employee, because
there was no evidence to show that petitioner had the right to direct the
manner and method of respondent's work."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Moreover, it is argued that petitioner's
evidence showed that "Solano worked on a </span><span class="SpellE"><u>pakiaw</u></span><u>
</u><span style="">basis" and that he stayed in
the establishment only when there was work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While this Court upholds the control test<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
under which an employer-employee relationship exists "where the <span style="">person for whom the services are performed
reserves a right to control not only the end to be achieved but also the means
to be used in reaching such end," it finds no merit with petitioner's
arguments as stated above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be
borne in mind that the control test calls merely for the existence of the right
to control the manner of doing the work, not the actual exercise of the right.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Considering the finding by the Hearing
Examiner that the establishment of <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> <span class="SpellE">Keh</span> <span class="SpellE">Beng</span> is "engaged in the
manufacture of baskets known as <span class="SpellE"><u>kaing</u></span>,"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> it is natural to expect that those working
under <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> would have to observe, among others, <span class="SpellE">Dy's</span> requirements of size and quality of the <span class="SpellE"><u>kaing</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some
control would necessarily be exercised by <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> as the
making of the <span class="SpellE"><u>kaing</u></span> would be subject to <span class="SpellE">Dy's</span> specifications.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Parenthetically, since the work on the baskets is done at <span class="SpellE">Dy's</span> establishments, it can be inferred that the proprietor
<span class="SpellE">Dy</span> could easily exercise control on the men he
employed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As to the contention that
Solano was not an employee because he worked on piece basis, this Court agrees
with the Hearing Examiner that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"circumstances must be construed to determine indeed if
payment by the piece is just a method of compensation and does not define the
essence of the relation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Units of time
... and units of work are in establishments like respondent (sic) just
yardsticks whereby to determine rate of compensation, to be applied whenever
agreed upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot construe payment
by the piece where work is done in such an establishment so as to put the
worker completely at liberty to turn him out and take in another at
pleasure."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">At
this juncture, it is worthy to note that Justice Perfecto, concurring with
Chief Justice Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> who penned the decision
in "<span class="SpellE">Sunripe</span> Coconut Products Co. v. Court of
Industrial Relations" (83 Phil. 518, 523), opined that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"judicial notice of the fact that the so-called '<span class="SpellE">pakyaw</span>' system mentioned in this case as generally
practiced in our country, is, in fact, a labor contract between employers and
employees, between capitalists and laborers."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Insofar as the other assignments of errors are concerned, there
is no showing that the Court of Industrial Relations abused its discretion when
it concluded that the findings of fact made by the Hearing Examiner were supported
by evidence on the record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 6,
Republic Act 875 provides that in unfair labor practice cases, the factual
findings of the Court of Industrial Relations are conclusive on the Supreme
Court, if supported by substantial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This provision <span style="">has been put into
effect in a long line of decisions where the Supreme Court did not reverse the
findings of fact of the Court of Industrial Relations when they were supported
by substantial evidence.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

the payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> to the employees from their
respective dates of dismissal until finally reinstated, it is fitting to apply
in this connection the formula for <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> worked
out by Justice Claudio <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> in "cases not
terminated sooner."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The formula calls for fixing the award of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> without qualification and deduction to three
