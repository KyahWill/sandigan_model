				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from the order of the Court of First Instance of Manila in
its Naturalization Case No. 43024, denying the petition of Emmanuel Lai to take
his oath as a naturalized citizen of the Philippines after the probationary
period of two (2) years from the issuance of the original deci­sion of the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> in the said proceeding de­claring petitioner eligible
for naturalization.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts are not disputed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="5"><span style="">May 3,
 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Court of
First Instance of Manila, the Honorable Judge <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
M. Vasquez, presid­ing, rendered a decision in the above-mentioned case,
declaring petitioner-appellant eligible for naturaliza­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A little more than two (2) years thereafter,
after the lapse of the probationary period provided for by Re­public Act 530,
petitioner filed the petition aforesaid for purposes of showing that he was
ready and qualified to take his oath of allegiance to the Republic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was opposed by the Solicitor General on
the grounds, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, (1) that petitioner failed
to apply or register his daughter, <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> Lai,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> "within thirty days after the birth of
the child", in violation of the "regulations governing registration
of aliens in accordance with the Alien Registration Act of 1950"; and (2)
that petitioner "failed to allege in his petition all his previous ad­dresses
and residences", in violation of Section 7 of the Naturalization Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due hearing, the trial court, the
Honorable Judge Jose </span><span style="">N. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Leuterio</span></span><span style="">, then presiding, is­sued the order of
October 17, 1963 appealed from, denying appellants petition to take his oath on
the ground that his failure to register his daughter within thirty days from
the birth of the child was a violation of government promulgated rules and
regulations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner moved for
reconsideration of the order but the same was denied by the trial court in its
subsequent order of </span><st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="1"><span style="">January 7, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">; hence, the instant appeal from said orders.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appeal is completely
devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of
established precedents, Judge <span class="SpellE">Leuterio</span> </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">per­fectly right in sustaining the Solicitor Generals oppo­sition to
petitioner-appellant's motion to take his oath </span>as a naturalized
citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has ruled beginning
way back in 1960, that in naturalization cases the failure of a petitioner to
comply with his obligation to register his wife and children with the Bureau of
Immigration as required by the Alien Registration Act, constitutes <u>fail­ure
to conduct himself in a proper and irreproachable man­ner in his relation with
our Government</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
a ground suf­ficient for the dismissal or disapproval of his petition for
naturalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That rule has been
reiterated' in subsequent cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">We </span>concede that in the earlier
case<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">heavily relied upon by herein
appellant, this Court held that failure of an applicant for naturalization to regis­ter
his wife and children with the Immigration Office is not of such gravity as to
disallow his petition, but this Court has likewise pointed out that such
earlier view had been abandoned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
in Koa <span class="SpellE">Heng</span> vs. Republic, <u>supra</u>, it was so
declared to dispel any further doubt on this point, <span class="SpellE">viz</span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner also admits that at least one of his seven
children is not registered, pursuant to the Alien Registration Act, with the
Bureau of Immigration ..... <span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> however invokes <span class="SpellE">Chay</span> Guan Tan vs. Re­public, L-9682, <st1:date year="1957" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1957</st1:date>, to the effect that failure of an
appli­cant to register his wife and child with the immigration Office, as
aliens, is not of such gravity as to disallow his petition for naturaliza­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to state that at the time petitioner,
applied for natu­ralization <u>this Court has subsequently ruled that such
failure to register constitutes reproachable and improper conduct which
precludes naturalization</u> (Co vs. Republic, L-12150, May 26, 1960;
reiterated in Chung Hong vs. Republic, L-17391, November 29, 1962)."

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner-appellant
would try to distinguish his case from the above-cited precedents in the
circumstance that while there, this Court dealt with the <u>failure to register
in violation of law</u>, Republic Act 562, other­</span>wise known as the Alien
Registration Act of 1950; here, there is merely a case of "late
registration of a newly <span style="">born
child" which, appellant argues, is <u>a minor infraction of an
implementing regulation of the Commissioner of Immigration</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Overlooked by appellant is the fact that his
having registered his daughter tardily on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="26" month="4"><span style="">April 26, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>or even <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1963</st1:date>, as he contends, involved not only a
violation of immigration regulations but the Alien Registration Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rules and regulations of the Government vio­lated by him read
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Article 1 - PERSONS REQUIRED TO REGISTER AND FINGER-PRINTED.-<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

and who will remain in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That is not all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he registered his daughter for the first
time only on April or March of 1963, </span>the inevitable conclusion is that
he did not report for her within the first sixty days of January 1962 and, if
in fact, the registration was April, again within the same period in 1963.</p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">cannot be validly said
then that appellant commit­ted only a minor infraction of a regulation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In truth, he violated the Alien Registration
Act in two ways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span>is <span style="">obvious that such violations constitute
improper and re­proachable conduct in his relation with the Government, which
renders him disqualified to be a naturalized citizen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With this view <span class="GramE">We</span> take, this case should write finis to any further move of
appellant to be a naturalized citi­</span><span style="">zen
</span><span style="">of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">, his infirmity above-pointed be­ing
incurable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, We find it
unnecessary to </span>make any express finding as regards the other ground
inter­posed by the Solicitor General in his opposition - that petitioner also
failed to allege <span style="">in </span>his petition
all his previous addresses and residences - which, albeit fatal, is technical
and curable in character.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, We find herein petitioner-appellant not
qualified to be a naturalized citizen of the Philippines and the denial of his petition
