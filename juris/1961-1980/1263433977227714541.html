evening of <st1:date year="1968" day="21" month="12">Saturday, December 21,
 1968</st1:date>, Emilio <span class="SpellE">Royo</span>, a
thirty-three-year-old married man, a "helper" by occupation, was
stabbed inside a residence on <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Maximo</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>, near the <st1:place><st1:placetype>church</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">ni</span></span> <span class="SpellE">Cristo</span>,
<span style="">squatter's </span>area, <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> Line, Barrio Olympia, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He died at the Philippine General Hospital at
nine-fifty <span style="">on that same night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">He sustained fifteen stab wounds located on the chest, shoulder,
back, head, and left arm, some of which injured his lungs, diaphragm and
stomach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also suffered a contusion on
the forehead and abrasions on the head and on the <span class="SpellE">infraclavicular</span>
and <span class="SpellE">infrascapular</span> regions.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the fact that nine wounds could have been caused by a
double-bladed weapon and that the other <span style="">six
</span>wounds were oval-shaped, the medico-legal officer concluded that they
were caused by two weapons, a double-edged knife and an ice pick, and that
there was more than one assailant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution presented only one eyewitness, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Dineros</span>, a twenty-four-year-old driver, to prove that
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Cananowa</span> stabbed <span class="SpellE">Royo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dineros</span> testified
briefly that in the evening in question, while he and Martin <span class="SpellE">Geroda</span> were drinking in the kitchen of his residence on <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, he heard <span class="SpellE">Royo</span> shouting the name "<span class="SpellE">Emerita</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shout came from the house which was the
second from the house of <span class="SpellE">Dineros</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On hearing that shout, <span class="SpellE">Dineros</span>
climbed the wall and he saw his neighbor, <span class="SpellE">Royo</span>, held
by two persons and being stabbed by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Cananowa</span>
who was facing <span class="SpellE">Dineros</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The place was near a lighted electric
post.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dineros</span>
knows Francisco because they were both drivers and they often met at the <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> gas station.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He did not know Francisco's companions because their backs were turned
to him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Dineros</span>' testimony was a confirmation
of his sworn statement to the police which reads:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Emerita</span> <span class="SpellE">Royo</span>
testified that her brother Emilio resided with her but his wife, <span class="SpellE">Gorgonia</span> Castillo, was staying in the house of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Cananowa</span> with her friend, the sister of Francisco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That arrangement was resorted to because
Emilio and his wife had not been able to rent a house after they were evicted
from the house where they resided (No. 11, page 4, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Emerita</span> further testified that Rosario
Robles, the wife of Francisco, suspected Emilio of having thrown a stone at
Francisco's house and that the two men who held <span class="SpellE">Royo</span>
were <span class="SpellE">Zosimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Palacio</span> and
Jesus <span class="SpellE">Cananowa</span>, the nephew of Francisco who later
went to <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> (18 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> Marsh
10, 1969).</p>

<p class="BODY">Francisco <span class="SpellE">Cananowa</span>, a
twenty-seven-year-old driver, relied on an alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified that at the time the stabbing
occurred he was working in <st1:address><st1:street><span class="SpellE">Infanta</span>
  Street</st1:street>, <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:city></st1:address>,
driving a truck and delivering ice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
went home at <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">ten o'clock</st1:time> or <span style="">after the stabbing had been consummated and
he found his nephew, Jesus, in the house with a wound in his abdomen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jesus told Francisco that he was stabbed by <span class="SpellE">Royo</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Francisco allegedly instructed his sister, <span class="SpellE">Sinforosa</span>,
to bring Jesus to the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He (Francisco)
remained at home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not know
anything about <span class="SpellE">Royo's</span> death.</p>

<p class="BODY">The police blotter and the police report (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
1 and 2) offered in evidence by the defense disclose different motives for the
killing of <span class="SpellE">Royo</span> supposedly by <u>Jesus <span class="SpellE">Cananowa</span></u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">According to Exhibit 1, at nine-thirty on that night of <st1:date year="1968" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1968</st1:date>, the stabbing was
reported to the police and entered in the police blotter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was recorded therein that <u>Jesus</u> <span class="SpellE">Cananowa</span>, a twenty-seven-year-old married man, a laborer,
residing at the squatter's area, <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> Line, Barrio
Olympia, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
was stabbed by Emilio <span class="SpellE">Royo</span> and was brought to the
Philippine General Hospital (p. 147, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the police report made at ten-forty-five on
that same night shows that <u>Jesus</u> <span class="SpellE">Cananowa</span> was
brought to the emergency room of the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although wounded in the abdomen, Jesus managed to tell a policeman that
he, <span class="SpellE">Royo</span> and one <span class="SpellE">Iso</span> had a
contract to install a pump for P250; that <span class="SpellE">Royo</span>
received that amount and pocketed it; that <span class="SpellE">Royo's</span>
concubine, <span class="SpellE">Gorgonia</span> Castillo, separated from him and
lived with <u>Jesus</u>; that <span class="SpellE">Royo</span> and one <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Basas</span> (<span class="SpellE">Basa</span>) went to the house of Jesus and challenged him to a
fight and that it was only when he (Jesus) could not endure <span class="SpellE">Royo's</span>
taunts anymore that he went down from his house and fought <span class="SpellE">Royo</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2, page 148, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the same report, it was stated that "the fatal weapon and
the weapon used by Jesus" <span class="SpellE">Cananowa</span>, were
recovered by the police from his aunt, <span class="SpellE">Sinforosa</span> <span class="SpellE">Cananowa</span>, the sister of Francisco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(They were not presented in evidence).</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court did not give credence to the alibi of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Cananowa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
convicted him of murder, sentenced him to death and ordered him to pay an
indemnity of twelve thousand pesos to the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Royo</span>
(Criminal Case No. 126).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Francisco did
not appeal from that decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case
was elevated to this Court for review of the death sentence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Francisco's counsel assails the finding of the trial court that
he admitted in his testimony that he stabbed and killed <span class="SpellE">Royo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General concedes that that con<span style="">clusion of the trial court is erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The truth is that Francisco did not make any
such admission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">What may be gleaned from his testimony and the testimony of his
sister, <span class="SpellE">Sinforosa</span>, is that their nephew, Jesus, had a
fight with <span class="SpellE">Royo</span> and in the course of the fight <span class="SpellE">Royo</span> sustained the stab wounds which caused his death.</p>

<p class="BODY">But that error of the trial court does not warrant the reversal
of the judgment of conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Dineros</span> is sufficient proof as to the
complicity of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Cananowa</span> in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Royo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Francisco's counsel contends that the trial court erred in
appreciating the aggravating circumstances of treachery and abuse of
superiority and in not convicting him of homicide only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Treachery was the only aggravating
circumstance alleged in the information.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the complaint for murder filed by the police in the municipal court,
treachery was not alleged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was
alleged was employment of means to weaken the defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as abuse of superiority was not alleged in the
information, it cannot be regarded as qualifying in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be appreciated as a generic
aggravating circumstance since there were three assailants.</p>

<p class="BODY">Treachery cannot likewise be considered as aggravating because
the sole prosecution eyewitness did not see the com­mencement of the assault on
the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no evidence in the
record as to how the stabbing started.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General cites the ruling in <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.
  S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> vs. <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>
and <span class="SpellE">Gamit</span>, 40 Phil. 876 that there was treachery in a
case where the appellant held the victim from behind while the other accused
assaulted him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That case is different
from the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <st1:city><st1:place><u>Valdez</u></st1:place></st1:city>
case, two witnesses testified as to the inception of the assault on the
victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They declared that the two
assailants followed the victim and that one assailant, without saying a word,
held the victim from behind and, while in that position, the other assailant
stabbed the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the record does not show how the assault on <span class="SpellE">Royo</span> began.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
one of the supposed assailants, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Cananowa</span>,
claimed that he was wounded by <span class="SpellE">Royo</span>, the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That circumstance may signify that there was
no surprise attack on <span class="SpellE">Royo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the killing of <span class="SpellE">Royo</span> should be
regarded as homicide only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial
court did not err in disbelieving the alibi of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Cananowa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was sufficiently identified by <span class="SpellE">Dineros</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His counsel
was not able to impeach the credi­bility of <span class="SpellE">Dineros</span>,
his neighbor and acquaintance.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of conviction is affirmed but the
death <span class="GramE">sentence</span> is set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Francisco <span class="SpellE">Cananowa</span>
is convicted of homicide with the aggravating circumstance of abuse of
superiority and without any mitigating circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of
twelve (12) years <span style="">of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u>, as minimum, to eighteen (18)
years of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal,</u> as maximum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The indemnity of twelve thousand pesos is
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs <u>de</u>
