				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Adela</span> <span class="SpellE">Ongsiaco</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Clemeña</span> instituted,
on <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="1">29 January 1965</st1:date>, Special
Proceeding No. 59712 in the Court of First Instance of Manila for the
settlement of the estate of the late <span class="SpellE">Engracio</span> <span class="SpellE">Clemeña</span>, and being the surviving consort, was appointed
Special <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span> on 2 February; she qualified
and was issued letters of administration.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing of the aforesaid petition, respondent Agustin <span class="SpellE">Engracio</span> <span class="SpellE">Clemeña</span>, claiming to be
decedent's illegitimate (not natural) child, sub­mitted written opposition,
alleging wrong venue, because at his death th<span style="">e</span> decedent was a resident of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The intervention of Agustin was objected to
by the <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span> on the ground that <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> had no legal interest, not having been recognized
by the decedent, either voluntarily or compul­sorily; that said Agustin's
action to establish his illegitimate paternity was already barred, since, by <span style="">his own </span>admission, he was born on 28
August 1928, and was, therefore, past the age of majority when the alleged
father died on 26 September 1964; that no action to establish illegitimate <span class="SpellE">filiation</span> was receivable after the death of the alleged
illegitimate progenitor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge Geronimo, however, instead of dismissing the
opposition, required <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> to produce evidence of
his claimed <span class="SpellE">filiation</span>, over the objection of
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After three witnesses had testified, the <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span> moved for suspension of the hearing and
objected to further reception of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court overruled the ob­jection, on the ground of absence of settled
jurisprudence on whether il­legitimate not natural paternity may be
investigated after the death of the alleged parent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Reconsideration having been denied, the <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span>
applied to this Court for writs of certiorari, prohibition, and preliminary
injunction, on the ground of abuse of discretion amounting to lack of
jurisdiction for subjecting the deceased's legitimate family to scandal and
social humiliation.<span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The petition was given due course.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue squarely posed in the present case is whether or not an
alleged illegitimate child not natural (vulgarly designated as
"spurious") may still bring an action or proceeding in court for the
purpose of establishing his illegitimate paternity even after the death of the
person he claims to have been his father, when on the date of such death the
claimant is already over 21 years of age.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
in its Article 285, expressly prescribes that "the action for the
recognition of natural children may be brought only <u>duri<span style="">ng the lifetime</span></u><span style=""> of </span>the presumed parents", unless
<span style="">(a) </span>the latter have died during
the claimant's minority or (b) after the death of the parents a hitherto
unknown document recognizing the child is discovered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But with regard to issue that is illegitimate
but <u>not</u> <u>natural</u> (i.e., whose parents could not have married each
other at the time of the child's conception), the Civil Code, although
providing (Article 289) that the investigation of their paternity is permitted
in the circumstances specified for <span style="">illegitimate
natural children, </span>is, <span style="">nevertheless,
silent on the duration of the action that may be brought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners-appellants urge that the action for the
declaration of the paternity of illegitimate children not natural is subject to
the limitation fixed by Article 285, and can not outlive the presumed father,
when the child is of age on the date of the parents' demise.</p>

<p class="BODY">While there has been heretofore no square pronouncement by this
Court on this issue (other than two contradictory <u>obiter</u> <u>dicta</u> in
Reyes, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Zuzuarregui</span> (1957) 102 Phil. 346
and in Barleys vs. Ponce <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>, G.R. No. L-12894,<span style=""> </span>September 30, 1960), we are of the
opinion, after mature deliberation, that<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>reason and history support the thesis of the appellants that the action
to establish paternity of spurious children (illegitimates not natural) should
be at least subject to the same limitations prescribed by law to actions by
natural illegitimate children seeking compulsory recognition (Art. 285, Civil
Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main reasons for this are the
following:</p>

<p class="NUM">(a) As pointed out in the <span class="SpellE">Barles</span> vs.
Ponce <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span> case, both actions are substantially
identical in nature and purpose:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>both
seek to establish a generation link between the claimant and the alleged
parent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While one action is designated
as one for compulsory acknowledgment while the other is labeled for declarations
of paternity, the distinction is purely nominal, for the purpose in either case
is to have the Court investigate and determine if plaintiff is <u>in</u> <u>fact</u>
the child of the defendant, provided any of the circumstances required by
Articles 283 and 284 are present (See Article 289).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if the nature and basis of the two
actions are identical, there is no cogent reason why the same time limit should
not apply to both, there being no express legal provision to the contrary.</p>

<p class="NUM">(b) The considerations of fairness and justice that underlie the
time limit fixed in Article 285 of the Civil Code for actions seeking
compulsory acknowledgment of natural children are fully applicable, if not
more, to <span style="">actions to </span>investigate
and declare the paternity of illegitimate children that are not natural.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motive that led the <span style="">codifiers to
restrict </span>the period for bringing actions <span style="">for </span>compulsory recognition of natural children were stated by
this Court, in Serrano vs. Aragon, 22 Phil. 18, to be as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“-----------------------.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The writers of the code no doubt had in mind that there would arise
instances where certain illegitimate children, on account of the strong
temptation due to the large estates left by deceased persons, would attempt to
establish<span style="">
that </span>they were natural children of such persons in order to get part of
the property; and furthermore, they considered that it is nothing but just and
right that alleged parents should have a personal opportunity to be heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was for these reasons and others equally
as well founded that article 137 was enacted."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Surely it can not be argued that while it is just and right that
the natural parent should have a personal opportunity to be heard and explain
his side, yet it would be neither just nor right that the parent of an illegitimate
child not natural should be accorded a similar opportunity to be heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Illegitimate paternity, natural or not
natural, is not paraded for every one to <span style="">see; </span>but it is normally enshrouded in
secrecy, and kept hidden from the members of the legitimate family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter are not in a position to explain
or contradict the circumstances surrounding the procreation of the illegitimate
progeny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To inquire into those circumstances
after the parent has died, when he or she alone has full knowledge thereof,
when no one else can fully prove the truth or falsity of the alleged <span class="SpellE">filiation</span> of a claimant, is to penalize unnecessarily the
legitimate family that constitutes one of the foundation blocks of society.</p>

<p class="NUM">(c) Nor can it be denied that by allowing the one who claims
illegitimate <span class="SpellE">filiation</span> to wait for the death of the
putative parent, when he had opportunity to confront the latter while alive, is
to facilitate, if not encourage, blackmailing suits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as illegitimate not natural paternity
presupposes either adultery (<span class="SpellE">concubinage</span>) or incest
or murder<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>,
the magnitude of the threatened scandal is a weapon that becomes more difficult
to resist for the legitimate family that desires to protect the memory of the
deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">The very liberality of the present Civil Code, that admits <u>"any</u>
evidence <span style="">or proof that </span>the
defendant is his father" (Article 283, No. 4), should caution against
indiscriminating admission of <u>post</u> <u>mortem </u>actions to investigate <u>de</u>
<u>facto</u> paternity of illegitimate children.</p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">(d) </span>Like its
predecessor, the Spanish Code of 1889, the new Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> </span>establishes a gradation in the rights
of children according <span style="">to the
circumstances that surround their conception.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>The greatest<span style=""> sum </span>of
rights corresponds to the legitimates, i.e., those conceived in <span style="">valid </span>matrimony; while of the <span style="">illegitimates, </span>those that are natural
(actually or <span style="">by </span>fiction) enjoy <span style="">greater rights than the illegitimates not
natural </span>(adulterous <span style="">or </span>incestuous).</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">successional</span></span><span style=""> rights
</span>of the three classes of children vary in the proportions 10:5:4, since
the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span> of the acknowledged natural children is
merely one half of that of the legitimates; while the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span>
of an illegitimate child not natural is four fifths (4/5ths) of that of an
acknowledged natural child (Article 895), i.e., it is only 2/5ths as large <span style="">as </span>the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span>
a legitimate child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These <span style="">proportions are </span>preserved even in
intestate succession (Article 983).</p>

<p class="BODY">And this gradation is followed in other rights as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right of action to claim legitimacy lasts
during the whole lifetime of the child and can be brought <span style="">against </span>the presumed parents, if <span style="">alive, and against their heirs </span>if the
parents are no longer living (Article 268); while the action to compel acknowledgment
of an illegitimate natural child may be brought only during the lifetime of the
presumed parents and therefore not against the parent's heirs, except in two
cases:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">(1) where </span>the parent has died during the minority of the child,
or (2) when a hitherto unknown document of <span style="">recognition is </span>discovered after the parent's death (Article
285).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, while an action to
claim legitimacy may exceptionally pass to the heirs of the child claimant (as
when he dies insane or still a minor) (Article 268), the right to compel
recognition never passes to the heirs of the natural child (<span class="SpellE">Conde</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Abaya</span>, 13 Phil. 249).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, as between the two classes of illegitimates,
only those that are natural can be elevated to the category of legitimates by
the process of <span class="SpellE">legitimation</span>; while those that are not
natural are denied this improvement of their condition (Article 269).</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, to hold with the court below that an illegitimate child not
natural, already over 21 years of age at the death of its alleged parent, may
still <span class="SpellE">implead</span> the latter's legal <span style="">heirs or representatives </span>to obtain a
declaration that the deceased is his progenitor is certainly to upset the
carefully categorized scheme of rights ordained by the Civil Code for the
various classes of children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because
such a holding would not only place the spurious child on a more advantageous
position <span class="SpellE"><span style="">vis-a-vis</span></span><span style=""> </span>the illegitimate but natural child,
but actually place him on an equal <span style="">footing
with legitimates, whose paternity suits </span>last <span style="">as </span>long as they live; and this advantage would be granted to the
illegitimates not natural children on no other basis than the mere <u>silence</u>
of the Code, when the right of le<span style="">gitimate
sons and daughters to file paternity suits despite the death of their </span>progenitors
had to be expressly conferred by Article 268.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In our opinion, the ruling under appeal goes against the spirit, the
system, and the logic of the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">In resume, we rule that the action of an illegitimate child, not
natural, to <span style="">secure a judicial
investigation and declaration of his paternity may </span>not be <span style="">instituted beyond the time limits prescribed
by Article 285 of the Civil </span>Code of the <span style="">Philippines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the ruling of the Court of First
Instance of Manila admitting evidence of the paternity of the private
respondent, over and against the objections of the legal representative of the
deceased alleged parent, <span style="">is in </span>grave
abuse of discretion, and is hereby set aside; hence, said respondent must be
declared without legal interest in the estate of the de­cedent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records of the case are ordered remanded
to the court of origin for further proceedings conformably to this
opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
