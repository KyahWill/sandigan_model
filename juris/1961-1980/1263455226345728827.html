Margarito Bolabog, Paquito Herandoy and Justo Constantino were charged with
murder in the Court of First Instance of Surigao del Norte (Criminal Case No.
3789).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due trial upon a plea of
not guilty the court found Angelito Guardo, Catalino and Maxiliano Gipal guilty
as charged, but acquitted the three other defendants for in足sufficiency of
evidence, the dispositive portion of the de足cision being as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the court finds the accused
Angelito Guardo, Catalino Gipal and Maxiliano Gipal guilty beyond reasonable
doubt of the crime charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Angelito
Guardo having appeared the <span class="GramE">most guilty</span> <span style="">is </span>hereby
sen足tenced to an imprisonment for the rest of his natural life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maxiliano Gipal to an imprison足ment of
seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and <span style="">one
(1) day to twenty (20) years; Catalino Gipal to an imprisonment of twelve (12)
years and one (1) day of reclusion temporal and all three (3) accused to
indemnify the heirs of </span>the deceased in the amount of Three Thousand (P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) Pesos in equal shares of P1,000.00 each, and to pay
the costs of the proceedings also<span style=""> </span>in
equal shares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The guilt of Justo
Constantino not having been proved beyond <span style="">all reasonable </span>doubt is hereby adjudged not guilty of the
offense and hereby acquits him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paquito
Herandoy and Margarito Bolabog are hereby declared acquitted <span style="">on reasonable doubt.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From the foregoing
decision </span>Guardo and the Gipals <span style="">interposed
the present appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The prosecution evidence
shows that </span>Maxiliano Gipal and the <span style="">deceased
Apolinario Edradan had quarrelled on several occasions prior to the fatal
incident of </span><st1:date year="1963" day="9" month="12"><span style="">December 9, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
result of one of their quarrels Maxiliano charged Apolinario with slight
physical injuries before the Justice of the Peace Court of Surigao,
Surigao.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case, however, was
dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <span style="">the evening </span><span style="">of </span><st1:date year="1963" day="9" month="12"><span style="">December 9, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, while Apolinario was taking his supper at
his mother's home in Surigao, </span>appellant Catalino Gipal, Jr., and Paquito
Herandoy arrived <span style="">to invite him - at the
instance of Maxiliano - to go with them to a place known as </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Riverside</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, to meet the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apolinario accepted their invitation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Prosecution witness
Teresita Casura testified that at about 11;00 o'clock that evening, while </span>she
was out <span style="">looking for Apolinario at the
request of the latter's </span>grandmother, she saw him <span style="">being mauled by all the defendants at Gonzales St. near appellant </span>Guardo's
store; that she <span style="">saw </span><span style="">Guardo stab the deceased with a small bolo at
the center of the breast, as a result of which the latter fell to the </span>ground
face upwards; that while <span style="">he was in this
position, Guardo stabbed him again on the breast; that he was then </span>dragged
by the <span style="">shoulders by Catalino Gipal and
Guardo to the latter's place, all of them followed by Maxiliano Gipal who was
holding a paddle; that once there, Guardo stabbed the deceased twice; that upon
witnessing all these, </span><span style="">she
immediately</span> reported the incident to the victim brother, Sabiniano
Edradan, who repaired to the scene of crime where he found his brother mortally
wounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was then taken to the
hospital where he died.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another eye-witness to the fetal incident was Can<span style="">dido </span>Ronquillo who testified that,
while standing at the corner of Gonzales end Rojas streets looking for his son,
he<span style=""> saw</span> Maxiliano Gipal hit
Apolinario Edradan with a paddle on the dorsal portion of his neck; that
thereupon, Catalino <span style="">Gipal </span>stabbed
Apolinario with a<span style=""> </span>small bolo on the right arm, followed by more bolo thrusts by <span style="">Margarito Bolabog</span> and Justo
Constantino on different parts of the victim body, after which he was dragged
to Guado's s<span style="">tore </span>where latter
mortally stabbed the deceased <span style="">twice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A post mortem </span>examination
made by Dr. Lourse H. Panaligan showed that the victim sustained numerous
wounds in different parts of the body and that his death was due to "shock
secondary to internal and external hemorrhage due stabbed <span style="">wound on the chest".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The assignment of errors made in appellants' brief assail the
sufficiency of the prosecution evidence to establish their guilt beyond
reasonable <span style="">doubt, claiming that the
trial court </span>erred: firstly, in finding that the wound suffered by <span style="">the </span>deceased Edradan on the neck was
caused by a paddle used by <span style="">Maxiliano
Gipal; secondly, in </span>finding that before said deceased <span style="">was </span>stabbed
to death, appellants rained fist blows upon him; thirdly, in finding that
Catalino Gipal stabbed the deceased on the latter's right arm; fourthly, in
giving full credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, and
lastly, <span style="">in </span>not
finding that Angelito Guardo was "the sole author of the death of the
deceased".</p>

<p class="BODY">We find all <span style="">the above
contentions to </span>be not well founded.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the lower <span style="">court held,
the motive for </span>the killing of the <span style="">deceased
</span>Apo<span style="">linario Edradan </span>was
well established because the <span style="">prosecution
evidence - practically uncontradicted </span>is to the <span style="">effect that before </span>he was fatally assaulted there <span style="">had been several quarrels between him and
Maxiliano Gipal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The</span> latter must <span style="">have felt that he </span>was <span style="">the aggrieved party because he took Edradan
to court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This feeling must have </span><span style="">been </span><span style="">aggravated </span>by <span style="">the </span>fact
that the case was dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the appellants (and their co-accused in the lower court who
were acquitted) had conspired together, to kill Edredan is shown by the fact
that upon direction of Maxillano his brother Catalino and Paquito Herandoy, a
laborer working in a launch belonging to the former, invited Edradan to go with
them for the purpose of meeting Maxiliano at a place known as Riverside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But apparently even before reaching that
place, the Gipal brothers, Angelito Guardo and other persons assaulted him with
fist blows first and ended up by attacking him with a paddle and bladed
weapons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the testimony of
the eye witnesses mentioned heretofore, Guardo inflicted upon Edradan two
mortal stab wounds; Maxiliano Gipal hit him with a paddle on the neck, while
Catalino Gipal also stabbed him with a small bolo on the right arm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While we have noticed some inconsistencies
between their respective <span class="GramE">testimony</span>, we do not consider
them sufficient to weaken the prosecution's case, much less to show bias and
improper motives on the part of said two eye witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that Angelito Guardo admits thee he was the only one <span class="GramE">who</span> killed Edradan is clearly a mere attempt to save his
co-appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is furthermore belied
by the fact that the deceased suffered multiple wounds caused by different
weapons.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the evidence of record, it is clear that the crime
committed by appellants was that of murder, qualified by treachery, and
aggravated by nocturnity and the use of superior strength.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The imposable penalty, therefore, is
reclusion temporal in its maximum period, to death, and as the three appellants
have common responsibility because of the clear evidence of conspiracy, they
should suffer the same penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
for lack of the necessary number of votes to impose the same, each one of the
appellants is hereby sentenced to reclusion perpetua.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>THUS</b> <b>MODIFIED</b>, the appealed decision is affirmed in
all other respects.</p>
