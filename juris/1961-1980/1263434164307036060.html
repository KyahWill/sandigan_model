Article 171, paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code which reads:</p>

follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In accordance with the provisions of the Revised Election
Code, the Court presided over by the then Honorable Judge Geronimo <span class="SpellE">Marave</span>, conducted the preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Honorable Judge Geronimo <span class="SpellE">Marave</span>, then presiding Judge issued an order requiring

examination.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“For several times the case was set for arraignment and trial and
were also postponed for several times, until on September 27, 1962, when this
Court in going over the Record, dis­covered that the preliminary investigation
is not terminated and that the Record does not show any finding <span style="">by </span>the Court that the accused is
probably guilty of the crime charged and that no warrant of arrest for the
accused was issued although the Record shows that said accused filed and
perfected a <span class="SpellE">bailbond</span> for his provisional
liberty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By this discovery, the
Presiding Judge addressed and forwarded a com­munication to the Prosecuting
Fiscal informing the latter that the preliminary investigation has not as yet
been terminated and that some­thing must be done by his office to effect the
termination of the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In answer to
the said communication, the Prosecuting Fiscal filed a manifestation dated
October 3, 1962, stating among other things, that in compliance with the order
of the Court dated April 27, 1962, appearing on pages 22, 23 and 24 of the
Record, the documentary exhibits for expert examination were forwarded by him
to the NBI for examina­tion and comparison and that the laboratory examination
by the NBI was received by him on June 4, 1962, and by that time the then
Honorable Judge Geronimo <span class="SpellE">Marave</span> was no longer the
District Judge of <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>, having assumed the position
of District Judge of <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, it <span style="">is </span>stated that to obviate legal technicalities he is ready and
willing, either to submit his evidence anew before this Court for preliminary
investigation any date the Court may deem it necessary to <span style="">do so or </span>submit the transcript of the
stenographic notes of the preliminary investigation and the findings of the NBI
for the purpose of establishing probable cause.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In said manifestation, the Prosecuting Fiscal prayed that further
proceedings in conjunction with the preliminary investigation be set for <st1:date year="1962" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1962</st1:date>, or any date prior
thereto.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Before </span>this
Court could set the continua­tion of the Preliminary Inv<span style="">e</span>stigation as prayed for by the Prosecuting Fiscal, he filed an <span class="SpellE">ex­parte</span> motion to dismiss, appearing on pages 81 to 83 of

ELECTIONS WHEN IN FACTS HE DID NOT SO PARTICIPATE OR VOTE, 'CONSTITUTE A
VIOLATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE REVISED ELECTION CODE AND PUNISHABLE UNDER
THE SAME.' "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is the appellant's
contention that the facts alleged in the information in question do not
constitute an election offense punishable under the Revised Election Code, but
one clearly and expressly punishable under the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To test the validity of this view, pertinent
provisions in both codes should be cited and quoted for ready reference.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Article 10 of the Revised
Penal Code provides as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Article 10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- <u>Offense
not subject to the provisions of this Code</u>. - Offenses which are or in the
future may be punish­able under special laws are not subject to the provisions
of this Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Code shall be
supplementary to such laws, unless the latter should specially provide the
contrary."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">There
can be no question that under the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
provision, the election law is a special law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The provision of said law pertinent hereto, reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<u>Common crimes</u>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- Acts and omissions relative to elections not punishable under this
Code but which constitute common crimes shall be punished as provided in the
penal laws applicable thereto." (Sec. 186, Revised Election Code).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing provision of the election code, what would be
the decisive inquiry for the purpose of the instant appeal is whether the acts
alleged <span style="">in </span>the information are
prohibited and punished by the electoral code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Solicitor General's submission is that they are not so
punishable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>What may be observed with
relevance in regard to the pertinent inquiry, as above indicated, is that there
is, at most, only an implied prohibition against the act ascribed to the
accused -- that of representing himself as one, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ambiting</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Sahibil</span>, a registered voter, and
voting in the latter's name, signing and <span class="SpellE">thumbmarking</span>
the proper election documents; as to make it appear falsely that it was <span class="SpellE">Ambiting</span> <span class="SpellE">Sahibil</span> who actually
voted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no provision in the
Revised Election Code that expressly and directly prohibits the act of voting
in place of another registered voter as if that voter had himself voted in
person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As minutely analyzed by the
Solicitor General, the pertinent provision of the Revised Election Code (Sec.
138 in relation to Sec. 134 to 137 and Section 139) do not include the acts
with which the accused has been charged (pp. 13-16, Appellant's Brief).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus the Solicitor General observed:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 138.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The
first sentence of the first paragraph is addressed to any voter or watcher, who
is granted the right to challenge any person offering to vote who is not regis­tered
in the list or for using the name of another.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The second sentence of the same paragraph <span style="">is </span>directed to the board of inspectors which is enjoined to take
the oath of the challenged voter or otherwise satisfy itself as to the truth of
the ground of the challenge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in
this paragraph may be said to be a directive to the person challenged to do or
not to do a certain act as to be penalized or punished under this section.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The second paragraph is an instruction to the board to the effect
that for the purpose of receiving and counting the vote, it should demand from
the person challenged his voter's affidavit or a sworn statement identifying
him, which statement shall be attached to the minutes to be made by the poll
clerk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like the first paragraph, the
second paragraph does not contain any prohibition against the doing or not
doing of a certain act by a person desiring to vote for or voting for another,</blockquote>

<blockquote>Otherwise stated, there is no provision in Section 138 making the
acts alleged <span style="">in </span>the information
criminal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SECTION 134.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The
first sentence speaks of what a voter should do to obtain a ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of the acts required of him is made
unlawful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rest of the section deals
with the correlative duties of the inspectors and the poll clerk.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SECTION 135:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- This
section prescribes the manner of preparing the ballots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The acts which are expressly made unlawful
are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>preparing the ballots outside the
voting booth; exhibiting the contents of the ballots to any person; erasing any
printing from the ballots; intentionally tearing or defacing the ballots;
putting on the ballots any distinguishing mark; using carbon paper, paraffin
paper, or other means for making a copy of the bal­lot; and making use of any
other means to identify the vote of the voter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>None of the acts alleged in the information falls under any of these
categories.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SECTION 136:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The
first sentence of the section refers to the surrender by a voter of a voter of
a soiled or defaced ballot to the inspector or poll clerk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rest of the provision is addressed to board
of inspectors including the poll clerk.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>None of the acts alleged in the information is mentioned.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SECTION 137:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Insofar
as a voter is concerned, this section states that after his ballot is filled,
he shall stamp his thumb-mark on the corresponding coupon <span style="">and </span>deliver the folded ballot to the
inspector or poll clerk from whom he received it; that he shall affix his
signature and the imprint of the thumb of his right hand in the copy of the
registry list in the column intended for the purpose, after which he shall
depart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of these relates to the
acts charged in the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
rest of the section refers to the duties of the election inspectors or poll
clerk.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SECTION 139:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The
first sentence gives a voter, candidate, or watcher, on the ground of corrupt
practices, the right to challenge any voter offer­ing to vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second sentence enumerates what the
challenged voter should state under oath - namely, that he has neither received
nor expects to receive, nor has paid, offered or promised to pay, nor has
contributed, offered or promised to contribute money or anything of value as
consider­ation for his vote or for the vote of another; that he has not made or
received any promise to influence the giving or withholding of any such vote;
and that he neither has made any bet nor is interested directly or <span style="">indirectly in any </span>bet which depends
upon the result of the election - so that the challenge will be dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The coverage of this section does not include
the acts of which appellant stands accused."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The prevailing doctrines, as enunciated by this Court, support
the <span style="">stand </span>of the Solicitor
General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus -</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</span><span class="SpellE">x</span> an act will not be held to be a criminal act
unless the statute clearly and <span class="SpellE">unmistakenly</span> makes it <span style="">so. (</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> </span>vs. Olsen, et. al., 36 Phil. 395,
400.)"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the Philippine Islands there exist no crimes such as are
known in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region> as
common law crimes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No act constitutes a
crime here unless it is made so by law. (<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. <st1:city><st1:place>Taylor</st1:place></st1:city>, 28 Phil. 599, 604;
Italics supplied.)" (Page 16, Brief.)'</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The rule of strict construction which should apply in the
interpretation of criminal statutes, likewise, strengthens the position of the
Solicitor General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus -</p>

<blockquote>"Criminal statutes are to be strictly construed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No persons should be brought within their
terms who is <u>not clearly within them</u>, nor should any act be pronounced
criminal which is not clearly made so. (<st1:country-region><st1:place>U. S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos, 36 Phil. 243, 246; Italics
supplied.)"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under the rule of strict construction, such statutes <u>will
not be enlarged by impli­cation</u> or intendment beyond the fair meaning of
the language used and will not be held to include other offenses and persons
than those which are <u>clearly described and provided for</u>, although the
court may think the legislature should have made them more comprehensive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(59 C.J., 1115-1117; Italics supplied.)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We are, therefore, constrained to hold that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
was in error in dismissing Criminal Case No. 264 which charges the accused with
an act clearly and expressly punishable under Article 171, paragraph 2 of the
Revised Penal Code, but not punished with similar clarity and expli­citness, as
is legally required in all criminal prosecutions, under the Revised Election
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So much so, that had Criminal Case
No. 2597 proceeded up to the filing in court of the information of an election
offense after the preliminary investigation, the same could have been properly
dismissed as not charging an offense expressly punishable under the Revised
Election Code, but one which, in accordance with Section 186 of the said Code
quoted earlier above, should be punished as provided in other penal laws
applicable thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">Incidentally, it should not matter whether, treated as a common
crime, not as an electoral offense, as the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
section would lay down the distinction between the two offenses, the penalty
imposed by the penal law other than the election statute for the offense
charged is heavier or lighter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court
<u>a</u> <u>quo</u> seems to have considered <span style="">this </span>fact of legal con­sequence as to prompt it to dismiss the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is import­ant is that the
violation is not left unpunished where, as in the present case, there is a law
clearly and explicitly punish<span style="">ing the
act, the Revised Penal Code which should, accordingly, be enforced and applied
because the provision of the Revised Election Code is, to say the least,
unclear and ambiguous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
provision of Section 186 of the Revised Election Code is obviously intended to
prevent any law violator, whether his motivation is solely to pervert the electoral
process, from escaping the punishment imposed by statute for the act he has
committed, for which the election law may have failed to provide, in a clear
and explicit way, not by mere impli­cation, appropriate punishment.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be well to note that in comparing the two <span class="SpellE">informations</span> repeatedly referred to herein, the respondent
court considered "insignificant" the difference that the first
information mentions the provision of the Revised Election Code and the Revised
Penal Code as having been violated, while the second information specifies an
article of the Revised Penal Code, as the law violated (page 8, Order, Appendix
A to Appellant's Brief).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent
court must have had in mind the well-settled rule that <span style="">not </span>the specification of the provision of law violated, but the
actual recital of the facts in the complaint or information that determines the
real nature of the offense charged (<span class="SpellE">Matilde</span>, Jr. vs. <span class="SpellE">Jabson</span>, 68 SCRA 456; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Arnault</span>,
92 Phil. 252).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This rule should have at
least had a deterrent effect against the dismissal of the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may also be pertinent to observe that the same presiding
judge, Hon. <span class="SpellE">Felino</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Abalos</span>,
who dismissed the information in Criminal Case No. 2597 on motion of the prose­cuting
fiscal in the latter's desire to file another inform­ation charging violation
of Article 171, paragraph (2) of the Revised Penal Code, found the motion to
dismiss filed by the fiscal "in order" (p. 85, Record, Criminal Case
No. 2597).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore, hard to see
