<p>This is a petition filed by Candida Piano for certiorari to review the decision of the court of Appeals, affirming the order of the CFI of Leyte in Civil Case No. R-608 entitled "Generoso Cayanong &amp; Regalado Bellones, plaintiffs-appellees versus Candida Piano, defendant-appellant, with Francisco P. Pilapil, oppositor-appelle (CA-G. R. No. 15831-R).</p><p>The facts are stated in the decision of the Court of Appeals as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is an appeal from the order of the Court of First Instance of Leyte 
dated Oct. 22, 1954, denying the defendant-appellant the right to redeeni the 
property under litigation. </p>
<p>"On March 17, 1952, the plaintiffs commenced an action to foreclose a 
Mortgage executed by the defendant in favor of the plaintiffs upon a parcel of 
land situated at sitio Ipil, Margen, Ormoc City.</p>
<p>"On July 29, 1952, the parties-litigant submitted a compromise agreement on 
the strength of which the trial judge rendered the following decision: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Los demandantes y la demandaba ban sonetido la siguiente estipulacion: </p>
<p>" 'Come now, the undersigned plaintiffs and defendant of the above entitled 
case and to this Honorable Court respectfully allege: <br></p><p>"'1. That the defendant 
admits the debt as embodied in the contract in the amount of Two Thousand Pesos 
(P2,000.00), Philippine Currency; </p>
<p>"'2. That the defendant agrees to pay the amount of Four Hundred Pesos 
(P400.00) as costs and attorney's fees of this action and, expenses of 
litigation; </p>
<p>"'3. That the defendant promises to pay the above amount within 30 days from 
promulgation of the judgment rendered by the court based on this compromise 
agreement; </p>
<p>"'4. That the defendant agrees that, failure to pay said amount within 30 
days, places at the disposal of the court said security for the satisfaction of 
the judgment. </p>
<p>"'Wherefore, it is most respectfully prayed that judgment be rendered in 
accordance with the above mentioned agreement without costs."</p></blockquote>
<p>'En su virtud, el Juzgado dicta sentencia condenando a la demandada Candida 
Piano a pagar a los demandantes Generosa Cayanong y Regalado Bellones la suma de 
P2,000.00 como deuda, mas la cantidad de P400.00 como costas y honorarios de 
abogado dentro del plazo de noventa (90) dias a partir desde la fecha de este 
decision. Si dentro del referido plazo la demandada dejara de pagar la suma 
total de P2,400.00 mencionada, el juzgado ordenara que la parcela de terreno 
hipotecada, conocida como Lote No. 6272 parte del Catastro de Ormoc, ubicada en 
el sitio de Ipil, barrio de Margen, Ciudad de Ormoc, colindante por el Norte con 
los herederos de Cirilo Cabahug y Nemesio Maglasang; por el Sur, con Lazaro 
Aying; y por el Ceste, con los herederos del finado Manuel Martinez, amillarada 
a nombre de Candida Piano, se venda en subasta publica y que con el producto de 
la venta se pague la cantidad de P2,400.00 a los demandantes.'</p>
<p>"The defendant failed to pay the obligation within the period set by the 
court; so the property in question was sold at public auction on Jan. 30, 1952 
(should be 1953) per order of the court, by the deputy sheriff of Maasin, Leyte, 
to the plaintiffs, they being the only bidders for P2,475. The certificate of 
sheriff's sale contained the provision that the said property is subject 'to 
redemption within one year from the date hereof in the manner provided by the 
law applicable to the case.' On March 11, 1953, the plaintiffs filed a motion 
for the confirmation of the sale executed by the sheriff, which was unopposed by 
the defendant. The sale was confirmed by the Court on March 21, 1953. 
Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of possession by virtue 
of such petition the court adjudicated possession to the plaintiffs on Aug. 15, 
1953. On Aug. 20, 1953, the deputy clerk issued the writ of possession prayed 
for by the plaintiffs. </p>
<p>"On Jan. 26, 1954, the defendant deposited with the court the sum of 
P2,783.93, P2,772 of which was in the concept of redemption deposit to be 
delivered to Generosa Cayanong and her husband, and P11.93 for consignation 
fees. On the same day, the defendant filed a motion asking the court to order, 
the plaintiffs to make an accounting of all rents and/or profits of the said 
property for the period of their possession. On Feb. 14, 1954, the plaintiff 
filed with the court required verified accounting, and at the same time informed 
the court that on Jan. 27, 1954, in Albuera, Leyte, a junior encumbrancer, 
Francisco Pilapil, had redeemed the property by paying them the amount of 
P2,772, one day after the defendant deposited with the court her redemption 
money. The instrument of redemption is Exh. I, Redemption of a Lien Holder of a 
Foreclosed Mortgage. The oppositor Francisco Pilapil, on Feb. 11, 1954 filed an 
opposition to the defendants' motion of Jan. 26, 1954, claiming that the 
property, subject of foreclosure, having be&amp;n sold at a Judicial foreclosure 
sale, was not subject to redemption after the Judicial sale was confirmed, title 
thereto having been fully vested and consolidated in favor of Cayamong and 
Bellones, their assignees and successors-in-interest.</p>
<p>"A month later, the defendant filed another motion questioning the adequacy, 
of the accounting, filed by the plaintiff and reiterad her prayer for the 
reconveyance to her of the property in question; the oppositor and the 
plaintiffs filed their respective oppositions to this motion. On Oct. 22, 1954, 
the court <i>a quo</i> issued an order denying the defendant the right to redeem 
the property in dispute."</p></blockquote>
<p>The first question raised in this appeal is whother the decision of the lower 
court based on the compromise agreement of the parties, is a judgment Tendered 
after trial within the contemplation of Section 2 of Rule 70 of the Rules of 
Court and the Constitution. </p>
<p>Petitioner argues that a judgment in a foreclosure of mortgage under said 
Section 2 of Rule 70 requires a trial on the merits before the property 
foreclosed shall be disposed by sale, but since the parties at bar submitted a 
compromise, agreement upon which the trial court rendered its decision, the same 
does not satisfy the requirement of the Constitution for failure to state the 
law and the facts of the case.</p>
<p>The contention is devoid of merit. The court <i>a quo</i> had no necessity of 
making a finding of facts, the parties having entered into a compromise 
agreement in order to terminate the suit between them. The agreement had upon 
the parties the effect and authority of res judicata (Art. 2037, New Civil Code; 
Yboleon <i>vs</i>. Sison, 59 Phil. 281, 290; Hernandez <i>vs</i>. Barcelon, 23 
Phil. 599, 607; De Jesus <i>vs</i>. Go Quiolay, 65 Phil. 476, 482; Meneses 
<i>vs</i>. De la Rosa, 77 Phil. 34, 38; Salazar <i>vs</i>. Jarabe 91 Phil., 596, 
48 Off. Gaz. 2708, 2712; Morales <i>vs</i>. Fontanos, 64 Phil. 19, 21), and the 
judgment rendered thereon had the authority of res judicata from the moment it 
was rendered (Meneses <i>vs</i>. De la Rosa, supra; Morales <i>vs</i>. Fontanos, 
supra). In the absence of an objection to the agreement, it was the duty of the 
trial court to render judgment strictly in accordance with the terms of the 
agreement (Cabrera <i>vs</i>. Lacson, 71 Phil. 182), and such judgment is more 
than a mere contract binding the parties because having the sanction of the 
court, and entered as its determination of the controversy, it has all the force 
and effect of any other judgment, it being conclusive upon the parties and their 
privies (Marquez, <i>vs</i>. Marquez, 73 Phil, 74). </p>
<p>Petitioner, in further support of her contention cites the case of Susaniada 
<i>vs</i>. Mata (49 Off. Gaz., 77) where this court held that an agreement 
between the parties sanctioned by the court to adjust a litigation, does not 
have the effect of a final judgment or character of res judicata, because the 
court's approval of the agreement is considered mainly as an administrative 
recording of what has been agreed to between the parties. </p>
<p>The above cited ease is not in point for the parties therein agreed "that the 
land to be taken by the plaintiff shall be segregated by a duly qualified 
surveyor" and this Court held that the "judgment was merely an interlocutory 
order because something had yet to be done, i.e., the segregation agreed upon, 
whieh'togfcther with the court's approval, will be the ones to give it 
finality". In the case at bar the decision of the lower court sentencing the 
petitioner to pay the amount she had agreed upon to pay was final and nothing 
else was to be done in order to make her liable for said payment. A judgment on 
a compromise is not appealable and is immediately executory unless a motion is 
filed to set aside the compromise on the ground of fraud, mistake, or duress in 
which event an appeal may be taken from the order denying the mption. (De los 
Reyes <i>vs</i>. De Ugarte, 75 Phil., 505; Enriquez <i>vs</i>. Padilla, 77 Phil. 
373; Serrano <i>vs</i>. Reyes, 110 Phil., 536).</p>
<p>There being no motion to set aside the compromise agreement, we believe, and 
so hold, that inasmuch as the petitioner admitted her indebtedness and agreed to 
pay the attorneys fees and the entire obligation within 30 days from the 
promulgation of the judgment, and having further agreed that in case of default 
the security would be at the disposal of the court for the satisfaction of the 
judgment, the lower court did not have the necessity to make findings of fact, 
it being sufficient that the case was decided on the agreed compromise between 
the parties. </p>
<p>Petitioner next maintains that the decision of the trial court based upon the 
compromise agreement should be enforced by execution as an ordinary judgment 
under Rule 89 of the Rules of Court and not under Rule 70.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> It is argued that Article 2037 of the New 
Civil Code on compromise agreements does not make any distinction between 
ordinary civil actions and foreclosure proceedings, and since the procedure 
under Rule 70 is strict, in that it grants only an equity of redemption of 90 
days, whereas Rule 39 grants a one year period of redemption, the latter rule 
should prevail, the intention of the law apparently being to give clemency or 
leniency to the debtor who earnestly submits to a compromise and spares the 
court of a lengthy trial. </p>
<p>The contention is untenable. An examination of the complaint filed in the 
lower court will reveal that the action filed by the plaintiffs, respondents 
herein, is one for foreclosure of mortgage. It is a settled rule that the 
purpose of an action or suit and the law to govern it, including the period of 
prescription, are to be determined not by the claim of the party filing the 
action, made in his argument or brief, but rather by the complaint itself, its 
argument or brief, but rather by the complaint itself, its allegations and 
prayer for relief (Rone <i>vs</i>. Claro, 91 Phil., 250). The mere silence of 
Article 2037 (supra), as to whether the compromise refers to an ordinary civil 
action or a foreclosure proceeding, does not justify execution under Rule 39 
when the case directly falls under Rule 70. No judgment rendered in an action 
for foreclosure of mortgage can be executed, otherwise than in the manner 
prescribed by the law on mortgages, for the reason that parties to an action are 
not authorized to change the procedure which it prescribes. (Diaz <i>vs</i>. 
Mendezona, 43 Phil. 472, 478).</p>
<p>The petitioner also maintains that the appellate court erred in not 
considering the insertion made by the Sheriff in the certificate of sale 
providing for a one year period of redemption, as a permissible agreement 
between the parties who abide by said period, considering that the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo 
</span>approved and confirmed the saleand respondents did not move to have said 
insertion stricken out. </p>
<p>The argument cannot be sustained. In a foreclosure of mortgage under Rules of 
Court, there is no right of redemption after the sale is confirmed (Benedicto 
<i>vs</i>. Yulo, 26 Phil. 160, 166), although there is an equity of redemption 
in favor of the mortgagor or junior encumbrancer, consisting in the right to 
redeem the mortgaged property within the 90 day period (Sun Life Assurance Co. 
of Canada <i>vs</i>. Gonzales Diez, 52 Phil. 271), or even thereafter, but 
before the confirmation of the sale (Anderson <i>vs</i>. Reyes, 54 Phil. 944; 
Reymundo <i>vs</i>. Sunico, 25 Phil. 365; Griwalt <i>vs</i> Velasquez, 36 Phil. 
936; La Urbana <i>vs</i>. Belando, 54, Phil. 930, 933). It is only in cases of 
foreclosures of mortgages in favor of banking and credit institutions (Sec. 76, 
General Banking Act [Rep. Act 337], to the Philippine National Bank (Acts No. 
2747, and 2938), and in extrajudicial foreclosures (Act 3135, as amended by Act 
4118), where, by express provision, the law allows redemption. In all other 
foreclosure cases, there is no legal redemption. The sheriff, therefore, has no 
authority to grant or insert a period of redemption in the certificate of sale, 
when the same is conducted pursuant to Rule 70 and, wanting in said authority, 
any insertion therein has no validity and effect. Once the judicial sale is 
confirmed by the court, the rights are vested in the purchaser (Sec. 3, Rule 
70). From all that appears on the record, the insertion referred to is, as the 
appellate court correctly declared, "a surplusage and must be disregarded". </p>
<p>The petitioner also maintains that the Court of Appeals erred in not 
declaring null and void the entire certificate of sheriff's sale upon finding 
that the sheriff' had no authority to embody in his certificate what is not in 
the substance of the decision. Petitioner cites the decisions of this Court in 
Silvestre <i>vs</i>. Torres (57 Phil. 885) and Velez <i>vs</i>. Martinez (63 
Phil., 23) wherein we held in effect that a writ of execution not warranted by 
the decision or judgment which gives life or cause to exist has no validity. 
</p>
<p>The cases cited are not in point because the writs of execution totally set 
aside there were against persons not parties to the action and hence the writs' 
invalidity is as a whole. The certificate of sale involved in this present 
appeal is in complete accordance with the judgment of the court and the writ of 
execution, the only defect being the unauthorized insertion of the period of 
redemption. </p>
<p>It is also petitioner's contention that the one year period of redemption in 
the certificate of sale duly approved by the trial court constituted a repeated 
assurance of the right of petitioner to redeem within the year and should have 
been considered as a "special circumstance" to allow the redemption beyond the 
period fixed by law, applying by analogy the doctrines in Lichauco <i>vs</i>. 
Olegario (43 Phil. 540); Rivero <i>vs</i>. Rivera, (80 Phil. 802); Alberto 
<i>vs</i>. De los Santos (81 Phil. 52); Facundo <i>vs</i>. Provincial Sheriff of 
Mindoro, (CA G.R. No. 421-R, February 28, 1950); and Bautista <i>vs</i>. Ago 
(CA-57 O.G. 4927). </p>
<p>The contention is untenable. The cases cited are not applicable. In Lichauco 
<i>vs</i>. Olegario (<span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>), a period of redemption existed and was interrupted 
when the execution debtor wanted to prevent it by executing on the right to 
redeem, and this Court, considering the legal proceedings therein as special 
circumstance, extended the period of redemption. In the present case, being a 
judicial foreclosure of mortgage, there is no period of redemption, or legal 
proceedings or interruption thereof. On the other hand, the decisions in Rivero 
<i>vs</i>. Rivero (<span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>), and Alberto <i>vs</i>. De los Santos, (<span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>), far 
from supporting petitioner's case militate against it, for in these two cases, 
this Court declared that the fundamental reason under lying statutes providing 
for the suspension or extension of the period of limitation is the legal or 
physical impossibility for the interested party to enforce or exercise in time 
his right of action. In the case at bar, the one year period of redemption 
erroneously included by the sheriff did not constitute a legal or physical 
impossibility for herein petitioner to pay the indebtedness and redeem the 
property before the confirmation of the sale, because the one year redemption 
period erroneously inserted in the certificate of sale would, if proper, 
commence to take only after the confirmation. Obviously this after effect could 
not be said to have impeded, legally or physically, what should have been 
accomplished before. </p>
<p>In view of the above conclusions we have arrived at, we find it unnecessary 
to pass upon the other errors assigned by the parties in their brief. </p>
<p>Finding no error in the decision appealed from the same is hereby affirmed, 
with costs against petitioner. So ordered. </p>
