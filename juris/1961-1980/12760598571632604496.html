				G.R. No. 16975, May 30, 1964</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, ROMULO QUA, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPONENT AND APPELLEE.

				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>This is an appeal from a decree entered by the Court of First Instance of 
Manila denying for the second time the petition to become Filipino citizen by 
naturalization filed by Romulo Qua. When his petition for naturalization was 
denied for the first time, the Court of First Instance of Manila found that—
<blockquote>
<p>“* * * there is a strong objection of the Philip-pine Array Headquarters to the 
petitioner's application for admission as citizen of the Philippines on the 
ground that ‘in the interest of National Security’ he should not be given G-2 
clearance because of an unfavorable information about him existing in the files 
of the General Headquarters of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (Exhibit 4). 
He is suspected of subversive activities, * * *" (pp. 2-3, Rec. on Appeal) 
</p></blockquote>
<p>After this denial, the petitioner moved for new trial on ground of newly 
discovered evidence. This consists of sworn statements of a certain attorney 
John E. Curtin, a citizen of the United States and resident of Manila, and of 
Lt. Col. Amadeo M. Gabe, Inf., P.O., submitted to the trial court. The sworn 
statements stated, among other things, that the petitioner could not possibly be 
or have been engaged in communistic activities, because he was a guerrilla of 
the COWHM group during the war, fought in the hills for several months against 
the Japanese armed forces and rendered services in the U.S. Army C.I.D. and in 
the Manila Police Department. The motion for new trial was denied for lack of 
merit. The petitioner appealed to this Court (G. R. No. L-12279).</p>
<p>In disposing of the petitioner's appeal, this Court found that—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The main objection of the trial court to the granting of petitioner's 
application for naturalization was the refusal of the Philippine Army G-2 
Department to give him a clearance on the ground that he was suspected by two 
officers of the Philippine Army of subversive activities. A G-2 Agent of the 
Philippine Army and Manuel Maravilla, a captain of the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines, testified as to the supposed subversive activities of the 
petitioner, but both witnesses refused to specify and reveal what those supposed 
subversive activities wereon the ground that it was confidential and also for 
security reasons. They even refused to name the organization or entity 
supposedly communistic to which the petitioner was said to belong. We can not 
refuse or deny a petition for naturalization on mere suspicion from the Armed 
Forces of the Philippines, supposed to investigate alleged subversive 
activities. If these suspicions are based on and supported by facts they should 
be placed on record so that petitioner may have an opportunity to examine them 
and, if possible, refute them. (pp. 16-17, Rec. on Appeal)</p></blockquote>
<p>Consequently, this Court set aside the order appealed from and remanded the 
case to the lower court for new trial "so as to give petitioner as well as the 
Government an opportunity to present further evidence in support of or against 
the application for naturalization."</p>
<p>In this new trial, Juliana Panganiban, whose testimony during the previous 
trial of the case regarding the petitioner's birth was erroneously cut short by 
the trial court for the reason that the best evidence on that point is the 
record of birth, was again called to the witness stand. John E. Curtin, an 
American citizen and 'former C.I.D. agent of the U.S. Army, testified that he 
came to know the petitioner in August 1945; that the petitioner worked for him 
in the C.I.D. for about four months; and that the petitioner is a person of good 
moral character, a good Catholic, and has remained anti-communist in his ideas 
and attitude. His testimony substantially confirmed his affidavit filed in the 
case (Exhibit R).</p>
<p>On its part the Government presented again its two witnesses, namely, Agent 
Fortunato P. Jose of G-2 Intelligence Section of the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines and Captain Manuel Maravilla also of G-2, Armed Forces of the 
Philippines. On direct examination by the government prosecutor, both witnesses 
once more refused to reveal the subversive activities of the petitioner for the 
reason that it involved the security of the State and that they were not 
authorized or given clearance by Colonel Reynaldo Mendoza, the Chief of the G-2 
of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, to reveal the same At this juncture, the 
government prosecutor heeding the suggestion of the courtmoved for continuance 
of the hearing and asked for the issuance of <em>subpoena duces 
tecum</em>—<em>ad testificandum</em> —addressed to Col. Reynaldo Mendoza, the 
Chief of G-2.</p>
<p>On the day set for the resumption of the hearing, Major Dominador C. Dacanay, 
Legal Officer of the Intelligence, Armed Forces of the Philippines, appeared in 
behalf of the Chief of the Intelligence (G-2) of the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines, in compliance with the <em>subpoena duces tecum</em> previously 
issued by the court. Major Dacanay submitted to the court a true copy of a 
confidential report (Exhibit1) of the Chief of the Counter-Intelligence Group 
addressed to the "AC of S, G2, GHQ, AFP Camp Murphy, Quezon City,(Assistant 
Chief of Staff, G-2, General Headquarters, Armed Forces of the Philippines, Camp 
Murphy, Quezon City), on Romulo Qua, the petitioner in this case. It appears in 
the confidential report that the petitioner, Romulo Qua, is one of the leaders 
of the Hiat Kan Tuan and an active commander of Troop 8 thereof; that the Hiat 
Kan Tuan is the most active Chinese Guerrilla Unit affiliated with the Chinese 
Communist Party; that from 1949 to 1956 he was employed as an office clerk of 
the Hiat Kan Tuan whose headquarters is located at No. 106 Soler Street, Manila, 
where the petitioner's residence is also located.</p>
<p>After the formal presentation of the confidential report as part of the 
evidence for the government, the Solicitor General filed a written objection to 
the petition, on the ground that the petitioner is a communist suspect and 
active member of a Chinese guerrilla unit affiliated with the Chinese Communist 
Party. The petitioner filed a reply to the objection of the Solicitor 
General.</p>
<p>On 24 March 1960, the court entered a decree denying again applicant's 
petition to become a Filipino citizen by naturalization.</p>
<p>The petitioner has appealed.</p>
<p>The admission in evidence of the report submitted to the court is correct, 
because the facts therein stated were entered by a public officer in the 
performance of his duties. The person referred to therein is no other than the 
petitioner. Even his connection with, or employment as agent by, the Criminal 
Investigation Department (C.I.D.), U.S.Army, mentioned by his witness John E. 
Curtin is there reported. His connection as one of the leaders of the Hiat Kan 
Tuan, the most active Chinese guerrilla unit affiliated with the Chinese 
Communist Party, and the fact that he resided in the same place, 106 Soler 
Street, Manila, where the Hiat Kan Tuan had its headquarters, constitute 
sufficient ground to deny his petition to become a Filipino citizen by 
naturalization.</p>
<p>The decree appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the 
petitioner-appellant.</p>
