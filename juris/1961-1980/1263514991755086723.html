				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from the order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, in its Civil Case No. 6103, dis­missing plaintiff's
complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">There was no trial in this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead of an answer, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss upon the
grounds of prescription and want of cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts as alleged in the complaint must,
therefore, be considered hypothetically admit­ted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Original plaintiff Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Veluz</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
filed a <span style="">complaint before the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Quezon</span></span><span style=""> on </span></span><st1:date year="1958" day="30" month="7"><span style="">July 30,1958</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span>a
<span style="">motion for bill of particulars by
defendants, the court ordered plaintiff to file an amended complaint, which
plaintiff did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <span style="">amended complaint </span>plaintiff alleged
that on January 2, 1953 he asked defendants for a loan of five thousand pesos,
to secure the payment of which he <span style="">proposed
to mortgage his share on a parcel of land covered by TCT No. 27247 </span>of
the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>; that the defendants
-agreed and caused forthwith the preparation of a deed, a copy of which is
attached to the complaint </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">An<span style="">nex</span> A; that when defendants asked
plaintiff to sign the deed as prepared, the latter noticed that the <span style="">deed </span></span><span style="">was an </span><span style="">absolute sale
instead </span><span style="">of a mortgage, and so he
asked defendants why the document was couched </span>that <span style="">way, to which query
</span><span style="">defendants answered that it had
to be so in order-that defendants could take possession and enjoy the fruits of
the land and that plaintiff had nothing to worry about the document as
defendants, being his brothers and sisters, would not take advantage of the
deed of sale, and that </span>plaintiff could <span style="">redeem the property anytime; that because of the assurance of his
brothers and sisters plaintiff affixed his signature on the document; that said
document did not express the real intention of the parties; that in May 1956
plain­tiff wanted to redeem </span>the property but the <span style="">defendants refused, </span><span style="">claiming that what plaintiff had executed was
a deed of sale; that several days later, plaintiff came to know that the
property had been registered already in defendants' name; that the value of the
land with its improvements would be no less than P80,000.00 yielding a monthly
produce valued at no less than P1,000, 00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff prayed that judgment be issued "order</span><span style="">ing the reformation of the deed of sale
attached hereto as Annex 'A' to express the true intention of the parties, to
wit: the same be made as a deed of </span>mortgage" and that defendants <span style="">be ordered to pay actual and moral damages
and attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Defendants moved for the
dismissal of the com­plaint upon the grounds that the cause of action has
prescribed and that the complaint states no cause </span><span style="">of action, to which motion plaintiff filed
his opposition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trial </span>court
issued its order, dated June 28, 1960, dismissing the complaint, upon the
ground that <span style="">plaintiff's action was for
annulment of contract based on fraud (although ultimately it was for recovery
of title and possession), which under Article 1391 had to be brought within
four years from the discovery of the fraud; that from January 2, 1953 when the
fraud was discovered to the date of institution of the act­ion on July 30,
1958, more than four years had elapsed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff moved for the reconsideration of the order of dismissal, but
the motion was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this
appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The plaintiff having died
in the meantime, the trial court ordered the substitution of plaintiff by his
wife <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Veluz</span>; and
by his children: Sonia <span class="SpellE">Veluz</span>, wife of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Villador</span>; Julia <span class="SpellE">Veluz</span>, wife of
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Peleñio</span>, and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Veluz</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In their appeal brief the
appellants made a lone assignment of error, to wit: that the trial court erred
in finding that the cause of action had already prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support thereof appellants argue that the
allegations, as well as the relief sought, in the complaint, clearly show that
the action is for reform­ation of instrument: under Articles 1365 and 1605 of
the Civil Code, which action prescribes in ten years</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and not for annulment of contract which
prescribes in four years; that assuming that the action was for an­nulment, it
could be said that original plaintiff Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Veluz</span>
discovered the fraud only in 1953 when his brothers and sisters, taking
advantage of the deed of sale, refused to allow him to redeem the property.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> rely principally on Article 1391 of the Civil
Code which provides that the action for the annulment of a contract on the
ground of fraud must be brought within four years from the date of the
discovery of the fraud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> urge that the four-year period of prescription of
the action began on </span><st1:date year="1953" day="2" month="1"><span style="">January 2, 1953</span></st1:date><span style=""> when the deed in question was signed by
original plaintiff Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Veluz</span> who already knew of
the fraud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
cite the cases </span>of <span class="SpellE">Rone</span>, et al., vs. <span class="SpellE">Claro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Baquiring</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Cariota</span> vs. <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Benares</span></st1:place>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
to support their stand. </p>

<p class="BODY">We find merit in this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The purpose of an action
and the law that should govern it, including the period of prescription, should
be determined by the complaint itself - its al­legations and prayer for relief.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The complaint in the instant case alleges
that the agreement of the parties was that the land of plaintiff Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Veluz</span> was to be mortgaged, but the defendants caused to be
prepared </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">deed of absolute sale
and assured said plaintiff that he had nothing to fear and worry about the
document because he could redeem the property </span>any time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint specifically alleges that the
instrument does not express the true intention of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint prayed, among others, that
judgment be issued:</p>

<blockquote>"(b) <u>ordering the reformation of the deed of sale attached
hereto<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as Annex 'A'</u> to express the
true intention of the part­ies, to wit: the same to be made as <span style="">a </span>deed of
Mortgage executed by the plaintiff in favor of the defendants for and in con­sideration
of Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000. <span style="">00) which plaintiff may redeem at any time he
desires or to such period as this Court </span>may fix and that if this Honorable
Court should fix a period to order in the mean­time the return of the
possession of the premises in question to the plaintiff." (Underscoring,
supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">our considered view, based upon the allega­tions,
and the relief prayed for, in the complaint, that the action is clearly one for
the reformation of an instrument as contemplated in Articles 1359 and 1365 of
the Civil Code of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the order appealed
from the lower court starts with the statement "This is an action for
reformation of contract with damages…", but later declared "that the
plaintiff's action in the case at bar is annulment of contract based on fraud
(although ultimately it is for recovery of title and possession) which, under
Article 1391 of the new Civil Code shall be brought within four years from the
discovery of the fraud."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court is in error.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The action for reformation of instrument should not be confused with the
action for annulment of contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reform­ation
of instrument:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>presupposes a valid
existing contract, in which there had been a meeting of the minds of the
parties but the instrument drawn up and signed by them does not correctly
express the terms of their agreement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Annulment of a contract, on the other hand, presupposes a defective
contract in which the minds of <span style="">the </span><span style="">parties
</span>did not meet, or the consent of one was vitiated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The equity of reformation is ordinarily
limited to written agree­ments, and its purpose is to establish and perpet­uate
the true agreement; annulment, on the other hand, is, intended <span style="">to </span>declare the inefficiency which the
contract already carries in itself and to render the contract inefficacious.</p>

<p class="BODY">The legal question to be resolved in the instant case, therefore,
is: When does an action for the reformation of instrument prescribed?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chapter 4, Title IT of Book IV of the Civil
Code, which treats of "Reformation of Instruments" carries no
provision regarding the period when the action for reformation of instrument
shall be brought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In two decisions of
this Court we find conflicting, pronouncements.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case of Heirs of Carlota vs. <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Benares</span></st1:place>,
<span style="">G. </span>R.
No. L-6438, <st1:date year="1955" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1955</st1:date>,
relied upon by the trial court, this Court said that the action prescribes in
four years, and we quote:</p>

<blockquote>"The fact that <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Benares</span></st1:place>,
through fraud and deceit, made them sign ab­solute sales instead, does net
render the sales absolutely void, but merely <span class="SpellE">voidable</span>;
and the remedy of plaintiffs <span style="">is </span>either
annulment on the ground of fraud, or reformation of the contracts to make them
express the parties' true intention and agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In either <span style="">case, </span>the action should be filed within four years from the time
the cause of<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> action
accrues, i.e. from the discovery of the fraud."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, in the
subsequent case of <span class="SpellE">Conde</span>, et al., vs. </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cuenca</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> and </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Malaga</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, G. R. No. L-9405, July 31, 1956, relied
upon by the <span style="">appellants, wherein the
action was precisely for </span></span><span style="">the
</span><span style="">reformation of the instrument of
sale <span style="">to make it </span>conform with the
intention of the parties to execute a deed of mortgage, under Article 1365 of
the Civil Code, this Court applied Article 1144 of the <span style="">Civil Code and </span>held that plaintiff had </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">period of 10 years within which to bring the
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We quote:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"As defendants themselves allege in their motion, plaintiff's
remedy is one for the reformation of an instrument under <span style="font-size: 12pt;">article 165 of the new Civil
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That article reads:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'ART. 1365.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If two parties
agree upon the mortgage or pledge of real or personal property, but the
instrument states that the property is sold absolutely or with a right of
repurchase, re<span style="font-size: 12pt;">formation
of the instrument is proper.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Plaintiff's case comes squarely under the
article, and it is precisely the remedy therein prescribed that he wants when
in his complaint:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he prays for judgment <u>declaring
the deed of sale Annex 'A' null and void <span class="SpellE">ab</span> <span class="SpellE">initio</span> but one of mortgage</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated more explicitly, the prayer is to have
the deed declared void as a sale and construed or given the effect of a mere
mort­gage so as to make it conform to the real intention of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, what is sought is 'reform­ation',
which is defined as that <span style="font-size: 12pt;">remedy
in equity by means of which a written instrument is mode or construed so as to
express or conform to the </span>real intention of the parties when some error
or mistake has been committed. <span style="">(53 C. </span><span style="">3. </span><span style="">906, cited in Padilla's Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Annotated, Vol. II, p. 431.) More­over, the
complaint also prays for such </span>remedy as in justice and equity plain­tiff
may be entitled to in the premises, and it <span style="">is </span>clear that upon the facts pleaded
reformation is proper in accord­ance with article 1365 of the new Civil Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As an action for reformation, plaintiff had 10 years within
which to bring it from the time the right of action accrued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Art. 1144, new Civil <span style="font-size: 12pt;">C</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">ode.)...."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
believe </span><span style="">that the decision in the
<span class="SpellE"><u>Conde</u></span> case should prevail, not only because it
is of a later date but also because the issue decided therein refers to the
period of prescription in an action for reform­ation of instruments; whereas,
in the <u>Carlota</u> case, the issue decided refers to the annulment of
contracts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ruling the <span class="SpellE"><u>Conde</u></span> case is squarely applicable to the case now
before us because, as in the <span class="SpellE">Conde</span> case, the question
involved is the reformation of an instrument which appears to be a deed of
absolute sale when the real intention of the parties was to execute a deed of
mortgage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence, in the case at
bar, even if the ten-year period of prescription be computed from the date of
the execution of the instrument on January 2, 1953, or from May, 1958 when
defendants refused to allow re­demption - evincing thus their intent not to
live up to the true agreement and thereby giving rise to the </span><span style="">right of action,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> until July 30; 1958 when the instant case
was commenced, the ten-year period for prescription of the action had not yet elapsed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
