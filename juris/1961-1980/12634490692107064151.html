to review the decision of the Court of Appeals finding the petitioner, Jorge <span class="SpellE">Vytiaco</span>, guilty of the crime of resistance and serious
disobedience in Case C.A.-G.R. No. 00528-R.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a result of an incident which occurred in <span class="SpellE">Aborlan</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Palawan</span></st1:place>, on <st1:date year="1959" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1959</st1:date>, the herein
petitioner, Jorge <span class="SpellE">Vytiaco</span>, was charged before the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span> in three criminal
cases, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>1. Criminal Case No. 2350, People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. Jorge <span class="SpellE">Vytiaco</span>, for Grave Threats;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. Criminal Case No. 2356, People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. Jorge <span class="SpellE">Vytiaco</span>, for Disobedience to a Person in
Authority.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">These cases were jointly tried by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span>, and in all the three cases herein petitioner was
found guilty as charged, and sentenced <span style="">as
</span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>(1) In Criminal Case No. 2350, for grave threats, petitioner was
sentenced to suffer two (2) months and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">arresto</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">mayor</span></u><span style="">, </span>to pay
a fine of P100.00, and to pay the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) In Criminal Case No. 2351, for assault upon an agent of <span style="">a </span>person in authority, petitioner was
sentenced to two (2) months and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">arresto</span></u></span><span style=""> <u>mayor</u> </span>as minimum, to two (2)
years, four (4) months and one (1) day <span style="">of
<span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>corr</u><u><span style="">eccional</span></u></span></span><span style=""> </span>as maximum, to pay <span style="">a fine </span>of P400.00, and to pay the
costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The gun used by the accused was
ordered confiscated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) In Criminal Case No. 2356, for dis­obedience to a person in
authority, peti­tioner was sentenced to one (1) month and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span> <u><span style="">mayor</span></u><span style="">, </span>a fine of P100.00, and to pay the
costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Regarding the fines imposed on the ac­cused in the three cases,
subsidiary impri­sonment <span style="">is </span>to
be served in case of insolvency.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span>, the petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals, <span style="">and the </span>abovementioned three <span style="">cases </span>were respectively <span style="">docketed as CA-G. R. No. 00528-R, CA-G. R.
No. 00528-R.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1962</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals rendered a decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads as fol­lows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in Criminal Cases Nos. 2350 and 2356 for grave
threat and serious dis­obedience, respectively, the decision is re­versed and
appellant acquitted, with costs <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">oficio</span></u></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In
Criminal Case No. 2351, he is hereby held guilty, not of direct assault as held
by the lower court but of resistance and serious disobedience and is sentenced
to 2 months and 1 day of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">arresto</span></u></span><span style=""> <u>mayor</u>
</span>and to pay a fine of P200.00, with subsidiary im­prisonment in case of
insolvency, plus the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the Court of Appeals the three cases were docket­ed as CA-G.
R. Nos. 00527-R, <span style="">00528-R </span>and <span style="">00529-R.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>It was in CA-G. R. Nos. 00527-R and 00529-R where the petitioner
was acquitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the decision of the
Court of Appeals in CA-G. R. No. 00528-R that is now sought to be reviewed by
this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because the Court of Appeals
rendered only one decision for the three cases, those three cases are now
docketed in this Court as G. R. Nos. L-20246, L-20247 and <span style="">L-20248.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>Actually, it is <span style="">Case G.
R. No. </span>L-20247 (which corresponds to CA-G. R. No. <span style="">00528-R) </span>that is the subject of this
decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends that, based on the facts as found by the
Court of Appeals, the respondent Court of Appeals committed error in holding
him guilty of the crime of resistance and serious disobedience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts as found by the Court of Appeals
are as follows:<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"The States' evidence tends to show that at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1959" day="12" month="3">March
 12, 1959</st1:date>, in the private market of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>
in <span class="SpellE">Panacan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aborlan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rosalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> was informed by
his brother<span style="">-in-</span>law, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, that the previous day a certain Eduardo created
trouble in the market, over­turning the tables.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> got mad and start­ed talking in a loud
voice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant Jorge <span class="SpellE">Vytiaco</span>, who was passing by, heard <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ap­pellant told him to calm down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> did not take
the remark good-naturedly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told ap­pellant
to mind his own business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An exchange of
unfriendly words followed and the two in no time grabbed each other. Esteban <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span>, a PC enlisted man who was in plainclothes and on
patrol duty, saw the two adversaries and se­parated them. Appellant ran away
but told <span class="SpellE">Jag­mis</span> to wait and he would get his
gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the way, appellant met his
brother-in-law, Ramon Ramos, carrying a .22 caliber rifle and a .38 caliber
pistol. Someone apparently had relayed the tiff to appellant's house. When <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> saw Ramos handing the pistol to appellant, he
approached to demand the surrender of the fire­arms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He however, failed to get the weapons because
Ramos ran away with the rifle and appellant held him by the waist and tried to
snatch his service pistol in his back pocket.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He tried to prevent appellant from gaining pos­session of the pistol and
while they were grap­pling, it went off.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> lost his balance and appellant
succeeded in wresting the gun from him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With a revolver in each hand, his own and that of <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span>,
appellant ordered the former and <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span>, who followed
<span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span>, to raise their hands and not to advance or
he would shoot them. <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> did as ordered but
asked appel­lant to return to him his pistol, identifying himself as a PC
soldier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant refused to give the
gun back and did not recognize <span class="SpellE">Gapi­lango's</span>
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span>
sent somebody to call the PC detachment commander, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Pelu­cio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Buñag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
meantime, one Jesus <span class="SpellE">Lepasana</span> arrived and <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> also requested him to help get his gun back from
appellant who already went home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While <span class="SpellE">Lepasana</span> was talking to appellant, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Buñag</span>
came.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked appellant for <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Gapi</span>lango's</span>
pistol and promised that he would try to amicably settle the <span style="">case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Appellant,
who was standing outside <span style="">his </span>house,
again declined to yield the gun and instead went inside and told the soldiers
to get it if they wanted it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later in
the afternoon, Capt. Pastor <span class="SpellE">Escano</span>, PC <span style="">as­sistant </span>provincial commander to
whom Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Buñag</span> reported the incident, went to
appellant's house and talked to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
revolver was re­turned to Capt. <span class="SpellE">Escano</span> by the vice
mayor of <span class="SpellE">Aborlan</span> to whom appellant surrendered it
earlier.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Appellant offers this story:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the day in question, he went to <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>'
market to see a Mr. Murillo to have him sign some papers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While conversing with Murillo, appellant
heard <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> angrily talking aloud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Apellant</span>, in a
manner of greeting <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> who was his friend, told
him to cool off as <span style="">the </span><span style="">weather </span>was al­ready hot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> resented the
remark and col­lared appellant. Surprised by <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span>'
reaction, appellant tried to free himself and protested that he had done <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> no wrong and that they were friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A companion of appellant and ano­ther man,
who turned out to be <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span>, in­tervened and <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> released appellant. When appellant asked <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> why he collared him, he (appellant) having merely
intended his remark as a greeting to a friend, <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span>
again grabbed him and said that appellant was <span style="">a </span>rich man and had no business interfering.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant again remonstrated and told <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> not to treat him that way because they were
friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span>'
brother-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, intervened and sepa­rated
the two.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Already peeved and embarrassed,
appellant prepared to defend himself if <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> would
charge again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as appellant happened
to look towards the road, he saw his brother-in-law carrying <span style="">a </span>rifle and <span style="">a </span>pistol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So he ran out
and shouted at him to go home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
followed by <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> told <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> to get the guns.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> drew his pistol and demanded the
surrender of the fire­arms. Appellant, sensing <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span>
to be close behind, suddenly wheeled around and seeing the latter's gun aimed
at him, grabbed it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the ensuing
struggle for its possession, it fired. Finally, appellant was able to wrest it
from <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> and with his own revolver which he got
from his brother-in-law, appellant pointed them at <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> and warned them, while retreating, not to
go near him or he would shoot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Mrs. </span><span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>
at this stage ap<span style="">proached appellant and </span>they
went home together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A little later after
he had hidden the guns and while he was standing outside his house, <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> and Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Buñag</span> came.
Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Buñag</span>, without asking any question, collared him
and harshly demanded for <span class="SpellE">Gapilango's</span> revolver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> also held
him by the shirt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant asked Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Buñag</span> that they clear matters first. When he was released,
appellant went inside his house and told the soldiers to come inside <span style="">if </span>they wanted to get the pistol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the soldiers left instead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant then delivered <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Gapilango's</span></span><span style=""> </span>revolver to the vice mayor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It <span style="">is </span>now
urged that appellant's conviction for assault upon an agent of a person in
authority, i.e., upon Esteban <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span>, a con­stabulary
soldier, was an error, the prosecution having failed utterly to show that appellant
knew that <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> was a soldier or an agent of a person
in authority when he disarmed him, which knowledge is essential for
conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. <span class="SpellE">Alvear</span>, 35 Phil. 625; Peo­ple v. <span class="SpellE">Rellin</span>, 77 Phil. 1033.) We find the contention meritorious.
Indeed, nowhere in the testimony of any of the prosecution wit­nesses can it be
found that appellant knew or ought to have known at the time he seized <span class="SpellE">Gapilango's</span> gun that the latter was a peace of­ficer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> revealed
his identity to ap­pellant only after the latter had dispossessed him of his
gun and he was asking it back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is </span>contended by the prosecution,
nonetheless, that appellant's act in pointing the revolver at <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> even after he was informed that he (<span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span>) was a peace officer constitutes direct
assault.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The whole trouble started when
appellant was unjustifiably roughed up by <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span>.
When appellant ran away, he was fol­lowed by <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> had his gun in hand
was perhaps not without reason considering that appellant's brother-in-law
appeared in the scene carrying firearms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant was able to wrest <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Gapi­</span>lango's</span> pistol.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While retreating, he warned <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span>,
together with <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span>, not to ad­vance or he would
shoot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this particular moment when
appellant could understandably be under <span style="">the
</span>apprehension that his pursuers, <span style="">one
of whom he still did not know to be a </span>constabulary soldier, were still
after him, <span style="">his act </span>of pointing
the <span style="">guns at them with </span>warning
not to come forward is not properly an act of intimidation but rather of
self-protection; appellant thereby hoped to dis­courage them from committing
any rash action or violence against his person.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> <span style="">asked for the return of his </span>gun, identifying himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant did not give the gun back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The
evidence does </span>not show whether or not, af­ter knowing of <span class="SpellE">Gapilango's</span> identity, appellant continued to point the gun
at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There <span style="">is </span>no question, however, that he thereafter went home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstance, it cannot be <span style="">said </span>with certainty that there was on
the <span style="">part </span>of appellant a palpable
intent or determination <span style="">to defy </span><span style="">a law </span>officer and therefore his
failure to heed <span class="SpellE">Gapilango's</span> <span style="">order to </span>return <span style="">the </span>re­volver
constitutes merely resistance and serious disobedience. (See <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. <span class="SpellE">Tabiana</span> and <span class="SpellE">Canillas</span>, 37
Phil. 515; People v. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Lapitan</span></span><span style="">, 58 Phil. 774; </span>People v. Reyes, 40
O.G. (118) No. 15, 24.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As above shown, appellant also pointed a revolver at <span class="SpellE">Rosalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> and threatened to
shoot him if he advanced. The trial court considered this <span style="">as </span>constituting grave threat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ap­pellant claims that <span style="">when he saw his </span>brother-in-law
carrying firearms, he ran towards him and told him to go home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution, on the other hand, asserts
that when he ran away he told <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> to wait and he
would get his gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That appellant said
this seems doubtful in the light of <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span>' own
statement that <span style="">when </span><span style="">ap­pellant </span><span style="">ran away, </span>he did <span style="">not </span>follow
the latter anymore because he thought that they were <span style="">paci­</span>fied already.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mad
appellant really told <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> that he would get his
gun, the latter would not have the impression that the incident was already
closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The picture as we <span style="">see </span>it seems to be <span style="">that when <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span>
saw </span>appellant's brother-in-law carrying guns, <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span>,
with <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span>, went af­ter appellant to prevent him
from getting hold of the weapons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant, who had just been subjected to unwarranted violence by <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span>, on his part, thought that he would be at tacked
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it is not farfetched, as we
have observed above, that the purpose of appellant <span style="">in </span>pointing the gun at <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> was to
protect himself from what he thought was an impending aggression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is evident from appellant's warning to <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> not to come near him while at the same time retreat­ing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The essence of threat is intimidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's act, in this particular case,
cannot be considered an act of intimidation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Appellant was also held guilty of grave disobedience in refusing
to return <span class="SpellE">Gapilango's</span> pistol to Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Buñag</span> despite the latter's order <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution would like it to appear that
Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Buñag</span> did nothing but de­mand from appellant the
gun and that appellant, instead of obeying this lawful order, defied and
challenged him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense, on the
other hand, would like us to believe that Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Buñag</span>
employed unnecessary violence in the perform­ance of his duty and therefore he
exceeded the limit of his authority and ceased to be a peace officer from that
moment and appellant was justified in disobeying him, nay even in repelling the
aggression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Dumo</span>, 400. O.G. (58) No. 9, 58). There is reason to be­lieve
the claim of appellant that Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Buñag</span> used
unnecessary force in demanding the return of the revolver. Appellant declared
that Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Buñag</span>, upon arriving at his house, collared
him and shook him violently and in a harsh tone said, 'will you give me the
pistol or not?' In his testimony, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Buñag</span> stated
that when he arrived, he approached appellant, 'touching his collar and tapping
his shoulder,' and asked for <span class="SpellE">Gapilango's</span> gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also stated that 'when I was holding his
collar' appellant uttered angry words.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <span class="SpellE">asing</span> for the pistol, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Buñag</span> did not have to 'touch' or 'hold' appellant's
collar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If by using adequate means to
repel the unlawful aggression of<span style=""> </span>Sgt.
<span class="SpellE">Buñag</span>, <span style="">appellant
would be merely acting in self-de­fense and therefore free from any criminal
liability (People v. <span class="SpellE">Dumo</span>, supra), then he could not
be guilty of disobedience in just declining to return the gun without using
force or violence."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find merit in the contention of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We gather, from a reading of the decision of
the Court of Ap­peals, that the petitioner was acquitted of the charge of grave
threats against the person of <span class="SpellE">Rosalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> upon the ground that when he pointed a gun at <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> his act did not constitute an act of intimidation,
which is an essential element in the crime of grave threats, but was simply an
act of self-defense, to prevent <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> and Es­teban <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> from getting nearer to him while he (pe­titioner)
was at the same time retreating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court of Appeals said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Appellant
was able to wrest <span class="SpellE">Gapilango's</span> pistol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While retreating, he warned <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span>, together <span style="">with
<span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span>, not to advance or he would shoot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this particular moment when appellant
could understandably be under the apprehension that his pursuers, one of whom
he still did not know to be a constabulary soldier, were still after him, his
act of pointing the guns at them with warning not to come forward is not
properly an act of intimidation but rather of self protection; appellant
thereby hoped to discourage them from committing any rush action or violence
against his person." The Court of Ap­peals further said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant, who had just been subject­ed to
unwarranted violence by <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span>, on his part, thought
that he would be attacked again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
it is not far­fetched, as we have observed above, that the purpose of the
appellant in pointing the gun at <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> was to
protect himself from what he thought was an impending aggression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is evident from appellant's warning to <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> not to come near him while at the same time

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals found that the petitioner did not know that <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> was a soldier when he disarmed <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is

that appellant knew or ought to have known at the time he seized <span class="SpellE">Gapilango's</span> gun that the latter was a peace officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> revealed
his iden­tity to appellant only after the latter had dispossessed <span style="">him of his gun and he was asking it back."
The petition­</span>er, at that particular moment, had two guns, one in each
hand - his own pistol and the pistol that he had wrested <span style="">from <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals </span>considered the
act <span style="">of the petitioner of pointing the
guns at <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ga­<span style="">pilango</span></span></span> as an act of
self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is why the Court of
Appeals did <span style="">not find the </span>petitioner
guilty of grave threats against the person of <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span>,
and of assault a­gainst <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> as an agent of a
person in <span style="">authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But </span>while the Court of Appeals had
declared that under those circumstances the petitioner had not committed the
crime <span style="">of assault against an agent of a
person in authority he had, however, committed the crime of resistance and
serious </span>disobedience against the agent of a person in authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason of the Court of Appeals in finding
that <span style="">the </span>petitioner had
committed the crime <span style="">of </span>resistance
and se­rious disobedience is because he did not return the gun of <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> after <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> had
identified <span style="">himself </span>as a
constabulary soldier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection,
this is what the Court of Appeals said:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"At this particular moment when appellant could understandably be
under the apprehension that his pursuers, one of whom he still did <span style="">not </span>know to be a constabulary soldier,
were still after him, his act of pointing the gun at them with <span style="">warning not </span>to <span style="">come forward is not properly an </span>act of intimidation <span style="">but </span>rather of self protection;
appellant thereby hoped to <span style="">discourage
them from </span>committing any rush action or vio­<span style="">lence </span>against his person. <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span>
asked for the return <span style="">of his </span>gun,
identifying himself. Appellant did not give the gun back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence does not show whether or not,
after knowing <span class="SpellE">Gapilango's</span> identity, appellant
continued to point the gun at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is no question, however, that he thereafter went home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstance, it cannot be said
with certainty that there was on the part of appellant a palpable intent or
determination to defy a law officer and therefore his failure to heed <span class="SpellE">Ga­pilango's</span> order to return the revolver constitutes
merely resistance and serious <span style="">disobedience."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is urged by the petitioner that there is no po­sitive finding
by the Court <span style="">of </span>Appeals that <span style="">in </span>failing to obey <span class="SpellE">Gapilango's</span>
demand for the return of his gun peti­<span style="">tioner
intended </span>to resist <span style="">or seriously
disobey said <span class="SpellE">Ga<span style="">pilango</span></span></span>
in his capacity as an agent of a person in author­ity engaged in the
performance of his official duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner maintains that the particular act for which the petitioner was held
guilty by the Court of Ap­peals - that is, his failure to return the gun - was
but one of a series of acts done in self-defense and/or un­der a mistake of
fact, one act following the other close­ly in point of time, all arising from
the same incident and each one performed under the same impulse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The peti­tioner points out that <span class="SpellE">Gapilango's</span> demand for the return of the gun and
petitioner's refusal to deliver the same happened immediately after the
struggle for the gun and the warning made by petitioner to <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> not to advance any farther or he would
shoot, and that was at a time when, as the Court of Appeals had found, the
petitioner was understandably under the apprehension that his pursuers were
still after him.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find merit in the stand of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let it be noted that, as the Court of Appeals
itself had found, the petitioner did not know that <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span>
was a constabulary soldier at the time when he grabbed <span class="SpellE">Gapilango's</span>
gun and at the time when he started pointing the guns at both <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals had found this act of
petitioner in pointing the guns at both <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> as an act of self-protection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the petitioner was pointing the guns at <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> he was
retreating and at the same time warning them not to approach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under that circumstance We consider that the
refusal of the petitioner to return the gun to <span class="SpellE">Gapi­lango</span>
was but one of the series of acts on his part to protect himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under that circumstance <span style="">it </span>cannot rea­sonably be said that he
meant to defy, or resist, or disobey an agent of a person in authority who was
in the per­formance of his official duties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What assurance had the petitioner at that precise moment, immediately
after he had a struggle with <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> for the
possession of the latter's gun and while he was pointing that gun to <span class="SpellE">Gapi­lango</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span>, that <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> was really a peace of­ficer?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence shows that <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span>
was in civilian clothes, he did not exhibit any badge - he simply identi­fied
himself verbally after the petitioner had wrested his gun from him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The refusal of petitioner to return <span class="SpellE">Gapi­lango's</span> gun was but a continuation of his efforts to
de­fend himself from whatever harm that could come from both <span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, the peti<span style="">tioner had reason to believe that once he had
returned the gun to <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span>
would use that gun against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
refusal to return the gun was what any reasonable person would have done under
the situa­tion that the petitioner found himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We agree with the
petitioner that in the decision of the Court of Appeals there is no positive
finding that the petitioner intended to resist or seriously disobey an agent of
a person in authority while engaged in the per­formance of official
duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, there </span>is <span style="">no posi­tive finding that when the petitioner
refused to return <span class="SpellE">Gapilango's</span> gun he believed that <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> was a consta­bulary soldier, and that the
petitioner knew that <span class="SpellE">Gapi­<span style="">lango</span></span></span> was at the time performing his official
duties as <span style="">a peace officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We accept the <span class="SpellE">hyphotesis</span>
offered by </span>counsel for the <span style="">petitioner
</span>that <span style="">the petitioner </span>had
reason <span style="">to suspect that <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span> </span>was <span style="">helping
<span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span>, because right at the start of the incident
between </span><span class="SpellE">Jagmis</span> <span style="">and the petitioner at </span>the store of <span style="">Ramon <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> <span class="SpellE">Gapilango</span>
</span>did not <span style="">identify himself as a
peace officer and both of </span>them pursued the petitioner from the store.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Before </span>a person
can be held guilty of the crime of resistance or <span style="">disobedience to a person in </span>authority or <span style="">the agent of such person </span>it must be shown <span style="">beyond reason</span>able doubt that the
accused knew that <span style="">the person he disobeyed
or resisted is </span>a <span style="">person in
authority or the agent of such person who is actually </span><span style="">engaged in the </span><span style="">performance </span><span style="">of </span>his
official duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is punished as an
act of re<span style="">sistance or serious
disobedience under the Revised Penal </span>Code is not the resistance <span style="">or disobedience against a per</span>son in
authority or an agent of such <span style="">person in
</span>his capa<span style="">city </span>as a <span style="">private individual but in </span>his official
capacity as an authority under the law, or as agent of the law, <span style="">while engaged in the performance of his
official duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The facts as
narrated in the decision of the <span style="">Court </span>of
Appeals engender in the mind a serious doubt as to whether or not the
petitioner had the intention <span style="">to resist
and dis</span>obey a peace officer who was in the performance of his official
duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That doubt must be resolved in
favor of the <span style="">petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, </span>We hold that the Court
of Appeals erred when <span style="">in case CA-G. R.
No. 00528-R it </span>found the petitioner guilty of the crime of resistance
and serious disobedience as defined in Article 151 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals under
review, insofar <span style="">as </span>it relates to
case CA-G. R. No. 00528-R which is now before this Court on appeal in case G.
R. No. L-20247, should be, as it is hereby reversed, and the petitioner is
thereby acquitted of the crime of resistance and serious disobedience of which
