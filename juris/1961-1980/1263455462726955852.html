filed on April 1, 1960 with the <span style="">Court </span>of
First <span style="">Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>
(civil case 2749) by the </span><span style="">spous­</span>es
<span class="SpellE">Melquiades</span> <span class="SpellE">Raagas</span> and Adele
<span class="SpellE">Laudiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Raagas</span> <span style="">against </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Oct</span>avi<span style="">o</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Traya</span>, his wife, and <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Canciller</span>, alleges <span style="">in
</span><span style="">essence </span>that on or about
April 9, 1958, while the latt<span style="">er </span>was
"recklessly" driving a truck owned <span style="">by his co-defendants, along the public </span>highway in <span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, the <span style="">said </span>vehicle ran over the plaintiffs'
three-year old <span style="">son </span><span class="SpellE">Regino</span>, <span style="">causing his
</span>instantaneous death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
plaintiffs ask for actual damages in the sum of P10,000, moral, no<span style="">minal and corrective </span>damages in a sum
to be determined by the court, P1,000 as <span style="">attorney's
fees, </span><span style="">P1,000 </span><span style="">for </span>expenses of litigation, plus
costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their answer with counterclaim for moral <span style="">and ac­</span>tual damages and attorney's fees,
filed on April 22, the defendants specifically deny that <span class="SpellE">Canciller</span>
was "driving recklessly" at the time of the mishap, and assert that
the truck "was fully loaded and was running at a very low speed and on the
right side of the road"; that it was the child who "rushed from an
unseen position and bumped the truck so that he was hit by the left rear tire
of the said truck and died", and consequently the defendants are not to
blame for the accident which was "entirely attributable to an unforeseen
event" or due to the fault of the child and negligence of <span style="">his </span>parents; that the
defendants-spouses have exercised due diligence in the selection and supervi­sion
of their driver <span class="SpellE">Canciller</span>, whom they hired in 1946
only after a thorough study of his background as a truck driver; and that each
time they allowed him to drive it was only after a check of his physical
condition and the mechanical fitness of the truck assigned to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 4 the plaintiffs' moved for a judgment on the pleadings,
upon the claim that the defendants' answer not only "failed to tender an
issue" but as well "admitted ma­terial allegations" of the
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion <span style="">was </span>set for hearing on June 18.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the previous day, however, the clerk of
court received a telegram from the defendants' counsel, requesting for
postponement of the hearing to July 2 on the ground that he was sick of <u><span style="">influenza</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The lower court denied
the request for lack of "proper notice to the adverse party" and
considered the case submitted for decision upon the filing of the plaintiffs'
memorandum.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 24 it rendered <span style="">a </span>judgment
on the pleadings, con­demning the defendants, jointly and severally, to pay
"to the plaintiffs the sum of P10,000 for the death of their child <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> <span class="SpellE">Laudiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Raagas</span>, P2,000 for moral damages, P1,000 actual damages,
P1,000 for attorney's fees, and the costs."</p>

<p class="BODY">The court reasoned that the denial in the answer of the charge of
reckless driving "did not affect the plaintiffs' positive al<span style="">l</span>egation in their complaint that the
truck * * * did not have a current year registration <span style="">plate * * * </span>for the year <span style="">1958
</span>when the accident occurred," that "this failure * * * has the
effect of admitting hypothetically that they operated * * * the said car
without proper license * * * when the accident occurred," and that "unless
there is proof to the contrary, it is presumed that a person driving a motor
vehicle has been negligent <span style="">if </span>at
the time of the mishap, he was violating any traffic regulation (article 2185
new Civil Code)." The court went on to conclude that under the cir­cumstances
a judgment on the pleadings was "irremediably pro per and fitting."</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified
the case to this Court because the issues raised are purely of <span style="">law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 10 of Rule <span style="">35 </span>of
the old Rules of Court<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
authorized a judgment on the pleadings "where an answer fails to tender an
issue, or otherwise admits the material allegations of the <span style="">adverse </span>party's pleading."</p>

<p class="BODY">The vital issue, therefore, to which the other issues are
subsidiary or interstitial, is whether the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> acted
correctly when it rendered judgment on the pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is our view that the court erred.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiffs' claim for actual, moral, nominal and <span style="">cor­rective </span>damages, was <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> by the averment in the <span style="">answer to </span>the effect that the defendants "have no knowledge
or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the
allegations" as to such damages, "the truth of the matter <span style="">being </span>that the death of <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> <span class="SpellE">Raagas</span> was occasioned by
an unforeseen event and/or by the fault of the small boy <span class="SpellE">Regino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Raagas</span> or his parents." Such averment has the
effect of tendering a valid issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We so
held in <u>Philippine National Bank vs. </u><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Lacson</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>L-94<span style="">19, </span>May 29, <span style="">1957 </span>and
in <u>Benavides </u><u><span style="">vs. </span></u><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Alabastro</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>L- 19762<span style="">, </span>Dec. <span style="">23, </span>1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Abubakar</u></span><u>
Tan </u><u><span style="">vs. <span class="SpellE">Tian</span>
Ho</span></u><span style="">, </span>L-18820, December
29, <span style="">1962 </span>and <u>Lim <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> Cigar and
Cigarette</u><u><span style=""> </span>Factory</u>,
L-15861, April 16<span style="">, 1960, </span>we held
that even if the allegations regarding t<span style="">he
</span><span style="">amount </span>of <span style="">damages in the complaint are not specifically
de</span>nied in the answer, such damages are not deemed admitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Tomassi</u></span><u> vs.</u></span><u> Villa-<span class="SpellE">Abrille</span></u>, L-7047, August 21, 1958, <span class="SpellE"><u>Suntay</u></span><u>
</u><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Tan</span>jangco</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Jovellanos</span>, et al</u>, L-12332, June 30, <span style="">1960, </span>and <span class="SpellE"><u>Delfin</u></span><u>
vs. Court of Agrarian Relations, et al</u>, <span style="">L</span>-<span style="">23348, March 14, 1967,
1967A PHILD 453, we declared in no uncertain terms </span>that actual damages
must be proved, and that a court cannot rely on "specu­lation, conjecture
or guesswork" as to the fact and amount <span style="">of </span>damages, but must depend on actual proof that damages had <span style="">been </span>suffered <span style="">and </span>on evidence of <span style="">the
actual amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Malonzo</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>, et
al</u>, <span style="">L</span>-<span style="">13851, </span><st1:date year="1960" day="27" month="7">July 27, <span style="">1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>we reaf­firmed the rule that
although <span style="">an allegation is </span>not
necessary in order that moral damages may be awarded, "it <span style="">is, never</span>theless, essential that the
claimant satisfactorily prove the existence of the factual basis of the damage
and its causal relation to defendant's acts."</p>

<p class="BODY">The preceding disquisition points up the inescapable need of a
full-blown trial on the merits at which the par­ties will be afforded every
opportunity to present evidence <span style="">in </span>support
of their respective contentions and defenses.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment on the pleadings of <st1:date year="1960" day="24" month="6">June 24, 1960</st1:date>, is set aside, and this
case is hereby remanded to the court of origin for trial on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
