				<BR><STRONG>MUNOZ PALMA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In a letter-complaint dated July 12, 1973, and filed with Hon. Juan Ponce Enrile, Secretary of National Defense, Remedios I. Jugueta, charged Judge Alejandro R. Boncaros of the Court of First Instance, Branch IV, Tarlac, with "favoring and/or giving undue interest in favor of the accused in Criminal Case No. 526" which was pending before said Judge.&nbsp; The complaint was forwarded to this Court for disposition pursuant to Sec. 6, Art. X of the 1973 Constitution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and upon receipt thereof, We required respondent Judge to answer, after which the case was referred to Hon. Justice Pacifico de Castro of the Court of Appeals for investigation, report and recommendation.<br><br>The following incidents are not in dispute:<br><br>Marissa Jugueta was the offended party in a criminal complaint for rape filed with the Court of First Instance of Tarlac against Ruben Domingo.&nbsp; (Criminal Case 526) The case was set for hearing on June 6, 1973, in Branch IV presided by respondent Judge Boncaros.&nbsp; Before the trial, the prosecuting fiscal, Wilfredo Macaraeg, called the accused, Ruben Domingo, and the offended party, Marissa Jugueta, to the chambers of Judge Boncaros.&nbsp; Marissa's mother, Remedios Jugueta, who was in the Courtroom was not however invited by the Fiscal to be present at the conference.&nbsp; Ruben and Marissa seated themselves in front of the table of Judge Boncaros who at the time was seated by his desk.&nbsp; Ruben talked to Marissa and proposed marriage but Marissa declined the offer.&nbsp; After a brief conversation, Marissa stood up to leave the room and when she was near the door Ruben kissed her on the cheek.&nbsp; Seeing that act of Ruben, Judge Boncaros remarked:&nbsp; "<i>Bakit sa pisngi hindi sa labi</i>" meaning:&nbsp; "why the cheek not the lips." Marissa reported what transpired inside the chambers of the Judge including the remark of the latter, to her mother Remedios Jugueta, who at that time was in the courtroom waiting for the trial of Marissa's complaint.&nbsp; Believing that the prosecuting fiscal and the trial Judge were favoring the accused, Ruben Domingo, as shown in their attempt to settle amicably the criminal case, Remedios Jugueta filed the instant complaint against Judge Boncaros.<br><br>At the hearing conducted by Justice Pacifico de Castro, Remedios Jugueta did not appear; however, her husband, Alfonso Jugueta was present and manifested that he was representing his wife who was no longer interested in proceeding with the complaint especially since respondent Judge had inhibited himself from trying the rape case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Notwithstanding this manifestation, the Investigator proceeded to hear the testimony of Marissa Jugueta concerning the incident complained of, and that of respondent.&nbsp; On the basis of his investigation, Justice de Castro recommends the dismissal of the complaint for lack of merit.<br><br>Although we concur with the findings of Justice Pacifico de Castro that the incident of June 6, 1973, inside the chambers of respondent Judge is not sufficient to substantiate the complaint that respondent was "favoring the accused Ruben Domingo" in the rape case, nevertheless, there are certain aspects of respondent's actuations which call for an admonition from this Court.<br><br>In his testimony given before the Investigator, respondent claims that he simply allowed the fiscal to call the accused and the offended party for a talk inside his office, that he did not take part in their conversation and so he was not aware of any proposal of marriage, and that when he made that remark "<i>bakit sa pisngi hindi sa labi</i>" he did so in anger when he saw Ruben kiss Marissa.<br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was it wise, prudent or discreet of respondent to allow the use of his chambers for a "talk" or conference between the prosecuting fiscal, the accused, and the victim of the rape case, in the absence of the latter's parent, she being a minor of seventeen years of age?&nbsp; Did not respondent by his act expose himself and the high office he holds to the suspicion that he was interested and was intervening in the settlement of the criminal complaint, for what could possibly be a reason for such a talk between the accused and the girl if it were not to explore such a possibility?&nbsp; The use of some amount of prudence would have deterred respondent from tolerating the act of the prosecuting fiscal in bringing together the parties in that criminal case to the exclusion of the victim's mother who all the time was in the courtroom, especially since under the law it is the marriage of the offender to the offended party which extinguishes the criminal action,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and in this particular case, no marriage could have taken place without the parents' consent inasmuch as the victim of the rape case was below eighteen years of age.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> True enough, during their conversation in the chambers of respondent, Ruben Domingo offered to marry Marissa and to give her everything he wanted, but his proposal was rejected by the girl.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When, upon seeing Ruben kiss Marissa on that occasion respondent said:&nbsp; "<i>bakit sa pisngi hindi sa labi</i>", did he do so in an outburst of anger as claimed by him, or did he not say it by way of a frivolous remark?&nbsp; Respondent's assertion that he uttered those words because he was indignant over the act committed by Ruben inside his office is unbelievable and borders on the ridiculous.&nbsp; Ire and indignation would have resulted in utterances, such as:&nbsp; "How dare you do that in my presence?" or "Don't you ever do that again in my office?", but surely not as what respondent said:&nbsp; "Why on the cheek not on the lips." For by those words respondent obviously encouraged rather than condemned the act of Ruben in kissing Marissa and, as a matter of fact, for him the kiss on the cheek was not even enough.&nbsp; Under the circumstances, we look upon this remark of respondent Judge not only uncalled for but also of unbecoming levity, offensive to and inconsiderate of the aggrieved feelings of the rape victim, Marissa.<br><br>One who occupies an exalted position in the administration of justice must pay a high price for the honor bestowed upon him, for his private as well as his official conduct must at all times be free from the appearance of impropriety.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Here, respondent failed.<br><br>Wherefore, this administrative complaint against respondent Judge Alejandro R. Boncaros is dismissed.&nbsp; We, however, admonish respondent to observe at all times a norm of conduct which will inspire the community he serves with respect for and confidence in the office he holds.<br><br><br><i>Makalintal, C.J., Castro, Teehankee,</i> and <i>Esguerra, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Makasiar, J., </i>is on leave.<br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Art.
