				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Under date of July &nbsp;16, 1963, respondent &nbsp;Reinsurance Company of the &nbsp;Orient, Inc. filed a manifestation to the effect that the purpose of this case for certiorari is to prevent the eviction of petitioner Arsenio Veluz from the premises involved in Civil Case No. 96678 &nbsp;of the Municipal Court of &nbsp;Manila &nbsp;entitled Reinsurance Company of the Orient, Inc.<span style="font-style: italic;"> vs</span>. Arsenio Veluz, etc., &nbsp;later appealed to the Court of First &nbsp;Instance of Manila (Civil &nbsp;Case &nbsp;No. 50962) and ultimately to the Court of Appeals (C.A.â€”G.R. No. 31295-R); that in the month of May 1963, petitioner herein-defendant in the case already mentioned-vacated the leased premises without paying to the lessor or depositing in court the &nbsp;March to May 1963 rentals; that the appeal interposed by him in the &nbsp;Court of Appeals &nbsp;was dismissed on &nbsp;July &nbsp;9, 1963 for his failure to file his brief. <p>Upon &nbsp;the &nbsp;foregoing &nbsp;facts, the respondent &nbsp;Reinsurance Company of the Orient, Inc. prays for the dismissal of the present case on the &nbsp;ground that it has become moot. &nbsp;In view &nbsp;of the &nbsp;above facts, petitioner was required by our resolution of August 6, 1963 to comment, within ten (10) days &nbsp;from &nbsp;notice, &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;aforesaid manifestation, &nbsp;said resolution &nbsp;having been served on his counsel on August 10, 1963. This notwithstanding, petitioner has not filed any comment up to this date.</p> <p>Wherefore, finding the petition well founded, the present case is dismissed, with costs.</p> <p><i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, &nbsp;Concepcion, &nbsp;Paredes, Regala</i> &nbsp;and <i>Makalintal, JJ.</i> concur.</p> </div>
