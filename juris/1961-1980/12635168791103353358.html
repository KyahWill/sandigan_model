				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">In this special civil
action, the petitioners seek a writ of cer­tiorari to annul two (2) orders of
Honorable Pedro J1. Bautista, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Branch III, dated June 19 and </span><st1:date year="1967" day="22" month="7"><span style="">July 22,
 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon after the filing of the petition herein,
we issued an order restraining respondent Judge from enforcing his order of </span><st1:date year="1967" day="19" month="6"><span style="">June 19,
 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">, and from
acting upon a motion of Perfecto Burgos and <span class="SpellE">Alejandra</span>
Marquez, dated </span><st1:date year="1967" day="11" month="7"><span style="">July 11, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioners herein
were defendants in a forcible entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> of the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, filed, </span>on
<st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1966</st1:date>, by the
spouses Perfecto Burgos and <span class="SpellE">Alejandra</span> Marquez,
hereinafter referred to as respondents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In their complaint, the latter alleged that they are lessees of the
Philippine National Railways (PNR) "and/or persons entitled to the
possession" of a strip of land, of about 3, 215 square meters, of the <span class="SpellE">Paco-Naic</span> Abandoned Railroad Line, in the Barrio of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. <span class="SpellE">Niño</span>, Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>; and
that, in the evening of September 24, 1966, <span style="">pe</span>titioners herein, through force, intimidation, threats, strategy
and stealth, took possession of portions of said land of about 20 square meters
each, and proceeded to construct thereon make-shift houses, which portions they
refused to vacate despite repeated demands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After appropriate proceedings, the municipal court rendered a decision,
on January 5, 1967, commanding petitioners herein to vacate the premises in
question and restore the possession thereof to the herein respondents, as well
as to pay a monthly rental of P40.00 each, from September 24, 1966 until the
premises are vacated, and the sum of P500, by way of attorney's fees, in
addition to the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon thereafter,
this deci­sion was set aside to give petitioners a "last opportunity"
to introduce additional evidence, upon the reception of which, on February 28,
1967, the municipal court reproduced the findings made in its decision of
January 5, and reiterated the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, petitioners filed a motion, dated <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1967</st1:date>, praying, in effect,
that the monthly rentals to be paid by each of them be reduced "and that
the amount of <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond be correspondingly
based thereon." Acting upon this motion, which was treated as one for
reconsideration, on <st1:date year="1967" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1967</st1:date>,
the court amended its decision of <st1:date year="1967" day="28" month="2">February
 28, 1967</st1:date>, by reducing said monthly rentals from P40 to P10
each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two (2) days later, petitioners
moved that they be allowed to appeal as pauper litigants and that the monthly
deposits to be made by them be fixed at the same amount that respondents
"would otherwise pay the Philippine National Railways for the same
lot." In an order, dated March 16, 1967, petitioners were allowed to
appeal as pauper litigants, without payment of the appellate docket fee and
"the necessary appeal bond," and the clerk of court was directed to
transmit the records of the case to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City Branch, where
it was docketed as Civil Case No. 2977-P.</p>

<p class="BODY">Over a month later, or on <st1:date year="1967" day="19" month="4">April
 19, 1967</st1:date>, respondents filed, with the latter Court, presided over
by Judge Bautista, a petition for the immediate execution of the appealed
decision, for failure of peti­tioners to file a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span>
bond and to deposit the monthly rentals that fell due during the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite petitioners' opposition thereto, on <st1:date year="1967" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1967</st1:date>, Judge Bautista issued
an order granting said petition and directing the issuance of the corresponding
writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1967</st1:date>, petitioners sought a
reconsideration of this order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents, in turn, filed a petition, bearing the same date, alleging
that, as Deputy Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tejones</span> had served upon the petitioners
copies of the writ of execution, issued on June 23, 1967, and given them ten
(10) days to vacate the portions respectively held by them, and that, despite
the expiration of said period, petitioners are still occupying said portions
and show no sign <span style="">of their intent to
leave the same, and praying, accordingly, that a special order be issued
directing the sheriff to demolish said houses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Soon thereafter, or on July 22, 1967, Judge Bautista denied the aforesaid
motion for reconsideration, in view of which, on September 29, 1967,
petitioners commenced the present special civil action against the respondents
and Judge Bautista, as well as deputy provincial sheriff <span class="SpellE">Tejones</span>,
to restrain the enforcement of the decision of the municipal court and annul
the aforementioned orders of June 19 and July 22, 1967.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners maintain that respondent Judge Bautista has com­mitted
a grave abuse of discretion in ordering the issuance of said writ of execution,
because although they had not filed the <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span>
bond required to suspend the execution of the decision of the municipal court,
this was due to an honest mistake or excusable negligence on their part, for
they had asked the municipal court to fix the amount of said bond and, yet, the
court did not do so, because of which, they entertained the honest belief that
they were relieved from the duty of filing the bond, until its amount shall
have been fixed by the court of first instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, Section 8 of Rule 70 of the Rules of Court
explicitly provides that "(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)f judgment is
rendered against the defendant" in a forcible entry case, "execution
shall issue immediately, unless an appeal has been perfected and the defendant
to stay execution files a sufficient bond, approved by the justice of the peace
or municipal court x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> to
enter the action in the Court of First Instance and to pay the rents, damages,
and costs accruing down to the time of the judgment." It has been
repeatedly held that the requirement of a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span>
bond is "mandatory"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> and
cannot be dispensed with by the courts<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a>; that, when
said bond is not filed, the duty of the court to order the execution of the
appealed decision is "ministerial and imperative"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a>; and that
the execution of the judgment shall then issue "immediately".<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The cases of <span class="SpellE">Tagulimot</span> v. Makalintal<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a> and <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> v. Court of
First Instance<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a> cited by the petitioners do not
support their pretense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first, we
declared that, although a court of first instance may, <u>in its discretion</u>,
give the interested party a reasonable time within which to file a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond or to replace a defective one<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> no abuse of discretion had been committed by the
court in <u>granting</u> the motion for execution, because no such bond had
been filed and appellant had not asked for time to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is worthy of notice that, subsequently
thereto, the <span class="SpellE">Tagulimots</span> <u>had filed</u> a bond,
which was, however, dis­allowed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, it
was held that the aforementioned discretion of the appellate court to allow or
disallow therein the filing of a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond had
<u>not</u> been abused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering
that, similarly, petitioners herein had <u>not</u> asked Judge Bautista to
grant them time to file a <span class="SpellE">super<span style="">sedeas</span></span><span style=""> bond,
before the issuance of the writ of execution complained </span>of; that, unlike
the <span class="SpellE">Tagulimots</span>, neither had petitioners herein filed
such bond up to now; that they merely asked for time to do so, over two (2)
weeks after the issuance of said writ; and that petitioners have not even
alleged, much less shown, that Judge Bautista had gravely abused his discretion
in denying their motion of July <span style="">11, </span>1967,
it is apparent that the <span class="SpellE">Tagulimot</span> case militates
against their pretense.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> case, <u>there was</u>
a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond, except that it was filed with the
court of first instance, instead of the muni­cipal court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the issue in that case was whether
the Judge of first instance had abused his discretion <u>in allowing</u> said
bond, and the Supreme Court resolved the question in the negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not fol­low from this that the Judge
would have committed a grave abuse of discretion <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span>
by certiorari had he <u>disallowed</u> said bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in the subsequent case of <span class="SpellE">Tagulimot</span>, it was ruled precisely that, since the appellate
court had <u>discretion</u> to allow or disallow the filing of a bond, it
follows that its choice in favor of the second alternative is not an abuse of
discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, such was the view
taken in <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> v. Court of Appeals.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Independently of the foregoing, it is not disputed that petitioners
herein had neither paid nor deposited the monthly rentals that had accrued
during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it is clear that respondent Judge had
neither abused his discretion nor committed an error of judgment, but merely
complied with his ministerial duty, under Section 8 of Rule 70 of the Rules of
Court, in ordering the issuance of the corresponding writ of execution.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Then, again, contrary to
the allegation in the petition herein, petitioners do not appear to have a
valid defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, their answer in
the municipal court alleges that respondents are not entitled to the possession
of the land in question, because their contract of lease with the PNR had ended
on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="12" month="7"><span style="">July 12, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their opposition to respondents' petition
for immediate execution, petitioners averred, however, that respondents had, in
1966, paid the back rentals for six years, which were seemingly accepted by the
PNR, thereby indicating that it had consented to a renewal of the lease
contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, petitioners
admitted, in their answer, that respondents had subsequently won in the bidding
for the purchase of the land in question, although the same had not, as yet,
been formally awarded to them (respondents).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a consequence, respondents are entitled to the possession of said
land, either as lessees thereof, or as its purchasers, if the award were
eventually formalized.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Regardless of the foregoing, in an action for forcible entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>, the main issue is one of priority of possession<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legal
right thereto is not essential to the possessor's cause of action, for no one
may take the law into his own hands and forcibly eject another or deprive him
of his possession by stealth, even if his title thereto were questionable<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> or actually disputed in another case<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
present case, both justice and equity are thus in favor of respon­dents herein.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the petition herein should be, as it is
hereby dismissed, and the writ prayed for denied, with costs against the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The restraining order issued by this Court,
on </span><st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="9"><span style="">September 30, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">, is, likewise, set aside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
