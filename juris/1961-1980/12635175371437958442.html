				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Appeal, on a question of law, from the order of
the Court of First Instance of Manila in its Special Proceedings No. 42412.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This case is one of the many incidents in the
testamentary proceedings for the settlement of the estate of the late Alejandro
Gonzales y <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner-Appellant Loreto <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>
(Gonzales) <span class="SpellE">Mangaliman</span>, <span class="GramE">an</span>
illegitimate daughter of Alejandro Gonzales y <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
was given a legacy of one-eighth (1/8) undivided portion of the Hacienda
Evangelista located at <span class="SpellE">Umingan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
having an area of 137 hectares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because
she was a minor when her father died, petitioner's share was placed under the
guardianship of her half-bro­ther, Alejandro Gonzales, Jr., a legitimate son of
the testator.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Manuel I. Gonzales
is a legiti­mate son of the testator, and was for some time the ad­ministrator
of the estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the payment of the
ser­vices of said respondent as administrator, it was agreed on <st1:date year="1943" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1943</st1:date> among the testator's
widow and legi­timate children that he would be paid the sum of P11<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
agreement was approved by the probate court on <st1:date year="1943" day="2" month="12">Decem­ber 2, 1943</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Alleging that he had not been paid his fee of P11<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
as provided in the compromise agreement, respondent filed before the probate
court a motion for execu­tion on <st1:date year="1948" day="28" month="7">July
 28, 1948</st1:date>, which motion was granted in an order issued by the court
on <st1:date year="1948" day="23" month="8">August 23, 1948</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually, on <st1:date year="1950" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1950</st1:date> the Hacienda Evangelista, which had
previously been levied on execution, was sold by the sheriff to res­pondent for
the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,307.46</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The one-year redemption period having elapsed without petitioner's
guardian having taken any step to redeem her undivided share of the hacien­da,
the sheriff executed, on <st1:date year="1951" day="31" month="10">October 31,
 1951</st1:date>, a final deed of sale in favor of respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">After coming of age, petitioner sought to recover her legacy by
filing a motion in the probate court to set aside the sale of the Hacienda
Evangelista.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having found, how­ever,
that her guardian was duly notified of such sale, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
denied her motion on <st1:date year="1954" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1954</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Peti­tioner did not appeal from this <span class="GramE">order,</span> instead she filed an action in the Court of First
Instance of Manila against her former guardian for damages for the loss of her
share in the hacienda (Civil Case No. 25986).<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Much later, or in April, 1962, petitioner allegedly learned that
before the sale to respondent of the Hacienda Evangelista, including her
one-eighth undivided share thereof, said respondent had actually been paid for
his services as administrator an amount more than the P11,000.00 claimed by
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contending that respondent, through
fraud and misrepresentations had obtained the order of payment for his services
and the subsequent writs of execution which ultimately led to his acquisition
of the property, thereby enriching himself at her expense, petitioner, on April
21, 1962, filed a petition before the same probate court for the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> to her of her one-eighth undivided share in
the Hacienda Evangelista by the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the filing by respondent of his opposition, and the respective
memorandum of the parties herein, the probate court, on <st1:date year="1962" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1962</st1:date>, issued an order, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"After considering the petition for re-conveyance of Loreto <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> (Gonzales) <span class="SpellE">Mangaliman</span>,
dated April 21, 1962, and the opposition thereto, dated May 14, 1962, of Manuel
Gonzales, in support of which oppo­sition said Manuel Gonzales filed his memo­randum
on September 12, of this year, and in reply to which Loreto <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>
(Gonzales) <span class="SpellE">Mangaliman</span> filed hers on October 24, same
year, the Court is of the opinion that in as much as the question of title or
ownership is involved, said Manuel Gonzales may not be divested of his title
within these probate proceedings but in an independent suit filed with a
competent court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence the present appeal by the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only question to be resolved in this appeal is, whether or
not the Court of First Instance of Manila, as a probate court, has jurisdiction
to entertain petitioner's petition for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the probate court has no jurisdiction to take
cognizance of the petition for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>, in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The remedy sought by
petitioner for the <span class="SpellE">recon­veyance</span> to her of her share
in the Hacienda Evangelista upon the ground that the same was acquired by
respondent through fraud or misrepresentation cannot be obtained by a mere
petition in the probate proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
court of first instance, acting as a probate court, has limited jurisdiction
and can take cognizance only of "matters of probate, both testate and intestate
estates, * * * and all such special cases and proceedings as are not other­wise
provided for."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The jurisdiction of a probate court is limited and special, and this should be
understood to comprehend only cases related to those powers specified in the
law, and can not extend to the adjudication of collateral matters.<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition filed by petitioner before the probate court which
seemingly seeks merely the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> to her of her
undivided share in a parcel of land which originally formed part of the estate
of her father in fact calls for the nullification, of the order of execu­tion
issued by the probate court which is already final, and of the subsequent sale
of a property to respondent, upon the alleged ground of fraud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense interposed by respondent is that
petitioner's action to recover the property is already barred by prescription, <span class="SpellE">laches</span>, and <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petition for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> has given rise to a
controversy involving rights over a real property which would require the presentation
of evidence and the determination of legal questions that should be ventilated
in a court of general jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, find no merit in this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order appealed from is affirmed, with­out
prejudice to petitioner-appellant's filing an action in the proper court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>
