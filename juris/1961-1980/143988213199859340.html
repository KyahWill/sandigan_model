				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE INTEGRATION OF THE BAR OF THE PHILIPPINES. JANUARY 9, 1973</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On December 1, 1972, the Commission on Bar Integration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> submitted its Report dated November 30, 1972, with the "earnest recommendation" — on the basis of the said <em>Report</em> and the proceedings had in Administrative Case No. 526<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court, and "consistently with the views and counsel received from its [the Commission's] Board of Consultants, as well as the overwhelming nationwide sentiment of the Philippine Bench and Bar" — that "<em>this Honorable Court ordain the integration of the Philippine Bar as soon as possible through the adoption and promulgation of an appropriate Court Rule</em>."<p></p><p>The petition in Adm. Case No. 526 formally prays the Court to order the integration of the Philippine Bar, after due hearing, giving recognition as far as possible and practicable to existing provincial and other local Bar associations. On August 16,1962, arguments in favor of as well as in opposition to the petition were orally expounded before the Court. Written oppositions were admitted,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and all parties were thereafter granted leave to file written memoranda.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p><p>Since then, the Court has closely observed and followed significant developments relative to the matter of the integration of the Bar in this jurisdiction.</p><p>In 1970, convinced from preliminary surveys that there had grown a strong nationwide sentiment in favor of Bar integration, the Court created the Commission on Bar Integration for the purpose of ascertaining the advisability of unifying the Philippine Bar.</p><p>In September, 1971, Congress passed House Bill No. 3277 entitled "An Act Providing for the Integration of the Philippine Bar, and Appropriating Funds Therefor." Hie measure was signed by President Ferdinand E. Marcos on September 17, 1971 and took effect on the same day as Rep. Act 6397. This law provides as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"SECTION 1. Within two years from the approval of this Act, the Supreme Court may adopt rules of court to effect the integration of the Philippine Bar under such conditions as it shall see fit in order to raise the standards of the legal profession, improve the administration of justice, and enable the Bar to discharge its public responsibility more effectively.&nbsp; </p><p>"SEC. 2. The sum of five hundred thousand pesos is hereby appropriated, out of any funds in the National Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to carry out the purposes of this Act. Thereafter, such sums as may be necessary for the same purpose shall be included in the annual appropriations for the Supreme Court.&nbsp; </p><p>"SEC. 3. This Act shall take effect upon its approval."</p></blockquote><p>The <em>Report</em> of the Commission abounds with arguments on the constitutionality of Bar integration and contains all necessary factual data bearing on the advisability {practicability and necessity) of Bar integration. Also embodied therein are the views, opinions, sentiments, comments and observations of the rank and file of the Philippine lawyer population relative to Bar integration, as well as a proposed integration Court Rule drafted by the Commission and presented to them by that body in a national Bar plebiscite. There is thus sufficient basis as well as ample material upon which the Court may decide whether or not to integrate the Philippine Bar at this time.</p><p>The following are the pertinent issues:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> (1) Does the Court have the power to integrate the Philippine Bar?</p><p> (2) Would the integration of the Bar be constitutional?</p><p> (3) Should the Court ordain the integration of the Bar at this time?</p></blockquote><p>A resolution of these issues requires, at the outset, a statement of the meaning of Bar integration. It will suffice, for this purpose, to adopt the concept given by the Commission on Bar Integration on pages 3 to 5 of its <em>Report</em>, thus:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Integration of the Philippine Bar means the official national unification of the entire lawyer population of the Philippines. This requires <em>membership </em>and<em> financial support</em> (in reasonable amount) of every attorney as conditions <em>sine qua non</em> to the practice of law and the retention of his name in the Roll of Attorneys of the Supreme Court.</p><p>"The term 'Bar' refers to the collectivity of all persons whose names appear in the Roll of Attorneys. An Integrated Bar (or Unified Bar) perforce must include all lawyers.&nbsp; </p><p>"Complete unification is not possible unless it is decreed by an entity with power to do so: the State. Bar integration, therefore, signifies the setting up by Governmental authority of a national organization of the legal profession based on the recognition of the lawyer as an officer of the court.</p><p>"Designed to improve the position of the Bar as an instrumentality of justice and the Rule of Law, integration fosters cohesion among lawyers, and ensures, through their own organized action and participation, the promotion of the objectives of the legal profession, pursuant to the principle of maximum Bar autonomy with minimum supervision and regulation by the Supreme Court.</p><p>"The purposes of an integrated Bar, in general, are:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"(1) Assist in the administration of justice;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>"(2) Foster and maintain on the part of its members high ideals of integrity, learning, professional competence, public service and conduct;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>"(3) Safeguard the professional interests of its members;</p>"(4) Cultivate among its members a spirit of cordiality and brotherhood;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>"(5) Provide a forum for the discussion of law, jurisprudence, law reform, pleading, practice and procedure, and the relations of the Bar to the Bench and to the public, and publish information relating thereto;&nbsp; </p><p>"(6) Encourage and foster legal education;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>"(7) Promote a continuing program of legal research in substantive and adjective law, and make reports and recommendations thereon; and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>"(8) Enable the Bar to discharge its public responsibility effectively.</p></blockquote><p>"Integration of the Bar will, among other things, make it possible for the legal profession to:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"(1) Render more effective assistance in maintaining the Rule of Law;&nbsp; </p><p>"(2) Protect lawyers and litigants against the abuses of tyrannical judges and prosecuting officers;&nbsp; </p><p>"(3) Discharge, fully and properly, its responsibility in the disciplining and/or removal of incompetent and unworthy judges and prosecuting officers;</p><p>"(4) Shield the judiciary, which traditionally cannot defend itself except within its own forum, from the assaults that politics and self-interest may level at it, and assist it to maintain its integrity, impartiality and independence;&nbsp; </p><p>"(5) Have an effective voice in the selection of judges and prosecuting officers;&nbsp; </p><p>"(6) Prevent the unauthorized practice of law, and break up any monopoly of local practice maintained through influence or position;</p><p>"(7) Establish welfare funds for families of disabled and deceased lawyers;&nbsp; </p><p>"(8) Provide placement services, and establish legal aid offices and set up lawyer reference services throughout the country so that the poor may not lack competent legal service;&nbsp; </p><p>"(9) Distribute educational and informational materials that are difficult to obtain in many of our provinces;&nbsp; </p><p>"(10) Devise and maintain a program of continuing legal education for practicing attorneys in order to elevate the standards of the profession throughout the country;&nbsp; </p><p>"(11) Enforce rigid ethical standards, and promulgate minimum fees schedules;</p><p>"(12) Create law centers and establish law libraries for legal research;&nbsp; </p><p>"(13) Conduct campaigns to educate the people on their legal rights and obligations, on the importance of preventive legal advice, and on the true functions and duties of the Filipino lawyer; and&nbsp; </p><p>"(14) Generate and maintain pervasive and meaningful countrywide involvement of the lawyer population in the solution of the multifarious problems that afflict the nation."</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Anent the <em>first issue</em>, the Court is of the view that it may integrate Philippine Bar in the exercise of its power, under Article VIII, Sec. 13 of (he Constitution, "to promulgate rules concerning pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts, and the admission to the practice of law." Indeed, the power to integrate is an inherent part of the Court's constitutional authority over the Bar. In providing that "the Supreme Court may adopt rules of court to effect the integration of the Philippine Bar," Republic Act 6397 neither confers a new power nor restricts the Court's inherent power, but is a mere legislative declaration that the integration of the Bar will promote public interest or, more specifically, will "raise the standards of the legal profession, improve the administration of justice, and enable the Bar to discharge its public responsibility more effectively.</p><p>Resolution of the <em>second issue</em> — whether the unification of the Bar would be constitutional—hinges on the effects of Bar integration on the lawyer's constitutional rights of freedom of association and freedom of speech, and on the nature of the dues exacted from him.</p><p>The Court approvingly quotes the following pertinent discussion made by the Commission on Bar Integration on pages 44 to 49 of its <em>Report</em>:</p><p align="center">"<em>Constitutionality of Bar Integration</em>&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"<em>Judicial Pronouncements.</em>&nbsp; </p><p>"In all cases where the validity of Bar integration measures has been put in issue, the Courts have upheld their constitutionality.</p>"The judicial pronouncements support this reasoning:&nbsp; <p>"— Courts have inherent power to supervise and regulate the practice of law.</p><p>"— The practice of law is not a vested right but a privilege; a privilege, moreover, clothed with public interest, because a lawyer owes duties not only to his client, but also to his brethren in the profession, to the courts, and to the nation; and takes part in one of the most important functions of the State, the administration of justice, as an officer of the court.&nbsp; </p><p>"— Because the practice of law is a privilege clothed with public interest, it is fair and just that the exercise of that privilege be regulated to assure compliance with the lawyer's public responsibilities.&nbsp; </p><p>"— These public responsibilities can best be discharged through collective action; but there can be no collective action without an organized body; no organized body can operate effectively without incurring expenses; therefore, it is fair and just that all attorneys be required to contribute to the support of such organized body; and, given existing Bar conditions, the most efficient means of doing so is by integrating the Bar through a rule of court that requires all lawyers to pay annual dues to the Integrated Bar.</p><p>"1. <em>Freedom of Association.</em></p><p>"To compel a lawyer to be a member of an integrated Bar is not violative of his constitutional freedom to associate (or the corollary right not to associate).</p><p>"Integration does not make a lawyer a member of any group of which he is not already a member. He became a member of the Bar when he passed the Bar examinations. All that integration actually does is to provide an official national organization for the well-defined but unorganized and incohesive group' of which every lawyer is already a member.</p><p>"Bar integration does not compel the lawyer to associate with anyone. He is free to attend or not attend the meetings of his Integrated Bar Chapter or vote or refuse to vote in its elections as he chooses. The only compulsion to which he is subjected is the payment of annual dues.</p><p>"Otherwise stated, membership in the Unified Bar imposes only the duty to pay dues in reasonable amount. The issue, therefore, is a question of compelled financial support of group activities, not involuntary membership in any other aspect.</p><p>"The greater part of Unified Bar activities serves the function of elevating the education and ethical standards of the Bar to the end of improving the quality of the legal service available to the people. The Supreme Court, in order to further the State's legitimate interest in elevating the quality of professional services, may require that the cost of improving the profession in this fashion be shared by the subjects and beneficiaries of the regulatory program — the lawyers.</p><p align="justify">"Assuming that Bar integration does compel a lawyer to be a member of the Integrated Bar, such compulsion is justified as an exercise of the police power of the State. The legal profession has long been regarded as a proper subject of legislative regulation and control. Moreover, the inherent power of the Supreme Court to regulate the Bar includes the authority to integrate the Bar.</p><p align="justify">"2. <em>Regulatory Fee</em>.</p><p>For the Court to prescribe dues to be paid by the members does not mean that the Court levies a tax.</p><p>"A membership fee in the Integrated Bar is an exaction for regulation, while the purpose of a tax is revenue. If the Court has inherent power to regulate the Bar, it follows that as an incident to regulation, it may impose a membership fee for that purpose. It would not be possible to push through an Integrated Bar program without means to defray the concomitant expenses. The doctrine of implied powers necessarily includes the power to impose such an exaction.</p><p>"The only limitation upon the State's power to regulate the Bar is that the regulation does not impose an unconstitutional burden. The public interest promoted by the integration of the Bar far outweighs the inconsequential inconvenience to a member that might result from his required payment of annual dues.</p><p>"3. <em>Freedom of Speech</em>.</p><p>"A lawyer is free, as he has always been, to voice his views on any subject in any manner he wishes, even though such views be opposed to positions taken by the Unified Bar.</p><p>"For the Integrated Bar to use a member's dues to promote measures to which said member is opposed, would not nullify or adversely affect his freedom of speech.</p><p>"Since a State may constitutionally condition the right to practice law^ upon membership in the Integrated Bar, it is difficult to understand why it should become unconstitutional for the Bar to use the member's dues to fulfill the very purposes for which it was established.</p><p>"The objection would make every Governmental exaction the material of a 'free speech' issue. Even the income tax would be suspect. The objection would cany us to lengths that have never been dreamed of. The conscientious objector, if his liberties were to be thus extended, might refuse to contribute taxes in furtherance of war or of any other end condemned by his conscience as irreligious or immoral. The right of private judgment has never yet been exalted above the powers and the compulsion of the agencies of Government.</p><p>"4. <em>Fair to All Lawyers</em>.</p><p>"Bar integration is not unfair to lawyers already practicing because although the requirement to pay annual dues is a new regulation, it will give the members of the Bar a new system which they hitherto have not had and through which, by proper work, they will receive benefits they have not heretofore enjoyed, and discharge their public responsibilities in a more effective manner than they have been able to do in the past. Because the requirement to pay dues is a valid exercise of regulatory power by the Court, because it will apply equally to all lawyers, young and old, at the time Bar integration takes effect, and because it is a new regulation in exchange for new benefits, it is not retroactive, it is not unequal, it is not unfair."</p></blockquote><p>To resolve the <em>third and final issue</em> — whether the Court should ordain the integration of the Bar at this time — requires a careful overview of the practicability and necessity as well as the advantages and disadvantages of Bar integration.</p><p>In many other jurisdictions, notably in England, Canada and the United States, Bar integration has yielded the following benefits: (1) improved discipline among the members of the Bar; (2) greater influence and ascendancy of the Bar; (3) better and more meaningful participation of the individual lawyer in the activities of the Integrated Bar; (4) greater Bar facilities and services; (5) elimination of unauthorized practice; (6) avoidance of costly membership campaigns; (7) establishment of an official status for the Bar; (8) more cohesive profession; and (9) better and more effective discharge by the Bar of its obligations and responsibilities to its members, to the courts, and to the public. No less than these salutary consequences are envisioned and in fact expected from the unification of the Philippine Bar.</p><p>Upon the other hand, it has been variously argued that in the event of integration, Government authority will dominate the Bar; local Bar associations will be weakened; cliquism will be the inevitable result; effective lobbying will not be possible; the Bar will become an impersonal Bar; and politics will intrude into its affairs.</p><p>It is noteworthy, however, that these and other evils prophesied by opponents of Bar integration have failed to materialize in over fifty years of Bar integration experience in England, Canada and the United States, In all the jurisdictions where the Integrated Bar has been tried, none of the abuses or evils feared has arisen; on the other hand, it has restored public confidence in the Bar, enlarged professional consciousness, energized the Bar's responsibilities to the public, and vastly improved the administration of justice.</p><p>How do the Filipino lawyers themselves regard Bar integration? The official statistics compiled by the Commission on Bar Integration show that in the <em>national poll</em> recently conducted by the Commission in the matter of the integration of the Philippine Bar, of a total of 15,090 lawyers from all over the archipelago who have turned in their individual responses, 14,555 (or 96.45 per cent) voted in favor of Bar integration, while 378 (or 2.51 per cent) voted against it, and 157 (or 1.04 per cent) are non-committal. In addition, a total of eighty (80) local Bar associations and lawyers' groups all over the Philippines have submitted resolutions and other expressions of unqualified endorsement and/or support for Bar integration, while not a single local Bar association or lawyers' group has expressed opposition thereto. Finally, of the 13,802 individual lawyers who cast their <em>plebiscite ballots</em> on the proposed integration Court Rule drafted by the Commission, 12,855 (93.14 per cent) voted in favor thereof, 662 (or 4.80 per cent) voted against it, and 285 (2.06 per cent) are non-committal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> All these clearly indicate an overwhelming nationwide demand for Bar integration at this time.</p><p>The Court is fully convinced, after a thoroughgoing conscientious study of all the arguments adduced in Adm. Case No. 526 and the authoritative materials and the mass of factual data contained in the exhaustive <em>Report</em> of the Commission on Bar Integration, that the integration of the Philippine Bar is "perfectly constitutional and legally unobjectionable," and, within the context of contemporary conditions in the Philippines, has become an imperative means to raise the standards of the legal profession, improve the administration of justice, and enable the Bar to discharge its public responsibility fully and effectively.</p><p>ACCORDINGLY, the Court, by virtue of the power vested in it by Section 13 of Article VIII of the Constitution, hereby ordains the integration of the Bar of the Philippines in accordance with the attached COURT RULE, effective on January 16, 1973.</p><p><em>Conception, C.J., Makalintal, Zaldivar, Ruiz Castro, Fernando, Teehankee, Barredo, Makasiar, Antonio, </em>and <em>Esguerra, JJ., </em>concur.</p><p align="center"><strong>RULE 139-A </strong></p><p align="center"><strong> INTEGRATED BAR OF THE PHILIPPINES</strong></p><p>SECTION 1. <em>Organization</em>.- There is hereby organized an official national body to be known as the "Integrated Bar of the Philippines," composed of all persons whose names now appear or may hereafter be included in the Roll of Attorneys of the Supreme Court.</p><p>SEC. 2. <em>Purposes</em>.- The fundamental purposes of the Integrated Bar shall be to elevate the standards of the legal profession, improve the administration of justice, and enable the Bar to discharge its public responsibility more effectively,</p><p>SEC. 3. <em>Regions</em>.- The Philippines is hereby divided into nine Regions of the Integrated Bar, to wit:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> (a) <em>Northern Luzon</em>, consisting of the provinces of Abra, Batanes, Benguet, Cagayan, Ifugao, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Isabela, Kalinga- Apayao, La Union, Mountain Province, Nueva Vizcaya, and Quirino;</p><p> (b) <em>Central Luzon</em>, consisting of the provinces of Bataan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Pangasinan, Tarlac, and Zambales.</p><p> (c) <em>Greater Manila</em>, consisting of the City of Manila and Quezon City;</p><p> (d) <em>Southern Luzon</em>, consisting of the provinces of Batangas, Cavite, Laguna, Marinduque, Occidental Mindoro, Oriental Mindoro, Quezon, and Rizal;</p><p> (e) <em>Bicolandia</em>, consisting of the provinces of Albay, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Catanduanes, Masbate, and Sorsogon;</p><p> (f) <em>Eastern Visayas</em>, consisting of the provinces of Bohol, Cebu, Eastern Samar, Leyte, Northern Samar, Samar, and Southern Leyte;</p><p> (g) <em>Western Visayas</em>, consisting of the provinces of Aklan, Antique, Capiz, Iloilo, Negros Occidental, Negros Oriental, Palawan, Romblon, and Siquijor;</p><p> (h) <em>Eastern Mindanao</em>, consisting of the provinces of Agusan del Norte, Agusan del Sur, Bukidnon, Camiguin, Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur, Davao Oriental, Misamis Oriental, Surigao del Norte, and Surigao del Sur; and</p><p> (i) <em>Western Mindanao</em>, consisting of the cities of Basilan and Zamboanga, and the provinces of Cotabato, Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Misamis Occidental, South Cotabato, Sulu, Zamboanga del Norte, and Zamboanga del Sur.</p><p> In the event of the creation of any new province, the Board of Governors shall, with the approval of the Supreme Court, determine the Region to which the said province shall belong.</p><p> Sec. 4. <em>Chapters</em>.- A Chapter of the Integrated Bar shall be organized in every province.
