				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Following the proclamation of martial law in the Philippines,
petitioner was arrested on September 23, 1972, pursuant to General Order No.
2-A of the President for complicity in a conspiracy to seize political and state
power in the country and to take over the Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was detained at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Fort</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
in <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> province.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1972" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1972</st1:date>,
he sued for a writ of habeas corpus<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
in which he questioned the legality of the proclamation of martial law and his
arrest and detention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court issued
a writ of habeas corpus, returnable to it, and required respondents to file
their respective answers, after which the case was heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the parties submitted their
memoranda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's last Reply
memorandum was dated <st1:date year="1972" day="30" month="11">November 30,
 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="17" month="9">September 17, 1974</st1:date>, this Court
dismissed the petition and upheld the validity of martial law and the arrest
and detention of petitioner.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, petitioner challenges the jurisdiction of
military commissions to try him, alone or together with others, for illegal
possession of firearms, ammunition and explosives, for violation of the
Anti-Subversion Act and for murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
charges are contained in six (6) amended charge sheets<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
filed on <st1:date year="1973" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1973</st1:date>
with Military Commission No. 2.</p>

<p class="BODY">The original petition in this case was filed on <st1:date year="1973" day="23" month="8">August 23, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It sought to restrain the respondent Military
Commission from proceeding with the hearing and trial of petitioner on <st1:date year="1973" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of the urgency of the petition, this
Court called a hearing on Sunday, August 26, on the question of whether with
its membership of only nine (9) Justices, it had a quorum to take cognizance of
the petition in view of the constitutional questions involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that hearing, this Court asked the parties
to agree to seek from the Military Commission a postponement of petitioner's
trial the following day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose was
to relieve the Court of the pressure of having to decide the question of quorum
without adequate time to do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the proceedings before the Military Commission opened the
following day, however, petitioner questioned the fairness of the trial and
announced that he did not wish to participate in the proceedings even as he
discharged both his defense counsel of choice and his military defense counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">The proceedings were thereupon adjourned to another day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, for the petitioner's
assurance, a Special Committee, composed of a retired Justice of the Supreme
Court, to be designated by the Chief Justice, as Chairman, and four (4) members
to be designated respectively by petitioner, the President of the Integrated
Bar of the Philippines, the Secretary of Justice and the Secretary of National
Defense, was created to reinvestigate the charges against petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Secretaries of Justice and National
Defense designated their representatives but the petitioner refused to name
his.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chief Justice asked former
Justice J.B.L. Reyes but the latter declined, as he also declined in his
capacity as President of the IBP to designate a representative to the
Committee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, with only two of
its members designated, the Special Committee has not been able to function.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1973</st1:date>,
a supplemental petition alleging the creation of the Special Committee and
questioning the legality of its creation was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and
the Secretary of Justice were included as respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the Court resolved to require
the respondents to file their answer and on <st1:date year="1974" day="21" month="8">August 21, 1974</st1:date>, within the extended period granted by the
Court, respondents, with the exception of the Chief Justice, filed their answer
to the supplemental petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, petitioner was required to file a reply and was
granted additional time after the lapse of the original period, but instead of
doing so, petitioner asked for the admission of a second supplemental petition
challenging the continued enforcement of martial law in the Philippines, in the
light of Presidential statements to the effect that with the coming into force
of the new Constitution on January 17, 1973, martial law was "technically
and legally" lifted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this
petition respondents answered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
the parties submitted their respective memoranda in lieu of oral argument as per
Resolution of this Court on <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="1">January
 14, 1975</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On March 24, 1975, petitioner filed an "Urgent Motion for
Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order Against Military Commission No.
2", praying that said Commission be prohibited from proceeding with the
perpetuation of testimony under its Order dated March 10, 1975, the same being
illegal, until further orders from the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1975</st1:date>,
respondents filed their Comment to petitioner's aforementioned urgent motion,
which motion and other related incidents were set for hearing on <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1975</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 a.m.</st1:time>, as per Resolution of this Court on <st1:date year="1975" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, or on <st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="4">April 1,
 1975</st1:date>, this Court issued a Resolution, stating that "for lack
of a necessary quorum", it could not act on petitioner's Urgent Motion for
Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order Against Military Commission No. 2,
inasmuch as this case involved a constitutional question.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1975</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a "Manifestation" stating, among others, that the
"Urgent Motion did not and does not involve a constitutional
question", for reasons stated therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 12, 1975, respondents filed their "Reply to
Petitioner's Manifestation", followed by Respondents' Manifestation filed
on April 14, 1975, attaching thereto fourteen (14) sworn statements of
witnesses whose testimonies are sought to be perpetuated.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1975</st1:date>,
this Court also issued a restraining order against respondent Military
Commission No. 2, restraining it from further proceeding with the perpetuation
of testimony under its Order dated <st1:date year="1975" day="10" month="3">March
 10, 1975</st1:date> until the matter is heard and further orders are issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">When this case was called for hearing, petitioner's counsel
presented to this Court a motion to withdraw the petition, as well as all other
pending matters and/or incidents in connection therewith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents' counsel interposed objections to
the granting of the aforesaid motion to withdraw.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the hearing, this Court Resolved:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"(a) to require the Solicitor General to
furnish the Court as well as the petitioner and the latter's counsel, with
copies of the transcript of all the stenographic notes taken at the hearing
before the Military Commission No. 2 for the perpetuation of the testimony of
the witnesses for the prosecution in various criminal cases filed against
herein petitioner, within five (5) days from today; (b) to request the
Solicitor General and the AFP Judge Advocate General to make the necessary
arrangements for the petitioner to confer with his counsel on matters connected
with the aforementioned motion to withdraw; (c) to allow counsel for the
petitioner, if they so desire, to file a manifestation in amplification of the
aforesaid motion to withdraw, within ten (10) days from the date they confer
with the petitioner, and thereafter to allow the Solicitor General to file a
counter-manifestation within ten (10) days from receipt of a copy thereof; and
(d) to consider the case submitted for decision after submission by both
parties of their respective pleadings on the motion to withdraw."</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, the parties manifested their compliance.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on petitioner's motion to withdraw the petitions and
motions in this case, and there being only three (3) Justices (Justices
Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> and Munoz Palma) who voted in
favor of granting such withdrawal, whereas seven (7) Justices (Justices Castro,
<span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, Antonio, <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> and
Martin) voted for its denial, the said motion to withdraw is deemed denied
(Section 11, Rule 56 of the Revised Rules of Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chief Justice has inhibited himself,
having been made respondent by petitioner his Supplemental Petitions.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Justices who voted to deny the withdrawal are of the opinion
that since all matters in issue in this case have already been submitted for
resolution, and they are of paramount public interest, it is imperative that
the questions raised by petitioner on the constitutionality and legality of
proceedings against civilians in the military commissions, pursuant to
pertinent General Orders, Presidential Decrees and Letters of Instruction,
should be definitely resolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">In regard to the merits, We Resolve by a vote of eight (8)
Justices to dismiss the main as well as the supplemental petitions.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5-A</span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">MILITARY COMMISSIONS</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the respondent Military Commission No. 2 has been
lawfully constituted and validly vested with jurisdiction to hear the cases
against civilians, including the petitioner.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court has previously
declared that the proclamation of Martial Law (Proclamation No. 1081) on <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1972</st1:date>, by the President
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is valid and constitutional and that its continuance is justified by the danger
posed to the public safety.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2. To preserve the safety of the nation in times of national peril,
the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
necessarily possesses broad authority compatible with the imperative
requirements of the emergency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
basis of this, he has authorized in General Order No. 8 (September 27, 1972)
the Chief of Staff, Armed Forces of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
to create military tribunals to try and decide cases "of military
personnel and such other cases as may be referred to them." In General
Order No. 12 (September 30, 1972), the military tribunals were vested with
jurisdiction "exclusive of the civil courts", among others, over
crimes against public order, violations of the Anti-Subversion Act, violations
of the laws on firearms, and other crimes which, in the face of the emergency,
are directly related to the quelling of the rebellion and preservation of the
safety and security of the Republic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
order to ensure a more orderly administration of justice in the cases <span class="SpellE">triable</span> by the said military tribunals, Presidential Decree
No. 39 was promulgated on <st1:date year="1972" day="7" month="11">November 7,
 1972</st1:date>, providing for the "Rules Governing the Creation,
Composition, Jurisdiction, Procedure and Other Matters Relevant to Military
Tribunals".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These measures he had
the authority to promulgate, since this Court recognized that the incumbent
President, under paragraphs 1 and 2 of Section 3 of Article XVII of the new
Constitution, had the authority to "promulgate proclamations, orders and
decrees during the period of martial law essential to the security and
preservation of the Republic, to the defense of the political and social liberties
of the people and to the institution of reforms to prevent the resurgence of
the rebellion or insurrection or secession or the threat thereof . . ."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a>
Pursuant to the aforesaid Section 3[1] and [2] of Article XVII of the
Constitution, General Orders No. 8, dated September 27, 1972 (authorizing the
creation of military tribunals), No. 12, dated September 30, 1972 (defining the
jurisdiction of military tribunals and providing for the transfer from the
civil courts to military tribunals of cases involving subversion, sedition,
insurrection or rebellion, etc.), and No. 39, dated November 7, 1972, as
amended (prescribing the procedures before military tribunals), are now
"part of the law of the land."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner nevertheless
insists that he being a civilian, his trial by a military commission deprives
him of his right to due process, since in his view the due process guaranteed
by the Constitution to persons accused of "ordinary" crimes means
judicial process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This argument ignores
the reality of the rebellion and the existence of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, of course, essential that in a martial
law situation, the martial law administrator must have ample and sufficient
means to quell the rebellion and restore civil order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prompt and effective trial and punishment of
offenders have been considered as necessary in a state of martial law, as a
mere power of detention may be wholly inadequate for the exigency,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a>
"It need hardly be remarked that martial law lawfully declared,"
observed Winthrop, "creates an exception to the general rule of exclusive
subjection to the civil jurisdiction, and renders offences against the laws of
war, as well as those of a civil character, <span class="SpellE">triable</span>,
at the discretion of the commander, (as governed by a consideration for the
public interests and the due administration of justice) by military
tribunals."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">10</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, it has been said that in time of overpowering necessity,
"Public danger warrants the substitution of executive process for judicial
process."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">11</span></span></a>
According to Schwartz, "The immunity of civilians from military
jurisdiction must, however, give way in areas governed by martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When it is absolutely imperative for public
safety, legal processes can be superseded and military tribunals authorized to
exercise the jurisdiction normally vested in courts."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In any case, We cannot close Our eyes to the fact that the
continued existence of these military tribunals and the exercise by them of
jurisdiction over civilians during the period of martial law are within the
contemplation and intendment of Section 3, paragraph 2 of Article XVII of the
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are tribunals of
special and restricted jurisdiction created under the stress of an emergency
and national security.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the only
logical way to construe said Section 3, paragraph 2 of Article XVII of the
Constitution, in relation to General Order Nos. 8, 12 and 39, in the context of
contemporary history and the circumstances attendant to the framing of the new
charter.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. When it has been established that martial law is in force, the
responsibility for all acts done <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> must be
taken by the authorities administering it.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">13</span></span></a> It is a serious responsibility
which merits the cooperation of all in the collective desire for the
restoration of civil order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case
at bar, petitioner is charged with having conspired with certain military
leaders of the communist rebellion to overthrow the government, furnishing them
arms and other instruments to further the uprising.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question that the continuing
communist rebellion was one of the grave threats to the Republic that brought
about the martial law situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
General Order No. 12, jurisdiction over this offense has been vested
exclusively upon military tribunals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
cannot be said that petitioner has been singled out for trial for this offense
before the military commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
to General Order No. 12, all "criminal cases involving subversion,
sedition, insurrection or rebellion or those committed in furtherance of, on
the occasion of, incident to or in connection with the commission of said
crimes" which were pending in civil courts were ordered transferred to the
military tribunals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This jurisdiction of
the tribunal, therefore, operates equally on all persons in like circumstances.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. Neither are We impressed with petitioner's argument that only
thru a judicial proceeding before the regular courts can his right to due
process be preserved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The guarantee of
due process is not a guarantee of any particular form of tribunal in criminal
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A military tribunal of competent
jurisdiction, accusation in due form, notice and opportunity to defend and
trial before an impartial tribunal, adequately meet the due process
requirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due process of law does not
necessarily mean a judicial proceeding in the regular courts.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span></a>
The guarantee of due process, viewed in its procedural aspect, requires no
particular form of procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It implies
due notice to the individual of the proceedings, an opportunity to defend
himself and "the problem of the propriety of the deprivations, under the
circumstances presented, must be resolved in a manner consistent with essential
fairness."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">15</span></span></a>
It means essentially a fair and impartial trial and reasonable opportunity for
the preparation of defense.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">16</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Here, the procedure before the Military Commission, as prescribed
in Presidential Decree No. 39, assures observance of the fundamental requisites
of procedural due process, due notice, an essentially fair and impartial trial
and reasonable opportunity for the preparation of the defense.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">17</span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">6. It is, however, asserted that petitioner's trial before the
military commission will not be fair and impartial, as the President had
already prejudged petitioner's cases and the military tribunal is a mere
creation of the President, and "subject to his control and
direction." We cannot, however, indulge in unjustified assumptions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prejudice cannot be presumed, especially if
weighed against the great confidence and trust reposed by the people upon the
President and the latter's legal obligation under his oath to "do justice
to every man".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is it
justifiable to conceive, much less presume that the members of the military
commission, the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Board
of Review and the Secretary of National Defense, with their corresponding staff
judge advocates, as reviewing authorities, through whom petitioner's
hypothetical conviction would be reviewed before reaching the President, would
all be insensitive to the great principles of justice and violate their respective
obligations to act fairly and impartially in the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">This assumption must be made because innocence, not wrongdoing,
is to be presumed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presumption of
innocence includes that of good faith, fair dealing and honesty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This presumption is accorded to every
official of the land in the performance of his public duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no reason why such presumption
cannot be accorded to the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
upon whom the people during this period has confided powers and
responsibilities which are of a very high and delicate nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The preservation of the rights guaranteed by
the Constitution rests at bottom exactly where the defense of the nation
rests:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in the good sense and good will
of the officials upon whom the Constitution has placed the responsibility of
ensuring the safety of the nation in times of national peril.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><st1:state><st1:place>Ill</st1:place></st1:state></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER NO. 355</p>

<p class="BODY">We also find that petitioner's claim that Administrative Order
No. 355 actually "strips him of his right to due process" is negated
by the basic purpose and the clear provisions of said Administrative
Order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was precisely because of
petitioner's complaint that he was denied the opportunity to be heard in the
preliminary investigation of his charges that the President created a Special Committee
to reinvestigate the charges filed against him in the military commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Committee is to be composed of a retired
Justice of the Supreme Court, to be designated by the Chief Justice, as
Chairman, and four (4) members to be designated respectively by the accused,
the President of the Integrated Bar, the Secretary of Justice and the Secretary
of National Defense, all of whom, according to Administrative Order No. 355
"must be learned in the law, reputed for probity, integrity, impartiality,
incorruptibility and fairness . . ." It is intended that the Committee
should conduct the investigation with "utmost fairness, impartiality and
objectivity" ensuring to the accused his constitutional right to due
process, to determine whether "there is reasonable ground to believe that
the offenses charged were in fact committed and the accused is probably guilty
thereof."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, however, objected by challenging in his supplemental
petition before this Court the validity of Administrative Order No. 355, on the
pretense that by submitting to the jurisdiction of the Special Committee he
would be waiving his right of cross-examination because Presidential Decree No.
77, which applies to the proceedings of the Special Committee, has done away
with cross-examination in preliminary investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The infirmity of this contention is apparent from the fact that
the Committee "shall have all the powers vested by law in officials
authorized to conduct preliminary investigations." We have held as
implicit in the power of the investigating Fiscal or Judge in the discharge of
his grave responsibility of ascertaining the existence of probable cause, is
his right to cross-examine the witnesses since "cross-examination whether
by the judge or by the prosecution supplies the gap by permitting an instant
contrast of falsehoods and opposing half-truths, mixed with elements of truth,
from which the examining judge or officer is better able to form a correct
synthesis of the real facts."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">18</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, petitioner's representative in the Committee,
having been conferred with "all the powers" of officials authorized
to conduct preliminary investigations, is, therefore, expressly authorized by
Section 1[c] of Presidential Decree No. 77 to subpoena the complainant and his
witnesses and "propound <span class="SpellE">clarificatory</span>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION</p>

<p class="BODY">Equally untenable is petitioner's contention that his
constitutional right to due process has been impaired when the anti-subversion
charges filed against him with the military commission were not investigated
preliminarily in accordance with Section 5 of the Anti-Subversion Act, but in
the manner prescribed by Presidential Decree No. 39, as amended by Presidential
Decree No. 77.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is asserted that under
the aforesaid Presidential Decrees, he is precluded from cross-examining the
prosecution witnesses and from being assisted by counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to petitioner's contention, Section
1[b] of Presidential Decree No. 77 specifically grants him the right to
counsel, and Presidential Decree No. 328 amended Presidential Decree No. 39,
precisely to secure the substantial rights of the accused by granting him the
right to counsel during preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 5 of Republic Act No. 1700, the
accused shall have the right "to cross-examine witnesses against him"
and in case the offense is penalized by <span class="SpellE"><i>prision</i></span><i>
mayor</i> to death, the preliminary investigation shall be conducted by the
proper Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to
whether or not the denial to an accused of an opportunity to cross-examine the
witnesses against him in the preliminary investigation constitutes an
infringement of his right to due process, We have to advert to certain basic
principles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution "does
not require the holding of preliminary investigations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right exists only, if and when created by
statute."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">20</span></span></a>
It is "not an essential part of due process of law."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">21</span></span></a>

affect the jurisdiction of the court over the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">22</span></span></a>
As a creation of the statute it can, therefore, be modified or amended by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also evident that there is no curtailment of the
constitutional right of an accused person when he is not given the opportunity
to "cross-examine the witnesses presented against him in the preliminary
investigation before his arrest, this being a matter that depends on the sound
discretion of the Judge or investigating officer concerned."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">23</span></span></a></p>

declares what acts are crimes and prescribes the punishment for committing
them, as distinguished from the procedural law which provides or regulates the
steps by which one who commits a crime is to be punished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(22 C.J.S., 49.) Preliminary investigation is
eminently and essentially remedial; it is the first step taken in a criminal
prosecution.</blockquote>

identified with and forms part of the method by which, in private law, rights
are enforced and redress obtained, and, in criminal law, a law transgressor is
punished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Criminal procedure refers to

importance as to offend against the constitutional inhibition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we have said in the beginning, preliminary
investigation is not an essential part of due process of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be suppressed entirely, and if this
may be done, mere restriction of the privilege formerly enjoyed <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> can not be held to fall within the

<p class="BODY">In rejecting the contention of the political offenders accused in
the People's Court that their constitutional right to equal protection of the laws
was impaired because they were denied preliminary examination and
investigation, whereas the others who may be accused of the same crimes in the
Court of First Instance shall be entitled thereto, this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"(2) Section 22
in denying preliminary investigation to persons accused before the People's
Court is justified by the conditions prevailing when the law was enacted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the great number of prisoners then
under detention and length of time and amount of labor that would be consumed
if so many prisoners were allowed the right to have preliminary investigation,
considered with the necessity of disposing of these cases at the earliest
possible dates in the interest of the public and of the accused themselves, it
was not an unwise measure which dispensed with such investigation in such
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Preliminary investigation, it
must be remembered, is not fundamental right guaranteed by the
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the rest, the
constitutional prohibition against discrimination among defendants placed in
the same situation and condition is not infringed."<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">25</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It was realized that the procedure prescribed in Republic Act No.
5180 granting the complainant and respondent in a preliminary investigation the
right to cross-examine each other and their witnesses was "time consuming
and not conducive to the expeditious administration of justice".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it was found necessary in Presidential
Decree No. 77 to simplify the procedure of preliminary investigation to conform
to its summary character, by eliminating the cross-examination by the
contending parties of their respective witnesses which in the past had made the
proceeding the occasion for the full and exhaustive display of parties'
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The procedure prescribed in
the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> decrees appears justified by the
necessity of disposing cases during the martial law, especially those affecting
national security, at the earliest date.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the basis of the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> settled
principles, the curtailment of the right of an accused to cross-examine the
witnesses against him in the preliminary investigation does not impair any
constitutional right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be relevant

Presidential Decree No. 77 issued on <st1:date year="1972" day="6" month="12">December

<p class="BODY">Petitioner claims that the order of the Military Commission for
the perpetuation of the testimony of prosecution witnesses is void because no
copy of the petition was previously served on him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asserts that, as a consequence, he was not
given the opportunity to contest the propriety of the taking of the deposition
of the witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted that
petitioner does not dispute respondents' claim that on <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1975</st1:date>, he knew of the order allowing the
taking of the deposition of prosecution witnesses on March 31, to continue

<p class="BODY">The provisions of Presidential Decree No. 328, dated <st1:date year="1973" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1973</st1:date>, for the
conditional examination of prosecution witnesses before trial, is similar to
the provisions of Section 7 of Rule 119 of the Revised Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Presidential Decree No. 328 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Where, upon proper application, it shall satisfactorily
appear to the military tribunal before which a case is pending, that a witness
for the prosecution or the defense is too sick or infirm to appear at the
trial, or has to leave the Philippines with no definite date of returning
thereto, or where delay in the taking of his testimony may result in the
failure of justice or adversely affect national security, the witness may
forthwith be examined and his deposition immediately taken, such examination to
be by question and answer, in the presence of the other party, or even in the
latter's absence provided that <i>reasonable notice</i> to attend the
examination or the taking of the deposition <i>has been served on him</i>, and
will be conducted in the same manner as an examination, at the trial, in which
latter event the failure or refusal to attend the examination or the taking of
the deposition shall be considered a waiver." (Italics supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 7 of Rule 119 of the Revised Rules provides:</p>

<blockquote>"<i>Deposition of witness for the prosecution</i>. — Where,
however, it shall satisfactorily appear that the witness cannot procure bail,
or is too sick or infirm to appear at the trial, as directed by the order of
the court, or has to leave the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
with no definite date of returning thereto, he may forthwith be conditionally
examined or his deposition immediately taken.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such examination or deposition must be by question and answer, in the
presence of the defendant or after reasonable notice to attend the examination
or the taking of the deposition has been served on him, and will be conducted
in the same manner as an examination at the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure or refusal on the part of the

thus taken may be admitted in behalf of or against the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony taken, the witness must
thereupon be discharged, if he has been detained."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing was taken substantially from Section 7 of Rule 115
of the old Rules of Court, with the difference, among others, that the phrase
"or after one hour notice" in the old Rules of Court has been changed
to "or after reasonable notice" in the Revised Rules of Court.</p>

this Court, in rejecting the contention that no written motion was filed by the
prosecuting attorney for the taking of the depositions and that less than one
hour notice has been given the defendant, held that "the one-hour notice
mentioned in Section 7, Rule 115, of the Rules of Court, was intended by law
mainly to give the defendant time to attend the taking of a deposition and not
to prepare for the taking thereof because in reality there is no need for
preparation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not a trial where the
defendant has to introduce his evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is only taking down the statements of the witnesses for the
prosecution with opportunity on the part of the defendant to cross-examine
them."</p>

<p class="BODY">The thrust of <span class="SpellE"><i>Elago</i></span> is that the
order of the court authorizing the taking of the deposition of the witnesses of
the prosecution and fixing the date and time thereof is the one that must be
served on the accused within a reasonable time prior to that fixed for the
examination of the witnesses so that the accused may be present and
cross-examine the witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">On this point of the time given the defendant to attend the
taking of the deposition, Professor <span class="SpellE">Wigmore</span> has the
following to say:</p>

<blockquote>"The opportunity of cross-examination involves two elements:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Notice</i> to the opponent that the
deposition is to be taken at the time and place specified, and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A <i>sufficient interval of time</i> to
prepare for examination and to reach the place.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(2) The
requirements as to the <i>interval of time are</i> now everywhere regulated by
statute . . .; the rulings in regard to the sufficiency of time are thus so
dependent on the interpretation of the detailed prescriptions of the local
statutes that it would be impracticable to examine them here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But whether or not the time allowed was
supposedly insufficient or was precisely the time required by statute, the <i>actual
attendance</i> of the party obviate any objection upon the ground of
insufficiency, because then the party has actually had that opportunity of cross-examination
. . . for the sole sake of which the notice was required."<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">28</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">WAIVER OF PETITIONER'S PRESENCE</p>

<p class="BODY">There is conflict among the authorities as to whether an accused
can waive his right to be present at his trial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Some courts have regarded the presence of the accused at his trial for
felony as a jurisdictional requirement, which cannot be waived.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">29</span></span></a>
Many others do not accept this <i>view</i>.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">30</span></span></a> In defense of the first view, it
has been stated that the public has an interest in the life and liberty of an
accused and that which the law considers essential in a trial cannot be waived
by the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">31</span></span></a>
In support of the latter view, it has been argued that the right is essentially
for the benefit of the accused,<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">32</span></span></a> and that "since the accused,
by pleading guilty, can waive any trial at all, he should be able to waive any
mere privilege on the trial that is designed only to aid him in shielding
himself from such result."<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">33</span></span></a></p>

and People <i>vs</i>. Francisco.<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">38</span></span></a> In the first two cases, it was
ruled that one whose life or liberty is involved in the prosecution for felony
must be personally present at every stage of the trial when his substantive
rights may be affected by the proceedings and that it is not within his power
to waive the right to be personally present.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In Diaz <i>vs</i>. <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and People <i>vs</i>. Francisco, this rule was modified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the authority of the <i>Diaz</i> and <i>Francisco</i>
cases, the Court laid down as the law in this jurisdiction that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in cases of felony, the accused has the
right to be present at every stage of the trial, inclusive of the arraignment
and pronouncement of the judgment; (2) - where the offense is <i>capital</i>
the right of the accused to be present at every stage of the trial is
indispensable and cannot be waived; (3) even in felonies not capital, if the
accused is <i>in custody</i>, his right to be present at every stage of the
trial is likewise indispensable and cannot be waived; (4) where the offense is
not capital and the accused is not in custody, his presence is indispensable
only:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) at the arraignment; (b) at the
time the plea is taken, if it be one of guilt; and (c) at the pronouncement of
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court quoted the rationale
of Diaz <i>vs</i>. <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as basis of its ruling, thus:</p>

<blockquote>". . . the court was called upon to pass on the question
whether the provision in section 5 of the Philippine Civil Government Act,
securing to the accused in all criminal prosecutions 'the right to be heard by
himself and counsel,' makes his presence indispensable at every stage of the
trial, or invests him with a right which he is always free to assert, but which
he also may waive by his voluntary act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After observing that an identical or similar provision is found in the
constitutions of the several states of the American Union, and that its
substantial equivalent is embodied in the 6th Amendment to the Constitution of
the United States; that it is the right which these constitutional provisions
secure to persons accused of crime in that country that was carried here by the
congressional enactment; and that, therefore, according to a familiar rule, the
prevailing course of decision there may and should be accepted as determinative
of the nature and measure of the right here.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Justice Van <span class="SpellE">Devanter</span>, speaking for the court,
said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'As the offense in this instance
was a felony, we may put out of view the decisions dealing with this right in
cases of misdemeanor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In cases of felony
our courts, with substantial accord, have regarded it as extending to every
stage of the trial, inclusive of the <span class="SpellE">empaneling</span> of
the jury and the reception of the verdict, and as being scarcely less important
to the accused than the right of trial itself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And with like accord they have regarded an accused who is in custody and
one who is charged with a capital offense as incapable of waiving the right;
the one, because his presence or absence is not within his own control; and the
other because, in addition to being usually in custody, he is deemed to suffer
the constraint naturally incident to an apprehension of the lawful penalty that
would follow conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, where the
offense is not capital and the accused is not in custody, the prevailing rule
has been, that if, after the trial has begun in his presence, he voluntarily
absents himself, this does not nullify what has been done or prevent the
completion of the trial, but, on the contrary, operates as a waiver of his
right to be present, and leaves the court free to proceed with the trial in
like manner and with like effect as if he were present."<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">39</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In <span class="SpellE"><i>Avanceña</i></span><i>,</i>

unjustified."<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">40</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
provision of the Constitution which allows trial of an accused <i>in absentia</i>,
the issue has been raised whether or not petitioner could waive his right to
present at the perpetuation of testimony proceedings before respondent
Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a general rule, subject to certain exceptions, any
constitutional or statutory right may be waived if such waiver is not against
public policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The personal presence of
the accused from the beginning to the end of a trial for felony, involving his
life and liberty, has been considered necessary and vital to the proper conduct
of his defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The "trend of
modern authority is in favor of the doctrine that a party in a criminal case
may waive irregularities and rights, whether constitutional or statutory, very
much the same as in a civil case."<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">41</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There are, for instance, certain rights secured to the individual
by the fundamental charter which may be the subject of waiver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rights of an accused to defend himself in
person and by attorney, to be informed of the nature and cause of the
accusation, to a speedy and public trial, and to meet the witnesses face to
face, as well as the right against unreasonable searches and seizures, are
rights guaranteed by the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They are rights necessary either because of the requirements of due
process to ensure a fair and impartial trial, or of the need of protecting the
individual from the exercise of arbitrary power. And yet, there is no question
that all of these rights may be waived.<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">42</span></span></a> Considering the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> provisions of the Constitution and the absence
of any law specifically requiring his presence at all stages of his trial,
there appears, therefore, no logical reason why petitioner, although he is
charged with a capital offense, should be precluded from waiving his right to
be present in the proceedings for the perpetuation of testimony, since this
right, like the others <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, was conferred
upon him for his protection and benefit.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also important to note that under Section 7 of Rule 119 of
the Revised Rules of Court (Deposition of witness for the prosecution) the
"Failure or refusal on the part of the defendant to attend the examination
or the taking of the deposition after notice hereinbefore provided, <i>shall be
considered a waiver</i> . . ." (Italics supplied.) Similarly, Presidential
Decree No. 328 expressly provides that "… the failure or refusal to attend
the examination or the taking of the deposition <i>shall be considered a waiver</i>."
(Italics supplied.)</p>

<p class="BODY">It is for the foregoing reasons that the writer of this opinion
voted with the six (6) Justices who ruled on the full right of petitioner to
waive his presence at said proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since only six (6) Justices (Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, Antonio, <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>
Palma and <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>) are of the view that petitioner may
waive his right to be present at all stages of the proceedings while five (5)
Justices (Castro, <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Jr. and Martin) are in agreement that he
may so waive such right, except when he is to be identified, the result is that
the respondent Commission's Order requiring his presence at all times during
the proceedings before it should be modified, in the sense that petitioner's
presence shall be required only in the instance just indicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ruling in People <i>vs</i>. Avanceña<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">43</span></span></a>
is thus <i>pro <span class="SpellE">tanto</span></i> modified.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, it is insisted that even if said orders and decrees were
valid as martial law measures, they have ceased to be so upon the termination
of the emergency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>,
<span class="SpellE">et.al</span>. <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>,
et al., <i>supra</i>, We adverted to the fact that the communist rebellion
which impelled the proclamation of martial law has not abated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of any official proclamation by
the President of the cessation of the public emergency, We have no basis to
conclude that the rebellion and communist subversion which compelled the
declaration of martial law, no longer pose a danger to public safety.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is important to note here that an accused being tried before a
military tribunal enjoys the specific constitutional safeguards pertaining to
criminal trials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, he is entitled to
be heard by himself and counsel,<a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">44</span></span></a> to be informed of the nature and
cause of the accusation,<a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">45</span></span></a> to meet the witnesses face to
face, to have compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses and the
production of evidence in his behalf,<a style="" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">46</span></span></a> and to be exempt from being a
witness against himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As in trial
before civil courts, the presumption of innocence can only be overcome by
evidence beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">47</span></span></a>
These tribunals, in general, are "bound to observe the fundamental rules
of law and principles of justice observed and expounded by the civil
judicature."<a style="" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">48</span></span></a> Section 11 of the Manual for
Courts-Martial specifically provides that the "rules of evidence generally
recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the courts of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
shall be applied by courts-martial."<a style="" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">49</span></span></a> This is applicable to trials in
the military commission.<a style="" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">50</span></span></a> There is, therefore, no
justification for petitioner's contention that such military tribunals are
concerned primarily with the conviction of an accused and that proceedings
therein involve the complete destruction and abolition of petitioner's
constitutional rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not,
however, to preclude the President from considering the advisability of the
transfer of these cases to the civil courts, as he has previously announced.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">According to <span class="SpellE">Fairman</span>,
"a military commission is a tribunal established to try persons not

civil nature or against the regulations of the military authorities." (<span class="SpellE">Fairman</span>, <i>supra</i>, p. 272.) One of the justifications
given for the trial of civilians by military commissions during an insurrection
"had been to try the accused more quickly with a view to stopping more
effectively the progress of the insurrection." (<i>Ibid</i>, citing <span class="SpellE">Finlason's</span> Rep. 83 ff., p. 267.)</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the main opinion so very ably penned for the Court by
our distinguished colleague, Mr. Justice Antonio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am writing this separate opinion not with
intent to unnecessarily lend force to the cogent and compelling considerations
expounded therein but only to articulate a few thoughts I entertain relative to
certain aspects of this case which have additionally impelled me to overrule
the contentions of petitioner other than his invocation of his right to waive
his presence at the proceedings being held against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, I would like to underscore the fact that this is
the first decision of this Court regarding major martial law issues wherein the
main opinion carries the unqualified concurrence of the required number of
justices for doctrinal purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since I
have heretofore regretted Our failure to agree on a common opinion that would
not be subject to varying constructions, including distorted and self-motivated
ones which could be peddled around for propaganda purposes by those who for
reasons of their own cannot see anything right in the present order, it is to
me a cause of genuine satisfaction that at long last the Court has been able to
render the instant opinion and judgment, touching on important and basic
constitutional and legal features of the prevailing martial law administration,
in a manner that leaves no room for doubt as to the meaning and scope of Our
pronouncements.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be more specific, the main opinion in this case and the
rulings therein contained own the full support of at least eight members of the
Court, without counting what I consider to be the close-enough-to-concurrence
posture of Mr. Justice Fernando, which betrays no little effort to reconcile
long cherished traditional views with the innovative and progressive juridical
concepts emerging from the imperatives of the legal character of the presently
established government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the light of
the constitutional requirement of ten (10) votes for a declaration of
invalidity of any order of the President, eight negatives votes is more than
impressive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And certainly, all the
rulings in the main opinion, having as they do have the support of those eight
votes, constitute authoritative doctrines, against which, the contrary views of
any member of the bar should have no more than academic value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At these times when it is best that the legal
foundations of the existing government should be securely solidified to better
and faster achieve the ends for which martial law has been proclaimed, the
pronouncements of the Court in this case should put an end to any effort to
discredit the actions of this Government as being founded only on might rather
Indeed, my faith is that the rule of law obtains to day as it than right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, my faith is that the rule of law
obtains today as it has always obtained before, and due consideration and
corresponding accommodation accorded to the requirements of the emergency
confronting the nation do not detract in any way from the effective supremacy
of the law.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify;">1. Petitioner's motion to withdraw
denied</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a settled rule consistent with the fitting dignity of
judicial proceedings that after a case has been submitted for decision,
withdrawal of the same from the jurisdiction of the court is a matter addressed
to its sound discretion and is far from being a matter of right on the part of
any of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For obvious reasons,
a party should not be allowed to provoke issues of far reaching interest and
importance and hurl accusations against the actuations of the adverse party,
thereby creating doubts in the public mind as to the validity of said
actuations, and thereafter, upon being confronted with the defenses of his
opponent and sensing perhaps probable defeat, to just take a retreat, without
expressly admitting the infirmity of his position, thereby making sure that he
can with relative impunity continue with his critical attitude in the manner
suitable to his convenience and purposes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Observance of the laudable policy of terminating litigations at the
earliest opportunity may not be invoked when the evident result is detriment to
the more paramount objective of having a definite ruling by the Supreme Court
as to what the law is in regard to the matters of vital public interest
actually and properly brought to it for adjudication.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the imperative need to settle the important issues raised in
this case is not the only reason I have for voting to deny petitioner's
motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When petitioner was required by
the Court to amplify his initial unreasoned request to be allowed to withdraw
all his petitions, motions and other incidents herein, his counsel submitted a
letter purportedly coming from petitioner, wherein he vehemently cast
aspersions against this Court, alleging that he does "not want anything
from the Supreme Court, and that the whole thing had been designed, composed
and orchestrated in <span class="SpellE">Malacañang</span>" and that his
"legal battles in the Supreme Court are now over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Marcos is the single genius, composing
and directing all the proceedings, whether in the military tribunal or in the
civil courts," and even going as far as referring to the "Supreme
Court as an obstacle."</p>

<p class="BODY">I do not believe it is under any circumstance proper for a
Supreme Court to leave such accusations unchallenged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most likely, they could be mere
uncontrollable outburst of a desperate soul which are without judicial
significance, but since it is as likely that petitioner's letter would be used
as propaganda material not only here but abroad to discredit the Philippine
Government in the eyes of the world, I consider it inevitable for the Court to
proceed to dispose of the merits of petitioner's case and thus let all and
sundry judge for themselves on the basis of the Court's expressed
considerations rather than on that of petitioner's self-serving opinion,
whether or not our judiciary is what petitioner claims it to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is my considered view that if a party who
comes to court has indeed any right to withdraw his case <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
such withdrawal should not receive the sanction of the court when the party
tells the court that his reason for withdrawing is because he has no confidence
in its impartiality and capacity to render justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a situation, the only recourse of the
court is to prove by actually deciding the case how just and impartial it is.</p>

<p class="BODY">I would like to state here emphatically that petitioner's
apprehensions about the dangers to the independence of the judiciary of the
Philippines at present, particularly the Supreme Court, is nothing more than an
<i>a priori </i>opinion and is not and cannot be supported by facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, the Court does not have to
necessarily agree with everyone who feels that certain acts of the Government
are illegal or unconstitutional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely,
a propensity to overrule the other departments of the Government is not the
true mark of the independence of the judicial branch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If so far, the Supreme Court has not yet
declared any impugned acts of the President or the martial law government
unconstitutional, it is not because the Court is subservient to the President
in any way, but simply because, in the honest conviction of its members, the
proper case for such a declaration has not come.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the Court can and will strike down acts
of the President in the appropriate instances, there should be no doubt
whatsoever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The people can rest assured
that when the proper occasions arise, the justices, individually and
collectively, will not be found wanting in wisdom and courage to act accordingly,
regardless of what might be the views and wishes of the Executive and/or any
other department of the government.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this point, it may not be amiss to say a few words respecting
petitioner's decision to resort to what is being referred to as a "hunger
strike."</p>

<p class="BODY">According to his letter aforementioned, the initial reason for
such a step was, to quote his own words, to "protest against a procedure
intended to humiliate and dehumanize me, considering that all they wanted was
for me to be identified as a common criminal and not as a political rival.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also said that my hunger strike was not
only for myself but on behalf of many other victims of today's oppression and
injustices." Later, however, the causes thereof were broadened by him
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Despite my hunger strike, or probably because of it, I see
with unmistakable clarity that my legal battles in the Supreme Court are now
over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Marcos is the single genius,
composing and directing all the proceedings, whether in the military tribunal
or in the civil courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the evil
of one-man rule at its very worst.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
has destroyed the independence of the civil courts, abolished the legislature,
controlled the mass media, curtailed our cherished liberties — with the backing
of the military, which, ironically, exists 'for the good of the people.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>Without the Supreme Court as an obstacle, I have decided to go on
my hunger strike and place my fate and my life squarely in the hands of my
accuser, prosecutor, and judge — Mr. Marcos.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus the plain, naked truth will be made clear to our people and to the
rest of the world.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As I said, my hunger strike is not for myself alone, but for the
many thousands of Filipinos who are helpless victims of the oppression and
injustices of the so-called New Society.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The meaning and thrust of my struggle and sacrifice transcend the
limited question of absence or presence in the proceedings before the military
tribunal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I have therefore solemnly vowed to continue my hunger strike as a
symbol of our people's firm protest against:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the trial of civilians before military tribunals,
particularly for offenses allegedly committed by them before martial law;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the lack of judicial independence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Trials by civil courts would still be a
travesty of justice, especially in cases where those in power, their relatives
or associates, are interested ? for as long as our judges remain
'casuals'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They should be given
permanent tenure, for their own good and for the benefit of our people who have
a vital stake in a sound administration of justice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the absence of a genuine free press.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since martial law was proclaimed, I have been
unfairly condemned and vilified by the controlled newspapers and <span class="SpellE">tv</span>-radio stations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
know there are many people who have been similarly pilloried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But a genuine free press is even more
important for those who are in power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
may free them from their arrogance, their prejudices, and their pretensions,
and help them see the injustices they have committed against their own people.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the further continuation of martial law and
its evils and repressions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all,
Mr. Marcos has already announced to the world that he had actually removed
martial law since April, 1974." (Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Aquino's</span>
letter, pp. 4-5.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In so far as petitioner's "hunger strike" may be
understood as an attempt to stampede the Court to render a verdict favorable to
his views, I must state categorically that it is subversive and contumacious,
specially because it is being admittedly done with "unmistakable
clarity" of mind and purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Frankly,
I am at a loss as to what kind of procedure would suit him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same breadth that he professes to
advocate that every man is entitled to equal protection of the laws, he claims
that he should be treated not as an ordinary accused but "as a political rival",
evidently meaning, of the President. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>How
indeed is "a political rival" of the Administrator of martial law
supposed to be prosecuted for an offense committed against the laws of the
land?</p>

<p class="BODY">Be that as it may, anyone can easily imagine the unmanageable
situation and judicial chaos that would result should We create a precedent
wherein the Court should yield to the demands of a person under formal charge
of committing an offense, as otherwise he would resort to a hunger strike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, We were somehow disposed to lean
backwards and rule <span class="SpellE">interlocutorily</span> as early as We
could on the issue as to whether or not the respondent Military Commission was
right in compelling petitioner to attend the perpetuation proceedings and
thereby place his initial cause for the "hunger strike" in its true
perspective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Our efforts to this end
were met by petitioner's Churchill-like reaction that what We could possibly
give was "too late and too little", manifested by his once more <span class="SpellE">disauthorizing</span> his lawyers from henceforth speaking for him
and finally seeking the withdrawal of this case from our hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is the Court supposed to extend to a
"political rival" of the President more than what the existing laws
provide for others?</p>

<p class="BODY">As a Filipino myself, I am ready to concede that petitioner is
being actuated by what he honestly believes to be his duty to our country and
people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His abiding loyalty to his cause
and his firm conviction to attain his objectives are to me admirable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I reject any suggestion that for the
Court to uphold the legality and constitutionality of the existing government
is inimical to the national interests and ideals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can see that the concept of martial law
presently being evolved here as well as some features of its implementation do
not conform with certain views of the American Supreme Court and some alien
writers on the subject, but is it imperative that the Supreme Court of the
Philippines should adhere to the doctrines laid down by alien authorities in
order to be right?</p>

<p class="BODY">Incidentally, it is becoming increasingly evident that some religious
quarters as such would want their influence felt in the resolution of the legal
issues before Us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One does not have to
dig deep into the pages of history to learn that nations and peoples have also
suffered where and when there was no separation of the church and state as when
they were under despots and autocrats.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In any event, while one can commiserate and sympathize with petitioner
for the personal sufferings he has elected to undergo, I cannot convince myself
that they are in anyway comparable with the agonies of Christ at Calvary, as
seemingly, I am informed, has been somehow or seemingly suggested at a
religious gathering sometime ago of those who share convictions with
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Withal, I am afraid that
even the mere attempt to draw such a comparison could be a sin of sacrilege and
of having strange gods before our only Holy Redeemer.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in 15pt 0.25in; text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.25in;">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Military tribunals and trials for persons who
have committed offenses against the objectives of martial law is a natural and
logical concomitant of martial rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">The legalistic and scholarly discussion in the main opinion of
the issue of jurisdiction of herein respondent Military Commission No. 2 needs
no amplification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I only wish to <span class="SpellE">punctualize</span> a broader foundation for my concurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have always maintained it is elementary,
historically and legally, that in any regime of martial law, offenders against
its objectives are and ought to be tried by military tribunals in accordance
with the procedure prescribed for them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To feel apprehensive then that unless the Court upholds petitioner's
contention that as a civilian he cannot be tried by respondent commission for
the crimes allegedly committed prior to the proclamation of martial law,
thousands of Filipinos run the risk of being similarly hailed before military
courts and deprived of their constitutional rights to due process, is to ignore
that throughout the life of all nations, when rebellions and revolutions were
mounted, no distinction has ever been drawn, among those igniting the uprising
which naturally was done before any declaration of martial law, as to whether
they are civilians or military men, for purposes of trying them before the
military courts of the legitimate or victorious government, at least, whenever
prosecution had to be undertaken before the hostilities were over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in this connection, it may be said of
more recent military tribunals trying rebels that more safeguards are being
adopted in order that the elementary requirements of due process may be surely
observed by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it would be
a misconception of the true import of this decision to suppose that it may be
taken advantage of by any future government, for, as I have explained in my
concurring opinion in the Habeas Corpus cases,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
any self-restraint the Court has opted to exercise in its decisions so far
rendered, from asserting its judicial authority to interfere with the
actuations of the Executive, considering it has not found any evidence of
manifest abuse of discretion or gross arbitrariness in them, does not mean the
Supreme Court has lost the power to act accordingly in appropriate cases that
may come later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And there being no
question that Proclamation 1081 which established martial law in the
Philippines is valid,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
it necessarily follows that respondent military tribunal which has been created
under it are vested with jurisdiction to try and decide petitioner's cases, it
appearing that the charges and specifications against him are related to the
causes that gave occasion to the Proclamation, no matter that the offenses
charged therein were committed long before the issuance of said
proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the alternative
would be to await the termination of martial law when all passions shall have
subsided and the courts could calmly and without regard to the personal
feelings of the judge as to the merits of the rebellion make an impartial
decision, but that would mean the continued detention of the petitioner in the
meantime.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is insisted, however, that since the civil courts are open, it
is derogative of their constitutional authority to sanction petitioner's trial
in a military commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
contention ignores the fundamental mission of military courts during martial
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any martial law situation
wherein civil courts are continued, their co-existence with military tribunals
ought not to create any conflict of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial and punishment of offenders against
the established order should as a matter of necessity be left in the hands of
the military whereas the civil courts are supposed to aid and in the
preservation of normal society among the non-offenders by continuing the
exercise of their jurisdiction over all civil matters which have no direct
relation to the imperatives of the Proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as very well explained in the main
opinion, the constitutional requirements of due process are being complied with
even in the military tribunals.</p>

<p class="BODY">In legal contemplation, there is here no diminution much less a
derogation of the judicial power vested by the Constitution upon the Supreme
Court and other inferior courts established by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I made clear in my separate opinion in the
Habeas Corpus cases,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
once the Supreme Court refrains, during a national emergency, by virtue of the
discretion implicitly granted to it by the people in the Constitution, from
invalidating the proclamation of martial law, because it is convinced that
there has been no patent arbitrariness in its issuance, which We have actually
done already in said cases, there can be no legal objection to the existence of
military courts for the purposes I have just indicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it must be so, for it is entirely
rational that military tribunals are peculiarly fit, in view of the more
summary and expeditious procedure designed for their functioning, to temporarily
administer justice in the prompt and <span class="SpellE">unencumbersome</span>
manner required by the exigencies of the situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the theater-of-war test is
not truly determinative of the constitutionality of military trials during
martial law, even when martial law is proclaimed for the express purposes of
simultaneously reforming society with the suppression of the rebellion by
force, to the end that the causes <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> may not
recur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the authority of
the civil courts may give way to military jurisdiction should rather depend on
the nature of the offenses committed and its relation to the elimination of the
unnecessary hindrances or obstacles to the complete restoration of order and
the attainment of the social and political objectives of the Proclamation.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in 15pt 13.5pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: -13.5pt;">3.
Petitioner's allegation of pre-judgment, albeit lacking in sufficient juridical
persuasiveness is nevertheless worthy of serious consideration by the authorities
who can provide relief.</p>

<p class="BODY">That I am somehow impressed by petitioner's contention of
supposed pre-judgment of his case by the President who has ordered the creation
of the military courts and by whom their decisions are to be reviewed for final
approval is no secret.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the open
hearing of this case before this Court on April 14 last, I had occasion to ask
the Solicitor General what possible impediments are there to the transfer of
petitioner's case to the civil courts, which can rightly be done under the
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But that was, of course, far from
indicating that I believe that indeed there could be such prejudgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have faith that in the discharge of his
solemn constitutionally prescribed oath to "do justice to every man",
President Marcos would not be capable of wantonly discarding the inherent
responsibilities of his high office, knowing as he does that he would not be
where he is were it not for the trust and confidence reposed in him by the
people when they elected him as the man who by the exercise of the immense
powers given him by the Constitution would precisely protect and defend them
against injustice and oppression.</p>

<p class="BODY">Truth to tell, the thought or suspicion of prejudgment in
military justice during martial law is inevitable, for the obvious reason that
the concentration of powers in such a situation carries with it inherently the
spectacle of the army being the accuser and judge at the same time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When it is considered, however, that military
courts are generally collegiate, with each member thereof being obliged to vote
secretly not only on the issue of the guilt of the accused as to each charge
and specification but separately, also on the penalty to be imposed, and that
in important cases, particularly capital ones like some of those of petitioner,
their decisions are automatically subject to review and recommendation by a number
of levels of authority, such as the Chief of Staff, the Board of Review, the
Secretary of National Defense etc., each with their corresponding staff judge
advocates, before reaching the President for the final verdict, one cannot
escape the conviction that more exacting safeguards against any possibility of
partiality and pre-judgment may not be found in the civil courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is entirely wrong, unjust and unwarranted
to think of all army men as having only one mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, they are also Filipinos like
petitioner and counsel, and they cannot have less interest in and devotion to
the sacred ideals for which our common country and people exist.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, in the case at bar, the statements attributed to the
President and which petitioner quotes and maintains are reflective of the
President's supposed pre-judgment of his cases, viewed objectively, would
indicate at most only an off-hand evaluation of the evidence then on hand,
without regard to the other evidence now in possession of the prosecution, and
without counting those which petitioner will present on his behalf, and does
not necessarily amount to a pronouncement of guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, therefore, they do not sufficiently
prove what the judgment of the President would be after the whole evidence of
petitioner's cases shall have been examined and evaluated by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, from the strictly legal point
of view, petitioner's pose about denial of due process to him by reason of
prejudgment lacks persuasiveness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Legal standards aside, however, it is immensely reassuring that
the President has announced that as soon as the present perpetuation
proceedings are terminated, he will consider the advisability of transferring
the cases in question to the civil courts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Should that be done, and I have no reason for believing that it will not
be so done, it will not only be that petitioner will be relieved of a great
degree of mental torture, but, as importantly if not more so, the President
shall have given the nation eloquent proof not so much of his nobility as of
his determination not to allow the decision in the cases of petitioner to be in
any manner tainted by the slightest suspicion of any personal feeling or
opinion on his part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I have no fears
at all that others who are also similarly charged before military commissions
will demand the same treatment, thereby subverting the whole system of crime
prosecution under martial law I have earlier adverted to, for in the particular
case of petitioner, there is the singular circumstances that the President has
made statements which have some relevance to his cases, which it does not
appear has been done in those of the others.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, under General Order No. 49, the President has already
transferred the mass of the cases against civilians to the civil courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Briefly then, while I hold that there is
nothing constitutionally wrong with having petitioner tried by a military
tribunal, it is my conviction that it is preferable from all other points of
view that his cases be transferred to the civil courts, and not because in fact
he will not get justice from the former, but because he will have more peace of
mind in the latter and the people will be spared every doubt as to whether or
not the slightest element of partiality or bias has crept into one of the most
important trials in the current history of our country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, of course, it is not within the ambit of
the authority of even the Court itself, much less this writer, to direct the
President's exercise of the powers vested in him by the Constitution; so, all
that I can do is to voice the faith and hope that the President may not
encounter any further obstacle to his actually ordering the transfer of
petitioner's cases to the civil courts in accordance with his aforementioned
public announcement, the sooner the better.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify;">4.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner has the right to waive his presence at the perpetuation
proceedings before the respondent Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">As I have stated earlier, what really seems to have initially
provoked petitioner's decision to go on some kind of a hunger strike was the
respondent Commission's turnabout in regard to the issue of whether or not he
can waive his presence during the perpetuation proceedings before it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After ruling at first that he had such right,
subsequently, upon motion for reconsideration of the prosecution, the
Commission reversed itself and ruled that his presence is indispensable and can
thus be secured compulsorily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But if
such action of the respondent commission is the cause of petitioner's hunger
strike, as he had stated at the beginning, he may now desist from continuing
with his rather perilous posture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
the members of the Court participating in this case are agreed that the ruling
in People <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Avanceña</span> relied upon by the
prosecution should be at least modified, if not completely overturned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Six of us, namely, Justices Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>, Antonio, <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> Palma, <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> and this writer are of the view that petitioner,
although under detention and charged with a capital offense, has the right to
absent himself at any stage of the trial, while the other five Justices, namely
Justices Castro, <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Jr. and Martin, believe also that that
right exists subject however to the qualification that it cannot be invoked
whenever his presence is needed for identification purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, it is entirely up to the
petitioner whether or not to attend the perpetuation proceedings now going on
except when he is to be identified by the witnesses on the stand and only for
just the time needed for that exclusive purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">Speaking for myself, I find eminent merit in the contention of
petitioner that even for identification purposes he cannot be made to be
present at the trial against his will.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since under the Constitution, trial of criminal cases in the absence of
the accused is allowed, when after the arraignment and in spite of due notice
he fails to appear without justification, pursuant to Section 19 of the Bill of
Rights or Article IV, I cannot see why an accused who does not want to undergo
the experience of being repeatedly pointed to and of being the target of the
curious eye of the public, cannot elect to leave the defense of his case and of
his rights to his counsel in his absence or even put himself completely at the
mercy of the court, secure in the thought that it is anyway the inescapable
duty of the judge not to allow anything illegal or inhuman to be done to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">I can understand why an accused has to be present at the
arraignment and at the reading of the sentence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the former, it has to be known to the court that he is indeed the
person charged and that he personally understands the accusation against
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More importantly, the plea must be
entered by him personally to avoid any misconstruction and misrepresentation,
innocent or otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the latter, it
is essential that the accused himself should be aware from personal knowledge
what is the verdict of the court, and if it be conviction, what is the penalty
to be served by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are matters
too personal to permit delegation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the same time, his presence makes it simpler in the public interest for the
authorities to enforce execution of any adverse judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I cannot see why an accused should be
compelled to be present at the trial when he prefers perhaps the solitude of
his cell to pray either for forgiveness, if he knows he is guilty, or, if he is
innocent, for God to illumine the court so there would be unerring justice in
his case.</p>

<p class="BODY">My understanding is that the problem of identification of an
accused may be adequately solved without violating the justified wishes of the
accused to be left alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To start with,
if he is referred to by the witnesses of the prosecution by name, the court may
presume that the accused who has acknowledged his true name at the arraignment
is the one indicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court ruled
unequivocally more than sixty-five years ago in U.S. <i>vs. </i>Adolfo, 12
Phil. 296, and reiterated it in People <i>vs. </i>Santos, 53 Phil. 863, twenty
years later, and there had been no contrary opinion since then, that the <span class="SpellE">rebuttable</span> presumption of identity of person is applicable
not only in civil cases but also to the identification of the accused in
criminal cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To my mind, there is
absolutely no need that the accused be personally identified by the court while
the inculpating witness is testifying, where the accused voluntarily waives his
presence and even suggests to the court, as petitioner has done, to avail of
the legal presumption just mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(See Sec. 5(w), Rule 131.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, it is to be underscored that the presumption is <span class="SpellE"><i>juris</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">tantum</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></i>Thus, the waiver of the presence of the
accused at the trial does not preclude him from presenting evidence to overcome
the presumption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I admit that the
ensuing situation may pose problems for the prosecution, but where in the
democratic world is the accused supposed to lend his hand in order to make it
that much easier for the court to convict him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our fundamental law, no less than the rudimentary rules of fair play,
expressly enjoins that the accused may not be compelled to incriminate himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I take such injunction to be consistent with
man's inalienable right to be treated with the dignity of a human being and it
therefore extends to any and all forms of making the accused aid the
prosecution in proving its case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is claimed that the state has the unquestionable right and
duty to see to it that the accused is not convicted unless he is duly
identified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the wisdom and nobility
of such proposition, I must say amen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But I maintain that it is an incongruity in principle to predicate on such
a just premise the conclusion that the state may compel the accused to assist
it by exhibiting himself for purposes of identification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am aware of precedents to the effect that
the compulsion against self-incrimination prohibited by the Bill of Rights does
not contemplate acts required of the accused which do not involve the
employment of his intellect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, he cannot be made to produce evidence against himself, but he can be
compelled to perform mechanical acts conducive to that end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I do not see any analogy between the
facts in those precedents and the case at bar, and, in any event, I do not see
the justice and fairness of those precedents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As far as I am concerned, the prosecution must prove its case by its own
effort and with its own resources and should not be permitted to depend on the
accused for anything that will help it secure his conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know that the Constitution has placed
emphasis on the duties and obligations of persons in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
equally with the Bill of Rights, but nowhere in those pertinent provisions in
Article V do I discern any duty or obligation on the part of an accused to help
the prosecution in having himself identified by the witnesses of the state.</p>

<p class="BODY">After having been in continuous practice at the bar for more than
three decades before joining the Court, I should know that the almost
invariable procedure practiced in the identification of accused persons at the
trial is in a sense impractical, if not farcical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the cases are called from the calendar,
the accused are made to stand and evidence their presence within the view of
everybody in the courtroom including the witnesses of the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rare is the occasion when necessary
precautions are taken at the initiative of meticulous defense lawyers to
prevent the witnesses from seeing the accused as they answer the calling of the
calendar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My point is that any quibbling
about the proper identification of the accused by compelling his presence at
the trial may not be worth the irreparable injury to human dignity that can be
caused by bodily and forcibly taking the accused from his place of confinement
to the place of trial in the event he insists on his pose that he is agreeable
anyway that the presumption on identities I have referred to be applied to his
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the precedents relied on by the prosecution, it is held that
inasmuch as the accused is under detention, his person is subject to the
disposition of the court before whom he is charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I disagree.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My position on this point is that his detention is only for the purpose
of securing the execution of the judgment in the eventuality of conviction and
for no other purpose derogative of his freedom to waive his personal rights
related to the procedure of his trial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His constitutional rights "to be heard by himself or counsel, to be
informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, to have a
speedy and public trial, to meet the witnesses face to face and to have
compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses and the production of
witnesses on his behalf" (Section 19, Art. IV) including those not to be
"compelled to be a witness against himself . . . to remain silent"
and not to be subjected to "force, violence, threat, intimidation, or any
other means which vitiates (his) free will" (Sec. 20, id.) and even that
of not being "twice put in jeopardy of punishment for the same
offense" (Sec. 22, id.) may be waived by him provided the waiver is made
properly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I see it, the right to be
present at the trial is more or less the composite of these rights I have
enumerated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since all of them separately
are <span class="SpellE">waivable</span>, why may not the waiver of all of them
be done wholesale, so to speak, as long as the waiver is clearly and
voluntarily manifested to the court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Above all, I consider the right of an accused to human dignity to be
more precious than all his other rights, hence I cannot see the point in
compelling the accused to sacrifice his human dignity for the sake of enabling
the prosecution to identify him in person when the same end can as well be
legally attained without exacting from him such sacrifice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sustaining as I do sustain the right of petitioner to absent
himself at the trial proper, it is unnecessary for me to discuss whether or not
the perpetuation proceedings constitute part of the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I must make it clear, however, than even if
We were to hold that they are part of the trial proper, I insist that if the
witnesses who have testified or will testify at the perpetuation proceedings
should be available when the trial actually takes place, it is the right of the
accused to have them recalled and to be examined further and even anew in the
sound discretion of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Presidential Decree 328, paragraph 2, amending subparagraph 4 b(7) of
Presidential Decree No. 39 is to be so construed, in the interest of fairness
and justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">As I close this concurrence, two thoughts continuously recurring
in my mind during its preparation keep urging articulation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first is that to commit suicide is
prohibited by the laws of God and man.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No one has the right to take his life for any reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Withal, leadership in any field of human
endeavor creates a responsibility that knows no surcease for any kind of
convenience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perseverance of purpose to
be of real significance and worth requires one's survival.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The future is inscrutable — the hand of fate
guides only those who bide their time and do not despair before the designed
moment comes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, could it yet be a
crime also against the interests of our country and people to indulge in
self-destruction when one knows that he has talents and attributes that can be
offered for the attainment of the national destiny.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second concerns the Supreme Court whose independence of
conviction it is the bounden duty of every Filipino to keep unsullied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The unkindest thing of all is for those to
whom you concede the loftiest of motives to impugn recklessly your own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The unceasing quest for the achievement of
the national goal naturally divides men in all democracies into groups each composed
of those sharing common views and feelings as to how to make the country
succeed earlier in realizing its ideals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such disparity, however, cannot produce disunity, as long as everyone
involved because of official duty or choice trusts the good faith of the other.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the members of the Court to happen to coincide in legal views
with the Executive is not servility.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither should it be considered evidence of any measure of orchestration
or common planning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact,
there has never been any such thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
best proof is that, as I have emphasized at the outset, this is the first
martial law case in which the required majority for doctrinal purposes has been
attained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where then is the alleged
orchestration?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And how could the charge
have basis in the face of the undeniable happenstance that no martial law or
constitutional decision has yet come out from the Court without vigorous and
extensive dissents of notable consistency.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, occasions there have been when one or two more votes became
imperative for a more effective and conclusive ruling, and no one can say that
anybody concerned received dictation as to what to do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of my own knowledge, I bear witness that not
even a finger has been lifted in any manner against any of the dissenters.</p>

<p class="BODY">As of now, the Court has not found enough cause to hold any of
the President's actuations submitted for Our scrutiny to have overstepped
constitutional bounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is evident
that due care is being taken to avoid fault in this respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can imagine no reason why and no occasion
when such effort will ever be relaxed at all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More so in the earnest vigil by the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">CASTRO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I am constrained to write this concurring and dissenting opinion
because e (a) although I substantially agree with Justice Felix Q. Antonio's
forthright discussion and learned resolution of the inescapable issues posed by
the petition and the supplemental petitions filed by the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Jr., I
disagree with his approbation of the "right" of total waiver claimed
by the petitioner, and (b) I desire to express my views on matters which,
although in a sense peripheral and not squarely in issue, are nevertheless
cogent and pertinent to the central issues at bar.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. At the threshold, I must state that I voted to deny the
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Aquino's</span> motion to withdraw his petitions
and all related motions and incidents, for the self-same reasons that impelled
my vote to deny Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno's</span> motion to withdraw
his petition in the Martial Law cases (<span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, et al.
<i>vs. </i><span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>, et al., L-35546, and other allied
cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a>) Like in the cases just adverted to, there
are in the case at bar considerations and issues of transcendental and grave
import, and I apprehend that great disservice may be caused to the national
interest if these are not resolved on the merits.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am hard put to
understand how and why the petitioner's counsels conjured the argument that
under the Bill of Rights the "due process" accorded to persons
accused in criminal cases contemplates only judicial process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This argument runs squarely athwart the
time-honored doctrine in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as well as in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
— a doctrine that the petitioner's counsels must surely be aware of — that due
process in criminal trials may comprehend not only judicial process, but also
executive process (and even legislative process in the proper cases.)</p>

<p class="NUM">3. <span class="SpellE">Corollarily</span> to this contention of the
petitioner, the further thesis is advanced that his trial by a military
commission denies him due process because he is deprived of the right of
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems rather elementary that
the right of appeal, unless the Constitution expressly guarantees such right,
is merely statutory and may be withdrawn, modified or altered at any time — a
principle that his counsels know only too well.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even an appeal to an intermediate collegiate appellate court or to the
Supreme Court is not a right under the Constitution unless <span class="GramE">an</span>
explicit guarantee can be found in the words thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">And as far as appeal is concerned, it is apparent that the
petitioner's counsels are not aware of the number of the levels of review of a
decision of conviction by a military commission in our jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four levels of review (equivalent to four
levels of automatic appeal) are provided, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the <i>first </i>review by the Staff Judge
Advocate of the Chief of Staff (who appoints the military commission); the <i>second
</i>review by a Board of Review of not less than three senior officers of the
Judge Advocate General's Service; the <i>third </i>review by a Board of
Military Review acting for the Secretary of National Defense and consisting of
not less than two lawyer-officers of at least field rank; and the <i>fourth and
final </i>review by the Secretary of Justice for the President of the
Philippines as Commander-in-Chief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
four reviews are compulsory; none of them may be bypassed or dispensed
with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And even if the Staff Judge
Advocate, the Board of Review, and the Board of Military Review all concur in
the judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed by the military commission,
the Secretary of Justice may yet, if in his opinion the evidence so warrants,
recommend to the President the acquittal or exoneration of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So that from arraignment by a military
commission to final action by the President, a minimum of thirteen
presumptively responsible individuals in different capacities are involved in
the entire process:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a military
commission of not less than five members, a Staff Judge Advocate, a Board of
Review of not less than three officers, a Board of Military Review of not less
than two officers, the Secretary of Justice, and the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I cannot accept the petitioner's inferential
conclusion that all the twelve persons involved (before the President <span class="GramE">takes</span> final action) can be dictated to, assuming that the
President is minded to influence them. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The petitioner may not be aware that the
military commissions now existing have acquitted many who have been accused
before them, and that convictions have been reversed or modified upon the
recommendation of the reviewing officers and boards of officers.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. The petitioner makes the indictment that the military tribunals
and the entire Judiciary are, to paraphrase him, well under the thumb of the
President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I quote his exact words:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Mr. Marcos is the single genius,
composing and directing all the proceedings, whether in the military tribunal
or in the civil courts . . . [and] has destroyed the independence of the civil
courts . . . Trials by civil courts would still be a travesty of justice . .
." This accusation is doubtless very serious, but I say that it is a
gravely irresponsible one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To declare or
imply that the entire Judiciary, from the Chief Justice and Associate Justices
of the Supreme Court down to the last municipal judge, is under dictation by
the <span class="GramE">President,</span> is an indictment that can come only
from a person who does not know whereof he speaks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the petitioner has no faith in military
justice and at the same time professes absolute lack of faith in the Judiciary,
does this mean that the petitioner is so magically endowed that only he and he
alone is capable of meting out justice in this country?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The over-all workload of all the courts in
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has increased immeasurably.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this does
not indubitably indicate the faith of the people in the Judiciary then I do not
know what does.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the petitioner does
not share the faith of the people in the Judiciary, we must look to reasons
other than the ostensible ones for his irresponsible and reprehensible
statements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To my mind these reasons are
obvious and need not be belabored.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. On the matter of whether the petitioner has what he claims is a
"right of total waiver" of his presence in the proceedings before the
military commission, I confess that the basis for such view escapes me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trouble with the advocacy of the so-called
"right" of total waiver is that it places undue and inordinate stress
on the "rights" of the individual and completely refuses to recognize
that the State, too, has its own rights and duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do not believe that there can be any debate
on the right and obligation of the State to administer justice properly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Part and parcel of this right and obligation
is the right of a tribunal, whether judicial or executive, to satisfy <span class="GramE">itself</span> that the person whom it may later convict upon the
evidence is the accused pointed to by the eye-witnesses for the
prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because if the witnesses
point to X, arid the accused actually happens to be Y, the court or tribunal
has, in conscience, no recourse but to absolve Y.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, the proper identification of the accused
is the very <i>quintessence </i>and <i>sine qua non </i>of any <i>valid </i>prosecution,
is the very <i>fundament of due process </i>in any criminal trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, if the commission is to discharge its
burden conscientiously, it cannot be denied the right to determine for itself
the proper identity of the person who stands accused before it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This right has absolute primacy over what the
petitioner calls his "right" of total waiver of his presence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, in this particular case of the petitioner, it could be
argued that he is a national figure and therefore is known by everybody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I challenge the correctness of this
postulate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For can it not possibly
happen that a member of the trying tribunal may have heard of <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Jr., the
former Governor of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> and former Senator, but may
have never actually seen him before?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Identification is essentially one of perception of sight and not a
process of inference or strained deductive reasoning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be correct to infer from the
declarations in court of witnesses for the prosecution who refer to a <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Jr., former
Governor of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> and former Senator, that the
person referred to is the petitioner, but this cannot thereby foreclose the
petitioner from later challenging the validity of his conviction (if he is
convicted) upon the ground that not one of the prosecution witnesses pointed to
him as the indicted <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>,
J r.</p>

<p class="BODY">My understanding of the provisions of the new Constitution on
waiver of presence in criminal proceedings is that such waiver may be validly
implied principally in cases where the accused has jumped bail or has escaped,
but certainly may not be asserted as a matter of absolute right in cases where
the accused is in custody and his identification is needed in the course of the
proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">And what of the reviews to be conducted by the Staff Judge
Advocate of the Chief of Staff, the Board of Review, the Board of Military
Review, and the Secretary of Justice?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is
it not the bounden duty of these individuals, singly and collectively, to
satisfy themselves beyond cavil at the outset of review that the person
convicted by the commission is the accused named in the charges and that he was
identified properly by the eye-witnesses for the prosecution?</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, I voted for <i>qualified waiver:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></i>the accused may waive his presence in the
criminal proceedings except at the stages where identification of his person by
the prosecution witnesses is necessary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I might agree to the proposition of "total" waiver in any case
<i>where the accused agrees explicitly and unequivocally in writing signed by
him or personally manifests clearly and indubitably in open court and such
manifestation is recorded, </i>that whenever a prosecution witness mentions a
name by which the accused is known, the witness is referring to him and to no
one else.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is disturbing is that because six Justices voted for
"total" waiver and only five Justices voted for qualified waiver, the
judges of all inferior courts would now be at a loss to determine, in any given
situation, whether to take the "total" waiver position or follow the
qualified waiver doctrine — unless it be conceded that because the Court is
divided and the "total" waiver theory fails to command the assent of
eight Justices, the qualified waiver theory must be regarded as doctrinal
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, each judge should be
left to determine, according to his conscience and the milieu of each case,
what to do in order to administer justice properly.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acquittal on a mistaken identity basis has occurred in numberless
instances all over the world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it
is true that the Rules of Court provide that identity of name means identity of
person, it is a well-known fact in this country that there are names so common
that many persons carry the same name.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Especially considering that our population has burgeoned considerably,
no one can deny that there are many persons by the name Jose Cruz, many by the
name Jose Santos, many by the name Jose Reyes, <i>ad infinitum</i><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span>
(which is good enough reason why the President of the Integrated Bar, retired
Supreme Court Justice Jose B.L. Reyes, has found it necessary to put the
letters "B" and "L" between the names "Jose" and
"Reyes", and why I have used the name "Ruiz" in my name in
order that my identity will not be confused with those of two other persons who
are known by the name Fred Castro).</p>

<p class="NUM">6. During the deliberations on this case, there came to the
attention of the Court rumors and amorphous bits of news to the effect that the
petitioner was on the verge of death because of his "hunger strike."
Curiously and oddly enough, none of those who purveyed the rumors ever thought
of submitting to the Court a statement from the Secretary of National Defense
as to the state of health of the petitioner. And because of this, there was a
feeling on the part of some members of the Court that they were being
"stampeded" into deciding this case on the basis of the petitioner's
"hunger strike." As far as I am concerned, I did not think it
advisable for the Court to request the Secretary of National Defense for such
statement, because I assumed that if the petitioner were indeed in a state
where his death was imminent, his counsels would have come forward with
alacrity to inform the Court accordingly — and this, <span class="SpellE">inspite</span>
of the petitioner's motion to withdraw which, at the time the rumors reached
the Court, was still unresolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
argue that because the petitioner had already filed his motion to withdraw
there was no more need for his counsels to give the Court information regarding
his supposedly deteriorating health, is to assume <span class="SpellE">erroneouslly</span>
that the Court would grant his motion.</p>

<p class="NUM">7. I here make of record my considered view that the petitioner
has deliberately and calculatingly tried to utilize the Court as a forum for
his propaganda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First he said he
preferred trial by the civil courts to trial by any military tribunal, but in
the next breath he denounced the civil courts as "lacking in
independence." Then he filed a petition with the Court to stop the
proceedings before the military tribunal; shortly thereafter he moved to
withdraw it, saying that his remedies had come "<span class="GramE">to</span>
little and too late." Next he renounced the services of all his counsels,
civilian and military, yet his lawyers continued to file pleadings in his
behalf with the Court, visit him in his quarters, and assist him in the
perpetuation proceedings before the military commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then his lawyers filed a manifestation with
the Court claiming that the military commission's decision to compel him to
appear was for the purpose of "dehumanizing and humiliating" him; but
when the Court, acting on his manifestation, restrained the military
commission, he directed his lawyers to withdraw his petitions before the Court,
including his prayer for a temporary restraining order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He informed the newspapers that his "hunger
strike" was a protest against his compelled presence in the perpetuation
proceedings, but when six Justices of the Court voted for his "right"
to "total" waiver of his presence, he announced that he would attend
the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of these developments
could indeed be read to mean one or both of two things:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that his "hunger strike" was, after
all, perhaps not quite what it purported to be and/or that he has been trifling
and continues to trifle with the military commission and with the Court.</p>

<p class="NUM">8. If I <span class="GramE">were</span> the petitioner, and I know I
am innocent, there would appear to be no reason for me not to face the
proceedings frontally and establish my innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not to imply that the petitioner is
guilty of the charges; it is merely to stress that his behavior is hardly what
perceptive people would expect from a man who professes innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it is propaganda that is in the back of
the head of the petitioner, I would think that the highest-quality propaganda
in his favor is to establish his innocence of the charges soonest possible</p>

<p class="NUM">9. I would like to add my own emphasis to the opinion written by
Justice Antonio, by stating in capsule my considered views:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the President of the Philippines, by
virtue of his proclamation of martial law <i>(in <span class="SpellE">sensu</span>
<span class="SpellE">strictiore</span>), </i>which the Court has already upheld
as within the ambit of his powers under the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions, has
likewise the power to organize military commissions in order to carry out the
objectives and purposes of martial rule; (2) the military commissions created
by authority of the pertinent presidential decrees are legal as well as
constitutional, as the said presidential decrees have been expressly made part
of the law of the land by the transitory provisions of the 1973 Constitution; (3)
by tradition and history as well as by the explicit provisions of the said
valid presidential decrees, the military commissions so created have
jurisdiction to try civilians for offenses necessarily connected with the
objectives of martial law, whether these offenses were committed prior to the
institution of martial rule or subsequent thereto — and this <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the fact that the civil courts are open and
functioning; (4) the claim of the petitioner that because the offenses with
which he is charged were, in point of time, allegedly committed prior to the
declaration of martial law they may not be taken cognizance of by a military
commission, ignores one inescapable basic fact, and this is that the crimes
imputed to him are among the crimes that gave cause for the institution of
martial rule; (5) the argument of the petitioner that the Constitution, in
providing for due process in criminal trials, can mean only trial by judicial
courts, not only demonstrates the petitioner's misunderstanding or misreading
of military traditions in civilized countries throughout the ages but as well
foists an interpretation of the Constitution not warranted by its phraseology;
(6) well-imbedded in our jurisprudence is the recognition that justice can be
administered fairly by military tribunals; and (7) the power of the Supreme
Court to review death sentences does not include the power to review death
sentences imposed by military tribunals.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="text-indent: -0.25in;">10. In view of all that I have above
stated, and especially in the light of my considered opinion that the military
commissions now in existence have jurisdiction to try civilians, judicial
restraint effectively precludes me from expressing my views on whether the
President should transfer the case of the petitioner to a civil court for trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, it is my abiding conviction that the
President will do, within the intendment of his sacred oath of office, what he
believes is just for the petitioner and, logically, also for everyone else
similarly situated.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FERNANDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">As was made clear at the opening of the learned and
comprehensive, ably-penned decision of the Court through Justice Antonio, I am
for the granting of petitioner's motion for withdrawal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My brethren had thought otherwise and
consequently did proceed to discuss the merits of the issues raised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While again I would vote for the transfer of
the criminal charges against petitioner to civil courts, it does not mean that
I am in total disagreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
there may be a need for a brief expression of opinion on my part as a mere
formal concurrence on some of the points discussed may for some imply an
identity of thought lurking dormant and concealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is better to avoid any misunderstanding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, at least to my mind, it would make
even more apparent the truth that there can be no such thing as complete
objectivity in constitutional law, a field where there are no absolutes, every
constitutional question involving a balancing of competing values.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may also serve, hopefully, to illustrate
that orthodoxy in juridical thought is not per se antithetical to the professed
aims of an innovative legal order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
gives me an opportunity likewise to acknowledge the neat and logical pattern to
the decision that strengthens its plausibility.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The principles of law announced flow from the basic premise of the stern
necessities of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What bothers
me is that from the standpoint of tried and tested concepts in constitutional
law, there would seem to be a need for further refinement as to the scope of
such doctrines and for clarifying differentiation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That, for me at least, would have been
desirable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The apprehension is
entertained that as worded in a rather all-encompassing manner, they may yield
the impression of a total surrender to the pressure of events and the demands
of the times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Candor though compels the
admission that in the final analysis juridical theories cannot afford to be
insensible to political and social realities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now for the grounds of my concurrence and my dissent.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the belief that
petitioner's motion to withdraw should be granted, I am compelled to
dissent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is with due recognition of
the principle that the Court is vested with discretion to grant or refuse such
a plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This notwithstanding, I am fully
persuaded that the more appropriate response is one of acceding to petitioner's
prayer that all cases filed on his behalf in this Court be terminated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assumption must be that before he did
arrive at such a conclusion, he had weighed with care and circumspection all
the relevant aspects of the situation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It could very well be that he was prompted to take such a move to avoid
further anxiety and worry on his part, considering that the ultimate outcome could
belie expectations and frustrate hopes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At any rate, with his mind thus made up and without any compelling
reason, in my mind, for the Court to keep the case in the docket, the
discretion should be exercised in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor does the fact that he used rather harsh language in the reasons
given by him for his motion of withdrawal militate against his plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There must be more understanding shown for
the state of his physical and mental health after this long period of
confinement, and of late of his depriving himself of the daily sustenance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, the cutting edge of his sharp
and pointed words may be blunted by the performance of this Court, which in the
ultimate analysis is the ultimate criterion as to whether or not it has
adequately discharged its responsibilities or lived up to the trust reposed in
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment is for the entire
constituency of informed and concerned citizens, not of petitioner alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As for any individual Justice, I would assume
that what matters most is the verdict of his conscience.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. Now as to the nature of my concurrence which has to be further
qualified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Right at the outset, may I
make clear that I join my brethren only to the extent that the conclusion
arrived at by them conforms to what I had previously expressed in my separate
opinions in <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> <i>vs</i>. Ponce <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> <i>vs</i>. Commission on Elections.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It follows that where the opinion of the Court reflects the stand I took, I am
in agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More specifically, on the
question of the scope of the competence of a military commission, I would
predicate my vote on the constitutional provision that affixes to General
Orders Nos. 8, 12, and 39 the status of being "part of the law of the
land."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
With due recognition of the vigor with which counsel for petitioner had pressed
the point that such a character cannot be impressed on the aforesaid general
orders if found in conflict with the present Constitution, I still find
difficulty in according complete acceptance to such a view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To do so in my opinion would mean closing
one's eyes to what was intended by the 1971 Constitutional Convention insofar
as it did provide for the continued existence of a military commission with
such powers as were then exercised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is not to imply though that in no case may a Presidential proclamation, order,
decree, or instruction be challenged in appropriate suits for lack of
conformity to a specific provision found in the present Constitution.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. It is to be stressed further that were it not for the above
mandate of the Transitory Provisions, the submission of petitioner as to a
military commission being devoid of jurisdiction over civilians elicits

my mind, is that supplied in the opinion of the United States Supreme Court in

As set forth in the Duncan opinion penned by Justice Black:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Our question does not involve the
well-established power of the military to exercise jurisdiction over members of
the armed forces, those directly connected with such forces, or enemy
belligerents, prisoners of war, or others charged with violating the laws of
war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not concerned with the
recognized power of the military to try civilians in tribunals established as a
part of a temporary military government over occupied enemy territory or
territory regained from an enemy where civilian government cannot and does not
function.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For <st1:state><st1:place>Hawaii</st1:place></st1:state>
since annexation has been held by and loyal to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor need we here consider the power of the military simply to arrest and
detain civilians interfering with a necessary military function at a time of
turbulence and danger from insurrection or war.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And finally, there was no specialized effort of the military, here, to
enforce orders which related only to military functions, such as, for
illustration, curfew rules or blackouts."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> I

that in any way runs counter to the above summary of the scope of the power of
military tribunals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was an action,
as pointed out by Justice Holmes, "brought by the plaintiff in error
against the former governor of the state of <st1:state><st1:place>Colorado</st1:place></st1:state>,
the former adjutant general of the national guard of the same state, and a
captain of a company of the national guard, for an imprisonment of the
plaintiff by them while in office."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came this portion of the opinion:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The complaint alleges that the imprisonment was continued from the
morning of March 30, 1904, to the afternoon of June 15, and that the defendants
justified under the Constitution of Colorado, making the governor commander in
chief of the state forces, and giving him power to call them out to execute
laws, suppress insurrection, and repel invasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It alleges that his imprisonment was without
probable cause, that no complaint was filed against the plaintiff, and that (in
that sense) he was prevented from having access to the courts of the state,
although they were open during the whole time; but it sets out proceedings on
habeas corpus, instituted by him before the supreme court of the state, in
which that court refused to admit him to bail and ultimately discharged the
writ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>35 <st1:state><st1:place>Colo.</st1:place></st1:state>
154, 91 <st1:place>Pac.</st1:place> 738, and 35 <st1:state><st1:place>Colo.</st1:place></st1:state>

190.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In those proceedings it appeared
that the governor had declared a county to be in a state of insurrection, had
called out troops to put down the trouble, and had ordered that the plaintiff
should be arrested as a leader of the outbreak, and should be detained until he
could be discharged with safety, and that then he should be delivered to the civil
authorities, to be dealt_ with according to law."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Plaintiff in error would hold the Governor liable for his order of detention in
the course of suppressing an insurrection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the case was dismissed on demurrer by the Circuit Court, it was
elevated to the United States Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In affirming the judgment, Justice Holmes categorically stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"When it comes to a decision by the head
of the state upon a matter involving its life, the ordinary rights of
individuals must yield to what he deems the necessities of the moment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Public danger warrants the substitution of
executive process for judicial process.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>See <span class="SpellE">Keely</span> <i>vs. </i>Sanders, 99 <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
441, 446; 25 L. ed. 327, 328.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was
admitted with regard to killing men in the actual clash of arms; and we think
it obvious, although it was disputed, that the same is true of temporary
detention to prevent apprehended harm."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
It does appear to me then, and this I say with due respect, that it is a rather
forced interpretation to extract from the above explicit declaration of Justice
Holmes the meaning that military tribunals are vested with jurisdiction over
civilians.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was involved was a
detention, not a trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the view I
entertain that <st1:city><st1:place>Duncan</st1:place></st1:city> <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Kahanamoku</span> supplies the applicable principle under the 1935
Constitution, the citations from <st1:city><st1:place>Winthrop</st1:place></st1:city>
and <span class="SpellE">Fairman</span> found in the opinion of the Court are,
for me, less than persuasive.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
What compels concurrence on my part, to repeat, is "the law of the
land" section found in the Transitory Provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Absent that provision, I would be unable to
yield to the conclusion reached by my brethren on the question of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. The recognition implicit in the above constitutional precept as
to the competence of a military commission to conduct criminal trials of
certain specified offenses, to my mind, carries with it the duty to respect all
the constitutional rights of an accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is from that perspective that a discussion of the due process
guarantee gains significance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has a
connotation both substantive and procedural.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As to the latter aspect, it is true that it has at its core, to follow
the classic formulation of Webster, the requirement of a hearing before
condemnation and a process of rational inquiry, but it has a much wider
radiation extending to all the legal safeguards enjoyed by a person indicted
for an offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it has come to be in
the United States, where it is deemed to include the right to be free from
unreasonable searches and seizures and to have excluded from criminal trials
any evidence illegally seized;<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>

A related matter is the question of due process and preliminary
investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have my reservations as
to the tone of certitude in the opinion of the court concerning the latter's
being bereft of any constitutional significance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the ruling in People <i>vs</i>. Sierra<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
that "the principle uninterruptedly adhered to [is] that only where an
accused is held to answer a criminal offense in an arbitrary or oppressive
manner is there a disregard thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
requirement of the proceeding not being unjust or unreasonable must be
met.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not to rule out cases where
such infirmity could be predicated on a showing that the disregard of this
procedural safeguard did infect the prosecution with unfairness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that sense, what was held in People <i>vs</i>.
<span class="SpellE">Monton</span> as to such a failing nullifying the proceeding
because of the due process protection could still be conceivably relied
upon."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">5. Thus we come to what for me is the crucial issue posed, labeled
"the principal question" in the memorandum of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would invoke the highly-prized ideal in
adjudication announced in Gutierrez, likewise a due process requirement, that a
party to a trial "is entitled to nothing less than the cold neutrality of
an impartial judge."<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
His fears, not devoid of plausibility, proceed from respondent Commission
having been "created by the President's Order and subject to his control
and direction" being unable to ignore his characterization that the
evidence against petitioner was "not only strong [but] overwhelming."<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
It is to that implacable tenet of objectivity and neutrality, one of
constitutional dimension, that appeal is made.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For Gutierrez has been followed subsequently in an unbroken line of
decisions with an impressive concord of opinion.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
That for petitioner is to buttress a stand that mirrors the realities, to
reinforce the solidity of his position.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For was it not <span class="SpellE">Stoessinger</span> who pointed out
that there may be at times a tendency difficult to resist in subordinate
military agencies to view matters in the light supplied by previous
pronouncements of those higher up in the ranks and to respond to situations
less on the basis of empirical evidence but more on that of conformity to a
position officially taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do not have
to go that far.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is acceptance on
my part that, as the opinion of the Court states, respondent military
commission may be trusted to be fair and that at any rate there are still
various appeals in the offing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus
there are built-in defenses against any erroneous or unfair judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, however, this other point to
consider.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the Gutierrez ruling as
now interpreted does not only guard against the reality but likewise the
appearance of partiality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That would
argue strongly for the transfer of the trial of the criminal charges against
petitioner to civil courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor would he
be the only one thereby benefited.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Commission would be spared from a proceeding with a case
where from the start, in view of the peculiar circumstances, its <i>bona fides</i>
had been open to question, although admittedly lacking factual foundation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President likewise would be absolved from
any adverse, if unfounded criticism. The greatest gain of course would be for
the administration of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
relevance to this excerpt from <span class="SpellE">Palang</span> <i>vs. </i><span class="SpellE">Zosa</span><a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
"This voluntary inhibition by respondent judge is to be commended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has lived up to what is expected of
occupants of the bench.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The public faith
in the impartial administration of justice is thus reinforced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not enough that they decide cases
without bias and favoritism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not
suffice that they in fact rid themselves of prepossessions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their actuation must inspire that
belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is an instance where
appearance is just as important as the reality.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Like Caesar's wife, a judge must not only be pure but beyond
suspicion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At least, that is an ideal
worth striving for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, there
is deference to the due process mandate."<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
Necessarily then, there is complete acceptance on my part of the thought
expressed in the opinion of the Court that the President is not precluded from
pursuing further a notion previously expressed by him concerning the possible
transfer of the proceedings against petitioner to the civil courts.</p>

<p class="NUM">6. A few words more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
to be admitted that in coping with the urgencies of the times, in accordance
with what is ordained by the fundamental law and thus have its promise
fulfilled, this Court is compelled to enter a domain much less clearly mapped
out than before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has to find its way
as best it can with the light supplied by applicable precedents and the
promptings of reason at times rendered obscure by the clouds of the emergency
conditions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, there must he an
awareness that the complexities of an era may not yield to the simplicities of
a constitutional fundamentalism as well as of the pitfalls of merely
doctrinaire interpretations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot
apply precepts with inflexible rigidity to fast-changing situations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notion of law in flux carries it far
indeed from a fixed mooring in certainty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There must be, it cannot be denied, greater sensitivity to the shifts in
approach called for by the troubled present.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, to paraphrase <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span>, care is to
be taken lest time-tested doctrines may shrivel in the effulgence of the
overpowering rays of martial rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
must be an effort to remain consistent with the old although relevant to the
new.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is my view that thereby there is
fidelity to the concept of the Constitution not only as a broad charter of
powers to resolve conflicting issues and social problems, a means of ordering
the life of the nation in times of normalcy as well as of crisis, but also as
an assurance of the primacy of civil liberties.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">MUÑOZ <st1:city><st1:place>PALMA</st1:place></st1:city>,
<i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur with the dissenting Opinion of Justice Claudio, <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> with additional explanation for my vote.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;">1. On the Motion to
withdraw Petition —</p>

<p class="BODY">From a letter of <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Jr. of <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="4">April
 14, 1975</st1:date>, addressed to his wife, children, relatives, and friends
submitted to the Court and now part of the record of the case (see page 65 of
Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee's</span> dissenting opinion), I am
convinced that petitioner no longer desires to seek redress or relief from this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would, rather make of his
plight (his continued detention from September 23, 1972, in a military camp and
his trial before a Military Commission for crimes allegedly committed before
the proclamation of Martial Law) a matter of conscience between himself arid
the President of the Republic, and offer his life for what he believes is a
rightful cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Who am I to stand on the
way of this man who offers himself in supreme sacrifice, and is ready to
consign his fate to his Maker, for his country and his people?</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;">2. <span class="GramE">On</span> the merits of the Case —</p>

<p class="BODY">I vote to grant the Petition for Prohibition because, brushing
aside the personalities of the parties involved, that is, the fact that <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Jr. was a member
of the Senate and a known leader of the Opposition at the time martial law was
proclaimed and that President Ferdinand E. Marcos believes in the Rule of Law
notwithstanding martial rule, I am called upon at this moment to lay down a
principle of law which will decide the fate, not only of the present generation
but also that of Filipinos still to be born.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For the main question now at stake — whether or not military tribunals
can try and render a verdict on <i>civilians </i>for offenses allegedly
committed before or even during martial rule, notwithstanding the fact that
civil authority is supreme and civil courts are existing and functioning under
the Constitution — raises before my eyes the gruesome <span class="SpellE">spectre</span>
of one, a hundred, a thousand civilian Filipinos being dragged by the mighty
arm of the military before its own created and manned tribunals, commissions,
etc., for offenses, real or imaginary, and tried and sentenced without the
constitutional safeguards attendant to a trial by civil courts (see page 70-74
of Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee's</span> Opinion for these safeguards).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True it is, that the picture I conjure before
me may not take place at all under the present dispensation because President
Ferdinand E. Marcos, as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, is committed to
uphold the Constitution and, as quoted by Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>,
believes in the protection of the Bill of Rights (see page 101 of Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee's</span> Opinion).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">But what about tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow,
when we shall all be gone and the political atmosphere different?</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Legal precepts which are to protect the basic
fundamental rights and liberties of an individual must be laid down not only
for the present but for all times and for all conditions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Bill of Rights must remain firm,
indestructible, and unyielding to all forms of pressure, <i>for like </i><st1:place><i>Mount
 Sinai</i></st1:place><i> of Moses it can be the only refuge of a people in any
crucible they may suffer in the course of their destiny</i>.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>: </p>

<p class="BODY">This opinion for the granting of petitioner's withdrawal motion
and in view of its denial, for the granting of the writ of prohibition against
respondent military commission as prayed for in the petition, is issued
pursuant to the Court's Resolution of <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="4">April
 25, 1975</st1:date>, which ruled as follows:</p>

<blockquote>". . . The Court, by a vote of seven to three, Resolved to
DENY petitioner's motion for withdrawal of the petition and of all motions and
incidents related thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Castro, <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, Antonio, <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, Jr. and
Martin, J.J., voted to deny the motion: Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> Palma, J.J., voted to grant the motion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There being no sufficient votes to declare that the
respondent Military Commission is without jurisdiction over the pending
criminal cases filed against the petitioner and that it acted with grave abuse
of discretion in conducting the perpetuation of testimony proceedings, the
Court Resolved to lift, effective immediately, the restraining order issued on
April 8, 1975.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> Palma, JJ., voted to maintain the
restraining order.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the question of waiver of the presence of the petitioner
in the perpetuation of testimony proceedings, Fernando; <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>,

<p class="NUM">I. I vote for the granting of petitioner's motion to withdraw his
petition and all other pending motions and matters.</p>

<p class="BODY">To paraphrase and cite the Chief Justice's reasons in casting a
vote for granting a similar motion for withdrawal of petition filed by former
Senator Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> in the Habeas Corpus cases<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
(which was also defeated for lack of necessary votes), such withdrawal would
not emasculate the "issues of paramount public interest" that need to
be resolved (as invoked by the majority) for they may be duly resolved in the
other cases which remain pending, such as the earlier and urgent lead case of <span class="SpellE"><i>Gumaua</i></span><i> vs. <span class="SpellE">Espino</span> and
Military Commission No.</i>2<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
which raises the same fundamental question of whether military tribunals have
jurisdiction to try civilians (wherein petitioner was sentenced on March 16,
1973 to death by firing squad, which sentence was affirmed on September 29,
1973 by the President and which has long been pending decision); and since it
is petitioner <span class="SpellE">Aquino's</span> life and liberty that are at
stake, his choice to renounce his own petition questioning the jurisdiction of
respondent military commission to try the cases filed against him and the
subsequent incidents and to remove the case from this Court's cognizance should
be respected "regardless of the fact that (one) disagreed with many of his
reasons for so doing" since one "could not escape a sense of irony in
this Court's turning down the plea to withdraw. . . and then ruling adversely
to him on the merits of his petition." It may be added that since the
majority who voted to deny the withdrawal motion numbers only seven out of ten
Justices taking part in the deliberations as of the date of issuance of the
Court's Resolution of April 25, 1975 which denied the motion<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
the majority opinion would fall short of the required number of eight Justices
to render a decision on the merits.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General's grounds for opposing withdrawal are not
persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his first opposition of <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1975</st1:date> where he notes that
petitioner "has chosen to dramatize his protest by staging a hunger
strike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's motion is thus
silently eloquent in its avoidance of the reasons for (withdrawal), "his
prayer that "if the petitioner's motion is granted, it should be with
prejudice," is inconsistent with his posture that the petition is
premature and with the fact that the charges against petitioner are still, <i>pending
reinvestigation</i> as ordered by the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his second opposition of April 16, 1975,
he avers that the Government "seeks only to present the evidence
supporting the charges of murder, illegal possession of firearms and subversion
against the petitioner," and if this be so, petitioner's withdrawal of his
petition at bar precisely clears the way of all judicial obstacles for the
prosecution to do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's withdrawal should be properly granted in pursuance
of the established principle that the judicial power is exercised only when
necessary for the resolution of an actual case and controversy, particularly in
view of the respondents' stand in their answer that the petition has been <i>prematurely</i>
filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judicial abstention would provide the Court with time and
opportunity to ponder and deliberate on the basic constitutional questions
involved and their ramifications which concern <i>inter</i> <span class="SpellE"><i>alia</i></span>
the supremacy of civilian authority over the military, the right of civilians
to judicial process as against the executive process of military tribunals, the
upholding of Judicial Power as vested by the Constitution in the Supreme Court
and in such inferior courts as may be established by law and the recognition of
the individual's liberties as guaranteed by the Bill of Rights even in a state
of martial law.</p>

<p class="NUM">II. Since the majority has nevertheless resolved to go into the
merits of the case and the transcendental constitutional issues, a brief
statement of the factual background is required for the proper consideration of
the issues on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner (after having been served on August 11 and 18, 1973 at
his detention quarters with copies of the six criminal charges filed against
him with respondent military commission) filed on August 23, 1973 his original petition
at bar for prohibition questioning the jurisdiction of military tribunals in
the absence of a state of war or belligerency over civilians like him
particularly, for civil offenses allegedly committed before the proclamation of
martial law and complaining of violation of his constitutional rights in that
he was deprived of due process and the vested right to preliminary
investigation as provided by law and the assistance of counsel with right to
cross-examine the witnesses against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner further alleged that the military tribunals are mere
instruments and subject to the control of the President as created by him under
the General Orders issued by him as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of
the Philippines,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and that he had already been publicly indicted and adjudged guilty by the
President of the charges in a nationwide press conference held on August 24,
1971, following the Plaza Miranda bombing of August 21, 1971 and the suspension
of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus under Proclamation No. 889 on
August 23, 1971.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court set an urgent preliminary hearing on <st1:date year="1973" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1973</st1:date> (a Sunday) on the
question of whether with its membership then of only nine (9) Justices, it had
the required <i>quorum</i> to take cognizance of the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No further action was taken by the Court for
following petitioner's refusal to participate in the arraignment and trial set
on August 27, 1973, the President issued on August 28, 1973 Administrative
Order No. 355, creating a special five-member committee to "reinvestigate
the charges against <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>,
Jr. and others," composed of a retired Supreme Court Justice to be
designated by the Chief Justice as chairman and four members to be designated
respectively, by the accused-petitioner himself, the president of the
Integrated Bar of the Philippines, the Secretary of Justice and the Secretary
of National Defense, with the proviso that "should the accused decline to
designate a representative to the committee, the Chief Justice shall designate
someone in his stead" and expressly stating the following premises and

of the application to him of the established procedure sanctioned by law and
practice;</blockquote>

conducted a <i>fair and impartial initial investigation</i>, it is desirable to
reassure the accused that he <i>continues</i> <i>to enjoy his constitutional

of anybody that only after finding a <i>prima</i> <i>facie case</i> against him
were charges filed;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, it is necessary for the above purpose that a
Committee be created to conduct a re-investigation of said charges to
demonstrate that everything is being done to <i>insure</i> <i>utmost</i> <i>fairness</i>,

the accused and <i>to determine whether really there is reasonable ground to
believe that the offenses charged were in fact committed and the accused is

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed on <st1:date year="1973" day="5" month="9">September

<p class="BODY">No action was taken by the Court on this supplemental petition

on April 15, 1974 and August 19, 1974 on the "actual removal" of
martial law and that "technically and legally, martial law was lifted with
the ratification of the Constitution last year (1973)." The Solicitor

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on March 10, 1975, respondent military commission

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's counsel filed on March 24, 1975 an urgent motion to
restrain respondent military commission from holding the perpetuation
proceedings on the grounds among others that the very issue of its jurisdiction
to take cognizance of civil offenses allegedly committed before martial law by
civilians like petitioner was pending with this Court and that such proceedings
would "short-circuit" the Special Reinvestigating Committee created
under Administrative Order No. 355 even before such committee has commenced its
duty to determine the existence of "reasonable ground to believe that the
offenses charged were in fact committed and the accused is probably guilty
thereof' and "whether or not petitioner should be held for trial."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

this Court, then composed of ten members issued its resolution that it lacked
the "necessary quorum" to act on petitioner's said urgent motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 7, 1975, petitioner's counsel filed an urgent
manifestation averring that this Court without a qualified quorum could issue
the temporary restraining order prayed for so as not to render the case moot
and apprising this Court that after respondent military commission had on April

that the perpetuation proceedings are <i>not</i> a part of the trial and
granted petitioner's request to be returned to his detention quarters, ruling
that he could refuse to be present at the proceedings since he had expressly
waived his presence, as allowed in P.D. No. 328, it reversed itself at the
military prosecutor's instance on April 4, 1975 and now ruled that the perpetuation
proceedings are part of the trial and that petitioner must be present at the
proceedings (which would take two to three months according to the military
prosecutor's manifestation) and that petitioner must be physically present
throughout the proceedings even against his will.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's counsel further manifested that petitioner's request
to respondent military commission to suspend the proceedings for seven days to
allow his counsel time and opportunity to seek appropriate relief from this Court
was summarily denied and petitioner then delivered his statement that if denied
this "last basic right of a human being . . . to be let alone" he
would have no alternative "but to go on a hunger strike, as a form of
silent protest against a procedure that is intended to humiliate and dehumanize
me."</p>

<p class="BODY">The perpetuation of testimony proceedings thus commenced on <st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1975</st1:date> and continued on
succeeding days with the military prosecutor presenting as the first state
witness Benjamin M. <span class="SpellE">Bie</span>, Jr. alias <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> Commander Melody, and with petitioner being compelled
to be present throughout the proceedings. This witness, <span class="SpellE">Bie</span>
together with another listed witness Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Sanguyo</span>
alias <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> Commander <span class="SpellE">Pusa</span>

charges against them were withdrawn under a "<span class="SpellE">nolle</span>
<span class="SpellE">prosequi</span>" order issued by the Secretary of
National Defense dated March 15, 1975.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1975</st1:date>,
the Court ordered the issuance of a temporary restraining order enjoining
respondent military commission from further proceeding with the perpetuation
proceedings until the matter is heard and further orders and set petitioner's
urgent motion and related incidents for hearing on <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was at this hearing that petitioner's counsel presented the simple
motion to withdraw the petition and all other pending motions in compliance
with the petitioner's express wish. </p>

<p class="BODY">In compliance with the Court's instruction at the hearing to
inquire into petitioner's reasons for his withdrawal motion, his counsel on the
next day, April<span style="">&nbsp; </span>5, 1975, filed their
manifestation submitting therewith petitioner's 6-page letter of April 14, 1975
addressed to his wife, mother, relatives and friends stating his reasons <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> and for continuing the hunger strike "
(he)began ten days ago," <i>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></i>, that
"(he) felt that the case (he) had filed since 1973 in the Supreme Court
had become meaningless; that he had decided to "place (his) fate and (his)
life squarely in the hands of . . . Mr. Marcos;" that "The meaning
and thrust of (his) struggle and sacrifice transcend the limited question of
(his) absence or presence in the proceedings before the military tribunal"
and he has solemnly vowed to continue his hunger strike as a protest against
:"1. the trial of civilians before military tribunals . . .; 2. the lack
of judicial independence . . . for as long as our judges remain 'casuals'. . .;
3. the absence of a genuine free press . . .; (and) 4. the further continuance

<p class="NUM">III. The transcendental character of the constitutional issues
raised, dealing as they do with the individual's fundamental liberties as
guaranteed by the Bill of Rights even in a state of martial law, which
concededly is "not a military takeover of civil government functions"<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
and recognized under the 1973 Constitution to which all have pledged loyalty
and wherein we are now called upon to discharge the judiciary's great burden of
defining its constitutional boundaries, compels my vote on the merits which I
cast for the granting of the writ of prohibition prayed for against respondent
military commission for the reasons and considerations which are <span class="SpellE">hereinbelow</span> respectfully submitted.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. <span style=""> </span>Civilians like petitioner
placed on trial for civil offenses under general law are entitled to trial by
judicial process, not by executive or military process.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judicial power is vested by the Constitution exclusively in the
Supreme Court and in such inferior courts as are duly established by law.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Judicial power exists only in the courts, which have "exclusive power to
hear and determine those matters which affect the life or liberty or property
of a citizen."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Military commission tribunals are admittedly not courts and do
not form part of the judicial system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
further admitted by the Solicitor General in his answer,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
"military commissions are authorized to exercise jurisdiction over <i>two
classes</i> <i>of</i> offenses, whether committed by <i>civilians</i> or by <i>military</i>
personnel either (a) in the <i>enemy's country during its occupation</i> by an
army and while it remains under <i>military government</i> or (b) in the
locality, not within the enemy's country, in which <i>martial law</i> has been
established by competent authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
classes of offenses are (a) <i>violation</i> of the <i>laws</i> and <i>customs
of war</i> and (b) <i>civil crimes</i>, which <i>because</i> the <i>civil
courts</i> are <i>closed</i> or their functions suspended or limited, <i>cannot</i>
be taken cognizance of by the ordinary tribunals."</p>

<p class="BODY">Since we are not enemy-occupied territory nor are we under a
military government and even on the premise that martial law continues in
force, the military tribunals cannot try and exercise jurisdiction over
civilians for civil offenses committed by them which are properly cognizable by
the civil courts that have remained open and have been regularly functioning.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
In the leading case of <i>Duncan vs. <span class="SpellE">Kahanamoku</span></i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
the U.S. Supreme Court held in setting aside the prison sentences imposed on
two civilians by military tribunals that the placing of Hawaii under martial
law (after the Japanese Pearl Harbor attack on December 7, 1941) under the
Hawaiian Organic Act<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
did not include the power on the part of the military governor to supplant
civilian laws by military orders and to supplant civil courts by military
tribunals, where conditions were not such as to prevent the enforcement of the
laws by the courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">The late Justice Frank Murphy in his concurring opinion therein
repudiated the government's appeal to abandon the "open courts" rule
on the alleged ground of its unsuitability to "modern warfare conditions
where all the territories of a warring nation may be in combat zones or
imminently threatened with long range attack even while civil courts are
operating" as seeking "to justify military usurpation of civilian
authority to punish crime without regard to the potency of the Bill of
Rights," and observing that "Constitutional rights are rooted deeper
than the wishes and desires of the military."</p>

<p class="BODY">And in <span class="SpellE"><i>Toth</i></span><i> vs. Quarles</i><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
the U.S. Supreme Court further stressed that "the assertion of military
authority over civilians cannot rest on the President's power as
Commander-in-Chief or on any theory of martial law."</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the President has filled up vacancies in the judiciary and
"allayed effectively the fears expressed during the initial days of
martial law that the rule of the military would prevail because other countries
under martial law had dispensed with civilian courts of justice" and
stressed the supremacy of the Constitution at the 38th anniversary rites of the
AFP when he told the Armed' Forces that "The military is the force that
enforces the law, but the civil government is the ruling power in our
country," and that "we have stuck to the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have pledged loyalty to that
Constitution."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2. <span style=""> </span>Even assuming that
military tribunals could validly exercise jurisdiction over offenses allegedly
committed by civilians notwithstanding the absence of a state of war or
belligerency and the unimpaired functioning of the regular courts of justice,
such jurisdiction could not encompass civil offenses (defined by the general
civil law as per the Revised Penal Code and Republic Act 1700 known as the
Anti-Subversion Act) alleged to have been committed by civilians like
petitioner in 1965, 1967, 1969, 1970 and 1971, long <i>before</i> the
declaration of martial law as of September 21, 1972.</p>

<p class="BODY">The U.S. Supreme Court aptly pointed out, in <span class="SpellE"><i>Toth</i></span><i>
vs. Quarles, supra</i>, in ruling that discharged army veterans (estimated to
number more than 22.5 million) could not be rendered "helpless before some
latter-day revival of old military charges"<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
and subjected to military trials for offenses committed while they were in the
military service prior to their discharge, that "the presiding officer at
a court martial is not a judge whose objectivity and independence are protected
by tenure and undiminished salary and nurtured by the judicial tradition, but
is a military law officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Substantially
different rules of evidence and procedure apply in military trials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apart from these differences, the suggestion
of the possibility of influence on the actions of the court-martial by the
officer who convenes it, selects its members and the counsel on both sides, and
who usually has direct command authority over its members is a pervasive one in
military law, despite strenuous efforts to eliminate the danger."</p>

<p class="BODY">The late Justice Black speaking for that Court added that
"(A) Court-Martial is not yet an independent instrument of justice but
remains to a significant degree a specialized part of the over-all mechanism by
which military discipline is preserved," and that ex-servicemen should be
given" the benefits of a civilian court trial when they are actually
civilians. . . . Free countries of the world have tried to restrict military
tribunals to the narrowest jurisdiction deemed absolutely essential to maintaining
discipline among troops in active service."</p>

<p class="BODY">More so then should military trials be not sanctioned for civil
offenses allegedly committed by civilians like petitioner long before the
declaration of martial law and for which they could have been charged then as

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General's contention that military tribunals have

in a veiled reference to the subversion" charges against petitioner does
not meet the essential requirement of the existence of overpowering necessity
or emergency to justify the trial of petitioner, a civilian, far the said civil
offenses by respondent military commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the contrary, the President's issuance of Administrative Order
No. 355 on August 28, 1973 for the reinvestigation of the charges against
petitioner by a non-military special committee establishes <i>per se</i> that
no serious grounds of overpowering necessity or considerations of national
security or emergency stand in the way of recognizing petitioner's right to a
civilian trial should the results of the civilian reinvestigation prove adverse
to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated by the present Judge Advocate General in his treatise
on martial law, "<i>Necessity</i> limits both the <i>extent</i> of powers
that may be exercised under martial law, and the <i>duration</i> of its
exercise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No life may be taken, no
individual arrested or confined, or held for trial no property destroyed, or
appropriated, no rights of the individual may be curtailed or suspended except
where necessity justifies such interference with the person or the
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any action on the part of the
military that is <i>not</i> founded on the reasonable demands of necessity is a
<i>gross</i> <i>usurpation</i> <i>of power</i>, illegal unjustified, and
improper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The broad mantle of martial
law cannot cover acts illegal because not justified by necessity, nor proper
under the circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This principle
is based not only upon the fundamental precepts of <i>constitutionalism</i>,
but rests on sound reason — that where the action of the matter is not
necessary for the public ends of the state they are illegal and the <i>mere

its jurisdiction over such serious cases, among others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court in the exercise of such

qualified majority of ten (10) votes for <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>
of the death penalty (which requirement is of course not found in the
Commander-in-Chiefs review of the decisions of military tribunals).</p>

specifically ordains that<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"No

investigation (with right of counsel and of cross-examination) of the
subversion charges before the proper court of first instance under Republic Act
1700 and of other rights vested in him at the time of the alleged commission of
the offense which were all meant to provide the accused with ample lawful
protection in the enforcement of said Act, such as the basic right to be tried
by judicial process and the right of judicial review by this Court would
further offend the Constitutional injunction against the enactment of <i>ex
post facto</i> laws which would render it easier to convict an accused than
before the enactment of such law.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

by the President and composed of the President's own military subordinates
without tenure and of non-lawyers (except the law member) and of whose decision
the President is the final reviewing authority as Commander-in-Chief of the
Armed Forces deprives him of a basic constitutional right to be heard by a fair
and impartial tribunal, considering that the President has publicly declared
the evidence against petitioner "not only strong (but) overwhelming"
and in petitioner's view thereby prejudged and predetermined his guilt merits
consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">In petitioner's view, he has been publicly indicted and his guilt
prejudged by the President when in a nationwide press conference on August 24,
1971 following the Plaza Miranda bombing three days earlier of the Liberal
Party proclamation meeting, the President charged him and disclosed evidence in
the possession of the government linking petitioner to some illegal and
subversive activities, in 1965-1971, which are virtually the same charges now
filed against him before respondent military commission, and declared the
evidence against petitioner "not only strong (but) overwhelming." The
President explained on the same occasion that in not acting against petitioner,
he had "erred on the side of generosity as well as of liberality hoping
that good sense may someday catch up with him" since petitioner was
"the only opposition senator left in the Senate" alter the bombing,
but that he did not know "what will happen later on, because, of course,
the military insist that we must not make any exceptions to the general
rule."<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While one may agree that the President as Commander-in-Chief
would discharge his duty as the final reviewing authority with fealty to his
oath "to do justice to every man", particularly because of his renowned
legal sagacity and experience, still under the environmental facts where the
military appears to have been impressed by the President's appraisal of the
evidence and without casting any reflection on the integrity of the members of
respondent military Commission which petitioner himself acknowledges, the
doctrine consistently held by the Court that "elementary due process
requires a hearing before an impartial and disinterested tribunal"<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">This Court in all its jurisprudence on disqualification and

he (the judge) reflect on the probability that a losing party might nurture at
the back of his mind the thought that the judge had <span class="SpellE">unmeritoriously</span>
tilted the scales of justice against him" and applied the yardstick that
when the basis has been laid for "the possibility of a trial being tainted
by partiality, this Court can step in to assure respect for the demands of due
process" which it has extended primarily for the peace of mind and
protection of the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a></p>

as justifying the prosecution and trial of civilians by military commissions is
in error as that case involved the "trial and punishment of war criminals
(which) is an aspect of waging war." Neither is the creation of the
People's Court after the last war to try those charged with treason in point,
for said court as well as similar courts like the Circuit Criminal Courts which
were created by Congress pursuant to its authority under the Constitution and
vested with special jurisdiction over certain crimes, were created as <i>judicial</i>
courts and part of the judicial system whose decisions were and are subject to
review by the appellate courts, unlike military commissions.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. <span class="SpellE">Prescinding</span> from the issue of
respondent military commission's lack of jurisdiction over the charges against
the petitioner, the examination of the prosecution witnesses and the
perpetuation of their testimony should properly be held before the Special
Reinvestigating Committee created under Administrative Order No. 355 for the simple
reason that all proceedings before respondent military commission were deemed
suspended by virtue of the reinvestigation ordered by the President to
determine whether there "really is reasonable ground" to hold
petitioner for trial and the perpetuation of testimony given before the said
Committee is expressly provided for in the Administrative Order.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was precisely "to reassure the (petitioner) that he
continues to enjoy his constitutional right to due process " and "to
insure utmost fairness, impartiality and objectivity" and "to
determine whether really there is reasonable ground to believe that the
offenses charged were in fact committed and the (petitioner) is probably guilty
thereof" that the President created under Adm. Order No. 355 on August 28,1973
a special five-member committee "to conduct the preliminary
investigation" of the charges against petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be seen from the above-stated premises and objectives that
the administrative order was issued by the President pursuant to his "orientation
towards the protection of the Bill of Rights (and) the judicial process."
As the President himself declared in the same nationwide press conference of <st1:date year="1971" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1971</st1:date>:</p>

<blockquote>"I am a lawyer, my training is oriented towards the protection
of the Bill of Rights, because if you will remember, I have repeatedly said,

would not be President of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.

<p class="BODY">In petitioner's urgent motion of March 24, 1975 for a restraining
order against the holding of perpetuation of testimony proceedings before
respondent military commission, he precisely complained that such proceedings
would preempt and render moot the prejudicial question raised by him in the
case at bar challenging the commission's jurisdiction to take cognizance of the
charges against him and would "short-circuit" the reinvestigation
ordered by the President under Adm. Order No. 355 "even before the said committee
has performed its duty to determine whether or not petitioner should be held
for trial" and notwithstanding that "there is no indication coming
from the President of the Philippines that it has outlived its usefulness — <span class="SpellE"><i>functus</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">oficio</span></i> — or
that it is not fit to administer justice to the petitioner."<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While petitioner insisted on his right to a preliminary
investigation of the subversion charges by the court of first instance as
prescribed by Republic Act 1700, he nevertheless propounded in his March 21,
1975 memorandum that retired Justice J. B. L. Reyes' having declined to act as
chairman of the committee and to designate a representative of the Integrated
Bar did not mean that the committee "cannot be made to function (since) in
the absence of judicial writ or process, there is nothing to prevent the
designation of another retired justice of the Supreme Court as chairman, and
nothing to prevent the incoming president of the Integrated Bar to designate a
representative to the committee."<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
As to petitioner's having declined to designate his representative, it has
already been pointed out, <i>supra</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
that the said order expressly provides that in such event "the Chief
Justice shall designate someone in his stead."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is evident then that under the said order, the Chief Justice
was called upon to fill at least the two vacancies by making the substitute
designations as therein provided, which would have enabled the committee to
discharge its function with a composition of four members (while awaiting the designation
of the fifth member by the IBP president) but that he refrained from doing so
as the matter was <i>sub <span class="SpellE">judice</span></i> because of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the supplemental petition at bar questioning
the validity of the order on the ground that it deprived petitioner of his
right to investigation by the court of first instance on the principal charges
of subversion.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the Court's dismissal of the petitions (and petitioner's
withdrawal thereof) nothing stands in the way now of activating the said
Special Reinvestigating Committee and its discharging its assigned task of
"conducting the preliminary investigation" and determining whether
petitioner should be held for trial in implementation of the order's express
objectives of reassuring petitioner of "his constitutional right to due
process" and "insuring utmost fairness, impartiality and objectivity
in the prosecution of the charges against (petitioner)."</p>

<p class="BODY">Such preliminary investigation by the Special Reinvestigating
Committee with its diverse membership and emphasis that those designated must
meet the qualifications of being "learned in the law, reputed for probity,
integrity, impartiality, incorruptibility and fairness and must have had no
previous connection in this matter either as counsel or investigator" is
certainly far more desirable than the present situation where such grave
charges were summarily filed with the military commission against petitioner
without his having been previously informed of the charges against him nor
given the benefit of any preliminary investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Going by the very standards of "utmost fairness,
impartiality and objectivity" set by the President in the Administrative
Order, and <span class="SpellE">prescinding</span> from the unsettled question of
whether petitioner would have through counsel the right of cross-examination of
the witnesses presented against him, it will be readily appreciated that in
such preliminary investigation by a non-military special committee wholly
composed of civilians, petitioner may then fairly and properly be represented
by experienced counsel who can competently handle his defense and at least
present timely objections to the admission of incompetent or inadmissible
evidence, not to mention that the five men "learned in the law"
composing the committee would most likely <span class="SpellE"><i>motu</i></span><i>
<span class="SpellE">proprio</span></i> rule out any such inadmissible
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would be in contrast to
the perpetuation proceedings in the military tribunal where petitioner has
discharged all his counsels, civilian and military, because of the lack of
jurisdiction, in his view, (as well as per this opinion) of the military
commission over civilians like him for alleged pre-martial law civil offenses
and the nullity of the proceedings therein, and thus has been deprived,
although by his own act, of indispensable legal representation and assistance
in the proceedings where his very life, liberty and honor are at stake.</p>

<p class="BODY">The objective of the perpetuation proceedings may properly be
achieved by the Special Reinvestigating Committee before whom the testimonial
evidence sought to be perpetuated should be presented in the discharge of its
assigned task to conduct a preliminary investigation to determine whether or
not the charges against petitioner should stand and petitioner made to face
trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Holding the perpetuation
proceedings before the committee would dispose of the legal requirements under
P.D. No. 328 itself that the proceedings be had before a military tribunal with
jurisdiction and "before which a case is pending." Even though
technically, as contended by respondents, the cases are still pending with the
military tribunal, it seems obvious from the very terms of Administrative Order
No. 355 that the charges are in fact deemed withdrawn from the military
tribunal and the latter cannot hold any proceedings for as long as the
committee has not completed its preliminary investigation and determined
thereafter the existence of a <i>prima</i> <i>facie</i> case sufficient to let
the charges remain and to require petitioner to face trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Administrative Order thus expressly
provides for the perpetuation of "any testimonial evidence presented
before the Committee" and for its use in any proceeding" before any
court or tribunal, <i>civil</i> or <i>military</i>, without need of presenting
the witness-or-witnesses who testified in case such witness or witnesses have <i>died</i>
or <i>left the country </i>or<i> become unable to</i> <i>testify</i>."<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">38-a</span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming nevertheless
that the perpetuation of testimony proceedings could be properly conducted
before respondent military commission, petitioner's physical presence at the
proceedings could not be compelled by virtue of his express waiver thereof as
explicitly allowed by the Constitution and by P.D. No. 328 itself.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1975</st1:date>,
respondent military commission had recognized petitioner's right to waive his
presence at the proceedings and granted his request to be returned to his
detention quarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But on April 4,
1975, it reversed itself at the military prosecutor's instance and ruled
instead that petitioner's presence at every stage of the proceeding is indispensable
on the ground, as stated by the Solicitor General, that "the charges
against petitioner involve capital offenses and petitioner is in custody and
petitioner had claimed in this case that proceedings for the perpetuation of
testimony were actually a part of trial"<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's submittal that he cannot be compelled to be present
at the proceedings even against his will by virtue of his express waiver is
meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereas previously such
right of waiver of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> presence in criminal
proceedings was generally recognized<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a>

(leading to the suspension of trial whenever the accused was at large) or where
the accused was in custody although for a non-capital offense, the 1973
Constitution now unqualifiedly permits trial <i>in absentia</i> even of capital
cases, and provides that "after arraignment, trial may proceed
notwithstanding the absence of the accused provided that he has been duly
notified and his failure to appear is unjustified,"<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a>
thus recognizing the right of an accused to waive his presence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P.D. No. 328 under which the perpetuation
proceedings are being conducted in military commissions (as the counterpart
rule for similar proceedings before the regular civil courts, as provided in
Rule 119, section 7 of the Rules of Court) explicitly provides that after reasonable
notice to an accused to attend the perpetuation proceedings, the deposition by
question and answer of the witness may proceed in the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
absence and "the failure or refusal to attend the examination or the
taking of the deposition shall be considered a waiver."<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, an <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> right of total waiver of his
presence either expressly or impliedly by unjustified failure or refusal to
attend the proceedings is now explicitly recognized and he cannot be compelled
to be present as against his express waiver.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even as among the members of the Court who voted as per the April
25, 1975 resolution in favor of qualified waiver, i.e. that the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> presence could be required in the instances where
his presence is needed for his identification by the prosecution witness, the
view was expressed that such presence could be dispensed with if his waiver
expressly included an admission of his identification by name by the
witnesses-deponents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should he noted
that such an additional requirement would be superfluous because of the total
waiver as well as because of the disputable presumption<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a>

aside from the many prominent public positions occupied by petitioner through
which his identification is made by the prosecution witnesses as noted from
their affidavits as submitted by the Solicitor-General.</p>

<p class="NUM">7. Petitioner's objection to the perpetuation proceedings,
particularly if they were to be considered part of the trial, since the very
question at issue in the case at bar on military commissions' lack of
jurisdiction over pre-martial law civil offenses allegedly committed by
civilians like petitioner would be preempted and rendered moot by the
proceedings should have been given due consideration by said commission,
instead of being used by it to require his presence against his will.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that the Solicitor General's second ground for
justifying respondent commission's reversal order requiring petitioner's
presence was that "petitioner had claimed in this case that proceedings
for the perpetuation of testimony were actually a part of trial", without
however stating respondent's own stand. </p>

<p class="BODY">The prevailing doctrine, as enunciated by the Court in <i>People
vs. <span class="SpellE">Elago</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a>
appears quite clear that "It is <i>not</i> <i>a</i> <i>trial</i> where the
defendant has to introduce his evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is only taking down the statements of the witnesses for the
prosecution with opportunity on the part of the defendant to cross-examine
them."<a style="" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a>
The Court, citing Rule 111 (e) of the 1940 Rules of Court (now reproduced in
Rule 115 (f) of the Revised Rules of Court)<a style="" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></span></span></a>
and the great weight of judicial authorities against the admission of a
deposition or previous testimony of a witness who is present in court or is
available at the actual trial set aside the appellate court's decision
affirming conviction therein and ruled that the trial court and the appellate
court "committed reversible error" in admitting the perpetuated
testimonies or depositions of the two American prosecution witnesses when they
were actually present in court at the time of trial.</p>

<blockquote>The Court thus held that:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is clear from the rule ... that the testimony or
deposition of a witness may be read or submitted in evidence <i>only</i> when
the deponent is <i>dead</i> or <i>incapacitated</i> to testify or <i>cannot be
found</i> in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he was <i>present</i> in court, there is <i>no
need</i> for introducing his deposition in evidence because <i>his testimony</i>
is the <i>best evidence</i>, especially in a case like the present where the
deponent in giving his deposition had <i>not been</i> <i>cross-examined</i> by
the defendant, although of course, said failure to cross examine may not be
laid at the door of the prosecution."<a style="" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The most that can be said then is that the perpetuation
proceedings may be <i>conditionally</i> considered part of the trial <i>only</i>
when the deponent witness— is at the time of trial dead or incapacitated to
testify or cannot with due diligence be found in the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Absent any of these conditions, it is <i>not</i>
a part of the trial and the witness(<span class="SpellE">es</span>) must give
their testimony <i>anew</i> (not their previous or perpetuated<span style="">&nbsp; </span>deposition) as the best evidence subject to
the crucible of cross-examination.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, petitioner had cause to complain against the military
prosecutor's ambivalent posture that "In the first day he argued we must
proceed (notwithstanding the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> before this
Court of the petition questioning the commission's lack of jurisdiction)
because this is not part of the trial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now, the ruling adversely was handed down (allowing petitioner's waiver
of his presence), but this is a part of trial, he says."<a style="" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">8. Withal, these questions presented serious, if not difficult,
questions of law, and particularly, the petitioner's right to totally waive his
presence at the proceedings presented an important new question that required
an authoritative ruling from this Court because of the new provisions of the
1973 Constitution involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">The granting of petitioner's urgent pleas on April 4, 1975 to be
given a period of at most seven days to file a written motion for
reconsideration of the commission's reversal order of the same date requiring
his presence at every stage of the proceedings (estimated to last from two to
three months, according to the military prosecutor<a style="" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></span></span></a>
and to seek relief from this Court, instead of yielding to the stubborn
insistence of the military prosecutor that the perpetuation be "done
immediately" on the gratuitous s assertion that "precisely because if
the ground is delay, the<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>witnesses
whose testimonies are sought to be presented would have been long dead if
perpetuation is held up"<a style="" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></span></span></a>
and summarily denying petitioner's "repeated appeals... as fast as they
were presented" as graphically reported by the press<a style="" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></span></span></a>
would have averted triggering off the hunger strike commenced on the same date
by petitioner who felt that he was unjustly denied his right of waiver and the
"last basic right of a human being . . . to be left alone."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Such an urgent serious
plea to be given a reasonable time and opportunity to seek recourse from this
Court would have been readily acceded to by a regular court in line with
established judicial usage and procedure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Solicitor General's reply of April 11, 1975 after this Court's
issuance of the restraining order of April 8, 1975 suspending further
proceedings by the commission — in contrast to the military prosecutor's
unyielding stand incongruously branding the filing with this Court of the
petition at bar and of the supplemental petitions as "delaying tactics"
and "dilatory moves"<a style="" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></span></span></a>
— expressly "welcome(d) any ruling by this Court whether under
Presidential Decree No. 328 the presence of the accused is necessary or
indispensable." The decision of this Court upholding petitioner's right of
waiver vindicates <span class="SpellE">petitioners's</span> assertion before
respondent military commission of his right "to keep silent . . . to stay
alone. . .not to participate. . ."<a style="" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></span></span></a>
— a right which is his to exercise or not.</p>

<p class="NUM">9. Respondents have utterly failed to show the existence of
"public danger (that) warrants the<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>substitution of executive process for the judicial process" and the
setting aside of the constitutional mandate that lodges judicial power in the
regular courts of law and not in military tribunals and guarantees civilians
the benefits of a civilian court trial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To subject civilians to military trial just like military personnel and
troops and enemy belligerents rather than to civilian trial by the regular
civil courts is to negate the cardinal principle and state policy of supremacy at

<p class="BODY">In seeking to justify the substitution of the executive or
military process by military commissions for the judicial process of
preliminary investigation and trial by the regular civil courts with right of
appeal to the Supreme Court invoked by petitioner as his constitutional right,
the Solicitor General in his memorandum has made a number of bare assertions
without even any factual averments or allegations in support thereof, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Indeed, civil courts may be open and undisturbed in the
execution of their functions and yet may be wholly incompetent to avert a
threatened danger, or to punish, with adequate promptitude and certainty, the
guilty conspirators. In times of rebellion it may often happen that the judges
are in active sympathy with the rebels, and courts their most efficient
allies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span>
Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 18 L. Ed. 281, 299 [Chase, C.J., concurring.])</blockquote>

<blockquote>There may be other reasons justifying the creation of military
tribunals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judges may be unwilling to
try the rebels out of fear or other motives."</blockquote>

<blockquote>* * *<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* * *<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In our case, study shows that Communist subversion and
propaganda aim at the <span class="SpellE">paralyzation</span> of the will and
the terrorism of the population and the government functionary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In many parts of the country the rebels
succeeded in intimidating and silencing not only the offended parties and their
witnesses but even the judges."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Still another reason for trial by military tribunals is the
possibility that the accused may <span class="SpellE">explocit</span> procedural
advantages available in the civil courts and render military operations against
the rebellion difficult." (Citing a West Virginia case (1912) where the
court therein reasoned that "Participants (in an insurrection) arrested
and committed to the <i>civil authorities</i>, could easily find means of
delaying trial, and <i>liberated</i> <i>on bail</i> return to the
insurrectionary camp and continue to render aid . . . (and) the civil tribunals

<p class="BODY">These reflections on the competence of the civil courts find no
justification in the facts of public notice and knowledge, to wit:</p>

<p class="BODY">A number of judges of courts of first instance have been removed
with the acceptance of their resignations but there is not a single recorded
case where the "judges (were) in active sympathy with the rebels, and
courts their most efficient allies";</p>

<p class="BODY">There is not a single known case since the martial law
proclamation of "judges (being) unwilling to try the rebels out of fear or
other motives" or of the judges, complainants and witnesses having been
intimidated and silenced by rebels;</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither is there a single known instance of an accused rebel
having "exploited procedural advantages available in the civil courts and
rendering military operations against the rebellion difficult", since
those suspected of participation or conspiracy in the communist rebellion have
been arrested without right to bail;</p>

<p class="BODY">General Order No. 49 issued by the President on October 4, 1974
restored to the civil courts a large number of criminal cases that were
transferred to military tribunals upon the proclamation of martial law on the
express premises that "positive steps have been taken to revitalize the
administration of justice and the new Constitution authorizes the
reorganization of the courts" and "although there still exist areas
of active rebellion in the country, on the whole there has been such an
improvement in the general conditions obtaining in the country and in the
administration of justice as to warrant the return of some of the criminal
cases to the jurisdiction of civil courts"; and</p>

<p class="BODY">These premises of G.O. No. 49 are borne out by the data and
published reports.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The twenty (20) military
commissions (14 ambulatory and 6 regional commissions)<a style="" href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></span></span></a>
hearing cases from time to time in marathon hearings as the pressures of the
military service allow the military commissions to convene could not
conceivably match the work and cases disposition of around three hundred and
twenty (320) courts of first instance and circuit criminal courts all over the
country working — continuously and regularly throughout the year.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument of procedural delays in the civil courts and need of
prompt and certain punishment has been long cut down by the late Justice Frank
Murphy in his concurring opinion in Duncan<a style="" href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></span></span></a>
when he stressed that "civil liberties and military expediency are often
irreconcilable" and that "the swift trial and punishment which the
military desires is precisely what the Bill of Rights outlaws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would be false to our trust if we allowed
the time it takes to give effect to constitutional rights to be used as the
very reason for taking away those constitutional rights," as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Delays in the civil courts and slowness in their procedure
are also cited as an excuse for shearing away their criminal jurisdiction,
although lack of knowledge of any undue delays in the Hawaiian courts is
admitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is said that the military
'cannot brook a delay and that 'the punishment must be swift; there is an
element of time in it, and we cannot afford to let the trial linger and
protracted.' This military attitude toward constitutional processes is not
novel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Civil liberties and military
expediency are often irreconcilable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
does take time to secure a grand jury indictment, to allow the accused to
procure and confer with counsel, to permit the preparation of a defense, to
form a petit jury, to respect the elementary rules of procedure and evidence
and to judge guilt or innocence according to accepted rules of law. But
experience has demonstrated that such time is well spent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the only method we have of insuring the
protection of constitutional rights and of guarding against oppression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The swift trial and punishment which the
military desires is precisely what the Bill of Rights outlaws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would be false to our trust if we allowed
the time it takes to give effect to constitutional rights to be used as the very
reason for talking away those rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is our duty, as well as that of the military, to make sure that such rights are
respected whenever possible, even though time may be consumed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As already indicated above, it should be noted that no actual
case of undue delays in the prosecution of criminal cases in the regular civil
courts has been claimed by respondents, nor has it been shown that military
necessity or public danger require that petitioner be deprived of his rights to
due process and to the cold neutrality of an impartial tribunal under the
judicial process, should the reinvestigation ordered by the President bind him
over for trial.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">10. The
Solicitor-General's submittal that "the decrees and orders relating to
military commissions are now part of the law of the land and are beyond question"
and that "as the trial and punishment of civilians by military tribunals
under the circumstances . . . are valid and constitutional, objections based on
differences between civil and military courts are immaterial" is
constitutionally infirm and untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor-General's premise is that "with the
ratification of the new Constitution martial law as proclaimed by the President
became part of the law of the land and now derives its validity from the new
Constitution"<a style="" href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></span></span></a>
and that by virtue of section 3 (2) of the transitory Provisions<a style="" href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></span></span></a>
the decrees and orders on the military commissions are now also part of the law
of the land and beyond question states a rather prolix and sweeping concept
that cannot be precipitately sanctioned. </p>

<p class="BODY">Martial law has not become part of the law of the land and beyond
question by virtue of the coming into force of the 1973 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the said Constitution has precisely
reproduced the 1935 Constitution's commander-in-chief clause with power to
declare martial law limited to exactly the same causes of invasion,
insurrection or rebellion or imminent danger and with exactly the same
requirement that the public safety require it.<a style="" href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></span></span></a>
Going by the doctrine enunciated in <span class="SpellE"><i>Lansang</i></span><i>
vs. Garcia</i><a style="" href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></span></span></a>
by a unanimous Court, the existence of factual bases for the proclamation and
continuation of martial law may under the said provision be judicially inquired
into in order to determine the constitutional sufficiency thereof as well as to
circumscribe the constraints thereof, in particular cases where they clash with
an individual's constitutional rights, within the bounds of necessity for the
public ends and the public safety, as indeed this Court did pass on such
questions in the Habeas Corpus cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></span></span></a>
And as the President expressly stated at his world-wide satellite press
conference of September 30, 1974, the duration of martial law is "only as
long as necessary" as per the following pertinent excerpt of his statement
thereon:</p>

<blockquote>"Of course the problem here is, if you say that martial law
leads to democracy, how long are you going to maintain martial law? I say again
that only as long as necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the
constitutionalists put it, necessity gave life to martial law and martial law
cannot continue unless necessity allows it to live."<a style="" href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The cited Transitory Provision, known as the validating provision
puts the imprimatur of a law upon the President's acts and decrees under
martial law which were not within or beyond his allocated constitutional
powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As aptly stated by Justice Munoz
Palma in her separate opinion in the Habeas Corpus cases, the people could not
by the 1973 Constitution have thrown away "all their precious liberties,
the sacred institutions enshrined in their Constitution, for that would be the
result if we say that the people have stamped their approval on all the acts of
the President executed after the proclamation of martial law irrespective of
any taint of injustice, arbitrariness, oppression, or culpable violation of the
Constitution that may characterize such acts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Surely, the people acting through their constitutional delegates could
not have written a fundamental law which guarantees their rights to life,
liberty and property, and at the same time in the same instrument provide for a
weapon that could spell death to these rights."</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention that the decrees and orders on military
commissions as "part of the law of the land are beyond question"
really begs the question, for as was stressed by Justice Munoz Palma, it would
be "incongruous" that while the acts of the regular National Assembly
as the "permanent repository of the legislative power" are subject to
judicial review, "the acts of its temporary substitute, that is, the
incumbent President" such as the decrees and orders in question would be
claimed to be "beyond question."</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the majority resolution recognizes that "Of course,
from the fact that the President has this range of discretion, it does not
necessarily follow that every action he may take, no matter how unjustified by
the exigency, would bear the imprimatur of validity."</p>

<p class="BODY">While the decrees and orders on military tribunals were made part
of the law of the land by the cited Transitory Provision (assuming that they
had been properly submitted for the purpose) still this general and transitory provision
can in no way supersede or nullify the specific allocation of jurisdiction and
judicial power of the Supreme Court and the regular courts of justice as
established by law under Article X section 1 of the Constitution nor their
proper exercise of jurisdiction to the exclusion of non-judicial agencies,
under section 8 of Article XVII which provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 8. All courts <i>existing</i> at the time of the
ratification of this Constitution shall continue and exercise their <i>jurisdiction</i>,
<i>until</i> <i>otherwise</i> <i>provided by law in accordance with this
Constitution,</i> and all cases pending in said courts shall be heard, tried,
and determined <i>under the laws then in force</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The provisions of the existing Rules of Court
not inconsistent with this Constitution shall <i>remain operative</i> unless
amended, modified, or repealed by the Supreme Court or the National
Assembly." (Art. XVII)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Insofar as the questioned decrees and orders encroached upon the
jurisdiction of the regular courts over the trial of civilians, they must be
deemed abrogated by the cited provisions of the Constitution itself, in
accordance with the established rule that statutes as well as executive orders
and regulations that are inconsistent with and transgress the provisions of a
new Constitution must be deemed repealed thereby.</p>

<p class="BODY">As noted in the writer's previous opinions,<a style="" href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></span></span></a>
the specific legislative powers granted the incumbent President in section 3
(2) of the article on Transitory Provisions are limited to "modifying,
revoking or superseding" the incumbent President's validated acts and
decrees done or issued <i>prior</i> to the proclaimed ratification on January
17, 1973 of the 1973 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
post-ratification legislative powers are therein granted the incumbent
President and such legislative power or more accurately military power under
martial rule that has been exercised by him thereafter (in the absence of a
parliament) must rest on the law of necessity of preservation of the State and
the decreeing of such necessary measures as will safeguard the Republic and
suppress the rebellion (or invasion).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the other hand, Section 7 of the same Article expressly reserves to the
National Assembly the power to amend, modify or repeal "all existing laws
not inconsistent with this Constitution (which) shall remain operative."
Among such existing laws whose "amendment, modification or repeal"
are reserved to the National Assembly are the laws herein involved, <span class="SpellE">viz</span>, the Anti-Subversion Act, Republic Act No. 1700 and the
existing Rules of Court<a style="" href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></span></span></a>
with their safeguards for the rights of an accused defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, any such presidential decrees
and orders cannot prejudice the vested rights of a defendant-accused as to
pre-martial law offenses allegedly committed by him nor be given an adverse <i>ex
post facto</i> effect against him.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">11. Respondent's
assumption of the validity of military trials of civilians and conclusion that
objections based on differences between civil and military courts are
immaterial must necessarily fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been shown that respondents have failed to show the
existence of some overpowering factor that makes a recognition of petitioner's
and other civilians' constitutional rights to due process incompatible with the
public safety as to warrant the temporary casting aside or suspension of such
rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the issuance of
the reinvestigation order under Administrative Order No. 355 for the
non-military Special Reinvestigating Committee created <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>
to conduct a preliminary investigation of the charges against petitioner shows
that no element of public safety is herein involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">The vested rights invoked by petitioner as essential elements of
his basic right to due process, which are not granted him under the decrees and
orders for his trial by respondent military commission, are substantial and
vital, <span class="SpellE">viz</span>, his right to a preliminary investigation
as apparently recognized by Administrative Order No. 355 (as to the
non-subversion charges) with right to counsel and of cross-examination of the
witnesses against him, and the right under the Anti-Subversion Act to a
preliminary investigation by the proper court of first<span style="">&nbsp; </span>instance; his right as a civilian to be tried
by judicial process, by the regular independent civilian courts presided by
permanent judges with tenure and with all the specific safeguards embodied in
the judicial process; and his right to appeal in capital cases to this Court
wherein a qualified majority of ten (10) affirmative votes for <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the death penalty is required.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ordinary layman as well as practitioner are totally
unfamiliar with the summary rules and procedures of military commissions as
compared to the established procedures under the Rules of Court before the
civilian courts, which <i>per se</i> places the civilian on trial before a
military commission in a disadvantageous position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A cursory review of the transcripts furnished
the Court shows these peculiarities that normally would not occur in civilian
trials, as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The swearing-in at the commencement of the perpetuation
proceedings on <st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1975</st1:date>

<p class="BODY">The withdrawal on March 15, 1975 of the charges against <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> Commanders Melody and <span class="SpellE">Pusa</span>
who were originally named as co-accused principals in the four subversion
charges and their utilization as state witnesses, which according to the
commission's law member "automatically takes effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The military commission cannot pass upon such
withdrawal"<a style="" href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></span></span></a>
in contrast to the procedure in the civilian courts where the discharge of
accused persons to be state witnesses must meet certain requirements in the

<p class="BODY">As far as is generally known, the military commission at the

of the members present to arrive at its summary findings of Guilty or Not
Guilty, without entering a written decision which "shall clearly and

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">12. The
transcendental constitutional issues involved in the case at bar which the
majority has resolved to decide on the merits despite petitioner's withdrawal
motion call for adjudication on the basis of enshrined principles of
constitutionalism and the rule of law, as <span class="SpellE">unequivocably</span>
espoused by the President himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case at bar asserts the right of civilians to the judicial
process of civilian trials by the regular civil courts (particularly for
pre-martial law offenses) as against the executive process of trial by military
tribunals and hinges on this Court's upholding the principle that the
individual in the absence of overpowering necessity or public danger, must be
accorded his constitutional rights as guaranteed by the Bill of Rights even a state
of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A corollary principle
would be that the continuation of martial law for institutionalization of
reforms is not incompatible with recognizing the fundamental liberties granted
in the Bill of Rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Bill of Rights of the Constitution specifies the powers that
have been withheld from the government and are reserved to the people.<a style="" href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup></span></span></a>
But the freedoms guaranteed by it against the overwhelming power of the State
would be meaningless and of no use unless citizens could vindicate and enforce
them against the government officials and agencies by proper procedures in the
courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">As held by the Court in <i>Garcia vs. <span class="SpellE">Macaraig</span></i>
, "In a system like ours, every exercise of governmental competence,
whether coming from the President or from the lowest official, may be
challenged in court in an appropriate legal proceeding."<a style="" href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As was stressed by the late Chief Justice Stone in <st1:city><st1:place><i>Duncan</i></st1:place></st1:city><i>,
supra</i>, "executive action is not proof of its own necessity, and the
military's judgment here is not conclusive that every action taken pursuant to
the declaration of martial law was justified by the exigency. In the
substitution of martial law controls for the ordinary civil processes, what are
the allowable limits of military discretion, and whether or not they have been
overstepped in a particular case, are judicial questions.' <st1:city><st1:place>Sterling</st1:place></st1:city>
<i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Constantin</span>, supra (287 <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>
401, 77 L ed 387, 53 S Ct 190)."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court's judgment at bar is therefore of the utmost importance
since under Article 8, Civil Code, "Judicial decisions applying or
interpreting the laws or the Constitution shall form a part of the legal system
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>."
As defined by <span class="SpellE">Konvitz</span>, "the Constitution and the
laws enacted by the legislatures and the judgments and orders of the courts
constitute the Rule of Law."</p>

<p class="BODY">The President has often declared that "The New Society looks
to individual rights as a matter of paramount concern, removed from the
vicissitudes of political controversy and beyond the reach of majorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are pledged to uphold the Bill of Rights and
as the exigencies may so allow, we are determined that each provision shall be
executed to the fullest, . . .".<a style="" href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While stressing that "martial law . . . is a temporary
constitutional expedient of safeguarding the Republic"<a style="" href="#_ftn77" name="_ftnref77" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup></span></span></a>
and "a temporary phase in the development of our country"<a style="" href="#_ftn78" name="_ftnref78" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup></span></span></a>,
the President has thus called for the Constitution to "remain firm and
stable, "has rejected the "exercise (of) power that can be identified
merely with a revolutionary government" that makes its own law<a style="" href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></span></span></a> and

the Constitution", as follows:</p>

<blockquote>". . . Whoever he may be and whatever position he may happen
to have, whether, in government or outside government, it is absolutely
necessary now that we look solemnly and perceptively into the Constitution and
try to discover for ourselves what our role is in the successful implementation
of that Constitution. With this thought, therefore, we can agree on one thing
and that is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let all of us age, let all
of us then pass away as a pace in the development of our country, but <i>let
the Constitution remain firm and stable</i> and let institutions grow in
strength from day to day, from achievement to achievement, and <i>so long as
that Constitution stands, whoever may the man in power be, whatever may his
purpose be, that Constitution will guide the people and no man, however
powerful he may be, will dare to destroy and wreck the foundation of such a
Constitution</i>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"These are the reasons why I personally, having proclaimed
martial law, having been often induced to exercise power that can be identified
merely with a revolutionary government, have remained <i>steadfast on the rule
of law and the Constitution</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would
recommend that if the President can do this, if the President can restrain the
exercise of his own powers, every citizen for his part should not find it a
burden to participate in this act of self-denial and self-abnegation, as an
earnest to the future of our race and our people. <a style="" href="#_ftn80" name="_ftnref80" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This is but to state that no one should be above or below the law
and to reiterate the classic dictum that "The Constitution . . . is a law
for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield
of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all

Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span> restated for the Court certain
"basic concepts and principles" of constitutionalism, which bear
reproducing as they concern the issues at bar, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a democracy, the preservation and
enhancement of the dignity and worth of the human personality is the central
core as well as the cardinal article of faith of our civilization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inviolable character of a man as an
individual must be ‘protected to the largest possible extent in his thoughts
and in his beliefs as the citadel of his person’.<a style="" href="#_ftn83" name="_ftnref83" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(2) The Bill
of Rights is designed to preserve the ideals of liberty, equality and security
'against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the
erosion of small encroachments, and the scorn and derision of those who have no
patience with general principles.<a style="" href="#_ftn84" name="_ftnref84" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the pithy language of Mr. Justice Robert Jackson, the
purpose of the Bill of Rights is to withdraw 'certain subjects from the
vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of
majorities and officials, and <i>to establish them as legal <span class="SpellE">priciples</span>
to be applied by the courts</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One's
rights to life, liberty and property, to free speech, or free press, freedom of
worship and assembly, and other <i>fundamental rights may not be submitted to a
vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections</i>.<i>'</i><a style="" href="#_ftn85" name="_ftnref85" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Laski</span> proclaimed that 'the happiness of the individual, not

power, set the limits to the authority it was entitled to exercise.<a style="" href="#_ftn86" name="_ftnref86" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

* *</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mr. Justice Douglas articulated this pointed reminder:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'The challenge to our liberties comes frequently not from those who
consciously seek to destroy our system of government, but from men of goodwill
— good men who allow their proper concerns to blind them to the fact that what
they propose to accomplish involves an impairment of liberty.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>. . The motives of these men
are often commendable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What we must
remember, however, is that <i>preservation</i> <i>of</i> <i>liberties</i> <i>does</i>
<i>not</i> <i>depend</i> <i>on</i> <i>motives</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>A suppression of liberty has the same
effect whether the suppressor be a reformer or an outlaw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only protection against misguided zeal is
constant alertness of the infractions of the guarantees of liberty</i>
contained in our Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Each</i>
<i>surrender of liberty to the demands of the moment makes easier </i>another,
larger surrender. The <i>battle over the Bill of Rights is a never ending one</i>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>'. . .The liberties of
any person are the liberties of all of us.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>'</i>. . . In short <i>the
liberties of none are safe unless the liberties of all are protected</i>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>'</i>. . .<i>But even if we should
sense no danger to our own liberties, even if we feel secure because we belong
to a group that is important and respected, we must recognize that our Bill of
Rights is a code of fair play for the less fortunate that we in all honor and
good conscience must observe.' "</i><a style="" href="#_ftn87" name="_ftnref87" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">If as stressed above uniformly by the President and the cited
legal authorities, <i>supra</i>, the freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights
are "removed from the vicissitudes of political controversy (and) beyond
the reach of majorities and officials" and are established "as legal
principles to be applied by the courts" and "may not be submitted to
a vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections," then it is
respectfully submitted that the principles of fundamental public policy enshrined
in the Bill of Rights that guarantee to every individual due process and fair
play, regardless of who he is and of whoever may be in power, call for the
granting of the petition and at the least for the reinvestigation of the
charges against petitioner with "utmost fairness, impartiality and
objectivity" as directed in Administrative Order No. 355 itself.</p>

The pertinent text as reported in Manila Times <st1:date year="1971" day="30" month="8">Aug. 30, 1971</st1:date>, Annex A, petition, reads:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: -0.25in;">Q: — In the light of all this,
Mr. Presidents do you contemplate any particular action on Mr. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> and some other officials, which you have also
mentioned?</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: -0.25in;">The President: — Well, I have
been asked the question, then why did you not order the arrest of Senator <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>? And my answer was he has always claimed that he is
one of the leaders of the Opposition, and I have erred on the side of
generosity as well as of liberality, hoping that good sense may someday <span class="SpellE">catcb</span> up with him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is why I have not acted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
do not know what will happen later on, because, of courses the military insist
that we must not make any exceptions to the general rule.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: -0.25in;">Q: — Mr. President, is the
evidence against the senator strong enough to - for conviction?</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: -0.25in;">The President: — I believe so, I
have not included some of the evidence, but even with what we have, and the
testimonies of some of those whom I have presented to you, as well as those who
are in the custody of the government, I believe that the evidence is not only
strong; it is overwhelming.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: -0.25in;">Q: — Then Mr. President, if this
is the case under your suspension of the writ of Habeas corpus, are you
empowered to call the Armed Forces to arrest the senator?</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: -0.25in;">The President — Yes, I am — that
I am empowered, yes, even before the suspension of the privilege of the writ of
habeas corpus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But now he is the I only
senator, the opposition senator left in the Senate."</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-indent: 0in;">In the latest case
of <span class="SpellE"><i>Magtoto</i></span><i> vs. <span class="SpellE">Manguera</span></i>
etc., L--37201-02, March 3, 1975, Mr. Justice Castro in his dissenting opinion
paraphrased Justice Douglas' admonition thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"the rights of none are sale unless the rights of a II are
protected; even if we should sense no danger to our owl rights because we
belong to a group that is informed, important and respected, we must always
recognize that any code of fair play is also a code for the less fortunate."</p>
