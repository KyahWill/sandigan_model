				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> seeks the reconsideration of
the decision rendered on December 17, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The motion for recon­sideration is based on two sets of grounds -- the
first set consisting of four principal grounds, and the second set consisting
of five alternative grounds, as fol­lows:</p>

<blockquote>Principal Grounds:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1. The court erred in overlooking and failing to apply the proper
law ap­plicable to the agency or management contract in question, namely,
Article 1733 of the Old Civil Code (Article 1920 of the new), by virtue of
which said agency was effectively revoked and terminated in 1945 when, as
stated in paragraph 20 of the complaint, "defendant voluntari­ly ...
prevented plaintiff from re­suming management and operation of said mining
properties."</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. The court erred in holding that paragraph II of the management
contract (Exhibit C) suspended the period of said contract.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. The court erred in reversing the ruling of the trial judge,
based on well-settled jurisprudence of this Supreme Court, that the management
agreement was only suspended but not extended on account of the war.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4. The court erred in reversing the finding of the trial judge that
Nielson's action had prescribed, but considering only the first claim and
ignoring the <span class="SpellE">prescriptibility</span> of the other claims.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Alternative Grounds</u>:</blockquote>

<blockquote>5. The court erred in holding that the period of suspension of the
contract on account of the war lasted from February 1942 to June 26, 1948.</blockquote>

<blockquote>6. Assuming <span class="SpellE">arguendo</span> that Nielson is
entitled to any relief, the court erred in awarding as damages (a) 10% of the
cash dividends declared and paid in December, 1941; (b) the management fee of
P2<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> for the Month of January, 1942; and (c) the
full contract price for the extended period of sixty months, since these
damages were neither demanded nor proved and, in any case, not allowable under
the general law of damages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>7. Assuming <span class="SpellE">arguendo</span> that appellant is
entitled to any relief, the court erred in ordering <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
to issue and deliver to appellant shares of stock together with fruits thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>8. The court erred in awarding to appellant an undetermined amount
of shares of stock and/or cash, which award cannot be ascertained and executed
without further litigation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>9. The court erred in rendering judgment for attorney's fees.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We are going to dwell on these grounds in the or­der they are
presented.</p>

<p class="BODY">1. In its first principal ground <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
claims that its own counsel and this Court had overlooked the real nature of
the management contract entered into by and between <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
and Nielson, and the law that is applicable on said contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> now asserts
for the first time -- and this is done in a motion for re­consideration -- that
the management contract in ques­tion is a contract of agency such that it has
the right to revoke and terminate the said contract, as it did terminate the
same, under the law of agency, and par­ticularly pursuant to Article 1733 of
the Old Civil Code (Article 1920 of the New Civil Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">We have taken note that <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> is
advancing a new theory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have
carefully examined the pleadings filed by <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> in
the lower court, its memorandum and its brief on appeal, and never did it
assert the theory that it has the right to terminate the manage­ment contract
because that contract is one of agency which it could terminate at will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that in its ninth and tenth
special affirmative defenses, in its answer in the court below, <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> pleaded that it had the right to terminate the
management contract in question, that plea of its right to terminate was not
based upon the ground that the relation between <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
and Nielson was that of principal and agent but upon the ground that Nielson
had allegedly not complied with certain terms of the management contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> had
thought of considering the management contract as one of agency it could have
amended its answer by stating exact­ly its position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could have asserted its theory of agency
in its memorandum for the lower court and in its brief on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> did
not do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the rule, and the settled
doctrine of this Court, that a par­ty cannot change his theory on appeal --
that is, that a party cannot raise in the appellate court any question of law
or of fact that was not raised in the court below or which was not within the
issue made by the parties in their pleadings (Section 19, Rule 49 of the old
Rules of Court, and also Section 18 of the new Rules of Court; <span class="SpellE">Hautea</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Magallon</span>, L-20345,
November 28, 1964; Northern Motors, Inc. vs. Prince Line, L-13884, Februa­ry
29, 1960; American Express Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>, 46
Phil. 207; <span class="SpellE">Agoncillo</span> vs. Javier, 38 Phil. 424 and
Moli­na vs. Somas, 24 Phil. 49.)</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, even if we allow <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
to assert its new theory at this very late stage of the proceedings, this Court
cannot sustain the same.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> contends that the management
contract in question (Exhibit C) is one of agency because:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) Niel­son was to manage and operate the
mining properties and mill on behalf, and for the account, of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>; and (2) Nielson was authorized to represent <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> in entering, on <span class="SpellE">Lepanto's</span>
behalf, into contracts for the hiring of laborers, purchase of supplies, and
the sale and marketing of the ores mined.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All these, <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> claims, show that Nielson
was, by the terms of the con­tract, destined to execute juridical acts not on
its own behalf but on behalf of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> under the
control of the Board of Directors of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> "at
all times".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> claims that the contract is one of agency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> then
maintains that an agency is revocable at the will of the principal (Article
1733 of the Old Civil Code) regardless of any term or period stipulated in they
contract, and it was in pursuance of that right that <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
terminated the contract in 1945 when it took over and assumed exclusive
management of the work previously entrusted to Nielson under the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> finally
maintains that Nielson as an agent is not entitl­ed to damages since the law
gives to the principal the right to terminate the agency at will.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto's</span> new theory <span class="GramE">We</span> consider it ne­cessary to determine the <u>nature</u> of
the management con­tract -- whether it is a contract of agency or a contract of
lease of services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incidentally, we have
noted that the lower court, in the decision appealed from, consider­ed the
management contract as a contract of lease of services.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 1709 of the old Civil Code, defining contract of agency,
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"By the contract of agency, one person binds himself to render
some service or do something for the account or at the request of
another."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Article 1544, defining contract of lease of service, provides:</p>

<blockquote>"In a lease of work or services, one of the parties binds
himself to make or construct something or to ren­der a service to the other for
a price certain."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In both agency and lease of services one of the parties binds
himself to render some service to the other party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Agency, however, is distinguished from lease
of work or services in that the basis of agency is representation, while in the
lease of work or ser­vices the basis is employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> of
services does not represent his employer, while the agent rep­resents his
principal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Manresa</span></st1:place></st1:city>, in his "<span class="SpellE">Commentarios</span> al <span class="SpellE">Codigo</span> Civil <span class="SpellE">Español</span>" (1931, <span class="SpellE">Tomo</span> IX, p.
372-373), points out that the element of representation disting­uishes agency
from lease of services, as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the interpretation of Article 1709 of the old
Civil Code, Article 1868 of the new Civil Code has defined the contract of
agency in more expli­cit terms, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"By the contract of agency a person binds himself to render
some service or to do something <u>in representation or on behalf of</u>
another, with the consent or authority of the latter."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is another obvious distinction between agency and lease of
services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Agency is a preparatory
contract, as agency "does not stop with the agency because the purpose is
to enter into other contracts." The most characteristic feature of an
agency relationship is the agent's power to bring about business relations
between his principal and third persons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The agent is destined to execute juridical acts (creation,
modification or ex­tinction of relations with third parties).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lease of services <span class="GramE">contemplate</span>
only material (non-juridical) acts." <span class="GramE">(Reyes and <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>, "An Outline of Philippine Civil Law," Vol.
V, p. 277).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the interpretations we have men­tioned in the
foregoing paragraphs, let us now determine the nature of the management
contract in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the
contract, Nielson had agreed, for a period of five years, with the right to
renew for a like period, to ex­plore, develop and operate the mining claims of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>, and to mine, or mine and mill, such pay ore as may
be found therein and to market the metallic products recover­ed <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> which may prove to be marketable, as well as to
render for <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> other services specified in the
contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We gather from the contract
that the work undertaken by Nielson was to take complete charge, sub­ject at
all times to the general control of the Board of Directors of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>, of the exploration and develop­ment of the mining
claims, of the hiring of a sufficient and competent staff and of sufficient and
capable la­borers, of the prospecting and development of the mine, of the
erection and operation of the mill, and of the beneficiation and marketing of
the minerals found on the mining properties; and in carrying out said
obligation Nielson should proceed diligently and in accordance with the best
mining practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In connection with its
work Nielson was to submit reports, maps, plans and recom­mendations with
respect to the operation and development of the mining properties, make
recommendations and plans on the erection or enlargement of any existing mill,
dispatch mining engineers and technicians to the mining properties as from time
to time may reasonably be required to investigate and make recommendations
without cost or expense to <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nielson was also to "act as purchasing
agent of supplies, equipment and other necessary purchases by <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>, provided, however, that no purchase shall be made
without the prior approval of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>; and provided
further, that no commission shall be claimed or retained by Nielson on such
purchase"; and "to submit all requisition for supplies, all contracts
and arrangement with engineers, and staff and all matters requiring the
expenditures of money, present or future, for prior approval by <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>; and also to make contracts subject to the prior
appro­val of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> for the sale and marketing of
the minerals mined from said properties, when said products are in a suitable
condition for marketing."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It thus appears that the principal and paramount undertaking of
Nielson under the management contract was the operation and development of the
mine and the operation of the mill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
the other undertakings men­tioned in the contract are necessary or incidental
to the principal undertaking -- these other undertakings being dependent upon
the work on the development of the mine and the operation of the mill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the performance of this principal
undertaking Nielson was not in any way executing juridical acts for <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>, destined to create, modify or extinguish business
relations between <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> and third persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, in perform­ing its principal
undertaking Nielson was not acting as an agent of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>,
in the sense that the term agent is interpreted under the law of agency, but as
one who was performing material acts for an employer, for <span class="GramE">a
compensation</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the management contract provides that Nielson
would also act as purchasing agent of supplies and enter into contracts
regarding the sale of mineral, but the contract also provides that Nielson
could not make any purchase, or sell the minerals, with­out the prior approval
of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is clear, therefore, that even in these cases Nielson could not exe­cute
juridical acts which would bind <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> without first
securing the approval of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nielson, then, was to act only as an
intermediary, not as an agent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> contends that the management
contract in question being one of agency it had the right to ter­minate the
contract at will pursuant to the provision of Article 1733 of the old Civil
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find, however, a proviso in the
management contract which mili­tates against this stand of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph XI of the contract provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Both parties to this agreement fully recognize that the terms
of this Agreement are made possible only because of the faith or confidence
that the Officials of each company have in the other; therefore, in order to as­sure
that such confidence and faith shall abide and continue, NIELSON ag­rees that
LEPANTO may cancel this Agreement at any time upon ninety (90) days written
notice, in the event that NIELSON for any reason whatsoever, except acts of
God, strike and other causes beyond its control, shall cease to prosecute the
operation and development of the properties herein described, in good faith and
In accordance with approved mining practice."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is thus seen, from the above-quoted provision of paragraph XI
of the management <span class="GramE">contract, that</span> <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
could not terminate the agreement at will.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Lepan­to</span> could terminate or cancel the
agreement by giving notice of termination ninety days in advance only in the
event that Nielson should prosecute in bad faith and not in accordance with
approved mining practice the opera­tion and development of the mining
properties of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> could not
terminate the agreement if Nielson should cease to prosecute the operation and
development of the mining properties by reason of acts of God, strike and other
causes beyond the control of Nielson.</p>

<p class="BODY">The phrase "Both parties to this agreement fully recognize
that the terms of this agreement are made possible only because of the faith
and confidence of the officials of each company have in the other" in
paragraph XI of the management contract does not qualify the relation between <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> and Nielson as that of principal and agent based on
trust and confidence, such that the contractual relation may be terminated by
the principal at any time that the principal loses trust end confidence in the
agent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, that phrase simply
implies the circumstance that brought about the execution of the management
contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the annual report for
1936<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>,

<p class="BODY">We can gather from the foregoing statements in the annual report
for 1936, and from the provision of paragraph XI of the Management contract,
that the employment by <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> of Nielson to operate
and manage its mines was principally in consideration of the know-how and
technical services that Nielson offered <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contract thus entered into pursuant to
the offer made by Nielson and accepted by <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> was
a "detailed operating contract".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was not a contract of agency.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nowhere in the record is it shown that <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
considered Nielson as its agent and that <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
terminated the management contract because it had lost its trust and confidence
in Nielson.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> that it had
terminated the management contract in 1945, following the libera­tion of the mines
from Japanese control, because the relation between it and Nielson was one of
agency and as such it could terminate the agency at will, is, therefore,
untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, it can be
said that, in asserting that it had terminated or cancelled the management
contract in 1945, <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> had thereby violated the
express terms of the management contract.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The management contract was renewed to last until <st1:date year="1947" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1947</st1:date>, so that the contract had yet
almost two years to go -- upon the liberation of the mines in 1945.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing that Nielson had ceased
to prosecute the operation and development of the mines in good faith and in
accordance with approved mining practice which would warrant the termination of
the contract upon ninety days written notice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact there was no such written notice of termination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an admitted fact that Nielson ceased to
operate and developed the mines because of the war -- a cause beyond the
control of Nielson.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, if the management contract in question was intended to
create a relationship of principal and agent between <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
and Nielson, paragraph XI of the contract should not have been inserted
because, as provided in Article 1733 of the old Civil Code, agency is
essentially revocable at the will of the principal -- that means, with or
without cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But precisely said
paragraph XI was inserted in the management contract to provide for the cause
for its revocation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The provision of
paragraph XI must be given effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the construction of an instrument where there are several
provisions or particulars, such a construction is, if possible, to be adopted
as will give effect to all<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>,
and if some stipulation of any contract should admit of several meanings, it
shall be understood as bearing that import which is most ade­quate to render it
effectual.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is <span class="GramE">Our</span> considered view that by
express sti­pulation of the parties, the management contract in question is not
revocable at the will of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We rule that this management contract is not
a con­tract of agency as defined in Article 1709 of the old Civil Code, but a
contract of lease of services as defined in Article 1544 of the same code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contract can not be unilaterally revoked
by <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first ground of the motion for reconsidera­tion should,
therefore, be brushed aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. In the second, third and fifth grounds of its motion for
reconsideration, <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> maintains that this Court
erred, in holding that paragraph II of the management contract suspended the
period of said con­tract, in holding that the agreement was not only suspended
but was extended on account of the war, and in holding that the period of
suspension on account of the war lasted from February, 1942 to June 26,
1948.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are going to discuss these
three grounds together because they are inter-related.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Our decision we have dwelt lengthily on the points that the
management contract was suspended be­cause of the war, and that the period of
the contract was extended for the period equivalent to the time when Nielson
was unable to perform the work of mining and milling because of the adverse
effects of the war on the work of mining and milling.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the contention of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> that
the happen­ing of those events, and the effects of those events, simply
suspended the performance of the obligations by either party in the contract,
but did not suspend the period of the contract, much less extended the period
of the contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have conscientiously considered the arguments of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> in support of these three grounds, but <span class="GramE">We</span> are not persuaded to reconsider the rulings that We made in
Our decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">We want to say a little more on these points, however.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph II of the management contract pro­vides
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In the event of inundation, flooding of the mine, typhoon,
earthquake or any other force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span>, war,
insurrection, civil commotion, organized strike, riot, fire, injury to the
machinery or other event or cause reasonably beyond the control of NIELSON and
which adversely affects the work of mining and milling; NIELSON shall report
such fact to LEPANTO and without liability or breach of the terms of this
Agreement, <u>the same</u> shall remain in suspense, wholly or partially during
the terms of such inability." (Un­derlining supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A reading of the above-quoted paragraph II cannot but convey the
idea that upon the happening of any of the events enumerated therein, which
adversely affects the work of mining and milling, the agreement is deemed
suspended for as long as Nielson is unable to per­form its work of mining and
milling because of the ad­verse effects of the happening of the event on the
work of mining and milling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the
period when the ad­verse effects on the work of mining and milling exist,
neither party in the contract would be held liable for non-compliance of its
obligation under the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, the operation of the contract is suspended for as long as the adverse
effects of the hap­pening of any of those events had impeded or obstruct­ed the
work of mining and milling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An analysis
of the phraseology of the above-quoted paragraph II of the management contract
readily supports the conclusion that it is the agreement, or the contract, that
is suspended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The phrase "the
same" can refer to no other than the term "Agreement" which
immediately precedes it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
"Agreement" may be wholly or partially suspended, and this situation
will depend on whether the event wholly or partially affected adversely the
work of mining and milling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
instant case, the war had adversely affected -- and wholly at that -- the work
of mining and milling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have clearly
stated in <span class="GramE">Our</span> decision the circumstances brought about
by the war which caused the whole or total suspension of the agreement or of
the management contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">LEPANTO itself admits that the management con­tract was
suspended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We quote from the brief of LEPANTO:</p>

<blockquote>"Probably, what Nielson meant was, it was prevented by <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> to assume again the management of the mine in 1945,
at the precise time when defendant was at the feverish phase of rehabilitation
and although the contract had already been sus­pended." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Lepanto's</span> Brief, p. 9).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> it
was impossible, as a result of the destruction of the mine, for the plaintiff
to manage and operate the same and because, as provided <span class="GramE">In</span>
the ag­reement, the contract was suspended by reason of the war." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Lepanto's</span> Brief, pp. 9-10).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Clause II, by its terms, is clear that the contract is <u>suspended</u>
in case fortuitous event or force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span>, such as
war, adversely affects the work of mining and milling." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Lepanto's</span> Brief, p. 49).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> is correct when it said that
the obliga­tions under the contract were suspended upon the hap­pening of any
of the events enumerated in paragraph II of the management contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, those obligations were suspended
because the contract itself was sus­pended.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When we talk of a contract that has been sus­pended we certainly mean
that the contract temporarily ceased to be operative, and the contract becomes
operative again upon the happening of a condition - or when a situation obtains
- which warrants the termina­tion of the suspension of the contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Our decision <span class="GramE">We</span> pointed out that the
agreement in the management contract would be suspended when two conditions
concur, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the happening of the
event constituting a force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span> that was reason­ably
beyond the control of Nielson, and (2) that the event constituting the force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span> adversely af­fected the work of mining and
milling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sus­pension, therefore,
would last not only while the event constituting the force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span>
continued to occur but also for as long as the adverse effects of the force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span> on the work of mining and milling had not been
eliminated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the manage­ment
contract the happening alone of the event constituting the force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span> which did not affect adversely the work of mining
and milling would not suspend the period of the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only when the two conditions concur
that the period of the agreement is suspended.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not denied that because of the war, in February 1942, the
mine, the original mill, the original power plant, the supplies and equipment,
and all installations at the <span class="SpellE">Mankayan</span> mines of <span class="SpellE">Le­panto</span>, were destroyed upon order of the United States
Army, to prevent their utilization by the enemy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not denied that for the duration of the
war Nielson could not undertake the work of mining and milling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the mines were liberated from the enemy
in Aug­ust, 1945, the condition of the mines, the mill, the power plant and
other installations, was not the same as in February 1942 when they were
ordered destroyed by the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>
army.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, upon the liberation of
the mines from the enemy, the work of mining and milling could not be
undertaken by Nielson under the same favorable circumstances that obtained
before Februa­ry 1942.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The work of
mining and milling, as undertaken by Nielson in January, 1942, could not be
resumed by Nielson soon after liberation because of the adverse effects of the
war, and this situation con­tinued until June of 1948.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the suspension of the management
contract did not end upon the libera­tion of the mines in August, 1945.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mines and the mill and the installations,
laid waste by the ravages of war, had to be reconstructed and rehabilitated,
and it can be said that it was only on June 26, 1948 that the adverse effects
of the war on the work of mining and milling had ended, because it was on that
date that the operation of the mines and the mill was resumed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The period of suspension should, therefore,
be reckoned from February 1942 until <st1:date year="1948" day="26" month="6">June
 26, 1948</st1:date>, because it was during this period that the war and the
adverse ef­fects of the war on the work of mining and milling had lasted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mines and the installations had to be
rehabilitated because of the adverse effects of the war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The work of rehabilitation started soon after
the liberation of the mines in August, 1945 and lasted un­til June 26, 1948
when, as stated in <span class="SpellE">Lepanto's</span> annual report to its
stockholders for the year 1948, "June 28, 1948 marked the official return
to operation of this company at its properties at <span class="SpellE">Mankayan</span>,
Mountain province, Philippines" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">F-1).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> would argue that if the
management con­tract was suspended at all the suspension should cease in August
of 1945, contending that the effects of the war should cease upon the
liberation of the mines from the enemy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This contention cannot be sus­tained, because the period of
rehabilitation was still a period when the physical effects of the war -- the
destruction of the mines and of all the mining installa­tions -- adversely
affected, and made impossible, the work of mining and milling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the period of the reconstruction and
rehabilitation of the mines and the installations must be counted as part of
the period of suspension of the contract.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
claims that it would not be unfair to end the period of suspension upon the
liberation of the mines because soon after the liberation of the mines Nielson
insisted to resume the management work, and that Nielson was under obligation
to reconstruct the mill in the same way that it was under obligation to
construct the mill in 1937.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
contention is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that
Nielson insisted to resume its management work after liberation, but this was
only for the purpose of restoring the mines, the mill, and other installations
to their operating and producing condition as of February 1942 when they were
ordered destroyed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not shown by
any evi­dence in the <span class="GramE">record, that</span> Nielson had agreed,
or would have agreed, that the period of suspension of the contract would end
upon the liberation of the mines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is so because, as found by this Court, the in­tention of the parties in the
management contract, and as understood by them, the management contract was
suspended for as long as the adverse effects of the force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span>
on the work of mining and milling had not been removed, and the contract would
be extended for as long as it was suspended.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the management contract Nielson had the obligation to erect and
ope­rate the mill, but not to re-erect or reconstruct the mill in case of its destruction
by force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the considered view of this court that it would not be fair
to Nielson to consider the suspension of the contract as terminated upon the li­beration
of the mines because then Nielson would be placed in a situation whereby it
would have to suffer the adverse effects of the war on the work of mining and
milling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence shows that as of
January 1942 the operation of the mines under the management of Nielson was
already under benefi­cial conditions, so much so that dividends were already
declared by <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> for the years 1939, 1940 and
1941.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To make the management contract
immediately operative after the liberation of the mines from the Japanese, at
the time when the mines and all its installations were laid waste as a result
of the war, would be to place Nielson in a situation whereby it would lose all
the benefits of what it had accomplished in placing the <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
mines in profitable operation before the outbreak of the war in December,
1941.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that Nielson
started its management operation way back in 1936, even before the management
contract was entered into.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As early as
August 1936 Nielson negotiated with Messrs. C. I. <span class="SpellE">Cookes</span>
and V. L. <span class="SpellE">Lednicky</span> for the opera­tion of the <span class="SpellE">Mankayan</span> mines and it was the result of those negotiations
that <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> was incorporated; that it was Nielson
that helped to capitalize <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>, and that after the
formation of the corporation (<span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>) Nielson
immediately assumed the management of the mining properties of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not
until <st1:date year="1937" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1937</st1:date> when
the management contract in ques­tion was entered into between <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> and Nielson (Exhibit A.).</p>

<p class="BODY">A contract for the management and operation of mines calls for a
speculative and risky venture on the part of the manager-operator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The manager-operator invests its technical
know-how, undertakes back­breaking efforts and tremendous spade-work, so to
say, in the first years of its management and operation of the mines, in the
expectation that the investment and the efforts employed might be rewarded
later with success.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This expected
success may never come.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This had
happened in the very case of the <span class="SpellE">Mankayan</span> mines
where, as recounted by Mr. <span class="SpellE">Lednicky</span> of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>, var­ious persons and entities of different
nationalities, including <span class="SpellE">Lednicky</span> <span class="GramE">himself,</span>
invested all their money and failed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
manager-operator may not strike suf­ficient ore in the first, second, third, or
fourth year of the management contract, or he may not strike ore even until the
end of the fifth year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unless the
manager-operator strikes sufficient quantity of ore he cannot expect profits or
reward for his investment and efforts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case of Nielson, its corps of com­petent engineers, geologists,
and technicians begun working on the <span class="SpellE">Mankayan</span> mines
of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> since the lat­ter part of 1936, and
continued their work without success and profit through 1937, 1938, and the
earlier part of 1939.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only in
December of 1939 when the efforts of Nielson started to be rewarded when <span class="SpellE">Le­panto</span> realized profits and the first dividends were
declared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From that time on Nielson
could expect pro­fit to come to it -- as in fact <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
declared di­vidends for 1940 and 1941 -- if the development and operation of
the mines and the mill would continue un­hampered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The operation, and the expected profits,
however, would still be subject to hazards due to the occurrence of fortuitous
events, fires, earthquakes, strikes, war, etc., constituting force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span>, which would result in the destruction of the mines
and the mill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of these diverse
causes, or one after the other, may consume the whole period of the contract,
and if it should happen that way the manager-operator would reap no profit to
compensate for the first years of spade-work and investment of efforts and
know-how.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, in fairness to the
manager-operator, so that he may not be deprived of the benefits of the work he
had accomplish­ed, the force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span> clause is
incorporated as a stand­ard clause in contracts for the management and
operation of mines.</p>

<p class="BODY">The nature of the contract for the management and operation of
mines justifies the interpretation of the force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span>
clause, that a period equal to the period of suspension due to force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span> should be added to the original term of the
contract by way of an extension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We,
therefore, reiterate the ruling in <span class="GramE">Our</span> decision that
the management contract in the instant case was suspended from February, 1942
to <st1:date year="1948" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1948</st1:date>, and that
from the latter date the contract had yet five years to go.</p>

<p class="BODY">3. In the fourth ground of its motion for recon­sideration, <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> maintains that this Court erred in reversing the
finding of the trial court that Nielson's action has prescribed, by considering
only the first claim and ignoring the <span class="SpellE">prescriptibility</span>
of the other claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">This ground of the motion for reconsideration has no merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Our decision <span class="GramE">We</span> stated that the
claims of Nielson are based on a written document, and, as such, the cause of
action prescribes in ten years.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
In­asmuch as there are different claims which accrued on different dates the
prescriptive periods for all the claims are not the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claims of Nielson that have been awarded
by this Court are itemized in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of
the decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <u>first</u> item of the awards in Our decision refers to
Nelson's compensation in the sum of P17<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>, which
is equivalent to 10% of the cash dividends dec­lared by <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
in December, 1941.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="GramE">We</span>
have stated in Our decision, this claim accrued on <st1:date year="1941" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1941</st1:date>, and the right to commence an
action thereon started on <st1:date year="1942" day="1" month="1">January 1,
 1942</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We declared that the
action on this claim did not prescribe although the complaint was filed on <st1:date year="1958" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1958</st1:date> -- or after a lapse
of 16 years, 1 month and 5 days -- because of the operation of the moratorium
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We declared that under the
applicable decisions of this Court<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
the moratorium period of 8 years, 2 months and 8 days should be deducted from
the period that had elapsed since the accrual of the cause of action to the
date of the filing of the complaint, so that there is a period of less than 8
years to be reckon­ed for the purpose of prescription.</p>

<p class="BODY">This claim of Nielson is covered by Executive Order No. 32,
issued on <st1:date year="1945" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1945</st1:date>,
which provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Enforcement of payments of <u>all debts and other monetary
obligations</u> payable in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
except debts and other monetary obligations entered into in any area after
declaration by Presidential Proclamation that such area has been freed from
enemy occupa­tion and control, is temporarily suspended pending action by the Com­monwealth
Government." (41 O.G. 56-57; Underlining supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Executive Order No. 32 covered all debts and mo­netary obligation
contracted before the war (or before December 8, 1941) and those contracted
subsequent to December 8, 1941 and during the Japanese occupation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Re­public Act No. 342, approved on July 26,
1948, lifted the moratorium provided for in Executive Order No. 32 on pre-war
(or pre-December 8, 1941) debts of debtors who had not filed war damage claims
with the United States War Damage Commission.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of
Republic Act No. 342, the debt mora­torium was limited:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) to debts and other monetary obligations
which were contracted after December 8, 1941 and during the Japanese
occupation, and (2) to those pre-war (or pre-December 8, 1941) debts and other
mone­tary obligations where the debtors filed war damage claims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was the situation up to May 18, 1953
when this Court declared Republic Act No. 342 unconstitu­tional.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It has been held by this Court, however, that from March 10, 1945 when
Executive Order No. 32 was issued, to May 18, 1953 when Republic Act No. 342
was declared unconstitutional -- or a period of 8 years, 2 months and 8 days --
the debt moratorium was in force, and had the effect of suspending the period

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> is wrong when in its motion for
reconside­ration it claims that the moratorium provided for in Executive Order
No. 32 was continued by Republic Act No. 342 "only with respect to debtors
of pre-war obliga­tions or those incurred prior to December 8, 1941," and
that "the moratorium was <u>lifted</u> and <u>terminated</u> with respect
to obligations incurred after December 8, 1941."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has held that Republic Act No. 342 does not apply to
debts contracted during the war and did not lift the moratorium in relation
thereto.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case of Abraham, et al. vs. Intestate Estate of Juan C. <span class="SpellE">Ysmael</span>, et al., L-16741, Jan. 31, 1962, this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"Respondents, however, contend that Republic Act No. 342,
which took effect on July 26, 1948, lifted the moratorium on debts contracted
during the Japanese occupation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
court has already held that Republic Act No. 342 did not lift the moratorium on
debts contracted during the war (<span class="SpellE">Uy</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> <span class="SpellE">Katigbak</span>, G.R. No. L-1830,
Dec. 31, 1949) but modified Executive Order No. 32 as to pre-war debts, making
the protection available only to debtors who had war damage claims (<span class="SpellE">Sison</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span>, G.R. No.
L-4711, Oct. 3, 1952)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We therefore reiterate the ruling in <span class="GramE">Our</span>
decision that the claim involved in the first item awarded to Nielson had not
prescribed.</p>

<p class="BODY">What we have stated herein regarding the non-pres­cription of the
cause of action of the claim involved in the first item in the award also holds
true with respect to the <u>second</u> item in the award, which refers to
Nielson's claim for management fee of P2<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> for
January 1942.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
admits that this second item, like the first, is a monetary obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right of action of Nielson regarding this
claim accrued on Jan­uary 31, 1942.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards items 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 in the awards in the decision,
the moratorium law is not applicable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is the reason why in <span class="GramE">Our</span> decision We did
not discuss the question of prescription regarding these items.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claims of Nielson involved in these items
are based on the management contract, and Nielson's cause of action regarding
these claims prescribes in ten years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Corollary to Our ruling that the management contract was suspended from
February, 1942 until June 26, 1948, and that the contract was extended for five
years from June 26, 1948, the right of action of Nielson to claim for what is
due to it during that period of extension accrued during the period from June
26, 1948 till the end of the five-year extension period -- or until June 26,
1953.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so, even if We reckon June 26,
1948 as the starting date of the ten-year period in connection with the <span class="SpellE">prescriptibility</span> of the claims involved in items 3, 4, 5, 6
and 7 of the awards in the decision, it is obvious that when the complaint was
filed on February 6, 1958 the ten-year prescriptive period had not yet lapsed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Our decision <span class="GramE">We</span> have also ruled that
the right of action of Nielson against <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> had
not prescrib­ed because of the arbitration clause in the Management
contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are satisfied that there is
evidence that Nielson had asked for arbitration, and an arbitra­tion committee
had been constituted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The arbitration
committee, however, failed to bring about any settle­ment of the differences
between Nielson and <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On June 25, 1957 counsel for <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> definitely advised Nielson that they were not
entertaining any claim of Nielson.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
complaint in this case was filed on February 6, 1958.</p>

<p class="BODY">4. In the sixth ground of its motion for recon­sideration, <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> maintains that this Court "erred in awarding
as damages (a) 10% of the cash dividends declared and paid in December, 1941;
(b) the management fee of P2<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> for the month of
January 1942; and (c) the full contract price for the extended period of 60
months, since the damages were never demanded nor proved and, in any case, not
allowable under the general law on damages."</p>

<p class="BODY">We have stated in Our decision that the original agreement in the
management contract regarding the com­pensation of Nielson was modified, such
that instead of receiving a monthly compensation of P2,500.00 plus 10% of the
net profits from the operation of the pro­perties for the preceding month,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Nielson would receive a compensation of P2,500.00 a month, plus (1) 10% of the
dividends declared and paid, when and as paid, during the period of the
contract, and at the end of each year, (2) 10% of any depletion reserve that
may be set up, and (3) 10% of any amount expended during the year out of
surplus earnings for capital account.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is shown that in December, 1941, cash dividends amounting to
P175<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> was declared by <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Nielson, therefore, should receive the equivalent of 10% of this amount, or the
sum of P17<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have found that this amount was not paid to Nielson.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its motion for reconsideration, <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
in­serted a photographic copy of page 127 of its cash disbursement book,
allegedly for 1941, in an effort to show that this amount of P17<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> had been paid to Nielson.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears, however, in this photographic
copy of page 127 of the cash disbursement book that the sum of P17<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> was entered on October 29 as "sur­plus a/c
Nielson &amp; Co. Inc." The entry does not make any reference to dividends
or participation of Nielson in the profits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, in the photographic copy of page 89 of the 1941 cash
disbursement book, also attached to the motion for reconsideration, there is an
entry for P17<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> on <st1:date year="1941" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1941</st1:date> which states "Accts. Pay. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Particip</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span>
Nielson &amp; Co. Inc." This entry for <st1:date year="1941" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1941</st1:date> may really be the participation of Nielson
in the profits based on dividends declared in April 1941 as shown in Exhibit
L.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in the same Exhibit L it is not
stated that any dividend was declared in October 1941.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary it is stated in Ex­hibit L
that dividends were declared in December 1941. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>We cannot entertain this piece of evidence for
several reasons:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) because this
evidence was not presented during the trial in the court below; (2) there is no
showing that this piece of evidence is newly discovered and that <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> was not in possession of said evidence when this
case was being tried in the court below; and (3) according to Exhibit L cash
dividends of P175,000.00 were declared in December, 1941, and so the sum of
P17,500.00 which appears to have been paid to Nielson in October 1941 could not
he payment of the equivalent of 10% of the cash dividends that were later
declared in December, 1941.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the management fee of Nielson corres­ponding to
January, 1942, in the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>, We have also
found that Nielson is entitled to be paid this amount, and that this amount was
not paid by <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> to Nielson.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereas, <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
was able to prove that it had paid the management fees of Nielson for November
and December, 1941,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
it was not able to present any evidence to show that the management fee of P2<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> for January, 1942 had been paid.</p>

<p class="BODY">It having been declared in Our decision, as well as in this
resolution, that the management contract had been extended for 5 years, or
sixty months, from June 27, 1948 to June 26, 1953, and that the cause of action
of Nielson to claim for its compensation during that period of extension had
not prescribed, it follows that Nielson should be awarded the manage­ment fees
during the whole period of extension, plus the 10% of the value of the
dividends declared during the said period of extension, the 10% of the
depletion reserve that was set up, and the 10% of any amount expended out of
surplus earnings for capital account.</p>

<p class="BODY">5. In the seventh ground of its motion for recon­sideration, <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> maintains that this Court erred in ordering <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> to issue and deliver to Nielson shares of stock
together with fruits thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Our decision, We declared that pursuant to the modified
agreement regarding the compensation of Niel­son which provides, among others,
that Nielson would receive 10% of any dividends declared and paid, when and as
paid, Nielson should be paid 10% of the stock dividends declared by <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> during the period of ex­tension of the contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not denied that on <st1:date year="1949" day="28" month="11">November
 28, 1949</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> declared stock
dividends worth P1<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span>; and on <st1:date year="1950" day="22" month="8">August 22, 1950</st1:date>, it declared stock
dividends worth P2,000,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, during the period of extension <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> had
declared stock dividends worth P3<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We held in Our decision that Nielson is
entitled to receive 10% of the stock dividends dec­lared, or shares of stocks,
worth P300,000.00 at the par value of P0.10 per share.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We ordered <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
to issue and deliver to Nielson those shares of stocks as well as all the
fruits or dividends that accrued to said shares.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its motion for reconsideration, <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
con­tends that the payment to Nielson of stock dividends as compensation for
its services under the management contract is a violation of the Corporation
Law, and that it was not, and it could not be, the intention of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> and Nielson -- as contracting parties -- that the
services of Nielson should be paid in shares of stock taken out of stock
dividends declared by <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have assiduously considered the arguments
adduced by <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> in support of its contention, as
well as the answer of Nielson in this connection, and <span class="GramE">We</span>
have ar­rived at the conclusion that there is merit in the con­tention of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 16 of the Corporation Law, in part, pro­vides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"No corporation organized under this Act shall create or issue
bills, notes or other evidence of debt, for circulation as money, and no
corporation shall issue stock or bonds except in exchange for actual cash paid
to the corporation or for:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) property

That no stock or bond dividend shall be issued without the approval of

Act No. 3518; Underlining supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the above-quoted provision of Section 16 of the Corporation
Law, the <span class="GramE">consideration</span> for which shares of stock may
be issued are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) cash; (2) property;
and (3) undistributed profits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shares of
stock are given the special name "stock dividends" only if they are
is­sued in lieu of undistributed profits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If shares of stocks are issued in exchange of cash or property then
those shares do not fall under the category of "stock
dividends".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A corporation may
legally issue shares of stock in consideration of services rendered to it by a
person not a stockholder, or in payment of its indebt­edness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A share of stock issued to pay for services
rendered is equivalent to a stock issued in exchange of property, because <span class="GramE">services is</span> equivalent to property.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Likewise a share of stock issued in payment of indebtedness is equivalent to
issuing a stock in exchange for cash.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But a share of stock thus issued should be part of the original capital
stock of the corporation upon its organization, or part of the stocks issued
when the increase of the capitalization of a corporation is pro­perly
authorized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it is the
shares of stock that are originally issued by the corporation and forming part
of the capital that can be exchanged for cash or services rendered, or
property; that is, if the corporation has original shares of stock unsold or
unsubscribed, either coming from the original capitaliza­tion or from the
increased capitalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those shares
of stock may be issued to a person who is not a stock­holder, or to a person
already a stockholder in exchange for services rendered or for cash or
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But a share of stock coming
from stock dividends declared can­not be issued to one who is not a stockholder
of a cor­poration.</p>

<p class="BODY">A "stock dividend" is any dividend payable in shares of
stock of the corporation declaring or authorizing such dividend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, what the term itself implies, a
distribution of the shares of stock of the corporation among the stockholders
as dividends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A stock dividend of a
corporation is a dividend paid in shares of stock instead of cash, and is
properly payable only out of surplus profits.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
So, a stock dividend is actually two things:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) a dividend, and (2) the enforced use of the dividend money to
purchase additional shares of stock at par.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
When a corporation issues stock dividends, it shows that the corporation's
accumulated profits have been capitalized instead of distributed to the
stockholder or retained as surplus available for distribution, in money or
kind, should opportunity offer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Far from
being a realization of profits for the stockholder, it tends rather to postpone
said realization, in that the fund represented by the new stock has been
transferred from surplus to assets and no longer available for actual
distribution.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, it is ap­parent that stock dividends are issued only to stock­holders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so because only stockholders are
entitled to dividends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are the only
ones who have a right to a proportional share in that part of the sur­plus
which is declared as dividends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A stock
dividend really adds nothing to the interest of the stockholder; the
proportional interest of each stockholder remains the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
If a stockholder is deprived of his stock dividends -- and this happens if the
shares of stock forming part of the stock dividends are issued to a
non-stockholder -- then the proportion of the stockholder's interest changes
radically.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stock dividends are civil
fruits of the original investment, and to the owners of the shares <span class="GramE">belong</span> the civil fruits.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The term "dividend" both in the technical sense and its
ordinary acceptation, is that part or portion of the profits of the enterprise
which the corporation, by its governing agents, sets apart for ratable division
among the holders of the capital stock.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It means the fund actually set aside, and declared by the directors of
the corporation as a dividend, and duly ordered by the director, or by the
stockholders at a corporate meeting, to be divided or distributed among the
stock­holders according to their respective interests.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is <span class="GramE">Our</span> considered view, therefore,
that under Section 16 of the Corporation Law stock dividends can not be issued
to a person who is not a stockholder in payment of services rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so, in the case at bar Nielson can not be
paid in shares of stock which form part of the stock dividends of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> for services it rendered under the management
contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We sustain the contention of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> that the understanding bet­ween <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
and Nielson was simply to make the cash value of the stock dividends declared
as the basis for determining the amount of compensation that should be paid to
Nielson, in the proportion of 10% of the cash value of the stock dividends
declared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this con­clusion of <span class="GramE">Ours</span> finds support in the record.</p>

<p class="BODY">We had adverted to in <span class="GramE">Our</span> decision that
in 1940 there was some dispute between <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> and
Nielson re­garding the application and interpretation of certain provisions of
the original contract particularly with regard to the 10% participation of
Nielson in the net profits, so that some adjustments had to be made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the minutes of the meeting of the Board of
Directors of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> on <st1:date year="1940" day="21" month="8">August 21, 1940</st1:date>, <span class="GramE">We</span> read the
following:</p>

<blockquote>"The Chairman stated that he believed that it would be better <u>to
tie the computation of the 10% participation of Nielson</u> &amp; <u>Company,
Inc. to the dividend, because Nielson will then be able to definitely compute
its net participation by the amount of the dividends declared</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition to the di­vidend, we have been
setting up a depletion reserve and it does not seem fair to burden the 10%
participation of Nielson with the depletion reserve, as the depletion reserve
should not be considered as an operating ex­pense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a prolonged discussion, upon motion
duly made and seconded, it was -</blockquote>

<blockquote>"RESOLVED, That the President, be, and he hereby is,
authorized to enter into an agreement with Nielson &amp; Company, Inc.,
modifying Paragraph V of management contract of January 30, 1937, effective
January 1, 1940, in such a way that Nielson &amp; Company, Inc. shall receive
10% of any dividends declared and paid, when and as paid during the period of
the contract and at the end of each year, 10% of any depletion reserve that may
be set up and 10% of any amount expended during the year out of surplus
earnings for capital account." (Underlining supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the sentence, "The Chairman stated that he believed
that it would be better to tie the computation of the 10% participation of
Nielson &amp; Company, Inc. to the dividend, because Nielson will then be able
to definitely compute its net participation by the amount of the dividends
declared" the idea is conveyed that the intention of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>,
as expressed by its Chairman C.A. DeWitt, was to make the value of the
dividends declared -- whether the dividends were in cash or in stock -- as the
basis for determining the amount of com­pensation that should be paid to
Nielson, in the pro­portion of 10% of the cash value of the dividends so dec­lared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not mean, however, that the
compensation of Nielson would be taken from the amount actually declared as
cash dividend to be distributed to the stockholder, nor from the shares of
stocks to be issued to the stockholders as stock dividends, but from the other
assets or funds of the corporation which are not burdened by the dividends thus
declared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, if, for
example, cash dividends of P300<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> are declared,
Nielson would be entitled to a compensation of P30,000.00, but this P30,000.00
should not be taken from the P300,000.00 to be distributed as cash dividends to
the stockholders but from some other funds or assets of the corporation which
are not included in the amount to answer for the cash dividends thus
declared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so because if the
P30,000.00 would be taken out from the P300,000.00 declared as cash dividends,
then the stockholders would not be getting P300,000.00 as di­vidends but only
P270,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There would be a dilution
of the dividend that corresponds to each share of stock held by the stockholders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, if there were stock dividends
worth one million pesos that were declared, which means an issuance of ten
million shares at the par value of ten centavos per share, it does not mean
that Nielson would be given 100,000 shares.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It only means that Nielson should be given the equivalent of 10% of the
aggregate cash value of those shares issued as stock dividends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That this was the understanding of Nielson
itself is borne out by the fact that in its appeal brief Nielson urged that it

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, reconsider that part of Our decision which
declares that Nielson is entitled to shares of stock worth P300<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> based on the stock dividends dec­lared on <st1:date year="1949" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1949</st1:date> and on <st1:date year="1950" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1950</st1:date>, to­gether with all
the fruits accruing thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, We
declare that Nielson is entitled to payment by <span class="SpellE">Lepan­to</span>
of P300<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in cash, which is equivalent to 10% of
the money value of the stock dividends worth P3,000,000.00 which were declared
on <st1:date year="1949" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1949</st1:date> and
on <st1:date year="1950" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1950</st1:date>, with
interest thereon at the rate of 6% from <st1:date year="1958" day="6" month="2">February
 6, 1958</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">6. In the eighth ground of its motion for recon­sideration <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> maintains that this Court erred in awarding to
Nielson an undetermined amount of shares of stock and/or cash, which award can
not be ascertained and executed without further litigation. </p>

<p class="BODY">In view of <span class="GramE">Our</span> ruling in this resolution
that Niel­son is not entitled to receive shares of stock as stock dividends in
payment of its compensation under the management contract, We do not consider
it necessary to discuss this ground of the motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The awards in the present case are all
reduced to speci­fic sums of money.</p>

<p class="BODY">7. In the ninth ground of its motion for reconsideration <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> maintains that this Court erred in rendering
judgment for attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The matter of the award of attorney's fees is with­in the sound
discretion of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Our
decision We have stated the reason why the award of P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
for attorney's fees is considered by this Court as reason­able.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, We resolve to modify the decision that We rendered
on December 17, 1966, in the sense that instead of awarding Nielson shares of
stock worth P300,000.00 at the par value of ten centavos (P0.10) per share
based on the stock dividends declared by <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> on
November 28, 1949 and August 20, 1950, together with their fruits, Nielson
should be awarded the sum of P300,000.00 which is an amount equivalent to 10%
of the cash value of the stock dividends thus declared, as part of the
compensation due Nielson under the manage­ment contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision should, therefore, be amended, to read as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS</b>, We hereby reverse
the decision of the court <u>a</u> quo and enter in lieu thereof another,
ordering the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>

<p class="BODY">(1) Seventeen thousand five hundred pesos (P17<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>),
equivalent to 10% of the cash dividends of December, 1941, with legal interest
thereon from the date of the filing of the complaint;</p>

<p class="BODY">(2) Two thousand five hundred pesos (P2<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>),
as management fee for January, 1942, with legal interest thereon from the date
of the filing of the complaint;</p>

<p class="BODY">(3) One hundred fifty thousand pesos (P150<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>),
representing management fees for the sixty-month period of extension of the
management contract, with legal in­terest thereon from the date of the filing
of the com­plaint;</p>

<p class="BODY">(4) One million four hundred thousand pesos (P1<span class="GramE">,400,000.00</span>),
equivalent to 10% of the cash dividends declared during the period of extension

filing of the complaint;</p>

<p class="BODY">(5) Three hundred thousand pesos (P300,000.00), equivalent to 10%
of the cash value of the stock dividends declared on November 28, 1949 and

complaint;</p>

<p class="BODY">(6) Fifty three thousand nine hundred twenty eight pesos and
eighty eight centavos (P53<span class="GramE">,928.88</span>), equivalent to 10%
of the depletion reserve set up during the period of extension, with legal
interest thereon from the date of the filing of the complaint;</p>

<p class="BODY">(7) Six hundred ninety four thousand three hundred sixty four
pesos and seventy six centavos (P694<span class="GramE">,364.76</span>),
equivalent to 10% of the expenses for capital account during the period of
extension, with legal interest thereon from the date of the filing of the complaint;</p>

<p class="BODY">(8) Fifty thousand pesos (P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) as
