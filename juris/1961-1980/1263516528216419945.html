<p class="BODY"><span style="">Prior to our decision in
the expropriation case, i.e., on July 11, 1960, after hearing the question of
rents due and current, respondent city court judge Gregorio N. Garcia ordered
the suspension of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> proceedings against
petitioners <span class="SpellE">Linkod</span> <span class="SpellE">Juane</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Suñga</span> and

 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, a similar
order was rendered in the other <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case
against petitioner Flora Antonio.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent judge Garcia
disallowed the appeals lodged by <span class="SpellE">Linkod</span> <span class="SpellE">Juane</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Suñga</span> against the order of </span><st1:date year="1960" day="11" month="7"><span style="">July 11, 1960</span></st1:date><span style=""> and by Flora Antonio against that of </span><st1:date year="1960" day="23" month="7"><span style="">July 23,
 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It was at this point that
petitioners joined hands and petitioned the Court of First Instance of Manila
for <i style="">mandamus</i>, prohibition and <i style="">certiorari</i> with a prayer for </span><span style="">prohibitory-mandatory injunction questioning
the disallowance of their appeals.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After hearing, Judge
Gustavo <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> issued the preliminary injunction
prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="3"><span style="">March
 17, </span>1961</st1:date> Judge <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span>
dismissed the petition because the July 11 and July 23 orders of respondent
city judge Garcia are interlocutory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
last move to reconsider the judgment of Judge <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span>
was denied by respondent judge <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span> in his order of <st1:date year="1962" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Meanwhile - and with the
injunction of the court of first instance out of the way - on December 12 and
18, </span>1961, respondent judge Garcia heard the two <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
cases on the merits separately,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
upon notices of hearing dated <st1:date year="1961" day="27" month="11">November
 27, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These notices were
sent to petitioners' counsel at his address - <span style="">Room </span>313 Cu <span class="SpellE">Unjieng</span> Building, <st1:address><st1:street><span class="SpellE">Dasmariñas</span> Street</st1:street>, <st1:city>Manila</st1:city></st1:address>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But said notices were returned to the court
by respondent sheriff because Room 313 was found vacant, closed and locked. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Defendants in said <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
suits (petitioners herein) did not appear on the respective dates of trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same dates, December 12 and 18, 1961, respondent judge
Garcia promulgated two separate judgments ordering petitioners to vacate their
respective premises and to pay rentals due.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Then, on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="3"><span style="">March
 21, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">,
petitioners lodged with the </span>court of first instance a second petition
for <i style="">certiorari</i>, <i style="">mandamus</i> and relief from judgment with preliminary injunction
contesting the jurisdiction of the City Court of Manila.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
But respondent judge Jose N. <span class="SpellE">Leuterio</span> of the Court of
First Instance of Manila, in his order of <st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="4">April 16, 1962</st1:date>, refused to grant the preliminary
injunction prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two motions far
reconsideration of this order failed of their purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This paved the way for
the issuance of two demolition orders - both dated </span><st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="7"><span style="">July 30, 1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> - by respondent city judge Garcia in
execution of the two judgments aforesaid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners came to this
Court on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="9"><span style="">September 3, 1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> on <i style="">certiorari</i> and <i style="">mandamus</i> with prohibitory-mandatory

the same purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They there prayed, <u>inter</u>

of nullity of the July 11 and 23, 1960 orders and the judgments of December 12
and 18, 1961 - all of respondent judge Garcia - </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">for a writ of pre­liminary
injunction to restrain execution of the judgments and the demolition
orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals, on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="1"><span style="">January
 31, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, dismissed
the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ground:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals had </span><span style="">no </span><span style="">appellate jurisdiction over the orders and decrees of city courts;
consequently, it had no jurisdiction to entertain the petition aforesaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Motions to reconsider and to amend their
petition by including the CFI judges (respondents herein) as re­spondents
therein were summarily rejected by the Court of Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We now come to the case
before us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners seek to
annul:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the city court orders of July
11 and 23, 1960, (2) </span>the <span style="">decision
of the Court of First Instance of Manila in </span>Civil <span style="">Case 44339 refusing <i style="">certiorari</i> to nullify the foregoing orders, (3) the order of the
Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil Case 49929 denying petitioners'
petition for preliminary injunction to stave off demolition and its refusal to
hear and try the merits of the petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>
filed before it, and (4) the Court of Appeals' resolution dismissing their
petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>, </span><i style="">mandamus</i> <span style="">and prohibition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="4"><span style="">April
 22, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, we granted
the writ of preliminary injunction prayed for by petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This </span>Court, <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="19" month="11"><span style="">November 19, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, allowed <span class="SpellE">Manotok</span>
to intervene.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As we assess the merits of the petition before us, we find
it convenient to first dispose of petitioners' argument that it was wrong both
for the city court and the court of first instance to disallow appeal from the
orders of July 11 and 23, 1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
courts below ruled that these orders were interlocutory and therefore not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
agree.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We first go to the nature
of these two orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the rate of
monthly rentals is disputed, it became necessary for the city court to
ascertain "the current rentals", payment of which is required as a
condition precedent for the suspension of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
proceedings upon the pro­visions of Section 5, Republic Act 1162 as amended,
and our ruling in </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Samia</u></span> <u><span style="">vs</span></u><span style="">. </span><u>Reyes</u>, <span style="">L-14760, May
31, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The city court's orders of
July 11 and 23, 1960 besides ordering suspension of the proceedings also fixed
the amount of rentals in arrears as well a</span><span style="">s </span><span style="">the current rentals to
be paid by petitioners to <span class="SpellE">Manotok</span>, their <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">By <span style="">no </span>stretch of
the imagination may the disputed orders be placed in the category of final and <span class="SpellE">appeal­able</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Precisely, those orders were issued in the course of the proceedings for
the suspension of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suspension <span style="">its</span>e<span style="">lf </span>connotes
the idea of work unfinished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfinished
because the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suits at that time had yet to
be decided on their merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
questioned orders did not completely dispose of the controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further court action - a <span style="">substantial </span>one - must take place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said orders then are clearly inter­locutory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No appeal lies <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">More to this.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
litigations were only finally decided by the city court in its judgments on the
merits of December 12 and 18, 1961.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The orders of July 11 and
23, 1960 being inter­locutory and therefore <span class="SpellE">unappealable</span>
rejection of the appeal both by the city court and the court of first </span><span style="">instance </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">was</span></span><span style=""> proper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners seek
annulment of the city court judgments of December 12 <span style="">and 18, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>They gripe
that their counsel did not receive notices of trial in the two <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
do not go along with petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the address of record of counsel for
petitioners, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Suñga</span>,
is Room 313 Cu <span class="SpellE">Unjieng</span> Building, <st1:address><st1:street><span class="SpellE">Dasmariñas</span> Street</st1:street>, <st1:city>Manila</st1:city></st1:address>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent sheriff tried to serve said
notices of trial at the address just mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He found the room vacant, closed and locked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, the <span style="">notices
</span>were <span class="SpellE">unserved</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is a situation brought about by the negligence of counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not inform the court of his change of
address.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a duty incumbent upon him
to do so.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The time has come, we
believe, for this Court to remind the members of the Bar that it is their
inescapable duty to make of record their correct address in all cases in which
they are counsel for a suitor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For,
instances there have been in the past when, because of failure to inform the
court of the change of address, litigations were delayed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, not to speak of inconvenience
caused the other parties and the court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Worse still, litigants have lost their cases in court because of such
negligence on the part of their counsel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is painful enough for a litigant to suffer a setback in a legal
battle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is doubly painful if defeat
is occasioned by his attorney's failure to receive notice because the latter
has changed the place of his law office without giving the proper notice <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only
when some such situation comes about that the negligent lawyer comes to realize
the grave responsibility that he has incurred both to his client and to the
cause of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is then that the
lawyer is reminded that in his oath of office he solemnly declared that he
"will conduct" himself "as a lawyer according to the best of his
knowledge and discretion".<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Too late.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Experience
indeed is a good teacher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">a
lawyer, though, it could prove very expensive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The considerations just
adverted to deter us from nullifying the judgments of the city court of
December 12 and 18, 1961 in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, there was no abuse of discretion on
the part of the city court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of no
importance is petitioners' charge that respondent city judge had personal
knowledge of <span class="SpellE">Suñga's</span> change of address.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It
has no basis in fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His petition for <i>certiorari</i>
in Civil Case 44339, CFI, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, does not reflect the new addres</span><span style="">s</span><span style="">, as <span class="SpellE">Suñga</span> claims.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anyway, notices of hearing are ordinarily taken care of by clerks, who
are naturally guided by addresses of record.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To require the judge <span class="GramE">himself</span> to look after the
simple ministerial function of sending notices is to add another burden to an
already heavily burdened position.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:place><span style="">Opportunity</span></st1:place><span style=""> to be heard was given.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners lost that opportunity because of
their lawyer's negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was due
process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The city court had jurisdiction
to decide the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i style="">Certiorari</i> to annul said judgments filed with the Court of Appeals
on behalf of said petitioners will not prosper.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither will a plea for the other extraordinary writs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At any rate, <i style="">certiorari</i> or similar writs may not
issue from the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For,
the Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In </span><u>Philippine</u> <u>Products</u> <u><span style="">Co</span></u><span style="">. <u>vs</u>. <u>The</u> <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> </span><u>Appeals</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> we ruled that by statute the Court of
Appeals may only issue a writ of <i style="">certiorari</i>
and similar writs in aid of its appellate jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to say, if the main case is <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the Court of Appeals, a special civil action
for <i style="">certiorari</i> on a matter incidental
thereto may be brought to said court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The main cases here are for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The city court's judgments in said cases are <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the Court of First Instance, not to the Court
of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners' belated attempt
- after dismissal of their case by the Court of Appeals - to include as party
re­spondents in the Court of Appeals the judges of the Court of First Instance
of Manila here involved does not change the picture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is enough to say once again that those
judges committed no abuse of di</span><span style="">s</span><span style="">cretion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, there is no infirmity in the Court of Appeals' decision
dismissing petitioners' petition therein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The net result of all the
foregoing is that no error exists in any of the proceedings taken by </span><span style="">re</span><span style="">spondents which would call for the exercise of this Court's supervisory

record".<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>See</u> <u>also</u>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>
