				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Originally elevated to the Court of Appeals, this case was
certified to this Court as the issues involve purely questions of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals in its Resolution, adopted the defen­dants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' counter-statement of facts as a fair
reproduction of the findings of the trial court, substantially in conformity
with appellant's statement of facts as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Adle</span> passed the Civil Service Examinations as shown by his
civil service rating dated <st1:date year="1949" day="20" month="8">August 20,
 1949</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span><span class="GramE">. '</span>A',
plaintiff), by virtue of which he was extended an appointment as Sergeant of Police
on <st1:date year="1951" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1951</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">'13', defendants).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This appointment was submitted to and bears
approval by the Executive Secretary, but bears a notation by the Bureau of
Civil Service as 'temporary pending report from the Government Service
Insurance System as to the appointee's physical and medical examination' (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">'13', defendants).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"During this time there were two positions of sergeant of
police in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>La
  <span class="SpellE">Castel­lana</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, one
occupied by the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Adle</span> and one occupied by <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Atesora</span>, the latter was also appointed on <st1:date year="1951" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1951</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span><span class="GramE">. '15', defendants).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The names of <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Adle</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Atesora</span> as
Sergeants of Police also appear in the <span class="SpellE">plantilla</span> of
per­sonnel and annual budget for 1951-1952 (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">'14', '14-A' and '14-B', defendants).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"That on <st1:date year="1951" day="24" month="11">November
 24, 1951</st1:date>, the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Adle</span> was charged with several other co-accused in the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental for the crime
of murder in <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No. 3220, 'People vs. Rafael <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>, et al.,' by virtue of which he was suspended on the
same date, <st1:date year="1951" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1951</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the interim, during the period of his
suspension, the municipal council of La <span class="SpellE">Castellana</span>,
in its Resolution No. 39, series of 1951, dated August 16, 1952, reduced the 47
existing positions in the municipal force of La <span class="SpellE">Castellana</span>
to 28, one of which is the position of a ser­geant of police so that instead of
2 sergeants of police, only one sergeant remained (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'6', defendants <span class="GramE">An­nex</span> 'A', Record on Appeal pp. 8-9).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The reason for the reduction of the police force and the
abolition of the positions was to implement the minimum wage law in favor of
the remaining employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This reduction
of the positions was likewise approved by the Secretary of Finance in its
letter dated <st1:date year="1952" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1952</st1:date>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">'7', defendant).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the reduction and abo­lition of the
positions of the members of the police force of La <span class="SpellE">Castellana</span>
on <st1:date year="1952" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1952</st1:date> the lone
position of sergeant of police was occupied by <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Atesora</span> who continued occupying the same position
until <st1:date year="1953" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1953</st1:date>, when
Sergeant <span class="SpellE">Atesora</span> was demoted to patrolman (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">'16', defendants).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Subsequently thereafter, the position of sergeant of police was
occupied by Ramon <span class="SpellE">Hechanova</span> by virtue of his
appointment dated <st1:date year="1954" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1954</st1:date>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span><span class="GramE">. '18', defendants; <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> 'O', plaintiff).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later <span class="SpellE">Hechanova</span> re­signed
and the position of sergeant of police is presently occupied by <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Atesora</span> who was
reappointed to the same position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
appears further from the record that plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Adle</span> was acquitted in the aforesaid <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No. 3220 in a decision rendered by the Supreme
Court on <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1961</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Plaintiff presented a voucher for the payment of his back salaries
from the date of his suspension on <st1:date year="1951" day="24" month="11">November
 24, 1951</st1:date> to the date of his acquittal on <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1961</st1:date>, which claim was transmitted by
the municipal treasurer to the Provincial Auditor on <st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1961</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span><span class="GramE">. '2', defendants), requesting for appropriate action on the
legality of the claim of the plaintiff inasmuch as his position was abolished
by the municipal council for the fiscal year 1952-53.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Provincial Auditor by its <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>
of <st1:date year="1961" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1961</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span><span class="GramE">. '</span>3', defendants), returned
the papers to the municipal treasurer requesting information regarding the
abolition of the position of <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Adle</span> which papers were further indorsed by the muni­cipal
treasurer on August 8, 1961, to the Municipal Mayor (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'4', defendants), requesting information and by <st1:date year="1961" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1961</st1:date>, the municipal secretary returned the
papers with its corresponding <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. '5', defendants), and again the municipal treasurer by
its third <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> dated <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1961</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'8', defendants), indorsed the papers to the Provincial Auditor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Provincial Auditor, by its 4th <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> dated <st1:date year="1961" day="6" month="9">September
 6, 1961</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. '9', Defendants), indorsed
the claim papers for back salaries of <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Adle</span> to the Auditor General with the corresponding
statement of facts particularly pointing to the abolition of the position of
the plain­tiff as per Resolution No. 39, Series of 1952.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"And finally, by the 5th <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>
dated <st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1961</st1:date>, of
the Deputy Auditor General (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span><span class="GramE">. '</span>10',
defen­dants), the latter rendered an opinion that by virtue of the abolition of
the position of <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Adle</span>,
plain­tiff herein, on August 16, 1952, his claim for back wages cannot be
allowed except for the period covering the date of his suspension on Nov. 24,
1951, to the date of the abolition of his position on August 16, 1952, which
was recommended for payment subject to the availability of funds.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The claim corresponding to the period covering this date, <st1:date year="1951" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1951</st1:date>, to <st1:date year="1952" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1952</st1:date>, was actually paid to
plaintiff (See Annex 'C', Record on Appeal, p. 11.)" <span class="GramE">(pp.
2-6, <span class="SpellE">Appellees</span>' Brief).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals added that "before appellant passed the
Civil Service examination for patrolman, he had already been serving as field
sergeant of the municipal police force of La <span class="SpellE">Castellana</span>,
having been appointed as such on <st1:date year="1948" day="4" month="10">October
 4, 1948</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After passing the
examination, he was given another appointment also as field sergeant with an
increase in salary at the rate of P960.00 per annum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After his acquittal by the Supreme Court on
February 16, 1961, he asked for reinstate­ment and for the payment of his back
salaries during the whole period of time from the date of his suspension until
the date of his acquittal, or a total of P8<span class="GramE">,855.81</span>;
but he was paid only the sum of P699.96 corresponding to the period from his
date of suspension to the date of the abolition of his position by means of a
resolution of the municipal council of La <span class="SpellE">Castellana</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the foregoing facts, plaintiff-appellant filed
his complaint against defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> for
reinstatement "to his former position as Field Sergeant of the Municipal
Police Force of La <span class="SpellE">Castellana</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental" and for payment of his back salaries in the amount of
P8,855.81, invoking the provisions of Section 4 of Republic Act No. 557.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court dismissed the complaint, holding that appel­lant's
appointment was of a temporary character, so authorized by the Civil Service
Commission pending report from the Govern­ment Service Insurance System as to
appellant's physical and medical examination, and that the abolition of 19
positions in the municipality's police force, including appellant's, was in
good faith and properly approved by the Secretary of Finance, in order to
enable the municipality to implement the Minimum Wage Law in favor of the
remaining employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant reiterates in this appeal his contention that his appointment
on April 1, 1951, as Sergeant of Police should not have been held by the trial
court to be temporary, in character, as he had passed the civil service
examinations in 1948.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is undisputed,
however, that his appointment was authorized by the Commissioner of Civil
Service as "temporary pending report from the Government Service Insurance
System as to the appointee's physical and medical examination," <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not until ten years later, after his
acquittal on February 15, 1961, in the Padilla murder case against Rafael <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> et al. that plaintiff-appellant submitted his
physical and medical report on July 21, 1961, and in the meantime, nine years
earlier on August 16, 1952, defendant municipality had abolished the position
of police sergeant to which he had been appointed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No error was committed by the trial court in
holding his appointment to be of a temporary character, as the passing of such
medical examination has been held to be a condition attached to an appointment,
which must be complied with within a reasonable time, for the condition of an
appointee's health may deteriorate after the passage of a consider­able period
of time.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Basically, appellant anchors his complaint for back wages and
reinstatement on Section 4 of Republic Act No. 557,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span class="GramE"> then</span> in force, which provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When a member of the municipal police is
accused in court of any felony or violation of law by the provincial or city
fiscal, the Mayor shall immediately suspend the accused pending final decision
of the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of acquittal, the
accused shall be entitled to payment of the entire salary he failed to receive
during suspension."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Having been suspended on November 24,
1951, upon the filing of the criminal charge against him and having been
acquitted on appeal by this Court on February 15, 1961, appellant claims that
after nearly ten years of confinement and deprivation, he is now entitled under
the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> provision of law to payment of the
entire salary he failed to receive during the period of his mandatory suspension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much as we sympathize with appellant's
plight, his claim to such back salaries must perforce be valid only for as long
as the position held by him was extant and had not been validly abolished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, appellant was duly paid the P699.96 corres­ponding
to the period from his date of suspension to the date of the abolition of his
position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the position held by him
had been validly abolished by defendant municipality during the early part of
his suspension on August 16, 1952, along with 18 other positions in order to
enable the municipality to implement the Minimum Wage Law in favor of the
remaining employees and such abolition had been duly approved by the Secretary
of Finance.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant <span class="GramE">himself</span> in his complaint made no allegation
impugning the abolition of his position as tainted with bad faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under such circumstances, appellant's
complaint was correctly dismissed by the trial court, for regardless of
Republic Act 557 and of his suspension under the provision of Section 4
thereof, the abolition of the office held by appellant terminated his right
thereto and to any further com­pensation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fundamental protection against removal of civil service employees
"except for cause as provided by law" does apply, where there has
been no removal of the employee but an abolition in good faith of his position,
for such abolition produces his lawful separation from the service.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant, therefore, could no longer legally invoke his right to reinstatement
and back wages under Rep. Act 557 as the position held by him and from which he
was suspended had ceased to exist and had been validly abolished.</p>
