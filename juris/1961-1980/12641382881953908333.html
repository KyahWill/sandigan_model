<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In connection with the 
application of <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolo</span>, a certificate of public convenience to operate a 
(transportation) public utility service on the route Sta. Rita (<span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>) to <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> Drive 
(Naval Base gate) in <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, the Public Service Commission issued an order 
dated June 28, 1962, setting said application for hearing on July 30, 1962. The 
order also contained the usual requirement of publication and notice (of said 
order) to all operators affected, as appearing in the list attached thereto, "at 
least ten (10) days before the date of hearing, and that applicant, during the 
hearing, shall submit among others, as proof of compliance therewith, the 
affidavit of the person who mailed said notices, to the effect that the same was 
made within the required period. The list of affected operators attached to the 
order contained 62 names, 60 of whom appear to be residents of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The records show, however, that 
while the notice was duly published in 2 newspapers of general circulation on 
</span><st1:date month="7" day="5" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 5, 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
individual notices sent by registered mail to the affected operators were posted 
in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> only on </span><st1:date month="7" day="25" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 25, 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
Consequently, the addressees received the same on the first week of August, as 
evidenced by the registry return cards, or after the scheduled date of hearing 
as appearing in said notice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In view thereof, the <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> <span class="SpellE">Jeepney</span> Operator 
Association (composed of the operators affected), in a motion which was received 
by the Public Service Commission on August 6, 1962, prayed for the re-opening of 
the case and/or setting aside of the decision, if the application of <span class="SpellE">Bartolo</span> was already granted, as said association desires to 
oppose the same, on the ground that public convenience and necessity would no 
longer be served thereby; that as the jurisdictional requirement of notice was 
not complied with, it was deprived of its day in court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Strangely, although the <span class="SpellE">oppositor's</span> copy of this motion, which contains the correct 
title or citation of the case, clearly bore the stamp of receipt of the 
receiving- section of the Public Service Commission on </span><st1:date month="8" day="6" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 6, 
1962</span></st1:date><sup><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; color: red; font-family: Verdana;">[1]</span></sup><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the original or copy of said 
motion does not appear in the Service Commission and <span class="SpellE">Bartolo</span> Commission's record-folder of Case No. 62-3695. It 
must be for this reason that no action was taken thereon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The records do not reveal what 
took place on July 30. It appears, however, that Atty. Jesus K. Calderon, who 
was designated to receive applicant's evidence, did so on August 20, 1962' and 
as none of the affected operators was present, an order of default was entered 
against them at the instance of the applicant. On </span><st1:date month="11" day="16" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 16, 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, a 
decision was rendered granting applicant <span class="SpellE">Bartolo</span> a 
certificate to operate 2 <span class="SpellE">jeepneys</span> in the route covered 
by his application. Presumably on account of the general order of default, the 
affected operators were not also notified of this decision. It was only in 
December, 1962, upon inquiry made in the Motor Vehicles <span class="GramE">Office, that</span> they learned of said decision. <span class="GramE">Hence, the filing of the instant petition for 
review.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On the petitioner's charge that 
the jurisdictional requirement of notice to affected parties was not complied 
with, the record of this case speaks for itself. Although the order of June 28, 
1962 specifically required that the notices should be sent to the persons named 
in the list at least 10 days before the hearing which was scheduled for July 30, 
1962, the registry receipts, which were submitted to the commissioner as part of 
applicant's evidence, show that the mails were actually posted in Manila only on 
July 25, 1962. Considering that these were sent by registered mail and the 
addressees were in <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, it was almost a certainty 
that the latter would not, as they did not, receive the same before July 30. 
Furthermore, it may be pointed out that although the same order of the 
Commission required the submission of the affidavit of the person who posted the 
notices, attesting to the fact that mailing was made at least 10 days before the 
date of hearing, no such affidavit was presented. Notwithstanding the foregoing 
deficiencies, the application was, nevertheless, approved and the disputed 
decision was rendered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In this instance, respondent 
applicant contends that the publication of the notice of hearing in 2 newspapers 
of general circulation in the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">province</span></st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Zambales</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> is notification not only to the 
interested parties, but to the whole world in general. This is inaccurate. The 
order required, <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">in addition to 
publication</span></em>, individual notice to the operators affected by the 
application whose names appeared in the list attached to the order. The 
requirement, therefore, is not in the alternative, but conjunctive. It cannot be 
disputed that this requirement of the Public Service Commission itself in 
connection with an application for a certificate of public convenience, is 
within the power of the Commission to impose. The inadequate notification to the 
interested parties in this case, which resulted in the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>' failure to be present during the hearing, 
deprived them of their day in court. The decision rendered in disregard of said 
right, consequently, is null and void.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision in PSC Case No. 
62-3695 is hereby set aside, and the case is remanded to the Commission for 
further proper proceedings. No costs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">SO 
ORDERED</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
