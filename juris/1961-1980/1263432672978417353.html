decision of respondent Court of Tax Appeals sustaining the actuation of the
Commissioner of Customs affirming a forfeiture decreed by the Acting Collector
of Customs, is understandable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
goods, subject of such proceedings, consisted of 108 cartons of <span class="SpellE">unmanifested</span> cigarettes found inside the cabins of
petitioners, crew members of the vessel <span class="SpellE">Fernside</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Customs authorities started the seizure
proceedings in accordance with the Tariff and Customs Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The nature of the case and the facts are set forth in the
appealed decision thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"This is a
petition to review the decision of the respondent Commissioner of Customs dated
December 14, 1964, affirming that of the Acting Collector of Customs in Seizure
Identification No. 6496, decreeing the forfeiture of twelve (12) cartons Salem
cigarettes, nine (9) cartons Salem cigarettes, eight (8) cartons Salem
cigarettes, one (1) carton Chesterfield cigarettes, seventy-nine (79) cartons
Salem cigarettes and two (2) cartons Kent cigarettes for violation of Section
2530(g) of the Tariff and Customs Code, in relation to Section 1005 of the same
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that the cigarettes in
question were discovered inside the cabin of three crew members of a foreign
vessel, named S/S 'FERNSIDE', during a search conducted by a team of customs
agents in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Port</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place>
on <st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the said cigarettes were not manifested
at the time of discovery and were found in the cabin, apparently concealed,
they were seized by the customs agents for violation of Section 2530(g) of the
Tariff and Customs Code, and, subsequently, were made subject of Seizure
Identification No. 6496 with Kurt <span class="SpellE">Nilsen</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dagpin</span> <span class="SpellE">Lunogren</span> and <span class="SpellE">Helgsesen</span>, crew members of S/S 'FERNSIDE' and <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> &amp; Company, Inc., agent of said vessel,
appearing as claimants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On July 1, 1964,
after due hearing, the Acting Collector of Customs rendered a decision
decreeing the forfeiture of the seized cigarettes, which decision, on appeal to
the Commissioner of Customs, was affirmed by the latter in his decision dated
December 14, 1964."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The issue was set forth in the appealed decision thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The principal issue raised for our
determination is whether the articles in question are subject to forfeiture for
violation of Section 2530(g) of the Tariff and Customs Code, in relation to
Section 1005 of the same Code, the pertinent portions of which, respectively,
provide as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sec. 2530.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Property Subject to Forfeiture Under
Tariff and Customs Laws</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Any
vessel or aircraft, cargo, articles and other objects shall, under the
following conditions, be subject to forfeiture: * * * (g) <span class="SpellE"><u>Unmanifested</u></span><u>
article</u> found on any vessel or aircraft, <u>if manifest <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
is required.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * Sec. 1005.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Manifest Required of Vessel From Foreign
Port</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Every vessel from a foreign
port must have on board a complete manifest of all her cargo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * Every vessel from a foreign port must
have on board complete manifest of passengers and their baggage, in the
prescribed form, setting forth their destination and all particulars required
by the immigration laws; <u>and every such vessel shall have</u> prepared for
presentation to the proper customs official upon arrival in ports of the
Philippines a <u>complete list of all sea stores then on board</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * "<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The well-written decision of the late Associate Judge Ramon L. <span class="SpellE">Avanceña</span> of respondent Court then proceeded to set forth
the contention of petitioners:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Petitioners maintain that under the above-quoted law the
cigarettes in question are not subject to forfeiture inasmuch as they do not
constitute cargo of the vessel but are part of the sea stores or provision of
the ship that need no manifest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are
in accord with the petitioners that sea stores need no manifest for the
consistent ruling of the Supreme Court is that it is enough that they are
contained in 'a complete list of all ship's stores'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * However, it is not correct to say that
said cigarettes were part of the sea stores because in point of fact they were
not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cigarettes were not found in
the slope chest where generally they are kept but in the crew's cabin,
apparently concealed, and were not in the list of sea stores."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Why the decision reached necessarily had to be adverse to
petitioners was explained in a clear and logical manner:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In fine, the cigarettes in question did
not appear in the manifest, did not appear in the sea stores list, and no claim
has been made that they were in the passenger baggage manifest or crew's
declaration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only reasonable
inference is that they were <span class="SpellE">unmanifested</span>
cargoes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cargo has been construed by our
Supreme Court to include all goods, wares, and merchandise aboard ship which do
not form part of the ship's stores (<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. <span class="SpellE">Islas</span> Filipinas, <u>supra)</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has also been said that the word 'cargo'
refers to the 'entire lading of the ship which carries it' and includes all
goods, wares and merchandise, effects, and indeed everything of every kind or
description, found on board, except such things as are used or intended for use
in connection with the management or direction of the vessel, and are not
intended for delivery at any port of call, and except also, perhaps,
'passengers or immigrants and their baggage.' (<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. S.S. <span class="SpellE">Rubi</span>, 32 Phil. 228).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This broad definition of cargo obviously
embraces the cigarettes in question."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">How then could petitioners nurture the legitimate expectation
that a reversal of the Court of Tax Appeals decision is warranted? As noted at
the outset, we affirm.</p>

<blockquote>1. This Court, in <span class="SpellE">Balbas</span> v. Domingo,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
affirming a decision of the Court of Tax Appeals, reiterated the authoritative
doctrine with reference to the force and effect to which an appraisal of the
facts by the Court of Tax Appeals is entitled.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"No other conclusion
is possible in view of the well-settled principle that this Court is bound by
the finding of facts of the Court of Tax Appeals, only questions of law being
open to it for determination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated
in another decision, 'only errors of law, and not rulings on the weight of
evidence, are <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> by this Court.' The facts
then as above ascertained cannot be disturbed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In our latest decision, there is a categorical assertion that where the
question is one of fact, it is no longer <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
That doctrine has been adhered to in subsequent cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>2. Nor is the force of the above controlling concept minimized by
allegations of petitioners which, if justified, could give rise to a procedural
due process question on the ground of arbitrariness on the part of respondent
Court, when it concluded that the cartons of cigarettes in question fell under
the category of <span class="SpellE">unmanifested</span> cargoes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What had been set forth earlier would
indicate that it so considered them, but only after a thorough scrutiny of the
undoubted facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was set forth by the
late Judge <span class="SpellE">Avanceña</span>, the cigarettes "were not
found in the slope chest where generally they are kept but in the crew's cabin,
apparently concealed, and were not in the list of sea stores."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
It thus arrived at the "reasonable inference" that they were in fact <span class="SpellE">unmanifested</span> cargoes as "the cigarettes in question
did not appear in the manifest, did not appear in the sea stores list, and no
claims has been made that they were in the passenger baggage manifest or crew's
declaration."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Nor is that all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To indicate the
circumspection that characterized the decision-making process of respondent
Court, there is this appraisal of the evidence for petitioners:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"We find no merit in the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Bergaño</span>, Chief of
Claims of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> &amp; Co. to the
effect that the cigarettes in question were in the list of sea stores and that
they had been released to the crew for consumption and receipted for by
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This witness learned of the
seizure two days after it took place after which he conducted an investigation
for petitioner <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> &amp; Co. that represented
the vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is in no position to have
knowledge of his own as to what transpired during the seizure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, considering the circumstances
of this case, his testimony is hardly probable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the same were true, for sure petitioners would have presented the sea
stores list, the receipts for the cigarettes, and the crew's declaration, for
these are vital pieces of evidence for them, but this was never done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is idle for him to explain that these
papers were brought by the officers of the vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ship is liable to penalties for <span class="SpellE">unmanifested</span> cargoes, and the ship's officers certainly had
every interest to leave said papers for evidence to forestall penalties against
the ship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Port regulation, furthermore,
allows the vessel to release only 1 carton of cigarettes for each member of the
crew for every 25 hours of stay in port but significantly enough 12 cartons of
Salem, 9 cartons of Salem, 8 cartons of Salem and 1 carton of Chesterfield,
quantities of cigarettes far in excess of regulations, were found in the
possession of Kurt <span class="SpellE">Nilsen</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dagpin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lunogren</span> and <span class="SpellE">Helge</span> <span class="SpellE">Helgsesen</span>, respectively, while 79 cartons of Salem and 1
carton of Kent had no claimant."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">There is nothing, therefore, in the
appealed decision that could be fitly stigmatized as indicative of
arbitrariness or caprice, the presence of which would give rise to a valid
procedural due process objection.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision of respondent Court of
Tax Appeals is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With costs.</p>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Antonio, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, Jr., Santos, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos,

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, J., <span style="font-style: normal;">no part.<o:p></o:p></span></span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, J., <span style="font-style: normal;">concur. The case is a smuggling case pure and simple.<o:p></o:p></span></span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: normal;">The Tax Court need not be a
party herein because the case is before this Court on appeal. It is similar to
an appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeals. Chief Justice Moran notes
that in such a case the Court of Appeals need not be made a party-respondent (2
Comments on the Rules of Court, 1970 Ed., p. 481).<o:p></o:p></span></span><br>
