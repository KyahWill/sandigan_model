				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This Court not so long ago reaffirmed the doctrine that where a
dismissal of a criminal prosecution amounts to an acquittal, even if arising
from a motion presented by the accused, the ban on being twice put in jeopardy
may be <span style="">invoked, especially where such
dismissal was predicated on the right to a speedy trial.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The specific question then that this
certiorari and prohibition proceeding presents is whether on the undisputed
facts, an order of dismissal given in open court by respondent Judge <span class="GramE">falls</span> within the operation of the above principle,
precluding its reconsideration later as the defense of double jeopardy would be
available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here respondent </span><span style="">Judge did reconsider, and his actuation is
now assailed as a grave abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As will be made apparent, petitioner has the law on his side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writs should be granted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It was shown that on <st1:date year="1959" day="3" month="8">August
 3, 1959</st1:date>, respondent Provincial Fiscal filed in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> <span class="GramE">a criminal</span>
information for damage to <span style="">property </span>through
reckless imprudence against petitioner and <span style="">a </span>certain Chi Chan Tan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
there were no further p<span style="">roceedings </span>in
the meantime, petitioner on <st1:date year="1965" day="19" month="5">May 19,
 1965</st1:date> moved <span style="">to dismiss </span>the
criminal charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge was <span style="">not </span>in agreement as shown by his order
<span style="">of denial of </span><st1:date year="1965" day="10" month="7"><span style="">July 10,
 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, after two more years, came the trial </span>with
t<span style="">he complainant having testified </span><span style="">on </span><span style="">direct examination but not having as yet been
fully </span>cross-examined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At <span style="">the continuation </span><span style="">of the </span>trial
set <span style="">for</span><span style=""> </span><st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1967</st1:date> such witness did not show up<span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
provincial </span>fiscal moved for <span style="">postponement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for petitioner, however, not only
objected but </span><span style="">sought </span><span style="">the dismissal </span>of
the case <span style="">based on the right of </span><span style="">the ac</span><span style="">c</span><span style="">used </span><span style="">to
speedy</span> <span style="">trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge this time acceded, but would
likewise base his order of dismissal, orally </span>given, on <span style="">the cross-ex</span>am<span style="">ination o</span>f complainant not having<span style=""> </span>started <span style="">as yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Later <span style="">that same day, respondent </span>Judge did reconsider the order <span style="">and reinstated</span> <span style="">the case, his </span>action being due to its being shown that th<span style="">e cross</span><span style="">-</span><span style="">examination </span>of the complainant had already
started.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the above facts, there can be no dispute as to the <span style="">applicable law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It <span style="">is </span>not to be lost <span style="">sight </span><span style="">of </span>that the petition <span style="">on
its face had </span>more than its fair share of plausibility, thus <span style="">eliciting an affirmative </span>response to
the <span style="">plea for </span>a writ of <span style="">preliminary injunction, duly issued</span> by
<span style="">this </span><span style="">Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For i</span><span style="">t </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">all too evident</span> that petitioner <span style="">could rely o</span>n his constitutional <span style="">right to </span><span style="">a speedy trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For more than </span>six
years the threat of his<span style=""> being subjected
to a penal liability did hang over his head, with the </span><span style="">prosecution failing
</span><span style="">to take any step to have the
matter heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did ask that the case
be dismissed</span>, <span style="">but respondent
Judge</span> turned him down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the
trial did at long last take place after two more years and again postponement
was sought as the complainant was <span style="">not
available for cross-examination, </span>petitioner, <span style="">as </span>could have been expected, did again seek to put an end to his
travail with a motion <span style="">for dismissal
grounded once more on </span>the undeniable fact that he was not accorded the <span style="">speedy </span>trial that was his due.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time respondent Judge was quite
receptive – and about time too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
order of dismissal given in open court had then the effect of an acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the respondent Judge to give vent to a
change of heart with his reconsideration was to subject petitioner to the risk
of being put in jeopardy once more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Nor could respondent Judge's allegation that he could do so as he
acted under a misapprehension be impressed with the quality of persuasiveness.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decisive fact was the absence of that
speedy trial guaranteed by the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This petition then, to repeat, possesses merit.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The right to a speedy trial means one free from vexatious,
capricious arid oppressive delays, its salutary objective being to assure that
an innocent person may be <span style="">freed from
the anxiety and expense of a court litigation or, if otherwise, of having his
guilt determined within the shortest possible time compatible with the
presentation and consideration of whatever legitimate defenses he may </span>interpose.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The remedy in the event of <span style="">a </span>non-observance of this right is by habeas corpus <span style="">if </span>the
accused were restrained of his liberty, or by certiorari, prohibition, or
mandamus for the final dismissal of the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the first Supreme Court decision after the Constitution took
effect, an appeal from a judgment of <span class="GramE">conviction,</span> it <span style="">was </span>shown
that the criminal case had been dragging on for almost five years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the trial did finally take <span style="">place, </span>it w<span style="">as </span>tainted
by irregularities. White ordinarily the remedy would have been <span style="">to remand the case again for a new trial, the
appealed decision of conviction was set aside and the accused acquitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a judgment was called for according to
the opinion penned by Justice Laurel, if this constitutional right were to be
accorded respect and deference.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The Government should
be the last to set an example of delay and oppression in the administration of
justice <span style="">and </span>it is the moral and
legal obligation of this court to </span><span style="">see </span><span style="">that
the criminal proceedings against the accused came to an end and that they be
immediately discharged from the custody of the law."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Conformably to the above ruling as well as the earlier case of <span class="SpellE">Conde</span> v. Rivera,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
the dismissal of a second information for frustrated homicide was ordered by
the Supreme Court on a showing that the first information had been dismissed
after a lapse of one year and seven months from the time the original complaint
was filed during which time on the three occasions the case was set for trial, the
private prosecutor twice asked for postponements and once the trial court
itself cancelled the entire calendar for the month it was supposed to have been
heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out in such decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The right of the accused to have a
speedy trial is violated not only when unjustified postponements of the trial
are asked for and secured, but also when, without good cause or justifiable
motive, a long period of time is allowed to elapse without having his case
tried."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
It did not matter that in this case the postponements were sought and obtained
by the private prosecution, although with the consent and approval of the
fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor was there a waiver and
abandonment of the right to a speedy, trial when there <span style="">was </span>a failure on the part of the accused to urge that the case be
heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Such a waiver or
abandonment may be presumed only when the postponement of the trial has been
sought and obtained [by him.]."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
A finding that there was an infringement of this right <span style="">was </span>predicated on an accused having been criminally prosecuted for
an alleged abuse of chastity in a justice of the <span style="">peace court as a result of which he was arrested three times, each time
having to post a bond for his provisional liberty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mandamus to compel the trial judge to dismiss
the case was under the circumstances the appropriate remedy.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In Mercado v. Santos,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
the second occasion Justice Laurel had to write the opinion for the Supreme
Court in a <span style="">case </span>of this nature,
the transgression of this constitutional mandate came about with petitioner
having in a space of twenty months been arrested four times on the charge of
falsifying his deceased wife's will, the first two complaints having been
subsequently withdrawn only to be <span class="SpellE">refiled</span> <span style="">a </span>third time and thereafter dismissed
after due investigation by the justice of the peace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Undeterred the provincial fiscal filed a
motion for reinvestigation favorably acted on by the Court of First Instance
which finally ordered that the case be heard on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this stage the accused moved to dismiss
but was rebuffed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He sought the aid of
the Court of Appeals in a petition for certiorari but did not prevail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then that the matter was elevated to
the Supreme Court which reversed the Court of Appeals, the accused "being
entitled to have the criminal proceedings against him quashed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">" It</span> was
stressed in Justice Laurel's opinion:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"An accused person is entitled to a trial at the earliest
opportunity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * He cannot be <span class="SpellE">ppressed</span> by delaying the commencement of trial for an
unreasonable length of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
proceedings ending trial are deferred, the trial itself is necessarily
delayed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not to be supposed, of
course, that the Constitution intends to remove from the prosecution every
reasonable opportunity to prepare for trial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Impossibilities cannot be expected or extra­ordinary efforts required on
the part of the prosecutor or the court."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>The opinion likewise considered as
not decisive the fact that the provincial fiscal did not intervene until an
information <span style="">was </span>filed charging
the accused with the crime of falsification the third time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "The Constitution does not say
that the right to a speedy trial may be availed of only where the prosecution
for crime is commenced and undertaken by the fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not exclude from its operation cases
commenced by private individuals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where
once a person is prosecuted criminally, he is entitled to a speedy trial,
irrespective of the nature of the offense or the manner in which it is
authorized to be commenced."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More
specifically, this Court has consistently adhered to the view that a dismissal
based on the denial of the right to<span style=""> </span><span style="">speedy
</span><span style="">trial
</span><span style="">amounts to an acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily, any further attempt at
continuing the prosecution or starting a new one would </span><span style="">fall </span><span style="">within the prohibition against an accused
being twice put in jeopardy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
extensive opinion of Justice Castro in People v. <span class="SpellE">Obsania</span>
noted earlier made reference to four Philippine decisions, People v. Diaz,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> People v. <span class="SpellE">Abaño</span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Pople</span> v.

no doubt that a dismissal of the case, though at the instance of the defendant
grounded on the disregard of his right to a speedy trial </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">tantamount to an acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In People v. Diaz, it was shown that the case
was set for hearing twice and the prosecution without asking for postponement
or giving any explanation failed to appear.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In People v. <span class="SpellE">Abaño</span>, the facts disclosed that
there were three postponements.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, at the time the resumption of the trial was scheduled, the
complaining witness as in this case was absent; this Court held that respondent
Judge was justified in dismissing the case upon motion of the defense and that
the annulment or setting aside of the order of dismissal would place the
accused twice in jeopardy of punishment for the same offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People v. Robles likewise presented a picture
of witnesses for the prosecution not being available, with the lower court
after having transferred the hearings on several occasions denying the last
plea for postponement and dismissing the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such order of dismissal, according to this Court "is not
provisional in character but one which is tantamount to acquittal that would
bar further prosecution of the accused for the same offense."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> This is a summary of the <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>
case as set forth in the above opinion of Justice Castro:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Cloribel</span></u></span><u><span style="">,</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">the case dragged for

to lend support to the reconsideration of his order of dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case is not applicable; the factual
setting is different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of
dismissal set aside in that case arose from the belief of the court that the
crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> was not committed as the liability
was civil in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At no stage then
was there a plea that the accused was denied his right to a speedy trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reconsideration was granted as there was
documentary evidence to show that the intention to defraud on the part of the
accused could be shown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under such
circumstances, this Court saw no grave abuse of discretion in the actuation of
the trial judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To repeat, the
proceeding now before this Court is any­thing but that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner not once but twice did seek to
have the prosecution for damage to property against him terminated as the
matter was pending for at least six years, the first time he sought to put an
end to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">When at
last, the trial stage was reached, the complaining witness testified on direct
examination but made no appearance when his cross-examination was to be
continued.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>A clear case of a
denial of the right to a speedy trial was thus made out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was an order of dismissal that amounted
to an acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No reconsideration
could therefore be had without offending the provision on double jeopardy.</p>
