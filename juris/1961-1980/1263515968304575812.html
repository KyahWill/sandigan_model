				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this appeal from a decision finding for the petitioner in a
mandamus suit, the appellants pose the legal issue:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Has the respondent Commissioner of Civil Service
the <span style="">power </span>and authority to
invalidate <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> the examination papers of
petitioner, cancel his eligibility (as patrolman) derived <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">therefrom</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> and eventually
terminate his services as patrolman in the Manila Police Department?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our answer is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his application for the Patrolman Examinations held by the
Civil Service Commission on <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="11">24
 November 1962</st1:date>, the petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
Tomas M. Perez, answered "yes" to question No. 6, which reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Have
you ever been accused of, indicted for or tried for the violation of any law,
ordinance, or regulation, before any court, or have you ever been charged with
or tried for any breach or infraction of military, naval, or constabulary
discipline before any military, naval, or constabulary tribunal or other
authority?"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
mentioned only two of the criminal cases of which he had been charged but
failed to mention two other cases, namely, attempted corruption of a public
official and gambling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These cases were
dismissed before he took the examinations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was thus cleared by the pertinent government offices and
law-enforcing agencies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he passed
the examinations, a character investigation and a six-month training course at
the Manila Police Academy, petitioner Perez was appointed by Mayor Antonio
Villegas of Manila as a <span class="SpellE">probational</span> patrolman of the
Manila Police Department on 27 May 1963, with a compensa­tion of P2,400 per
annum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent-appellant
Commissioner of Civil Service approved the appointment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="1">1
 January 1964</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was extended a
permanent appointment with a salary adjusted to P2<span class="GramE">,940</span>
per annum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This appointment and a
subsequent promotion in salary to P3<span class="GramE">,300</span> per annum
were also approved by the respondent Commissioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 20 October 1965, however, the Commissioner of Civil Service
addressed a letter to the City Mayor informing him of the invalidation of the
examination papers of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> because of his failure
to state the two other criminal cases of which he had been charged in his
application to take the examinations, the cancellation of his civil service
eligibility and the termination of his employment as patrolman in the Manila
Police Department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perez requested <span class="GramE">a reconsideration</span> but was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The City Mayor found no ground upon which to
proceed against Perez and did not dismiss him but respondent Commissioner
transmitted copies of his letter to the mayor to the City Treasurer and the
City Auditor who, thereafter, refused to pay the salary of Perez.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="12" month="4">12 April 1966</st1:date>,
Tomas M. Perez filed a petition for mandamus with the Court of First Instance
of Manila praying for the nullification of the order of the respondent
Commissioner of Civil Service and to compel the other <st1:place><st1:placename>respondents</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> Treasurer and City Auditor to
authorize and pay the petitioner's salary.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial based on a stipulation of facts, the lower court
granted the petition by declaring as null and void the Commissioner's order
terminating the petitioner's employment and ordering the payment of his salary.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Commissioner appealed to this Court on the point of
law stated at the beginning of this decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The situation of petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Tomas M. Perez is not unlike, and, even better than, the petitioner in the case
of <span class="SpellE">Abaya</span> <span style="">vs. </span>Villegas,
et al., L-25641, <st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="12">17 December 1966</st1:date>
(18 Sup. Ct. Rep. <span class="SpellE">Anno</span>. 1034)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Speaking</span> through Justice <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Sanchez, this Court stated in said case:</p>

<blockquote>"Two acts adverse to petitioner were done:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant Commissioner's cancellation of his
eligibility, <u>and</u> respondent Mayor's order of dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Concededly, however, there <span style="">was </span>no investigation prior to the
cancel­lation of petitioner's civil service eligibility <u>and</u> before he
was eased out of the service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, petitioner <span style="">was </span>denied
due process.''</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">On the first adverse act, this Court
said:</p>

<blockquote>"We go to the controlling principle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rule II, Article 4, of the Civil Service
Rules, in its proviso, reads:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'That when an applicant for examination <u>intention­ally</u> makes
a false statement of any material fact in his application, or practices or
attempts to practice any deception or fraud in connection with his examina­tion,
the Commissioner shall invalidate his examina­tion <u>and</u> such offense
shall be ground for his removal from the service.'</p>

<blockquote>"The accent is on the word <u>intentionally</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that petitioner made an answer which
is at war with the truth does not connote the idea that it was intentionally
made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conceivably, situations may exist
which could bring up that answer to the level of one given in good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without evidence, we are <span class="GramE">loathe</span>
to tar and feather petition­er as a perjurer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Short of an inquiry which proves that the false answer was intentionally
made, we cannot attribute thereto a meaning which would make a felon out of
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It </span>should then go without saying that the vitality of the cons­titutional
principle of due process cannot be allowed to weaken by sanctioning
cancellation of an employee's civil service eligibility and/or his dismissal
from service - without hearing - upon a <u>doubtful</u> <u>assumption</u> that
he has ad­mitted his guilt for an offense against civil service rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is pertinent here to recall that good
faith is always presumed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the context
just presented, <span style="">we </span>are constrained to state that petitioner received less than a
fair treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due process, in the end,
merely is 'the embodiment of the sporting idea of fair play'."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">And
on </span>the second adverse act, this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The constitutionally protected security of
tenure:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'<span style="">[N]o </span>officer or employee in the civil service shall be removed or
suspended except for cause as provided by law'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Section 32 of the Civil Service Law of 1959 echoes this
precept with the provision that '[N]o officer or employee in the <span style="">civil </span>service shall be removed or
suspended except for cause as provided by law and after due process.' Said
Section 32 <span style="">adds that </span>the officer
or employee complained of 'shall be en­titled to a formal investigation if he
so desires, in which case, he shall have the right to appear and defend himself
at said investigation in person or by counsel, to confront and cross-examine
the witnesses against him, and to have the attendance of witnesses and
production of documents in his favor by com­pulsory process or <u><span style="">subpoena </span></u>or <u><span style="">subpoena <span class="SpellE">duces</span> <span class="SpellE">tecum</span>.</span></u><span style="">' </span>A
civil service employee should be heard before he is condemned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jurisprudence has clung to this rule with
such <span class="SpellE">unrelentless</span> grasp that by now it would appear
trite to make citation thereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is, therefore, plain that the Commissioner of Civil Service is
without power or authority to cancel <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
or without hearing the civil service eligibility of a patrolman nor to
terminate his employment without a formal investigation.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>For the foregoing reasons</b>, the appealed decision is hereby
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
