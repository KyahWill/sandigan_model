<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1956" day="5" month="9">September 5, 1956</st1:date>,
Benito <span class="SpellE">Artuyo</span> filed, with Regional Office No. 3 of
the Department of Labor, Case No. L03-6722 thereof, against the American
International Underwriters of the Philippines, Inc. - hereafter referred to as
the Company - and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Gonzalves</span>, to recover
compensation for overtime services allegedly rendered to said defendants from
January 1950 to August 9, 1956, in addition to hospitalization expenses, and -
by amendment, made on October 13, 1956 - compensation for work done on Sundays
and other legal holidays.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1956" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1956</st1:date>, defendants moved

filed by <span class="SpellE">Artuyo</span>, on <st1:date year="1957" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1957</st1:date>, the Regional Office advised his counsel,
on <st1:date year="1957" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1957</st1:date>, to file
a formal complaint with the Hearing Section of said Office.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">Artuyo</span></span></span><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style=""> did so, on </span></span><st1:date year="1958" day="24" month="4"><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">April 24, 1958</span></span></st1:date><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">, his formal

 14, 1959</span></span></st1:date><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">, reversed said order and remanded the case
to the Regional Office for further proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The defendants appealed, however, to the Court of First Instance of
Manila, in which the appeal was docketed as Civil Case No. 40544.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the </span></span>hearing thereof, on
September 26, 1960, while <span class="SpellE">Artuyo</span> was introducing
evidence on his services from January 1950 to August 1956, counsel for the
Company objected thereto, invoking Section 7-A of Commonwealth Act No. 444,
pursuant to which, actions under said Act, as amended by Republic Act No. 1993,
shall be barred unless commenced within three (3) years after accrual of the
cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The objection was
sustained and <span class="SpellE">Artuyo</span> was not allowed to present
evidence, except for services rendered within three (3) years before the filing
of the complaint, on <st1:date year="1958" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for the reconsideration of the order
to this effect was denied on <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="1">January
 17, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A second motion
for re­consideration of <span class="SpellE">Artuyo</span> had, on <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1961</st1:date>, the same fate.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">Accordingly,
<span class="SpellE">Artuyo</span> filed with the Supreme Court a petition
docketed as Case G. R. No. L-19505, for a writ of <i style="">certiorari</i> and <i style="">mandamus</i>,
to set aside the orders of the Court of First Instance dated </span></span><st1:date year="1960" day="26" month="9"><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">September 26, 1960</span></span></st1:date><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style=""> and January 17,

Court of Appeals, where it was docketed as CA-G.R.

overtime compensation beginning from January 1950.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants sought a review of said judgment
by this Court (G. R.

denied the petition for review, for lack of merit.</span></span></span><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Back to the court of first instance, pursuant to the decision of
the Court of Appeals, on November 29, 1963, the former court dismissed Civil
Case No. 40544, for want of appellate jurisdiction over the case, upon the
ground that the Labor Standards Commission and the Regional Office had no
original jurisdiction to hear Case No. 1307, under our ruling in <span class="SpellE">Corominas</span> v. Labor Standards Commission.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, on <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1964</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Artuyo</span> filed, with the court of first instance, the
complaint in the pre­sent action, which was docketed as Civil Case No.
56254.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1964</st1:date>, defendants moved to dismiss the
complaint, upon the ground of lack of cause of action, against <span class="SpellE">Gonzalves</span>, and of prescription, as regards the
Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion having been denied,
on <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1964</st1:date>, the
defendants filed their answer on <st1:date year="1964" day="24" month="4">April
 24, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, or
on <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="8">August 12, 1965</st1:date>, the
defendants moved for <span class="GramE">a reconsideration</span> of the order of
<st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1964</st1:date>, which the
trial court granted, on <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="9">September 25,
 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal, in
which <span class="SpellE">Artuyo</span> maintains that the lower court
erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in not holding that its order
of dismissal dated April 15, 1964 had become final, long before the defendants
had moved for its reconsideration, on August 12, 1965; (2) in finding that <span class="SpellE">Artuyo</span> had no cause of action against <span class="SpellE">Gonzalves</span>;
and (3) in holding that the cause of action against the Company is barred by
the statute of limitations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first contention is manifestly devoid of merit, for the order
of April 15, 1964, denying defendants' motion for reconsideration, is
interlocutory in nature<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and, not being <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>, independently of the
decision on the merits, which has not been rendered, as yet, could not and has
not become final.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">As
regards the second issue, it is worthy of notice that, al­though plaintiff's
complaint alleges that <span class="SpellE">Gonzalves</span> had engaged his
services acting as agent or representative of the Company, of which he is its
Vice-President, the answer filed by <span class="SpellE">Gonzalves</span> avers
that the services of <span class="SpellE">Artuyo</span> were engaged by him in
his <u>personal</u> capacity, from January 15, 1950 to December 1950; that </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">in </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">January 1951, <span class="SpellE">Artuyo</span> was employed by the
Company as its driver, although in April 1951, there was a change in the policy
of the Company, pursuant to which drivers ceased to be its employees and
reverted to their former status as domestic drivers; that, while <span class="SpellE">Artuyo</span> was such domestic driver, he drove for local of­ficials
of the Company and other officials thereof who came on periodic visits to the
Philippines; that <span class="SpellE">Artuyo</span> received a Christ­mas gift,
in money, from the Company and that he had, more</span></span>over, been
allowed to join the Company employees in their group, insurance policy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, although under his complaint <span class="SpellE">Artuyo</span>
might have no cause of action against <span class="SpellE">Gonzalves</span>, the
latter's own answer indi­cates the contrary. In fact, said answer suggests that
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Artuyo</span></span></span><span class="GramE"><span style="">' </span>s</span> status as
a driver was rather peculiar, <span style="">in </span>that,
although he was, at given times, a domestic driver of <span class="SpellE">Gonzalves</span>,
he, likewise, drove other officials of the Company, received a Christmas bonus <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> and participated in the group insurance of its
employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances, it
is understandable, that he sued both as alternative defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it is not indubitable from
the record that <span class="SpellE">Artuyo</span> has no cause of action against
<span class="SpellE">Gonzal­ves</span>, so that the lower court should have
denied the motion to dismiss, insofar as <span class="SpellE">Gonzalves</span> is
concerned, without prejudice to passing upon the existence or inexistence of a
cause of action against the latter in the decision that may, in due course, be
rendered on the merits.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the third issue, the lower court found that <span class="SpellE">Artuyo's</span> action against the Company is barred by the
statute of limitations, more than three (3) years having elapsed from <st1:date year="1956" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1956</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1964</st1:date>, when the present case was
instituted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted, however,
that the first complaint against the defendants, or Case No. L03-6722 of
Regional Office No. <span class="GramE">3,</span> was filed by <span class="SpellE">Artuyo</span> as early as <st1:date year="1956" day="5" month="9">September
 5, 1956</st1:date>, or less than a month after his services to the defendants
had ceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the proceedings in
connection therewith, seemingly, ended sometime in 1957, when the Regional
Office advised <span class="SpellE">Artuyo's</span> counsel to file a formal
complaint with the Hearing Section of said Office, such complaint was filed on
April 24, 1958 and docketed as Case No. 1307 of the Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As above indicated, the defendants appealed
this case to the court of first instance - where it was docketed as Civil Case
No. 40544 - whose action was the object of a petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> and <i style="">mandamus</i>
with the Supreme Court; the latter certified the case to the Court of Appeals,
which decided it on September 29, 1962, in favor of <span class="SpellE">Artuyo</span>;
and defendants' petition for review of said decision of the Court of Appeals
was denied by the Supreme Court on August 23, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Civil Case No. 40544 was, however, dismissed
by the Court of First Instance of Manila, on November 29, 1963, upon the ground
that it had acquired no appellate jurisdiction over <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Artuyo</span></span><span class="GramE">' s</span> claim, the Labor
Standards Commission and the Regional Office having been without original
jurisdiction to hear <span class="SpellE">Artuyo's</span> claim in Case No. 1307
of said office, according to the decision of this Court in the <span class="SpellE">Corominas</span> case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
early as <st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1961</st1:date>,
<span class="GramE">We</span> have, however, held<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
that the filing of the claim with the Regional Office had the effect of
interrupting the prescriptive period embodied in Republic Act No. 1993, even if
said Office had subsequently been held to be without original jurisdiction over
said claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This doctrine was reiterated
in 1962,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Deducting the period from <st1:date year="1956" day="5" month="9">September
 5, 1956</st1:date> to March 1957, when the proceedings relative to Case No.
