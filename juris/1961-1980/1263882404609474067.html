denying a petition for review based on the indisputable evidence of record
renders evident why this <i>certiorari</i> proceeding intended to secure the
reinstatement as Commercial <span class="SpellE">Attache</span> of petitioner
Marcela M. <span class="SpellE">Baldoz</span> is doomed from the start, the
safeguard accorded by the Constitution to a civil service officer or employee
being unavailing.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
It reads thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"This case, has been
the subject of three decisions of this Office."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">She formerly occupied such position, her assignment being in <st1:place><st1:city>Berne</st1:city>,
 <st1:country-region>Switzerland</st1:country-region></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Formal charges were filed against her on
April 22, 1971 for insubordination and for violation of office regulations,
more specifically, for going on home leave without the approval of the then
Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Industry, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Maceda</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
After being duly investigated by a special committee, she was found guilty of
the charges and ordered dismissed effective <st1:date year="1971" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1971</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
As the penalty imposed was removal, her case was elevated to the Civil Service
Commission, the then Civil Service Commissioner concluding that the penalty
should be reduced to a fine equivalent to ten days' pay.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
There was a request for reconsideration filed by Secretary <span class="SpellE">Maceda</span>,
favorably acted upon by the Commissioner of Civil Service, who modified his
decision to the effect that petitioner was required to seek transfer to another
office within a period of not less than ninety days, otherwise she would be
considered resigned from the office.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
There was a further modification of such a decision by the Commissioner of
Civil Service in view of a plea for reconsideration by the petitioner herself.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision of the then
Acting Commissioner of Civil Service reads thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Wherefore, the penalty requiring her to
transfer to another office within a period of not less than 90 days otherwise
she will be considered resigned is hereby modified in the sense that in case
she is unable to seek transfer after the prescribed 90-day period, she shall be
considered resigned without prejudice to her subsequent re-instatement to
another position in the same Department at the discretion of the appointing
authority."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It was at that stage, on <st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1973</st1:date>,
that petitioner appealed to the Office of the President.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
On November 5, 1973, respondent <span class="SpellE">Ronaldo</span> B. Zamora,
then Assistant Executive Secretary, ruled on her case as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"After a careful consideration of the
case and pursuant to the recommendation of the Acting Commissioner of Civil
Service and the provision of Section 37 of Republic Act No. 2260, as amended,
you are hereby granted executive clemency in the sense that you may be
reinstated to your former position as Commercial <span class="SpellE">Attache</span>,
Department of Trade, at the discretion of the appointing authority and subject
to Civil Service law and rules."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, there was a request for reinstatement in the then Department of
Trade and Tourism which could not be granted by the then Secretary <span class="SpellE">Troadio</span> T. <span class="SpellE">Quiazon</span>, Jr., not only
in view of the abolition of her item under the reorganization staffing pattern
of the Bureau of Foreign Trade, but also on account of her lack of appropriate
civil service eligibility for the position.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, the matter was taken to the Office of the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was likewise respondent <st1:city><st1:place>Zamora</st1:place></st1:city>,
still as Assistant Executive Secretary, who, in a communication to her dated <st1:date year="1974" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1974</st1:date>, informed her that
the Acting Secretary possessed discretion as appointing authority whether or
not to retain, her in the service. It was therein further stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"For the commutation or removal by the
President of the administrative penalties or disabilities does not entitle the
recipient thereof to automatic reinstatement in the service or payment of his
back salaries inasmuch as in filing the corresponding petition for clemency in
accordance with Section 37 of the Civil Service Law (Rep. Act No. 2260, as
amended by Rep. Act No. 6040), the petitioner is deemed to have admitted his
guilt."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner was anything if not persistent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were subsequent letters by her dated <st1:date year="1974" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1974</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1975" day="8" month="4">April
 8, 1975</st1:date>, but her pleas were to no avail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As set forth in the letter of the then Deputy
Executive Secretary Roberto V. Reyes:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"In this connection, I wish to inform you that after another
searching restudy of the case, this Office fails to view your petition as being
impressed with merit to warrant a departure from the adverse finding of the
Acting Secretary of Trade that you lack the corresponding appropriate civil
service eligibility as well as the previous determination of this Office that
the matter of your reappointment to your former position is essentially
discretionary with the appointing authority, your having been granted executive
clemency on November 25, 1973, notwithstanding."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><b>
</b>It was at that stage that petitioner, undeterred and intransigent, filed
anew on March 17, 1976 an urgent motion for review<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
leading to the decision of August 9, 1976, the subject of this <i>certiorari</i>
proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY">The aforesaid denial of the last petition for review explained
clearly why respondent Presidential Assistant Zamora had no choice on the
matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The petition raises several issues
relative to the proceedings conducted and the decisions rendered in
petitioner's case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These issues are,
however, rendered moot and academic by an affirmative answer to the issue:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether the letter-decision dated <st1:date year="1973" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1973</st1:date>, of this Office was
responsive to petitioner's letter-petition dated <st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1973</st1:date>."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came this portion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is
alleged that petitioner's letter of <st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="7">July
 10, 1973</st1:date>, was misconstrued and that the executive clemency granted
her in this Office's letter decision of <st1:date year="1973" day="5" month="11">November
 5, 1973</st1:date>, 'is a patent nullity.' Quite simple and plain is the
language of said petitioner's letter in question to have escaped the human
comprehension of this Office. With the citation and quotation in said letter of
the very provisions of the law upon which she asked this Office to act - and
upon which the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> letter-decision of November
5, 1973 was based this Office could not have missed or misconstrued the true
import and substance of petitioner's letter in question."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent <st1:city><st1:place>Zamora</st1:place></st1:city> did consider all
the points raised by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
continued:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is, however, claimed
that petitioner is 'unschooled in law' and that her real intention in the
letter was 'not to ask for mercy to commute or remove (her) penalty' but to
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wording of the law cited and
quoted in her letter in question are quite so simple and plain that even one
who is 'unschooled in law' can readily comprehend their meaning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner claims to be a holder of a
master's degree obtained at the world-renowned <st1:place><st1:city>New York
  University</st1:city>, <st1:country-region>U.S.A.</st1:country-region></st1:place>,
and to have been a professor and lecturer at various prestigious universities
and colleges in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With such prestigious educational background,
petitioner could not have missed or failed to comprehend the import or meaning
of the simply-worded provisions of the law under which she sought protection
and benefit."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Further on this point:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"This becomes more significant in the light of the fact that, after
receiving the letter-decision of this Office dated <st1:date year="1973" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1973</st1:date>, granting her executive clemency, she
tried to enforce the qualified directive therein relative to her reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had her intention in her questioned letter of
<st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1973</st1:date>, been
contrary to what had been granted her in said letter-decision of <st1:date year="1973" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1973</st1:date>, she would have come
back to this Office to question the same, instead of attempting or trying first
to enforce or implement the qualified directive in said executive
clemency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But she came back to this
Office only after the non-enforcement by the appointing authority of such
qualified directive in the executive clemency - that is, only after she was
denied reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact
eloquently evidences her unqualified acceptance of the executive clemency
granted her under this Office's letter-decision dated <st1:date year="1973" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1973</st1:date>, and is, undoubtedly, expressive
of the responsiveness of said letter-decision to petitioner's letter-petition
dated <st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can be assumed then, without fear of
contradiction, that petitioner came to entertain this theory of misconstruction
only after she failed to enforce the qualified directive in the executive
clemency granted her, and not before the receipt thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This change of position or theory is,
however, understandable."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Lastly, came its <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reads as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In view of the foregoing, the instant
petition for review should be, as it is hereby, denied for lack of merit."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent proceedings speak for themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their import is not susceptible to any
misinterpretation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner has not
shown any justification for the exercise of our <i>certiorari</i> jurisdiction.
There was no violation of the due process guarantee, whether in its procedural
or substantive aspects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of
respondent Presidential Assistant Zamora has not thus been successfully
assailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it was stressed vigorously
in the comment, considered as the answer, of the then Acting Solicitor General,
now Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals, Hugo E. Gutierrez, Jr.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
To repeat, this petition must fail.</p>

<blockquote>1. There is persuasiveness in this excerpt from the comment of the
Acting Solicitor General to the effect that petitioner was accorded procedural
due process:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"At any rate,
petitioner had been heard in her defense by the Special Committee that
investigated the charges against her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She had availed herself of her right to ventilate her side when she
filed a petition for reconsideration * * * of the decision of the Commissioner
of Service requiring her to seek transfer to another office within 90 days * *
*. Indeed, pursuant to her said petition, the decision was modified in the
sense that in the event she is unable to seek transfer, she shall be considered
resigned without prejudice to subsequent reinstatement to another position in
the Department of Commerce and Industry at the discretion of the appointing
authority."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
In the recent decision of Reyes v. <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
reference was made to the leading case of <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> v.
Romero.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
The doctrine announced in that case, interpreting the provision found both in
the 1935 and the present Constitutions as to removal or suspension being only
for cause, was to the effect that "there must first be an investigation at
which he must be given a fair hearing and an opportunity to defend
himself."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
So it has been since then, Reyes v. <span class="SpellE">Subido</span> being the
last in an impressive number of adjudications notable for their unanimity.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2. Neither could it be plausibly maintained that there was a denial
of substantive due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even a
cursory reading of the annexes to her petition leads to no other conclusion
except that the various government agencies which acted on the controversy were
guided solely by what the law prescribes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the facts as duly established, to which attention was called in the
various orders and decisions, which petitioner would have this Court examine
anew, it is indisputable that the conclusions arrived at could not be
susceptible to the reproach of unfairness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reasons on which they were based were clearly specified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no iota of evidence that would serve
to indict the Office of the President of lack of judicious appraisal of all the
questions raised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There could be no imputation
then of arbitrariness or caprice, which could be the proper basis of denial of
substantive due process.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>3. There is this further consideration which, as noted in the
comment, militated against her claim to reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The position which she would like to occupy
anew was abolished. Under the circumstances, her plea certainly cannot be
granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be an undue
interference with the discretion vested in the executive department if on a
petition such as this, even on the assumption that the decision arrived at in
an administrative case for disciplinary action was tainted with arbitrariness,
not only would there be a finding by this Court of an existence of an infirmity
but also would further direct that petitioner be reinstated to an office no
longer in existence. That is not the holding in <span class="SpellE">Bendanillo</span>,
Sr. v. Provincial Governor.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>As set forth in the opinion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The law on abolition of positions is
well-settled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It gives rise to no doubt.
It is notable for its clarity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
petitioner, it is an insurmountable obstacle."<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
Reference was then made to <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Quitoriano</span>, a 1954 decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
with the then Justice, later Chief Justice, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
as the <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The pretense cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To begin with, petitioner has never been Commissioner of the National
Employment Service and, hence, he could not have been, and has not been removed
<span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, to remove an officer is to oust him from office before the
expiration of his term.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A removal
implies that the office exists after the ouster.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * Accordingly, the constitutional mandate
to the effect that 'no officer or employee in the civil service shall be
removed or suspended except for cause as provided by law' (Art. XII, Sec. 4,
Phil. Const.), is not in point, for there has been neither a removal nor a
suspension of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>, but an abolition
of his former office of Director of the Placement Bureau, which, admittedly, is
within the power of Congress to undertake by legislation."<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
Then there is Cruz v. <span class="SpellE">Primcias</span>, Jr.,<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
where Justice J. B. L. Reyes, speaking for the Court, reiterated the <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span> doctrine and noted the exception thereto, which is
the absence of good faith, in this wise:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>' "We find in this point, urged by respondents, to be without
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No removal or separation of
petitioners from the service is here involved, but the validity of the
abolition of their offices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * As
well-settled as the rule that the abolition of an office does not amount to an
illegal removal of its incumbent is the principle that, in order to be valid,
the abolition must be made in good faith. Where the abolition is made in bad
faith, for political or personal reasons, or in order to circumvent the
constitutional security of tenure of civil service employees, it is null and
void * * *.' Since it is evident from the records of the case that there is no
showing of bad faith and that the step taken by the Provincial Board is a clear
indication of its decision to abolish the position of petitioner, what was done
by the lower court is free from any legal infirmity."<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
As in Cruz v. <span class="SpellE">Primicias</span>, so in this case, there was
no finding of bad faith as to the abolition of the position in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is precisely then in accordance with
settled legal norms that no judicial remedy is available to petitioner, however
much her valiant but losing struggle to hold on to her former position may
elicit a degree of sympathy. There is comfort in the thought that with her
conceded educational qualifications, she would be able to obtain an employment
where her talents may be put to good use.</blockquote>
