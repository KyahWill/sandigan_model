				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">It was the failure of respondent Deputy Minister of Labor <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span> to grant <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, although sustaining a decision of the National
Labor Relations Commission for reinstatement of petitioners Benjamin Cuevas and
Carlos Enriquez to their employment in respondent <span class="SpellE">Allenco</span>
Steel Corporation, that gave rise to this <i>certiorari</i> proceeding.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
It is to the credit of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Genconsu</span> Free
Workers Union that it has not ceased in its efforts to remedy what it considers
an injustice done to its members, the aforesaid Cuevas and Enriquez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim is made that the order of <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> was tainted with unfairness, sufficing to
justify an invocation of the substantive due process guarantee, respondent firm
having been found guilty of an unfair labor practice by the labor arbitrator.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It must be admitted that the National Labor Relations Commission acted within
its competence in holding that there was no unfair labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to its decision, the circumstances
that gave rise to this controversy started when "complainant Cuevas was
advised that he will be transferred to the Scrap Yard Section (<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>., pages 12 and 13, December 21, 1973).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was given one week's time to inform
respondent whether or not he would accept the new job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because complainant did not return,
respondent was constrained to file an application for clearance to terminate
his services on <st1:date year="1973" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1973</st1:date>
on the ground of abandonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
immediate filing of the opposition to the clearance application and his
insistence to return to work clearly show that he did not abandon his job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, we believe that the complainant must
have been given more time to ponder on whether to accept the new job, for the
one-week time given to him to report was too short considering that the position
being offered is a new job for him."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner Enriquez, on the other hand, according to such decision, "was
then on sick leave when respondent sent letters of recall to the laid-off
workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was not dismissed and, in
fact, management even endorsed his claim for sickness benefit to the Social
Security System.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not find
sufficient evidence to show that respondent had committed discriminatory acts
against the union members, much less the herein complainants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of the workers were laid off when the
respondent's plant stopped its operations in the melting plant and rolling
mills and all were recalled upon the resumption of the operations."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
It granted reinstatement but without <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were some loose ends in such decision
which respondent Deputy Minister of Labor could have clarified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was, instead, a terse three-paragraph
order of <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On its face, it gives rise to doubts of possible injustice, which bears
careful scrutiny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After setting forth
that there was "no sufficient evidence to indicate that [private respondent]
has committed discriminatory acts" against Cuevas and Enriquez and that
"there was actually no dismissal," it characterized the failure of
complainant "to immediately report for work after the resumption of
respondent's operation, [as] a result of misunderstanding or misapprehension by
the parties of the true facts and circumstances then obtaining."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to petitioner Enriquez, the facts as found justify the
conclusion that no <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> need be paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could not have reported earlier as he was
on sick leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to petitioner Cuevas,
however, the appraisal of the situation both by the National Labor Relations
Commission and the Deputy Minister of Labor lacks precision, giving rise to an
ambiguity that lends plausibility to a proceeding of this character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The loss of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
could be too harsh a penalty, considering that as was admitted in the affirmed
decision, he should "have been given more time to ponder on whether to
accept the new job, for the one-week time given to him to report was too short
* * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
As there are matters that still need to be clarified, equity calls for a remand
of his claim to the National Labor Relations Commission for an ascertainment in
greater detail of the circumstances that resulted in his failure to report to
work.</p>

<p class="BODY"><i>Certiorari</i> to that extent lies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we rule.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->There is no occasion to pass upon the allegation
in the petition that certain discriminatory acts, anti-union in character,
could be attributed to private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Deputy Minister of Labor and the National Labor Relations
Commission absolved it from such a charge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is a finding of fact to which deference must be paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That norm has invariably been followed by
this Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The failing of both the National Labor Relations
Commission and respondent Deputy Minister of Labor with reference to petitioner
Cuevas certainly cannot be characterized as a clear denial of substantive due
process in the sense of its having "outrun the bounds of reason and result[ed]
in sheer oppression."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
(It cannot be denied, however, that the loss of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
under the circumstances disclosed may be unfair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There does not appear of record the necessary
facts that would justify such a result.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To repeat, there is an element of ambiguity in the decision of the
National Labor Relations Commission and the order of respondent Deputy Minister
of Labor that must be resolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
cannot be denied either that both the Commission and respondent official did
not give full approval to what was done by private respondent <span class="SpellE">Allenco</span> Steel Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is to that extent, therefore, an element of unfairness if at this
stage it would be categorically declared that petitioner Cuevas was not
entitled to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If we do not squarely rule on the matter now,
it is because of the paucity of the facts of record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is for that reason that we order a remand
to the National Labor Relations Commission to determine with more precision the
aforesaid circumstances, more specifically the length of time he did not report
for work and the justification, if any, for such refusal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It only remains to be added that as stated in
<span class="SpellE">Almira</span> v. B.F. Goodrich <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
"labor law determinations, to quote from <span class="SpellE">Bultmann</span>,
should be not only <span class="SpellE"><u>secundum</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>rationem</u></span> but also <span class="SpellE"><u>secundum</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>caritatem</u></span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the assailed order of respondent Deputy
Minister of Labor is affirmed as to the denial of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
to petitioner Enriquez but modified in the sense that the case is remanded to
the National Labor Relations Commission for the determination with greater
detail of circumstances that resulted in the failure of petitioner Cuevas to
report for work and for it thereafter to rule on whether or not <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> should be granted petitioner Cuevas.</p>
