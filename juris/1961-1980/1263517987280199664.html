				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal taken by <span class="SpellE">Rizalino</span> Sosa, Antonia
Sosa de Rivera and Abraham <span class="SpellE">Salva</span> from three orders of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span> in Civil
Case No. 1166:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the first dismissed the
complaint they had filed against Domingo Yu <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> and
Yu <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> Investment Corporation, and the second and
third denied their motions for reconsideration and for new trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1959</st1:date>,
appellants filed the complaint mentioned above to recover from <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> the ownership and possession of one-half of the
land described therein or its value, to compel them to render an accounting of
the fruits and other benefits received by them, and to pay attorney's fees and
costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint alleged that the
spouses <span class="SpellE">Casto</span> Sosa and <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Soleta</span> de Sosa were the owners of a parcel of coconut
land situated in barrio <span class="SpellE">Dawis</span>, Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Gasan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span>, contain­ing an
area of approximately 42,147 square meters; that upon the death of <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span> <span class="SpellE">Soleta</span> de Sosa in 1927,
her children (appellants <span class="SpellE">Rizalino</span> Sosa and Antonia
Sosa de Rivera) and grandson by her deceased daughter, Maria Sosa de <span class="SpellE">Salva</span>, (appellant Abraham <span class="SpellE">Salva</span>),
as sole heirs, in­herited her one-half share of the land aforesaid; that on
November 15, 1928, <span class="SpellE">Casto</span> Sosa executed a deed of sale
with <span class="SpellE">pacto</span> de retro over the entire land in favor of
appellant Domingo Yu <span class="SpellE">Chu</span>, both parties having full
knowledge and information of the rights and interests of appellants therein;
that said <span class="SpellE">pacto</span> de retro sale was registered in the
Office of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span> on June
22, 1929; that thereafter appellant Yu <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> took
possession of the entire land, reaping the fruits thereof until 1958 when he
sold the same to co-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Yu <span class="SpellE">Chu</span>
Investment Corporation, a private corporation owned and controlled by him, both
parties also with knowledge of the defect in the title of the vendor as to
one-half of the land; that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> corporation had
since then been in possession of the land, enjoying its fruits and, despite
repeated demands made by appellants, read refused to deliver <span class="GramE">one-half</span>
of the land and its fruits to them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> filed their answer alleging, among other things,
that the whole land in question was purchased in 1928 by Yu <span class="SpellE">Chu</span>
from the then ex­clusive owner and possessor, <span class="SpellE">Casto</span>
Sosa; that Yu <span class="SpellE">Chu</span>, in turn, sold the land to Yu <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> Investment Corporation, an innocent purchaser for
value, in whose name the property was titled afterwards.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was set for trial on <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1962</st1:date>, but on the 10th of the same month
appellants moved for the post­ponement of the trial to another date, preferably
between December 20 and <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="12">December 31,
 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Granting said motion,
the court reset the date of trial for <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="12">December
 20, 1962</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 a.m.</st1:time>, on
which date the court issued the following order:</p>

<blockquote>"When this case was called for trial, one of the plaintiffs
appeared without their lawyer and informed the Court that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Pe</span>, plaintiff's
counsel, could not appear today as per telegram which said plaintiff showed to
the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the telegram,
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pe</span> could not appear because it was only yester­day
that he received the notice of hearing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said lawyer did not even inform the Court that he was not coming and did
not even take the trouble of requesting for the postpone­ment of the hearing of
this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The de­fendants, on the other
hand, appeared with their lawyer, Atty. Ernesto R. <span class="SpellE">Rondolo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court asked the said plaintiff who was
then present if he could present their evidence without their lawyer and he
answered in the negative, so the hearing of this case could not take
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the inability of the
plaintiffs to present their evidence, the defense counsel prayed for the
dismissal of the case for non-suit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Finding the pe­tition of the defendants to be well-founded and
meritorious, plaintiff's complaint is hereby ordered dismissed with costs
against the said plaintiffs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"IT IS SO ORDERED.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Boac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span>,
<st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1962</st1:date>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Notice of the above order of dismissal was received by appellants
on <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the 16th of the same month they filed a
motion for reconsideration thereof and prayed that the case be reset for trial,
preferably on three successive days in April or May 1963, claiming that the
failure of their counsel to appear on the date set for the trial was due to his
having received the notice there­fore, in Manila, only the day before the
trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellees</span>
filed their opposition and on January 23 of the same year the court denied the
motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having
received notice of this order of denial, appellants, eight days later, filed a
verified motion for new trial, reiterat­ing that the non-appearance of their
attorney of record on the date set for the trial was due to accident, mistake
or excusable negligence; that said attorney received the notice of trial only on
December 19, 1962, that is, only one day before the date set for said trial
(December 20, 1962); that with only one day notice, it was physically
impossible for their attorney of record, who was residing and had his law
office in Manila, to be physically present on the date set for the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for new trial was supported with
Annex A, an affidavit of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Pe</span>, appellants' attorney of record, to prove the accident,
mistake or excusable negligence relied upon as ground for new trial, and Annex
B, an affidavit of the same attorney which, in part, stated the following:</p>

<blockquote>"1<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That</span> I am the counsel for the plain­tiffs in Civil Case No. 1166
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span>,
entitled <span class="SpellE">Rizalino</span> Sosa, et al. vs. Domingo Yu <span class="SpellE">Chu</span>, et. <span class="GramE">al</span>.;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;

supports the allegations and claims of my clients, the plaintiffs in the said
case, as set forth in their complaint;</blockquote>

in the name of '<span class="SpellE">Casto</span> Sosa married to <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span> <span class="SpellE">Soleta</span>' an owner
appearing thereon.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Certificate,
when considered jointly with the records of the land registration case pursuant
to which it was issued, shows that the land was acquired as conjugal property
and registered as such on Sept. 5, 1918 or during the marriage of <span class="SpellE">Casto</span> Sosa and <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span> <span class="SpellE">Soleta</span>, even as the term 'mar­ried' to written on the title
has been interpreted by our courts to mean that the land is conjugal property.</p>

showing that they are the children and grandchild of the marriage of <span class="SpellE">Casto</span> Sosa and <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span> <span class="SpellE">Soleta</span>, and hence their lawful heirs, and the lawful heirs
of each of them.</span></p>

<p class="2Q">'(e) Death Certificate of <span class="SpellE">Vic­torina</span> <span class="SpellE">Soleta</span>, showing that she died on February 22, 1927, the
date when her conjugal share in the land descend­ed to her lawful heirs by
intestate succession, that is, to her children and grandchild, namely, the
plaintiffs.</p>

<p class="2Q">'(f) Deed of Sale with <span class="SpellE">Pacto</span> de Retro

after the death of <span class="SpellE">Victo­rina</span> <span class="SpellE">Soleta</span>,
which deed is a sale of the entire land covered by Original Certificate of
Title No. 656.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This deed when considered
together with the certificate of Title, shows that the defendant Domingo Yu <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> acquired the land in bad faith, at least with res­pect
to the share of the plaintiffs therein, as he knew of the plaintiffs share
which <span class="SpellE">Casto</span> Sosa and Isabel Sosa had no right to sell
or convey.'</p>

<p class="2Q">'(<span class="GramE">a</span>) It is registered land which under the
law cannot be acquired by him by prescription;</p>

faith; and</p>

</span>That</span> I am executing this affidavit of merits in order to obtain a
new trial of the abovementioned case by the setting aside of the Court's order
of December 20 which dismissed plaintiffs' complaint for non-suit due to
accident or excusable negligence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellants objected to the motion for new trial and on <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1963</st1:date> the Court denied the
same for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
appellants perfected their appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the facts set forth above, <span class="GramE">We</span> find
the appeal to be meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not denied that the notice setting the case for trial on <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1962</st1:date> was received by
appellants' counsel only one day before that date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that said counsel was a resident
of and had his law office in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
at the time, it was almost physically impossible for him to appear at said
trial before the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
instead of sending a telegram addressed to the court regarding the service of
the notice of trial on him only one day before the date set <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
he sent the telegram to one of his clients, is not fatal to appellants' case,
it appearing that the addressee received the telegram and submitted it to the
court when the case was called for trial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The contents thereof not having been sufficiently contradicted, there
was enough reason for the court to postpone the trial and reset it for another
date instead of dismissing the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the denial of their motion for reconsideration but within
the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, appellants filed a motion
for new trial duly supported with an affidavit to prove the grounds relied upon
and another affidavit showing upon its face that appellants had indubitable
documents showing that the property which they sought to recover from <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> was the share of <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Soleta</span> de Sosa in a bigger parcel which she and her
husband, <span class="SpellE">Casto</span> Sosa, had acquired during their
marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this is so, the sale of the
entire parcel by <span class="SpellE">Casto</span> Sosa and his second wife in
favor of appellant Yu <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> was void as far as the
share of Sosa's first wife was concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court evidently erred in denying said motion for new trial.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the orders appealed from are set aside and the
present case is remanded below for trial on the merits, all over again.</p>
