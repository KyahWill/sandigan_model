				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an automatic review of the decision of the Court of First
Instance of Leyte sentencing the appellants-reviewees to suffer the penalty of
DEATH for the special complex crime of robbery in band with double homicide,
with frustrated homi­cide, less serious physical injuries and direct assault
upon agents of persons in authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">The information<span style="">&nbsp; </span>field with
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> charged nine persons of the offense, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gorgo­nio Ubaldo, Valentin Superable,
Norberto Lumpay, Alfonso Hembra, Severo Caigoy, Vicente <span style="">Calabia, Crispin </span>Villablanca, Jr., and <span class="GramE">brothers</span>
Antonio <span style="">Pacli </span>and Benjamin
Pacli.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the pendency of the case,
however, accused Gorgonio Ubaldo succumbed from <span style="">the </span>gunshot wounds sustained by him during and on the occasion
of the robbery; accused Norberto Lumpay <span style="">was
</span>shot to death on his second attempt to escape from confinement <span style="">in </span>the provincial jail where he was
de­tained while the trial of the case was in progress; while accused Alfonso
Hembra <span style="">was </span>later discharged from
the information to become state witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, trial proceeded with respect only to the remaining
six accused, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Valentin Super­able,
Severe Caigoy @ Beroy, Vicente Calabia, Cris­pin <span style="">Villablanca, </span>Jr. @ Pengpeng, and the brothers Antonio Pacli and
Benjamin Pacli.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due trial, on <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1962</st1:date>, the trial court
found each and everyone of the accused:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x guilty of the crime of robbery in band with double homi­cide,
frustrated homicide and less serious physical injuries and direct assault upon
agents of per­sons in authority, and sentences each and everyone of them to
suffer the penalty of DEATH, indemnify the heirs of the two deceased, Co Cui
Hui and Margarito Cotoner, jointly and severally, in the amount of P5,000.00
each, indemnify Eng Wan the amount of P250.00, the value of the things robbed,
without subsi­diary imprisonment in case of in­solvency, and to pay the propor­tional
costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Crispin Villablanca, Jr. <span style="">has
</span>appealed from the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
other accused are represented by counsel de officio for purposes of this review
of <span style="">this </span>Court by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our own examination of the record revealed <span style="">that </span>of the seven witnesses for the
prosecution, only Alfonso Hembra, Marci<span style="">al
Glore </span>and Jorge Co had direct and personal knowledge of the facts attend­ing
the commission of the robbery-killings in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alfonso Hembra was originally one of these
charged in the information, but was later discharged to become state witness;
Marcial Glore was then a policeman in the municipality of Tunga, Leyte, who, in
the perfor­mance of his duties, sutained gunshot wounds on the occasion of the
robbery; while Jorge Go was a member of the family whose store was robbed on
the night of April 24, 1958.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears
indubitable in the record also, that immediately after the <span class="GramE">robbery,</span>
two lifeless bodies were left at the scene of the crime - those of Co Cui Hui
(mother of Jorge Go) and policeman Margarito Cotoner of Tunga.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A review of the evidence
for the prosecution shows that at about </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="13"><span style="">1:00 o'clock</span></st1:time><span style=""> in the afternoon of </span><st1:date year="1958" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1958</st1:date>, a market day, accused
<span style="">turned state wit­ness Alfonso Hembra
left his house in Jaro, </span><st1:place><span style="">Leyte</span></st1:place><span style="">, and went to the cockpit of the adjoining </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">municipality</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> of </span><st1:placename><span style="">Tunga</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style=""> to see the cockfights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After staying there for about two hours, he
left the cockpit and passed by the house of his friend, accused Antonio Pacli,
located in the said </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">municipality</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> of </span><st1:placename><span style="">Tunga</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="">, </span><st1:place><span style="">Leyte</span></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There he found also the other accused -
Benjamin Pacli, Norberto Lumpay, Severo Caigoy, Gorgonio Ubaldo, Vicente
Calabia, Valentin Superable and Crispin Villablanca, Jr. - drink­ing <u>tuba</u>;
and, he joined them in the "<u>toma</u>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In the course of their
drinking spree, at about </span></span><st1:time minute="0" hour="17"><span class="GramE"><span style="">5:00 o'clock</span></span></st1:time><span class="GramE"><span style=""> in the afternoon, accused
Antonio Pacli proposed to the group that they rob Eng Wan, owner of a store
located along the provincial road.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the proposition, all the
members of the group agreed, signifying their assent and concurrence to the
plan with the words "go ahead".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then and there, they made preparations to execute the robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonio Pacli went to the back of his house
and soon returned with several firearms which he dis­</span>tributed among the <span style="">members of the group.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He gave a carbine to </span><span style="">Lumpay, another
carbine to Superable, a Thompson to Villablanca </span>a <span style="">.38 cal. revolver to Ubaldo, </span>a .45
cal. pistol to Caigoy, and a pistol each to Calabia and Hembra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, they continued drinking.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 o'clock</st1:time> <span style="">that </span>evening, the group prepared to go
to the store of Eng Wan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused Va­lentin
Superable suggested that Lumpay, Ubaldo and Caigoy should enter the store while
the rest would re­main outside as lookouts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They reached the store at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00
 o'clock</st1:time> and, as <span style="">planned, </span>they divided into three groups.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Lumpay, Ubaldo and Caigoy <span style="">entered the store, Superable, </span>Villablanca
and Hembra posted them­selves on one corner of the road some ten meters from
the store, while Calabia and the Pacli brothers stood watch at the other corner
<span style="">of </span>the road eight <span style="">meters </span>from the said <span style="">store </span>of Eng Wan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said lookouts stood guard in squatting or
proning positions with their guns point­ing towards the direction of the store,
ready for <span style="">any eventuality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">When Lumpay, Ubaldo and </span>Caigoy
approached the store, Jorge Go, younger brother of Eng Wan, was stand­<span style="">ing at the </span>sidewalk passing <span style="">away </span>the time; and he was <span style="">completely taken </span>by <span style="">surprise </span>when he was suddenly com­manded
by Ubaldo to get inside the store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the same <span style="">time, Lumpay </span>aimed his
gun at Mana Lilia, Go's sister-in-law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Caigoy went further <span style="">inside </span>the
store, and when <span style="">he </span>came <span style="">back, he had with </span>him Co Cui Hui,
Jorge Go's mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having hied the
inmates together, Ubaldo com­manded them to point to the place where their
money <span style="">was </span>hidden, and one of
them readily pointed to the drawer where they kept their cash, as they had no
safe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ubal­do opened the drawer and took
therefrom P200.00 in cash. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>From another
drawer, Ubaldo obtained some P<span style="">50.00
worth of jewelry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Meanwhile that the
drawers <span style="">were </span></span>being
ransacked, Jorge Go slipped out of the store unnoticed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went<span style="">
</span>out of the store thru the door of Bodega A and proceeded towards the
direction of the store Bodega B to hide.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From there, he saw Caigoy came <span style="">out
</span><span style="">of </span>the door <span style="">of </span>Bodega <span style="">A, </span>conducting his mother, Co Cui Hui, by the neck of her
dress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about the same time, policeman
Margarito Cotoner entered the store, followed by an exchange of shots between
the policeman and Ubaldo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Outside the
store, Caigoy also shot the Chinese woman Co Cui Hui who fell on the sidewalk
between the canal of the road <span style="">and the
wall of the store.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The ensuing gunplay f</span>rom
the direction <span style="">of </span>Eng Wan's store
called the attention of Marcial Glore, another policeman of Tunga, who was then
eating supper <span style="">with his family in his </span>house
about 300 meters from the store of Eng <span style="">Wan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He immediately </span>proceeded towards <span style="">the store to investigate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But </span>before he could reach the place,
at <span style="">a distance </span>of 8 to 10 meters
from the store of Eng Wan, he <span style="">was </span>fired
upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">He </span>focused his flash­<span style="">light
towards the direction </span>of the place where the shot came from as he
ducked, and saw accused Lumpay, Calabia <span style="">and
Villablanca in the middle </span>of the road pointing their <span style="">guns at him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Policeman Glore </span>put out <span style="">his
flashlight </span><span style="">an</span><span style="">d tried to load his gun
which, unluckily, he failed </span>to do, even as the second shot directed
against him <span style="">came
</span>from the <span style="">place </span>where the above-named accused were at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He noted that Superable, whom he previously
saw a little farther away than Lumpay when he flashed his flashlight, ran
towards his back and there fired one shot, hitting him (Glore) at the right
shoulder below the scapula.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As policeman
Glore fell, his carbine and his flashlight were thrown aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the rob­bers left, one of them
dragging a body towards the river not far behind the store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still later policeman Glore managed to get up
and return to his house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was taken by
his wife to Carigara for first aid treatment and then <span style="">to the </span><st1:place><st1:placename>Leyte</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Provincial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
for more adequate treat­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
discharged from the said hospital after 19 days, but had to report back for
thirty days more before his wound was finally healed.</p>

they were goi<span style="">n</span>g <span style="">to </span>hire the truck of Eng Wan; <span style="">after </span>they had left his house, he
heard shots, so, he put out the light in the house because he was afraid that
they may come back; after the firing, he saw people running in different
directions, and he decided to close the doors of his house; the next morning,
he went out and mingled with the <span style="">people </span>among whom there was common talk that

</span>Incredibly, however, he </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">not awakened by the shots nor was he bothered
by the same, while he was overly sensitive to the voice of his wife who woke him
up to close the windows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimonies

contradictory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And considering that
Pacli's house was less than 200 meters from the store of Eng Wan; and there was
continuous firing, it is unbelievable that Aguja should hear only one

according to her own testimony, Peñaranda was then administering prenatal

after which they continued their way home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While crossing the bridge, they heard guns firing, and they
stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A policeman soon came who
advised them not to continue their way because there were Huks and<span style=""> </span>they were killing people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon said information and advice then, he

go to the place to save the people from being attack­ed by the Huks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much more, this policeman was not presented
to cor­roborate his testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Taking
into <span style="">consideration the distance from

place where the crime </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">committed."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find no cogent reason
to disturb that finding </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the
trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the evidence for the
prosecution already </span><span style="">set forth,
there is </span><span style="">no doubt that the
presence of Benjamin Pacli at the </span><span style="">scene </span><span style="">of the crime had
been clearly established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Above all, the
stuborn fact stands out in the record that soon after the wound­ed Gorgonio
Ubaldo </span><span style="">was
</span><span style="">found in the </span><span style="">river, </span><span style="">he revealed the names of his companions in the robbery </span><span style="">as set </span><span style="">out in his <u>ante</u> <u>mortem</u>
declaration, and when Benjamin Pacli and Antonio </span><span style="">Pecli </span><span style="">were brought before
him, he pointed to them </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">the
ones referred to in his statement; and both Antonio and Benjamin did not even
protest against the imputation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Nor do We give any
credence to the claim that the PC soldiers had maltreated Benjamin </span><span style="">Pacli </span><span style="">and his brother Antonio, for it appears that
the officials be­fore whom their statements were sworn to by them tes­tified
during the trial of </span><span style="">the case,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Furthermore,
the statements signed by the Pacli brothers, far from being in the nature of
complete ad­missions of </span><span style="">their </span><span style="">participation in
the commission of the robbery in question, were actually exculpatory in </span><span style="">essence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Antonio Pacli admitted in his statement that </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">other accused were his visitors in his house
in the afternoon of </span><st1:date year="1958" day="24" month="4"><span style="">April 24, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, and that firearms were actually distributed
in his house; but he was careful in his declaration, and did not admit that he </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">the one who distributed the firearms to
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was, likewise, careful in
stating that he knew nothing about the subject of their conversation when the
group engaged in a drinking spree in his house, and never revealed the fact
that he joined them when they left later and pro­ceeded to the store of Eng
Wan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benjamin Pacli, on the other hand,
admitted in his extra-judicial statement that he was with Superable and his
companions in the house of Antonio Pacli in the afternoon of </span><st1:date year="1958" day="24" month="4"><span style="">April
 24, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, and that
Superable and his companions robbed the store of Eng Wan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he never admitted in said statement of
his, that he was with them in the robbery, claiming that he immediately left
the place and went across the river as soon as he had pointed to them the store
of Eng Wan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No reasonable mind would
swallow such versions in the light of their pretenses that they signed their
said statements only because they were maltreated by the PC soldiers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had they really been maltreated, their
respective statements would have contained more serious incriminatory matters
which could later be effectively used against them; but <span style="">as </span>it is, their statements were but narrations of the events
that led to the commission of the robbery by the other accused, without making <span style="">any </span>direct acknowledgment of their
participation therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it defies
logic and common sense that seasoned investigators would have to resort to
violence to make them sign such statements which are relatively harmless
insofar </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">they are concerned which, to our mind, discards the theory of Ben­jamin </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">Antonio Pacli that
the investigators had attempted to incriminate them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">As we </span><span style="">read their state­ments, <span class="GramE">We</span>
find that they reflect spontaneity and co­herence, supplied with details which

must rest upon stronger evidence to overturn the testimony of equally credible

crime imputed to him was commit­ted, but he must, <span style="">likewise, </span>demonstrate that it was phy­sically
impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when, as here, the perpetra­tors of the

<p class="BODY">Pedro Dorango, a tuba gatherer, testified that he was one of the
guests in the house of Toribio Campos on the night of <st1:date year="1958" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">Again this Court has to turn down the foregoing de­fense of
Crispin Villablanca, Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His <u>alibi</u>
did not overcome the positive identification of him by the wit­nesses for the
prosecution as <span style="">one
</span>of the perpetrators of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our attention is called to the fact that Crispin Villablanca, Jr. <span style="">was </span>not
mentioned by Gorgonio Ubaldo in his ante mortem statement - a circumstance pointed
out by Villablanca in his brief and heavily re­lied upon by Villablanca in this
appeal; however, <span style="">We </span>find upon the evidence that the inculpatory facts have <span style="">established beyond any cavil of doubt the
participation of Villablanca in the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Wh</span>en the wounded Gorgonio Ubaldo was discovered lying prostrate
near the bank of the river in the vicinity of the scene of the crime, and was
investigated, Ubaldo readily admitted participation in the commission of the
robbery, naming his com­panions in the perpetration of the crime, among them<span style=""> </span>appellant Villablanca.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">On </span>the
basis of his revelations, the other accused were subsequently arrested,
majority of them on that very day; their extra-judicial statements were taken
then and there, and they were one and all in their declaration that herein
appellant Crispin Villa­blanca, Jr. (Pengpeng) was with the group that effected
the robbery; accused Alfonso Hembra revealed in open court how he and his
co-accused, including Villablanca, Jr., had committed the crime; and his identification
of herein appellant Villablanca, Jr. was convincingly cor­roborated by the
testimony of policeman Marcial Glore who was fired upon and wounded on the
occasion of the robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Crispin
Villablanca, Jr. had tried to show that Alfonso Hembra had an axe to grind
against him (Villablanca appears to have begotten a child with Hembra's
sister-in-law) which could have been a strong mo­tive for Alfonso Hembra to
implicate Villablanca to get even with him; but no such ill motives had been
shown on the part of the other accused and policeman Marcial Glore which might
have impelled them to incriminate him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The circumstance that the other accused repudiated their extra-judicial
statements later, affords no relief to Villablanca, Jr. either, for the Court finds
no truth in the alleged maltreatment they claimed to have induced them to
execute their respective extra-judicial state­ments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that herein appellant Villablanca,
Jr., along with Valentin Superable and Vicente Calabia, were not forced by the
investigating officers into making any extra-judicial statements, as a matter
of fact, militates against the claim of the other accused that they executed
their statements involuntarily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, the fact that the extra-judicial statements corro­borate one
another, describing in detail the steps taken in the perpetration of the
robbery, is a circumstance that may be taken and relied upon by the Court in
accept­ing the credibility of <span style="">state </span>witnesses
testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Besides the respective <u>alibis</u>

to give it <span style="">any </span>weight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it observed:</p>

<blockquote>"The testimony of Lucio Pal­conit, a prisoner detained in the
provincial jail, <span style="">is, </span>in the
opinion of the Court, not only fantastic but <span style="">also </span>extraordinary and a frame-up one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The way he came to know Gorgonio Ubaldo, one
of the accused in this case, did not convince the the Court that he had an
intimate relation with Gorgonio Ubaldo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This witness was convicted in accordance with Criminal Case No. 1774 of
this Court for illegal possession of fire­arm, on <st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1961</st1:date>, and <span style="">is again accused of </span>another serious crime of robbery in band and
has been detained in the provincial jail already for a long time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What he alleged that he was invited by
Gorgonio Ubaldo to go to the house of the latter located behind the Aztec
Theater, and for that he went to <st1:place><st1:placename>Tacloban</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and arrived there on <st1:date year="1958" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1958</st1:date>, is devoid of
truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it is true that he was written
<span style="">a </span>letter,
yet, that letter was not even exhibited in Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One thing more which the Court does not
believe in his testi­mony is, that when he arrived in Tacloban City in the
house of Gorgo­nio Ubaldo, he did not meet him in the house, and the father of
the lat­ter pointed him to go to the Shamrock Hotel to look for him there, and
there he met Norberto Lumpay and was introduced to him by Gorgonio Ubaldo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that place, they planned the rob­bery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the Court, this is <span style="">a </span>story coming from <span style="">a </span>polluted
source, and for <span style="">that, </span>its
veracity is doubtful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From that place
they went to the Coca-cola Plant, and then to Tunga riding in <span style="">a </span>jeep up
to barrio Baliri to pick up their companions by the name of Carlin Miralles and
Jose Ca­tega.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the Court, this is an
in­vented story, imaginative in its na­ture.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These two persons, Carling Miralles and Jose Catag, were never mentioned
in the information <span class="GramE">nor</span> in the evidence presented by
the prose­cution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not even
mentioned in the testimony of the witnesses of any of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">fact
does not reconcile with the defense presented by Crispin <span class="GramE">Villablanca,
that</span> Gorgonio Ubaldo </span>is not from Tacloban but from Pastrana, <st1:place><span style="">Leyte</span></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He</span>
alleged <span style="">further that it was Carling
Miralles who brought the weapons that were distributed to them in Barrio Baliri
but there is no evidence at all to corroborate this fact, nor Carling Miralles
was ever presented to make the necessary corroboration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Jose
</span>Cataga was not even presented to testify for the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court believes and so <span class="GramE">opines,</span>
that these persons never exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court <span style="">is </span>surprised why this
witness was presented to tell a suicidal story and incriminating himself before
the Court for so serious a crime of rob­bery in band with double homicide,
etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When this witness was asked on
cross-examination, he manifested, that he did not know the whereabouts of Jose
Cataga and Carling Miralles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
confirms the doubt of the Court <span style="">as </span>to
the existence of <span class="GramE">this persons</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further alleged that while he was detained
in Tacloban for seven months and did not reveal anything that happened for
Norberto Lumpay threatened to kill him if he will do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This witness, while testifying in court in this
case, is detained <span style="">as </span>above-mentioned
for the crime of robbery in band.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court is at a loss to give credit to his testimony as he said, he was afraid of
Norberto Lumpay as the latter admonished him not to make it known to other
persons about the robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, the
records show that this witness was testifying while Nor­berto Lumpay had
already made an es­cape from the provincial jail, at large and is free to <span style="">make </span>some harm if he desires to make
any revelation as what he stated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
fact makes the Court to doubt its veracity and qualifies the story as real
fantasy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He wanted to be crucified to
save the real enemies of mankind."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This self-sacrifice
bravely assumed by Lucio Palconit in owning direct participation in the
commission of the offense charged thereby inferentially absolving </span><span style="">the other accused from criminal liability <span style="">is, </span>to our mind, hardly
believable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted <span style="">that Palconit</span>'s<span style=""> </span>al­leged participation in the robbery homicide surprisingly
surfaced into the open only after the lapse of more than three years from the
date of the commission of the of­fense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We cannot give credence to Palconit's lame excuse that he had not been
able to come forward much earlier to supply such vital <span class="GramE">an
information</span> because he was afraid of Norberto Lumpay who had previously
threatened to kill him should he confess.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rather, <span class="GramE">We</span> entertain a very strong hunch <span style="">that Palconit </span>must have been persuaded
to admit the offenses charged in view of the fact that he <span style="">had very little to lose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Palconit was a consistent law­</span>breaker,
having <span style="">to his credit </span>a string of
criminal charges for robbery aside from one confirmed conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fur­thermore, <span class="GramE">We</span>
cannot conceive of Palconit to be overly apprehensive about Norberto Lumpay's
threat to kill him should he confess and at the </span><span style="">same time </span><span style="">be extremely courageous to own direct participation in an offense with
which he was clearly aware could mete him the death penalty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise militating against the truth of Palconit's confession <span style="">is </span>the fact
that nowhere in the investigation <span style="">conducted
by the police authorities nor in the preliminary statements given by the
accused had Palconit's partici­</span>pation been slightly <span class="GramE">connected.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This glaring non-inclu­sion could obviously
only mean that Palconit was actually not with the group which perpetrated the acts
leading to the filing of this instant charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">After carefully examining the voluminous record of this case, a
larger part of which faithfully recited appellants' respective defenses and
testimonies, the Court <span style="">has arrived at </span>the
conclusion that the <u>alibis</u> set up by Antonio Pacli, Benjamin Pacli,
Valentin Superable and Severo Caigoy do not impair in the least the evidence
adduced by the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The members
of the Court are unanimous in the opinion that the trial court did not err in
not giving credence to the evidence they have respectively presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conclusion has, like­wise, been reached <span style="">that the </span>guilt of Vicente Calabia and
Crispin Villablanca, Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">has</span> been proven beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The precision which characterized the movements of <span style="">the accused in carrying out their </span>plan
to rob the victim, strongly suggests a unity of purpose and design to the end
that the accused’ intent may be expeditiously consummated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As planned and later on carried out, three <span style="">of the accused, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gorgonio Ubaldo, Norberto Lumpay </span>and
Severo Caigoy entered the store in order to secure things of value; Superable,
Villablanca, Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">and</span>
Hembra posted themselves on one corner of the road while Cala­bia, Antonio
Pacli and Benjamin Pacli stood guard on the other corner of <span style="">the street </span>to insure protection
against any interference from the outside that may ham­per the success of the
whole operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They acted accordingly,
primarily obssessed with the unity of their intent to gain from the
undertaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Ubaldo shot and
killed policeman Cotoñer even before the lat­ter could <span style="">render any help to the victims </span>of the robbery; while the lookouts
posted on opposite corners of the road fronting the store effectively halted
policeman Glore by wounding him even before he could come near the store and
assess the gravity of the situation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such precision displayed by them in the execution of the rob­bery,
coupled with the evidence that they came together to the house of Antonio Pacli
earlier that afternoon and agreed to commit the same against Eng Wan, leave no
room for doubt that they have acted pursuant to a cons­piracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, it is not absolutely necessary
to pinpoint specifically, who fired the shot that kill­ed either policeman <span style="">Cotoñer or the Chinese </span>woman <span style="">Co Cui Hui; all the conspirators are liable
irrespective of the fact that </span>some had limited themselves to the act or <span style="">robbery while the others participated in </span>the
act of homicide and less serious physical injuries.</p>

<p class="BODY">Crispin Villablanca, Jr. pleads, in this connect­ion, that even
the evidence for the prosecution tends to show that he escaped from the scene
of the crime shortly after the appearance of policeman Marcial Glore near the
premises of <span style="">the </span>store of Eng
Wan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This cir­cumstance, he argues,
shows voluntary desistance on his part from the consummation of the robbery and
should entitle him to an acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
pretense deserves no <span style="">serious
consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence is
conclusive, that </span>policeman Marcial Glore went to the scene of the crime
only after hearing several gun reports from <span style="">the </span>direction of Eng Wan’s store.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Apparently, the shots <span style="">he </span>heard
from the <span class="GramE">place,</span> were those that emanated from the
exchange of fires between <span style="">Ubaldo </span>and
policeman Cotoñer and the shot with which Caigoy killed the Chinese woman Co <span style="">Cui </span>Hui.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time, the robbery and killings had
fully been consummated before the arrival of policeman Marcial Glore at the
scene of the crime, and Crispin Villablanca, Jr. cannot exculpate himself from
liabi­lity simply because he left shortly thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he did escape from the place without
waiting for his companions, <span style="">it was not
by reason of any desistance anymore, but with a </span>desire to evade the
hands of the law which he must have then realized would soon be out to get<span style=""> </span><span style="">him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The crime committed by
the accused is robbery in <span style="">band with
double homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty provided
for by Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code is <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>
to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the provision of
Article 296, </span></span><span style="">as </span><span style="">amended, of the Revised Penal Code which pro­vides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Art. 296. Definition of <span style="">a </span>band and penalty incurred by the members thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- When more than three armed malefactors take
part in the commis­sion of robbery it shall be deemed to have been committed by
<span style="">a </span>band.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When any of the arms used in the commission
of the offense be an unli­censed firearm, the penalty to be im­posed upon <span style="">all </span>the
malefactors shall be the maximum of the corresponding penalty provided by <span style="">law, </span>without
pre­judice to the criminal liability for illegal possession of such unlicensed
firearm.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Any member of a band who is present at the commission of a
rob­bery by the band shall be punished <span style="">as </span>principal of any of the assaults
committed by the band unless it <span class="GramE">be</span> shown that he
attempted to prevent <span style="">the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(As emended by Republic Act
No. 12, Sec. 3)."</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE"><span style="">the</span></span><span style=""> penalty to be
imposed upon them is the maximum</span> p<span style="">enalty,
that is, DEATH even without the concurrence of any aggravating circumstance
(see People </span><span style="">vs. </span><span style="">Valeriano,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>et al., 90 Phil. 15).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, <span class="GramE">We</span>
do not find it necessary to discuss separately and in detail the aggravating

mitigating circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, there
is no further need to consider the frustrated homicide, less serious physical
injuries and the direct assault upon agents of persons in authority which were
all al­leged in the information and subsequently proved dur­ing the trial to
have been committed <span style="">by </span>the
accused on the occasion of the robbery, for purposes of determining the proper
penalty to be impo<span style="">sed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></span><span style="">Anyway, </span><span style="">with or without such consideration, the conclusion would be the same -
the accused should <span style="">be sentenced to </span>the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Accused Valentin
Superable, </span>Severo Caigoy, Antonio Pacli and Benjamin Pacli, as shown by <span style="">the </span>degree of their participation in
the commission of the atrocious horrible crime of which they now stand
convicted, have proved themselves dangerous enemies of the decent members of
society.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">law </span>ordains that they should pay with
their lives in retribution for their offense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In these days of rampant violence and criminality, this decision is
calculated to have a most salutary effect upon the elements <span style="">that threaten to set the law at naught and
break the social order; it should serve as a reminder to those who are
criminally minded that crime does not </span><span style="">pay; </span><span style="">and above all, it should make them realize once again that courts will
not shrink their disagreeable duty to impose the death penalty in cases where
the law so provides.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Some members of the Court believe, however, that Vicente Calabia
