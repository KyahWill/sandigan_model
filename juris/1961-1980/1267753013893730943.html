<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(1) In Criminal Case No. 1147 (G. 
R. No. L-134G9), Pablo <span class="SpellE">Egual</span>, alias Commander Reyes, 
and Domingo <span class="SpellE">Encallado</span>, alias Commander Doming, were 
charged with murder for the killing of Julian Castillo. They entered a plea of 
not guilty and after the trial court had denied <span class="SpellE">Egual’s</span> motion to quash the information on the ground that 
the crime charged was absorbed by that of rebellion of which he had already been 
prosecuted and convicted, they were tried. <span class="SpellE">Egual</span> was 
thereafter found guilty beyond reasonable doubt, as charged, with the 
aggravating circumstances of armed band and abuse of superior strength, but with 
the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender to the late President <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>, and was sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>, to indemnify the heirs of the 
deceased Julian Castillo in the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, to 
suffer the accessory penalties prescribed by law, and to pay one-half of the 
costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Domingo <span class="SpellE">Encallado</span> was acquitted on the ground of reasonable doubt, 
with one-half of the costs declared de officio. Consequently, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Egual</span> is now the only appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(2) In Criminal Case No. 1148 (G. 
R. No. L-14240), an information for assault against agents of a person in 
authority, with triple murder, was filed against Pablo <span class="SpellE">Egual</span>, Commander Reyes, <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> 
Hernandez, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Encallado</span>, alias Commander Doming, 
Carlos <span class="SpellE">Logti</span>, alias' Commander Mailing, <span class="SpellE">Sancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Diwa</span>, alias Commander <span class="SpellE">Badong</span>, and Marcelo Mendoza, alias Commander Oscar. Their 
motion to quash the information upon the same ground advanced by <span class="SpellE">Egual</span> in the first case having been denied, they pleaded not 
guilty, were subsequently tried and found guilty as charged (except (1) Carlos 
<span class="SpellE">Logti</span>, who was still at large and had not been brought 
to trial, the case against him having been dismissed, without prejudice and 
defendant (2) <span class="SpellE">Encallado</span>, the case as against him 
having been provisionally dismissed—with his conformity—on the ground of 
insufficiency of evidence, with one-fifth of the costs de officio); and 
considering the aggravating circumstance of aimed band, without any mitigating 
circumstance to offset it, each of the defendants was sentenced to suffer 
<i>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></i>, to jointly and severally 
indemnify each of the victims in the sum of P6,000.00, to pay one-fifth of the 
costs, and to suffer the accessory penalties prescribed by 
law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(3) In Criminal Case No. 1153 (G. 
R. No. L-14209), an information charging the murder of <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Rublico</span> was filed against 
<span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> Hernandez, Marcelo Mendoza, alias Commander 
Oscar, and a third person designated therein as John Doe, who was still at 
large. After due trial upon a plea of not guilty, the defendants were all found 
guilty as charged, with the aggravating circumstance of <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span>, without any mitigating circumstance to offset 
it, and each was sentenced to suffer reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>, to jointly and severally indemnify the heirs of 
the deceased in the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, each to pay 
one-third of the costs, and to suffer the accessory penalties prescribed by 
law.<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">A<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the first case (Criminal Case 
No. 1147, now G. R. No. L-13469) the prosecution evidence clearly established 
the fallowing facts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">At about 7 o'clock in the evening 
of October 10, 1955, Appellant <span class="SpellE">Egual</span>, armed with an 
automatic carbine, <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> Reyes, alias Commander 
<span class="SpellE">Malvar</span>, carrying a long firearm, together with about 
twenty other armed persons, arrived in front of the house of Julian Castillo—an 
overseer of private property at <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> Santo <span class="SpellE">Toribio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Marauoy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lipa</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>. Upon seeing 
him, <span class="SpellE">Egual</span> and Reyes grabbed him, tied his hands and 
led him westward towards the railroad trucks. <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> 
Castillo, a fifteen year old son of Julian, tried to follow and help his father, 
but on being threatened by one of the armed men, he went back to their house, 
and from one of the windows he saw <span class="SpellE">Egual</span> and his <span class="GramE">companions</span> fire shots at his father and afterwards at their 
house, after which they left. <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> then went to the 
place where his father was shot and there found him dead with several gun-shot 
wounds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Hilarion</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> Reyes was not included among the 
defendants in this case because he had already been separately prosecuted and 
convicted for the murder of Julian Castillo (Criminal Case No. 978 of the Court 
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The record further discloses that 
on February 6, 1957, <span class="SpellE">Egual</span> signed a sworn statement 
before the Deputy Clerk, Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lipa</span> City Branch, 
admitting therein that he had participated in the killing of Julian Castillo 
because he was one of the members of the <span class="SpellE">Hukbalahap</span> 
organization ordered to kill the latter due to his alleged participation in the 
killing of Commander Recto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Equal's main contention is that 
his motion to quash the information should have been sustained because the 
offense charged therein was absorbed by that of rebellion of which he had 
already been convicted on </span><st1:date month="3" day="28" year="1957"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 28, 
1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> by 
the Court of First Instance of Laguna (Criminal Case No. <span class="GramE">B-103).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This contention is without merit. 
Firstly, because the act <span class="SpellE">Egual</span> is now charged with was 
not among those alleged in the Laguna case as constituting the crime of 
rebellion. Secondly, because there is no evidence to show that the offense 
charged in the present case was committed as a necessary means to commit that of 
rebellion or in furtherance thereof. Thirdly, because while the acts 
constituting the offense of rebellion covered by the Laguna case were committed 
in the province of Laguna, the murder of which <span class="SpellE">Egual</span> 
is charged in the present was committed in the province of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>—over which the Laguna court had no jurisdiction. 
<span class="GramE">Fourthly, because the deceased Julian Castillo was a mere 
overseer of a private property, with no established connection with the 
government at the time; and lastly, because <span class="SpellE">Egual</span> 
presented absolutely no evidence to show Castillo's connection with the killing 
of Commander Recto.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We find, therefore, that the 
defense has failed to prove that the killing of Castillo was a necessary means 
to commit the crime of rebellion—of which appellant had already been prosecuted 
and convicted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The crime committed was murder, 
qualified by treachery, the evidence showing that when Julian Castillo was 
killed, his hands were tied, thus insuring the commission of the crime by his 
assailants without any risk on their part arising from any defense the victim 
might offer. The aggravating circumstances of abuse of superior strength and 
night time duly established by the evidence are deemed absorbed by that of 
treachery (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Magsilang</span>, 46 O. G. 1557 and 
People vs. <span class="SpellE">Cespeñe</span>, G. R. No. L-9346, </span><st1:date month="10" day="30" year="1957"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 30, 
1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">). 
There being no aggravating <span class="GramE">nor</span> mitigating circumstance 
to be considered, the trial court was right in imposing on appellant the medium 
period of the penalty prescribed by law, which is reclusion. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">perpetua</span></span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Modified as above indicated, the 
decision appealed from is affirmed in all other respects, with 
cost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">B<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the second case (Criminal Case 
No, 1148, now G. R- No. L-14240), the prosecution evidence shows that in the 
afternoon of </span><st1:date month="9" day="14" year="1953"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 14, 
1953</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
while Andres <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> was supervising the harvest of 
<span class="SpellE">palay</span> in his farm in barrio San Lucas, 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Lipa</span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
</span><st1:place><st1:city><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Batangas</span></span></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
</span><st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:country-region></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, he happened to see three 
persons crossing a coconut trunk bridge. Shortly thereafter he heard several 
shots. Minutes later, he saw coming from a distance of twenty-five meters 
several members of the <span class="SpellE">Hukbalahap</span> organization, 
amongst <span class="GramE">whom</span> were <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> 
Hernandez, Marcelo Mendoza and Pablo <span class="SpellE">Egual</span>. After 
these persons had passed, <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> went to the place 
from where the shots came and there found the dead bodies of Benito <span class="SpellE">Pagkaliwangan</span>, Santiago <span class="SpellE">Macatangay</span>, and (Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Yason</span>, 
subsequently identified as soldiers of the Philippine Constabulary. Barrio 
Lieutenant <span class="SpellE">Braulio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paltado</span> 
also testified that while supervising the harvest of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> in his rice field, he also heard the shots; that while 
on his way to the place from where the shots came, he met a group of thirteen 
<span class="SpellE">Huks</span>, amongst them being <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> Hernandez, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Encallado</span>, Marcelo Mendoza, <span class="SpellE">Sancho</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Diwa</span>, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Egual</span>, and 
Carlos <span class="SpellE">Logti</span>, the first one (Hernandez) having warned 
him not to reveal to anybody the killing of the three 
soldiers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="9" day="14" year="1953"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 14, 
1953</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
Municipal Health Officer of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, after 
investigating the shooting, issued a certificate of the death of the three 
victims (Exhibit A, B and C found in the record).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="5" day="26" year="1957"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 
26, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
Marcelo Mendoza and <span class="SpellE">Sancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Diwa</span> signed separate extrajudicial confessions sworn to 
before Justice of the Peace <span class="SpellE">Eulalio</span> Chavez, wherein 
they admitted their (participation in the killing of the three constabulary 
soldiers (Exhibits D and E).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Before going further, it must be 
noted that the case was dismissed provisionally as against Domingo <span class="SpellE">Encallado</span> on </span><st1:date month="10" day="4" year="1957"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 4, 
1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, on 
the ground of insufficiency of evidence, while defendant Carlos <span class="SpellE">Logti</span> did not undergo trial because he remained at large 
until the case was decided below.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Testifying in his own defense, 
appellant <span class="SpellE">Sancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Diwa</span> 
admitted that he was a member of the <span class="SpellE">Hukbalahap</span>, an 
organization Unit aimed at correcting the wrong administration of the 
government; that he was one of the group of thirteen links who killed three PC 
soldiers on September 14, 1955, claiming, however, that he did not know at that 
time that the victims were PC soldiers because they were in civilian clothes; 
that because the soldiers drew their guns, his companions also fired at them, 
although he himself fired shots in the air.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">For his part, appellant 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Mendoza</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> denied participation in the 
commission of the offense and claimed that he signed his extrajudicial 
confession without even reading it because he was repeatedly hit and maltreated. 
He admitted, however, that while confined in the Municipal jail of 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Lipa</span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, he was not maltreated at all by 
the police and that he swore to the truth of the contents of his confession 
before Justice of the Peace <span class="SpellE">Eulalio</span> 
Chavez.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Egual</span>, on the other hand, after denying participation in the 
commission of the crime, testified that he was a member of the <span class="SpellE">Hukbalahap</span> organization for eight years; that in January 
1957 he surrendered to the late President <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> in 
order to live a peaceful life, but after his surrender he was charged of 
rebellion in the Court of First Instance of Laguna (Criminal Case No. B-103), 
and was sentenced to suffer an imprisonment of one year and six months; that as 
a link he had several encounters with PC soldiers whom he considered his 
enemies; that <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of his not having participated 
in the commission of the crime, he signed a statement regarding the killing of 
Julian Castillo incriminating himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Egual</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> also invokes double jeopardy by 
reason of his prosecution and conviction of rebellion in the Court of First 
Instance of Laguna on </span><st1:date month="3" day="31" year="1957"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 31, 
1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> Hernandez did not admit his membership in the 
<span class="SpellE">Hukbalahap</span> organization.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Diwa</span> contends that the offense charged in the present case 
was absorbed by that of rebellion of which he was found guilty in Criminal Case 
No. 774 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, 
the information filed in the latter having charged that the crime of rebellion 
alleged therein was committed between June 30, 1950 and August 11, 1954—a period 
which includes the date of the commission of the crime subject matter of the 
present case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">For his part, appellant 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Mendoza</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> contends that the proper charge 
against him should have been rebellion and not assault against persons in 
authority, with triple murder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the case of <span class="SpellE">Diwa</span> and <span class="SpellE">Egual</span>, it appears that 
the murder of the three PC soldiers was net mentioned at all in the rebellion 
cases filed against them, and the acts constituting rebellion of which <span class="SpellE">Egual</span> was found guilty were committed in the province of 
Laguna. Furthermore, the defense evidence does not show that the killing of the 
PC soldiers was in furtherance of the crime of rebellion. As a matter of fact, 
according to <span class="SpellE">Diwa</span> the victims were wearing civilian 
clothes at the time they were ambushed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Upon the other hand, the mere 
denials of appellants can not overcome the positive testimony of <span class="SpellE">Braulio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paltado</span> and Andres <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> linking them with the killing of the three PC 
soldiers mentioned heretofore, their testimony having been substantially 
corroborated by the extrajudicial confessions of <span class="SpellE">Diwa</span> 
and Mendoza themselves. True these appellants tried to repudiate the <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> of said confessions, but after an examination 
of the record, <span class="GramE">We</span> are satisfied that they were freely 
made and sworn to later before Justice of the Peace <span class="SpellE">Eulalio</span> Chavez. <span class="GramE">In fact, in Criminal Case 
No. 1153 (now G. R. No.</span> L-14209), appellant 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Mendoza</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> testified that he had 
voluntarily executed his extra- Judicial confession (Exhibit E, which is marked 
as Exhibit A in Criminal Case No. 1153, p. 45 of the record said 
case).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The evidence does not show that 
the killing, qualified <span class="GramE">treachery,</span> was committed with 
the attendance of any aggravating or mitigating circumstance. Consequently, the 
penalty of reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span> imposed by the trial 
court is correct. However, the provision in the appealed decision that indemnity 
shall be paid to the victims should be modified by making the indemnity payable 
to their heirs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Modified as above indicated, the 
decision appealed from in this second case is affirmed in all other respects, 
with costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">C.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In Criminal 
Case No. 1163, now G. R. No.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> L-14209, the prosecution 
evidence has established that at about eight o'clock in the evening of August 
22, 1953, while <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span>, Barrio Lieutenant of Barrio San Lucas, <span class="SpellE">Lipa</span> City, and his family were sleeping in their house in 
said barrio, somebody shouted: "Ka <span class="SpellE">Perto</span>, Ka <span class="SpellE">Perto</span>". This awakened his daughter, Lilia and his wife, 
<span class="SpellE">Teodora</span> <span class="SpellE">Marasigan</span>, who in 
turn woke him up telling him that somebody wanted to talk to him. Thereafter, 
<span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span>, followed by his wife and daughter, went 
downstairs where, without warning, he was fired upon by <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> Hernandez and Marcelo Mendoza, this causing his 
instantaneous death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Teodora's</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> testimony shows that she had 
known Hernandez and Mendoza for sometime before this incident. She even 
testified that the motive for the killing was Hernandez' desire, to take the 
place of her husband as overseer of a piece of land in the barrio and her 
husband's refusal to give Hernandez five hundred coconut fruits for the 
guerrillas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The prosecution also presented as 
witness Francisco Beltran, another resident of the same barrio, who testified 
that after he had heard shots on the evening of the incident, he brought the 
members of his family to a dugout from where he saw around seven persons 
conversing near his house; that amongst them were his "<span class="SpellE">compadre</span>", <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> Hernandez, 
and Marcelo Mendoza, he having heard the former making the remark that he had 
first shot <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> on 
the leg; that as the group approached him, Hernandez recognized him and told 
him, "<span class="SpellE">Compadre</span>, do not be afraid of me, we killed Ka 
<span class="SpellE">Perto</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Leoncio</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="SpellE">Pagcaliwangan</span>, also of 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Lipa</span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, testified that at about 
</span><st1:time hour="19" minute="0"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">7 o'clock</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> in the evening of the incident, 
Marcelo Mendoza, with two armed companions, went to his house and asked him 
whether <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> Hernandez had already arrived. In 
reply he said that Hernandez had not yet arrived, but a little while later, 
Hernandez actually came; that a short while after the group had left his house, 
<span class="SpellE">Pagkaliwangan</span> heard shots from the direction of the 
house of <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In connection with this case, it 
appears that on May 25, 1957, after PC Corporal Torres had investigated him, 
Mendoza made an extrajudicial confession (Exhibit A, p. 45 of the record in 
Criminal Case No. 1153, and Exhibit E, p. 151 of the record of Criminal Case No. 
1158) wherein he admitted his participation in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> in company of <span class="SpellE">Egual</span>, Hernandez, one Faustino <span class="SpellE">Rochas</span> and others, and stated further that it was <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> Hernandez who ordered the killing of <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> because of his desire to replace him as overseer and 
because of <span class="SpellE">Rubico's</span> refusal to give coconuts to their 
organization.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In his defense, Mendoza testified 
that although he had been a member of the <span class="SpellE">Hukbalahap</span> 
since June 1950, he surrendered in 1953 to <span class="SpellE">Tarciano</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span>, Laguna; 
that as a result of the investigation to which he was submitted by PC soldiers, 
he made the sworn statement Exhibit A, claiming, however, that the killing of 
<span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> was in furtherance of 
rebellion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Mendoza</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">'s contentions are without merit. 
Although <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> was a barrio lieutenant, the record 
contains m evidence at all that his murder was absolutely necessary to carry out 
the purpose of the rebellion. That </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Mendoza</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> was a member of the <span class="SpellE">Hukbalahap</span> organization is do reason why all his acts and 
misdeeds should be considered in furtherance of, or absorbed by 
rebellion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Moreover, appellant 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Mendoza</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> has not shown that he had even 
been prosecuted and convicted of rebellion. On the other hand, the prosecution 
evidence is sufficient to establish that <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> was 
killed by Mendoza and his companions upon orders of <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> Hernandez who had a strictly personal grudge 
against the victim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">For his part, appellant Hernandez 
claims that the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Teodora</span> <span class="SpellE">Marasigan</span> and Lilia <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> are not 
worthy of belief and that the extrajudicial confession of appellant 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Mendoza</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> should not affect him adversely, 
it being admissible only as against the latter. He also tried to establish an 
alibi, claiming that at the time of the commission of the crime, he was in his 
house attending to a sick child, and that when he went to the house of <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span>, he saw the latter already dead and sprawled on the 
ground near the stairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After going over the record, we 
found nothing sufficient to show sufficient ill motive on the part of <span class="SpellE">Teodora</span> <span class="SpellE">Marasigan</span> and her daughter 
to induce them to testify falsely against appellants, nor any other factor 
sufficient to discredit their testimonies. Both witnesses knew appellants well 
and long before the incident, and they positively testified that they were the 
ones who killed <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span>. Moreover, their testimony is 
strongly supported by Francisco Beltran's <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> testimony to the effect that Hernandez was 
his "<span class="SpellE">compadre</span>", that, on the night in question, he had 
heard Hernandez telling Mendoza that he had first shot <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> on the leg, and that later Hernandez even told him 
not to be afraid as they had already killed <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In all these cases it is true 
that the witnesses for the state failed to reveal and disclose the identity of 
the perpetrators of the crime for almost three years, but we give to this 
circumstance little importance considering that at the time of the commission of 
the crime and for some time thereafter, the bands of <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> roaming in the locality were still strong and ruthless, 
and it was natural for said witnesses to be afraid to tell the truth about what 
they knew until they felt that it was safe for them to do 
so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The crime committed by appellants 
Mendoza and Hernandez is also that of murder, without the attendance of any 
aggravating or mitigating circumstance. Consequently, <span class="GramE">We</span> find the penalty imposed by the trial court to be correct. 
Wherefore, the appealed decision is affirmed in <span class="SpellE">toto</span>, 
with costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
