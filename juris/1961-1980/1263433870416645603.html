Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City and the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, the plaintiffs prayed that they be declared the rightful owners and
entitled to the possession of Lot 719 of the <span class="SpellE">Piedad</span>
Estate located in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, and sought <span style="">the cancellation of the titles thereto now
appearing in the name of defendant St. Peter Memorial Park, Inc., as well as
the titles from which the same were derived, and sought to recover damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the antecedent ownership thereof being traceable to Original Certificate of

reconstitution of the title of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> to Lot

the said land until 1945 when Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> died;
that the certificate of title in the name of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>
was burned; and that the efforts of the plaintiffs, respondents herein, to
reconstitute said title, resulted in the discovery of the existence of Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 21893 over the same property the names of <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> Martin and <span class="SpellE">Trino</span> <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>.</p>

<blockquote>"A review of the evidence initially adduced before the court
then presided over by the former trial judge, in relation with the newly
discovered evidence introÂ­duced during new trial, would now be in order.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The single undisputed fact is that <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 719
of the <span class="SpellE">Piedad</span> Estate forms part of the land covered
by Original Transfer Certificate of Title No. 614 of the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, in the name of the Government of the Philippine
Islands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs have been consistent
in their contention that <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 719 belongs to them in
ownership, as heirs of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>, original <span class="SpellE">awardee</span> of said lot the title to which in the name of said
predecessor in interest is said to have been burnt in a fire in 1933.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:placename>Defendant</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Memorial Park</st1:placetype></st1:place>, however, claims to
have derived its title to <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 719 through a series of
transfers ultimately traced back to an alleged assignment made by Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> on <st1:date year="1921" day="15" month="7">July
 15, 1921</st1:date> over Sales Certificate No. 923 in favor of <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> Martin and <span class="SpellE">Trino</span> <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise
stated, <st1:place><st1:placename>defendant</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Memorial
  Park</st1:placetype></st1:place> initially seems to have anchored the
validity of its title to <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 719, on antecedent ownership
thereof by Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>, on the strength of Sales
Certificate No. 923 in favor of said AnÂ­tonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>
dated <st1:date year="1909" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1909</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the newly discovered evidence adduced by defendant Memorial Park
during new trial, however, said defendant appears to have drastically shifted
its position, in that the main thrust of said newly discovered evidence would
tend to establish that Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> is the <span class="SpellE">awardee</span> of Lot 640 of the <span class="SpellE">Piedad</span>
Estate as evidenced by Deed No. 18562 dated August 10, 1929, as well as by the
resultant Transfer Certificate of Title No. 15694 covering the same Lot
640.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a corollary, it is argued that
Sheet 15 of Original Certificate of Title No. <span class="GramE">614,</span>
must have referred not to <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 719 as claimed by
plaintiffs, but to <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 640, as allegedly fortified by
the <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> register of Vicente Garcia (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. '10') and Deed No. 18652 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'11')<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursued</span>
to its logical conclusion, defendant Memorial Park's stance during the new
trial, which parenthetically is incompatible with its material allegations in
its Answer, would undermine not only plaintiffs' claim to Lot 719, but also its
claim thereto, since the validity of its claim to said Lot 719 is clearly
predicated on a series of transactions traced back to an alleged assignment
thereof purportedly made by Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> to <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> Martin and <span class="SpellE">Trino</span> <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> in 1921.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
it is, indeed, true that Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> has never
been awarded <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 719, no assignment thereof by the same
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> can be said to have the effect of now
vesting ownership of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 719 in <st1:place><st1:placename>defendant</st1:placename>

<blockquote>The abrupt shift in the legal position of <st1:place><st1:placename>defendant</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Memorial Park</st1:placetype></st1:place>, if taken at face
value, could very well result in the perhaps absurd conclusion that neither
plaintiffs, as heirs of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>, nor <st1:place><st1:placename>deÂ­fendant</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Memorial Park</st1:placetype></st1:place>, as successor in
interest of the same Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>, own the subject
<st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 719 of the <span class="SpellE">Piedad</span>
Estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereas this Court accepts
without reservation the observation of the Supreme Court that the newly
discovered evidence constitutes 'documentary and official' proof of the sale to
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> of Lot 640 of the <span class="SpellE">Piedad</span>
Estate, the exclusion thereby of the award and sale to him of Lot 719 under
Sales Certificate No. 923 may not necessarily follow as an equally inescapable
conclusion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>With no small measure of trepidation, this Court would venture the
opinion that the apparent finding in the Supreme Court's decision of March 21,
1975 of the sale to Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> of Lot 640 but <u>not</u>
of Lot 719 of the <span class="SpellE">Piedad</span> Estate would apply in a
situation where said Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> can be or has
been shown to have been sold only one lot from said estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the evidence which would
support such a situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
contrary, the possibility of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> having
been awarded and sold more than one lot from the <span class="SpellE">Piedad</span>
Estate cannot be discounted from the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>
Francisco Mateo to the effect that there are several entries in the index card
for names surnamed <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>, that he is not sure
whether there are other titles in the name of <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>
in volumes other than T-63 covering property likewise deriving from Original
Certificate of Title No. 614; and that he has made a search for titles numbered
only in five digits and beginning with 156.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No less signifiÂ­cant is the testimony of vault keeper Prospero <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span> that even volume T-63 is incomplete, with almost
all pre-war titles missing <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It behooves this Court, therefore, to further scrutinize the evidence
on hand for adequate and satisfactory indicia of whether or not Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> has been awarded and sold <u>both</u> Lot 640 and <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
719 of the <span class="SpellE">Piedad</span> Estate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>From the evidence can be gleaned the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) The award to Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>
of Lot 719 is covered by Sales Certificate No. 923; whereas Deed No. 18562 of
Lot 640 in favor of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> and four others,
makes specific reference to 'S.C. 924', being an induÂ­bitable reference to
Sales Certificate No. 924; (b) Sales Certificate No. 923 for Lot 719 is for an
area of 21 hectares; whereas Deed No. 18562 for Lot 640 specifies an area of '1
hectare, 51 <span class="SpellE">ares</span>, and 13 <span class="SpellE">centares</span>';
(c) Sales Certificate No. 923 for Lot 719 is for a consideration of P676.00;
whereas Deed No. 18562 sets forth a value of only P57.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This constitutes compelling reason to
conclude that Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> has, in fact, been
awarded and sold not only <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 640 but also <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
719 of the <span class="SpellE">Piedad</span> Estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the validity of <st1:place><st1:placename>defendant</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Memorial Park</st1:placetype></st1:place>'s title to said <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
719, unequivocally stressed by witness <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> Francisco
Mateo even during the new trial thereto, must hinge on the authenticity of the
title thereto of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claimed assignment by Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> of Lot 719 to <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> Martin
and <span class="SpellE">Trino</span> <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> on July
15, 1921, and the resultant transfer culminating in title to Lot 719 now vested
in defendant Memorial Park, can only serve to fortify a conclusion that Lot 640
is another parcel awarded to Antonio, <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Romana</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dionisia</span>, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>, <span style="">as </span>distinct and separate from Lot 719
awarded to Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> alone as evidenced by
Sales Certificate No. 923.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally,
issuance of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 15694 covering Lot 640 in the
names of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> and four others, and the
issuance of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 21893 in the names of <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> Martin and <span class="SpellE">Trino</span> <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> as assignees of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>
in respect of Lot 719, are strongly confirmatory of the award and sale of Lot
719 to Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> as being separate and distinct
from the award and sale of Lot 640 to Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>
and four others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether Sheet 15 of
Original Certificate of Title No. 614 containing an entry in the name of
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> relates to Lot 640 or to Lot 719,
does not strike this Court as a matter of pivotal value, given the finding that
Lot 640 appears to have been awarded to Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>
as evidenced by Sales Certificate No. 924 as indicated in Deed No. 18562, and
that Lot 719 likewise appears to have been awarded to the same Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> as evidenced by Sales Certificate No. 923.</blockquote>

<blockquote>While Sheet 15 of O.C.T. No. 614 has, in the opinion of this Court,
lost much of its impact in terms of probative value, the Court is not prepared
to disturb the findings of the then trial court that said sheet has reference
to Lot 719 as awarded to Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More to the point, this Court is not
convinced by the theory advanced by defendants during the new trial, the same
being predicated on the assumption that Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>
has been awarded only one lot, in the absence of a clear showing that such is
the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, assuming this
Court were so inclined, a <span style="">finding </span>that
the aforesaid Sheet 15 of O.C.T. No. 614 relates to Lot 640, which is not in
dispute, would not be relevant to the determination of the ownership of Lot 719
of the <span class="SpellE">Piedad</span> Estate, which is and must remain the
issue in this case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In order to resolve the main issue of ownership of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
719 of the <span class="SpellE">Piedad</span> Estate, this Court must address its
attention to the validity of the alleged assignment by Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 719 to <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> Martin and <span class="SpellE">Trino</span> <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court

consists of original documents alleged to have been executed way back in 1921

 <st1:placetype>Memorial Park</st1:placetype></st1:place> and not in custody by

the vital documents supporting the chain of transactions leading to the title
by defendant Memorial Park for Lot 719 of the <span class="SpellE">Piedad</span>
Estate, the following appear not to have been with the proper custodians or
repositories thereof, but rather in the possession of said defendant,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the Assignment by Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> in favor of <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span>

in favor of <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span> <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>

</span>These are facts of record which do not inspire the confidence of this
court in respect to the reliability of the said document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the established fact that the alleged
assignment purportedly made by Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> on
July 15, 1921 bears only a <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> although there
is proof of his competence to sign, constitutes strong basis to support a conclusion

<p class="BODY">As stated earlier, the findings of the trial court may not be
assailed by the petitioners in the present appeal where only questions of law
may be raised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conclusions drawn by
the trial court from the evidence on record are not erroneous.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court did not shift the burden of proof to the
petitioner-appellant, St. Peter Memorial Park, <span class="GramE">Inc..</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In appreciating not only the newly discovered
evidence but the original evidence of record, the trial court simply found that
the petitioners had failed to establish their affirmative allegation that
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> had assigned the Deed of Sale No. 923
to <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 719 in favor of <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion of the trial court that the title of the
respondents, successors in interest of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>,
prevails over the certificate of title of the petitioner-appellant St. Peter
Memorial Park, Inc. is based on the finding that Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>
did not make any assignment at all of Lot No. 719 to any person and that the
purported assignment of the land in question bearing only the supposed thumb
mark of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> is spurious.</p>

<p class="BODY">The finding of fact that the supposed deed of assignment of the
Deed of Sale of Lot No. 719 is spurious cannot be reviewed in this appeal under
R.A. 5440.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of the petitioners that the Deed of Assignment of
Lot No. 719 supposed to have been executed by Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>

<p class="BODY">The deed of assignment in question of Lot No. 719, although more
than thirty years old, was not produced from a custody in which it would
naturally be found if genuine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
found in the custody of the St. Peter Memorial Park, Inc., not in the folder of
the Bureau of Lands for Lot No. 719.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If,

the sale of Lot No. 719 by the Bureau of Lands in favor of <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span>

the deed of assignment should have been placed in the folder of the Bureau of

given why the deed of assignment of Lot No. 719 in favor of <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span>

was produced from the possession of St. Peter Memorial Park, <span class="GramE">Inc..</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, the deed of
assignment was principally signed by one <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> who was not a co-owner of Lot No. 719.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>,
who was the sole owner of said lot, was only a co-assignor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although he could write his name, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> did not sign the deed of assignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There appears only a thumb mark over the
typewritten name of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These suspicious circumstances were not
explained by the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deed
of assignment cannot be presumed genuine and authentic under Sec. 22, Rule 132
of the Revised Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
not produced from a custody in which it would naturally be found if genuine and
it is blemished by circumstances of suspicion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the petitioner, St. Peter Memorial Park, Inc., was
in possession of the deed of assignment of Lot No. 719 which the trial court
found to be spurious is a badge of bad faith.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trial court found
that Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span> was in the continuous and quiet
possession of the land in question, Lot No. 719, until his death in 1945.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact shows that he did not assign said
land to any person.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The St. Peter Memorial
Park, Inc. could not have failed to know or discover that the land, Lot No.
719, sold to it was in the adverse possession of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>
and his heirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said petitioner, St.
Peter Memorial Park, Inc., is not a buyer in good faith of the land in
question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

respondents, <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>
