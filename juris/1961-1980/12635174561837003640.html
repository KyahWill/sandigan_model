				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal taken by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> Workers
Union pursuant to Section 4, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court from an order issued
on March 3, 1965 by the respondent Court of Industrial Relations in its Case
No. 731-ULP entitled "<span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> Workers Union,
complainant, vs. Manila Electric Company, respondent," and from said
court's subsequent resolution dated April 2 of the same year denying peti­tioner's
motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 28, 1955 petitioner Union filed an unfair labor practice
case against the Manila Electric Company, <span style="">a
</span>duly organized domestic public utility corporation - referred to
hereinafter as <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> - docketed as Case No. 731-ULP
of the respondent court, praying for the reinstatement of <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alcancia</span>, <span style="">a </span>union
member, to his former position as bill collector, with back wages, and praying
further that <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> be ordered to bargain
collectively in good faith with its employees or their representatives by
implementing the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement entered into
between them on April 29, 1955, particularly Section 7 thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> answered
alleging principally that its bill collector <span class="SpellE">Alcancia</span>
was dismissed because he had mis­appropriated and converted to his own use
collections made by him amounting to the sum of P593.00, and alleg­ing further
that it had faithfully complied with all the provisions of the bargaining
agreement of <st1:date month="4" day="29" year="1955">April 29, 1955</st1:date>
mentioned in the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due
hearing the CIR, through Associate Judge Amanda C. <span class="SpellE">Bugayong</span>,
rendered its decision on December 20, 1961, the <span class="SpellE">dis­positive</span>
portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the charges of unfair labor
practices against the res­pondent should be, as they are hereby, dis­missed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, however, without enforc­ing the
agreements between the parties which gave rise to some of the disputes herein,
hereby enjoins the parties to comply with the same as it was approved by this
Court in Case No. 7-IPA, since anyway the parties do not have any objection to
its literal <span class="GramE">implementation</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The agreement referred to in the above-quoted portion of the CIR
decision is the collective bargaining agreement entered into between the
petitioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place>, on the one hand, and the <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span>, on the other, on <st1:date year="1955" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1955</st1:date> which, upon submission to <span style="">said </span>court in <u>Case No. 7-<span class="GramE">IPA<span style="text-decoration: none;">,</span></span></u>
was approved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said case arose out of the
exercise of com­pulsory arbitration power of the CIR under Section 10 of
Republic Act No. 875, and involved the <span style="">same
</span>parties <span style="">as </span>Case No.
731-ULP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The implementation of the
aforesaid bargaining agreement, which was one of the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>
prayed for in the complaint filed by petitioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place> in
Case No. 731-ULP, had been clarified by the parties thereto on <st1:date month="5" day="19" year="1955">May 19, 1955</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because it explains what the CIR said in the
appealed decision ("This Court, however, without en­forcing the agreements
between the parties which gave rise to some of the disputes herein hereby
enjoins the parties to comply with the same etc"), We quote the following
from said decision:</p>

<blockquote>"CASE OF THE ALLEGED REFUSAL OF THE RESPONDENT TO BARGAIN
COLLECTIVELY IN GOOD FAITH BY FAILING TO COMPLY WITH THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING
AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BY THE PARTIES ON <st1:date month="4" day="29" year="1955">APRIL 29, 1955</st1:date></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It <span style="">is </span>not
disputed by the parties that they entered into <span style="">a </span>collective bar­gaining agreement on April 29, 1955 con­taining
a provision, particularly Section 7 thereof, to wit:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">'Classification of Employees Positions and
Standardization of Salaries.</span></p>

<p class="2Q">'The UNION accepts the plan of classification of positions and
standardization of salaries as pre­pared and produced by the COMPANY, in
pursuance of Section 7 of the former Agreement of December 22, 1953, and the
COMPANY shall put it into effect after, and not before satisfying or complying
with the following condition:</p>

<p class="3Q">That (a) <span style="">all </span>employees
receiving salaries or wages up to P250.00 per month or its equivalent will be
granted an automatic increase of thirteen per cent (13%) over their pre­sent
salaries or wages and (b) employees receiving salaries or wages above P250.00
per month or its equivalent will be grant­ed an automatic increase of six and
one half per cent (6-1/2%) over their present salaries or wages; it being
understood that the final rates will be to the nearest centavo per hour or the
nearest peso per month.</p>

<p class="2Q">'It is mutually understood and agreed by and between the parties
herein that the classification of positions and standardization of salaries are
not deemed to be final and in­flexible, but may be subject to such charges or
amendments as the parties herein may mutually agree from time to time.'</p>

<blockquote>This agreement was marked as Exhibit 'C'
and Section 7 thereof as Exhibit ‘C-1’.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The question presented before this Court is whether or not the Company
is guilty of bargaining in bad faith by not alleged­ly implementing the
provision on the wage increase regarding the employees who were receiving
P300.00 a month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that this
agreement between the parties was deemed to be effective as of <st1:date month="1" day="1" year="1955">January 1, 1955</st1:date>, subject to such
changes and amendments that the parties may agree on from time to time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the intervening period, there were questions raised in the
minds of both par­ties as to the implementation of Sec. 7 of the
agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A conciliation meeting was
held on May 19, 1955 between the parties herein with Mr. H. B. Reyes and <span style="">A. J. </span><span class="SpellE">Buen­viaje</span>
representing the respondent, while P. <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span>, S. <span class="SpellE">Bunao</span>, N. Cote, J. <span class="SpellE">Campoma­nes</span>,
and J. <span class="SpellE">Croox</span> representing the com­plainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The minutes of that meeting now forms part of
the record and is marked Ex­hibit '10’.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From the minutes of that meet­ing between the parties, it appears that
the following transpired:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first matter brought out by the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
is the matter of salary increases, in accordance with the agreement, of
employees receiving P300.00 and up per month.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mr. Re­yes explained to the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> that im­mediately
after the agreement was signed he ordered the increase of salaries of employees
whose salaries are reviewed on the 1st of January of each year effective <st1:date month="1" day="1" year="1955">January 1, 1955</st1:date>, in accordance with
the agree­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That employees whose
salaries are reviewed on the anniversary dates of employment have also been
reviewed as of the 1st day of the month of their anniversary dates of
employment, and others not reviewed heretofore will be reviewed during the year
1955 on the 1st days of the months of their employ­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Reyes explained that this is in
accordance with the established po­licy regarding employees whose salaries are
reviewed on the anniversary dates of their employment because their sala­ries
have respectively been reviewed throughout the year 1954, from January to
December.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this explanation, the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
has agreed to such a policy and is satisfied with the Company's pro­cedure of
reviewing the salaries of these particular employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same agree­ment has been reached between
the Com­pany and the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> in the matter of the review
of salaries of hourly paid employees whose total monthly salary rates amounts
to P300.00 and above.</p>

<blockquote>This minutes was signed by <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> J. <span class="SpellE">Buenviaje</span> for the
respondent and Nicolas Cote for the complainant as secretary thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant contends that <span class="GramE">this
minutes</span> could not have al­tered the agreement of the parties because it
was not acted upon and approved by its board of directors and/or its members in
general.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was further alleged that Mr.
Cote could not have signed for the union.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, complainant repudiated what transpired in the
conciliation meeting between the parties on <st1:date month="5" day="19" year="1955">May 19, 1955</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
questioning of the capacity of Cote to sign the minutes and the repudiation of
the agreement arrived at in that concilia­tion could not be sustained because,
as Exhibits '10-A', 10-B', '10-C', '10-D', 10-E', '10-F’, '<span style="">10-G', '10-H’, and ‘10-I’ show, Mr. Cote has
previously signed the minutes of other conciliation meetings between the
parties therein and the complainant has never re­pudiated any of what
transpired or was agreed upon in these meetings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court can not see any reason why
complainant should go back on what was agreed upon in the conciliation meeting
of </span><st1:date month="5" day="19" year="1955"><span style="">May 19, 1955</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must also be considered that Mr. <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span> and other responsible officials of complainant were
present in that meet­ing and did not present any objections to what had been
agreed upon, indicating that they have agreed to it, as in fact they did.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The question now <span style="">is </span>not
a question of whether the agreement entered into by the parties upon the
intervention of this court through the Honorable Associate Judge Juan L. <span class="SpellE">Lanting</span> was violated or not since this Court has no
jurisdiction to enforce collective bargaining agreements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was the doctrine enunciated in the case
of the Philippine Sugar Institute (G. R. No. L-13098, dated <st1:date month="10" day="29" year="1959">October 29, 1959</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, the question to be decided is
whether or not the respondent en­tered into the agreement without any intention
of complying with the same for if so, bad faith may be imputed upon it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this bad faith could not be imputed upon
the respondent even granting that they did not follow the agreement to the
letter on the point in question since it appears that this matter was taken up
in <span style="">a </span>conciliation meeting
between the parties wherein they were properly represented and wherein the
policy of the Company to the effect that the increase in pay equivalent to
6-1/2% was to be reviewed and granted on the anniversary month of the
employment of the employees con­cerned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As has been pointed out, the complainant did not oppose this policy
which the Company broached <span style="">as </span>the
one it would follow in implement­ing the collective bargaining agreement of the
parties regarding the wage increase of its em­ployees receiving above P250.00 <span style="">a </span>month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there was no bad faith, there could not
have been a refusal to bargain in good faith.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must also be remembered that the agreement was entered into through
the conciliatory powers of this Court, presided by the then Associate Judge
Juan L. <span class="SpellE">Lanting</span> who attested and approved the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The agreement was not entered into
in the concept of free collective bargaining as now outlined by Republic <span style="">Act No. </span>875, the very act under which
respondent is prosecuted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should also
be noted that there is nothing on the record to show that the respondent
followed its announced policy in implementing the wage increase in question to
dis­criminate against union members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, the evidence shows or tends to show that the application of that policy
was univer­sal regardless of the union membership or activities of the
employees concerned.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is a well-settled rule that before any party may be found <span style="">guilty </span>of unfair la­bor practice, it
is essential to show that such party discriminated against union mem­bers or
against employees in order to dis­courage, interfere, or in any way meddle into
the union activities of such employees.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, after considering the fact that the acts imputed by
complainant upon the respondent and alleged to be unfair labor practice acts were
agreed upon and executed only after a conciliation meeting with the responsible
officials of the complainant it could not be said that the Company or the
respondent herein is guilty of unfair labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be recalled that the causes of the
implementation of the <span style="">policy </span>and
the reasons thereof were announced to the responsible officials of the
complainant in that conciliation meeting on May 19, 1955, is too farfetched to
hold that the Company, the respondent herein, intended to commit un­fair labor
practice acts when the acts im­puted against it were first announced to the
union to which the latter agreed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At this juncture, it is noteworthy to mention that the
implementation of Section 7 of the agreement as proposed by the respondent and
agreed upon by complainant in the conciliation meeting of <st1:date month="5" day="19" year="1955">May 19, 1955</st1:date> was more advantageous to the
employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the agreement the wage
increase is to be implemented only once during the three years duration of the
contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While under the policy of the
respondent to which, as has been said, complainant agreed, the wage increase in
the percentages set forth in the agreement is to be implemented or granted not
once but every first of the month of the anni­versary of the employment of each
and every one of the employees concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, during the three years dura­tion of the contract between
the parties, the wage increase will be implemented thrice instead of once <span style="">as </span>said contract seems to imply before
the parties held a conciliation meeting on <st1:date month="5" day="19" year="1955">May 19, 1955</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">This again </span>is another factor which the
Court took into consideration when disposing of this issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The general welfare of the <span class="GramE">respondents</span>
em­ployees was paramount in the mind of the Court."</blockquote>

taken into consideration the fact that the agreement in question arose out of
the exercise of compulsory arbitra­tion by this Court under Section 10 of <span style="">Republic </span>Act No. 875.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That case involves the same parties herein
and was docketed as Case No. 7-IPA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
it may be added that agreements arrived at pursuant to the exercise of the
powers of this Court under Section 10 of Republic Act No. 875 <span style="">may </span>be abandoned, amended or altered

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Union admits that respondent <span class="SpellE">Pangilalo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span>, a member of the Philippine Bar, <span style="">a </span>clerk-typist in the Engineering

signed and filed all the pleadings and appeared for <span style="">the Union in all the </span>hearings <span style="">and other proceedings had in <u>Case No. 7-IPA</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on July 11, 1962, or more than <span style="">seven </span>years after the collective
bargaining agreement mentioned heretofore was entered into by petitioner Union
and <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> and approved by the respondent Court in <u>Case
No. 7-IPA</u>, respondent <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span> <span style="">filed in his own behalf in <u>Case </u></span><u>No.
731-ULP</u> a "Motion for Execution and Notice of Attorney's <span style="">Lie</span>n" alleging that the collective
bargaining agreement already referred to had an estimated monetary benefit for
the members of petitioner Union amounting to about P2,000,000; that petitioner
had retained him as counsel in Case No. 7-IPA on a contingent basis of 20% of
the total mone­tary benefits that might accrue in favor of the employees of <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> as a result of said case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon these facts he prayed the respondent
court (1) to order the computation of all the benefits received or to be
received by the mem­bers of the petitioner <span style="">Union by virtue of the award in </span>Cases 7-IPA and 731-ULP and (2)
to order further that 20% <span style="">thereof be

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span> served no notice of the motion
abovementioned on, petitioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place>, <span style="">for which reason during the hearing held in </span>connection
therewith <span style="">the CIR issued an </span>order
requir­<span style="">ing him to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The notice was subsequently served on
Nicolas Cote, at the time President of petitioner Union, who subsequently
appeared <span style="">and </span>manifested that
while the <span style="">Union had no objection to <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan's</span> claim for </span>attorney's <span style="">fees in so far as the supervisory employees
of <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> were concerned, he, however, prayed that

claim in so far <span style="">as </span>it affected
other members of the Union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">having </span>been granted, <span style="">petitioner Union filed its opposition on
October </span>21, 1962 alleging the following as grounds <span style="">in </span>support there­of: that <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan's</span> retention as counsel for petitioner <span style="">Union </span>was <span style="">made through </span>misrepresentation and <span style="">did not reflect the true intention of </span>the Union; that the <span style="">services for </span>which he was claiming
compensation were primarily rendered by him as President of petitioner Union at
that time and that, <span style="">as </span>such
President, he was receiving due <span style="">compensation;
that he </span>had already been paid for whatever services he had rendered <span style="">as </span>the Union's counsel in Case No.
7-IPA; that the award in Case No. 7-IPA - which was the approved version of <span style="">the </span><span style="">bargaining agreement entered into between petitioner Union and <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> - was not the result of <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan's</span>
legal services but was due to the efforts exerted by the Union and Management,
and that, at any rate, the contingent fees of 20% of the monetary benefits
awarded under said bargaining agreement were exorbitant and un­conscionable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1965</st1:date>
the CIR, through Judge <span class="SpellE">Bugayong</span>, issued the appealed
order granting, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, res­pondent <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan's</span> claim for attorney's fees on <span style="">a </span>20% contingent basis estimated to
amount to P400<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This, according to petitioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place>, was done
without giving it a chance to be heard and present evidence in support of its
opposition filed as mentioned heretofore.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On March 13, 1965 petitioner Union filed <span style="">a </span>motion for re­consideration alleging, among other things, that
res­pondent <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span> was not retained by it as its
counsel in Case No. 7-IPA because he was then its President; that the
resolution attesting to his retention as counsel and his right to compensation
was not only approved by less than a majority of petitioner's Board of
Directors but was secured through fraud and misrepresentation; that, as stated
in a sworn statement subscribed by three mem­bers of <span style="">said </span>Board of Directors (Salvador <span class="SpellE">Bunao</span>,
Ale­jandro Santos and Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>), the alleged
resolu­tion was signed by them in 1962 and not in February 26, 1955 as the
aforesaid resolution purported to show.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <span style="">March 18, 1965 <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span> filed his opposition to the aforesaid motion for
reconsideration <span class="SpellE">controverting</span> the grounds relied upon
therein, to which petitioner Union filed </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">reply on April 15 of
the same year in which it alleged, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, that
the respondent court had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the pending
incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few days later, <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> moved the CIR to set the matter for oral argument
before the Court en banc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without
expressly passing upon this latter motion, the CIR denied the </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style="">’s motion for reconsideration as well as a
similar motion filed by <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Apart from the present appeal before <span class="GramE">Us</span>
taken by peti­tioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span>
had appealed from the same order and resolution on <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1965</st1:date> (G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-24453).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal, however, was dismissed by <span class="GramE">Us</span> on May 19 of the same year.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of the present appeal, petitioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
has submitted for consideration the following propositions:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the CIR has no jurisdiction to determine
and award attorney's fees <span style="">in </span>a
case involving purely a labor dispute; (2) that even if it had such
jurisdiction, it had no authority to do it in Case No. 731-ULP, nor to issue an
order in said Case No. /31-ULP for the execution of its award of attorney's
fees in favor of respondent <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span>, the alleged
legal services of the latter having been rendered in another labor case
terminated seven years before; (3) that the CIR had no jurisdiction to grant
affirmative relief or any other kind of relief in an unfair labor practice case
after finding that the res­pondent therein had not committed the unfair labor
practice charged and was, therefore, acquitted; and finally, that assuming that
it had the authority to consider and make the award of attorney's fees for
legal services rendered in Case No. 7-IPA and order its execution in Case No.
731- ULP, it had no authority to make the award and order its execution without
giving the party ordered to pay the attorney's fees an opportunity to present
evidence in support of <span style="">its </span>opposition
to the claim for attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above propositions being interrelated, <span class="GramE">We</span>
shall consider them jointly.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Gaerlan's</span> right to collect attorney's
fees is pre­dicated upon legal services allegedly rendered by him to petitioner
Union and its members in connection with Case No. 7-IPA - a case involving the
exercise of compulsory arbitration power by the CIR under Republic Act No. 875
in which it had approved a collective bargaining agree­ment entered into
between the parties therein (petitioner Union and <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span>)
on April 29, 1955.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Case No. 731-ULP was an Unfair Labor Practice
case filed by petitioner Union against <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> on
March 3, 1965 for the reinstatement of <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Alcancia</span>, a <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> bill
collector and member of the Union, and for an order requiring <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> to bargain collectively in good faith with its
employees or their representatives by implementing the provisions of the
aforesaid collective bargaining agreement of April 29, 1955, particularly
Section 7 thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As heretofore
adverted to, the charge for un­fair labor practice was dismissed, and, in
relation to the other relief prayed for, the CIR declined to <u><span style="">enforce</span></u><span style=""> </span>the collective bargaining agreement limiting itself to <u><span style="">enjoini</span></u><u><span style="">ng</span></u><span style=""> </span>the
parties thereto to comply with its provisions <span style="">as </span>approved by it in Case No. 7-IPA.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is patent that it was error for respondent <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span>
to file his motion for award of attorney's fees and for execution in <u>Case
No. 731-ULP</u>, in the same manner that it was error for the CIR to entertain
such motion and to issue the writ, in said case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This conclusion is fortified by the fact
that, in the appealed order itself, the CIR held - following the doctrine laid
down in the case of Philippine Sugar Institute vs. CIR et al. (106 Phil. 401) -
that it has no jurisdiction to enforce collective bargaining agreements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore clear, that Case No. 7-IPA
which ended with a Collective Bargaining Agree­ment submitted to and approved by
the CIR, is the proper forum for the consideration of the professional fees due
to the lawyers who appeared for the parties therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner claims, however, that the CIR, being a court of
limited jurisdiction, has no authority to resolve <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan's</span>
claim for attorney's fees, which should be the subject of an ordinary civil
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated heretofore, <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan's</span>
claim for attorney's fees can not be entertained in Case No. 731-ULP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, however, does not apply to Case No.
7-IPA, the subject matter of which - both parties concede - was within the
jurisdiction of the CIR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter, con­sequently,
must be deemed to have jurisdiction, of all incidental matters connected with
the main issue - such as the professional fees due to the lawyers who repre­sented
the parties - even if a considerable period of time has already elapsed since
their services were ren­dered.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, even if we were to hold that the claim for attorney's
fees under consideration may be entertained in Case No. 731-ULP, We would be
constrained to set aside the order and resolution appealed from on the ground
of lack of procedural due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated heretofore, upon being served with notice of the claim
for attorney's fees and motion for execution filed by respondent, <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span>, petitioner Union, through its President at the
time, Mr. Cote, appeared and manifested that while the Union had no opposition
to the claim in so far as the supervisory employees of <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span>
were concerned, he asked for time to file an opposition thereto in so far as it
adversely affected other employees of <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="">a </span>matter
of fact, on <st1:date month="11" day="8" year="1962">November 8, 1962</st1:date>
petitioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place>, through its President, filed a formal
written opposition to <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Gaerlan's</span></span><span style=""> claim </span>and motion, raising substantial
issues whose resolution required a hearing and presentation of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among them were that <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan's</span>
retention as counsel for the Union was procured through misrepresentation and
did not reflect the true intention of the Union; that <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan's</span>
appearance in Case No. 7-IPA was in his capacity as President of the Union and
not par­ticularly as counsel; that even if he had appeared as counsel, his
services <span style="">as </span>such had already
been duly <span style="">com­pensated; </span>that the
collective bargaining agreement executed by the parties in Case No. 7-IPA was
arrived at not through the efforts and services of <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span>
but through those of <span style="">Management and the
Union; that the Board resolution pur</span>suant to which <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan's</span>
legal services were engaged was <span style="">not
approved on February 26, 1955, as claimed by him, but sometime in 1962, and
that said resolution was not </span>binding upon the Union because it <span style="">was approved with the vote of less than the
majority of the members of its Board of Directors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the above issues there appears nothing in the
record sufficient to overcome the Union's contention that there had been no
formal hearing; that it had not been given sufficient opportunity to present
its evidence; and that after the filing of its opposition the next notice that
it received was in connection with the order of the CIR of March 3, 1965 which
is the order appealed from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bearing in
mind that the claim for attor­ney's fees in question may reach the considerable
amount <span style="">of P400<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
- an amount that may not be justified by the nature of the professional </span>services
rendered – <span style="">We are </span>of the opinion,
and so hold, that it should have been the subject of a careful hearing, with
full opportunity given to both parties to the controversy to present what­ever
evidence they had to support their respective con­tentions.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE,</span></b><span style=""> the order and resolution appealed from </span>are
hereby set aside, without prejudice to the right of respondent <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span> to file his claim for attorney's fees in Case No.
7-IPA, where it should be resolved <span style="">after
giving </span>all the interested parties an opportunity to be heard in
accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Without
costs.</span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I concur fully with the main opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, but wish to add these brief comments to the <u>caveat</u>
therein that res­pondent's belated claim for attorney's fees and petitioner's
strong opposition thereto should be "the subject of a careful hear­ing,
with full opportunity given to both parties to the controversy to present
whatever evidence they had to support their respective contentions."</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been noted that in most of these cases of attorneys' fees,
the industrial court summarily grants the attorney's claim for stipulated
contingent fees ranging from 20% to 30% of the total monetary benefits accruing
to the workers and orders the direct segregation and payment thereof, without
considering the reasonableness thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This has led to complaints of exploita­tion of the workers, which,
however, do not reach this Court because of the workers' inhibition and
reluctance to question 'their leaders' actions, apathy or ignorance.</p>

<p class="BODY">I believe that all such claims for attorneys' fees should be the
subject of careful hearing by the court, and where, as in this case, the
attorney is also the president of the workers' union, the court should be more
cautious in assessing the claim, because the union president, as such, is
already compensated for his ser­vices by the workers from their union dues, in
the same manner that an executor or administrator of an estate may not charge
against the estate any professional fee for legal services rendered by him,
because he is already compensated as such executor or administrator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Rule 85, section 7).</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing ordered by the Court, the industrial court should
take into consideration the Court's admonition in <span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Gochangco</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
that that "(F)<span class="SpellE">rom</span> <span class="SpellE">Bachrach</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Golingco</span>, 39 Phil. , 138 (rendered in 1918) to <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Suntay</span>, 102 Phil. ,
769, Dec­ember 28, 1957, this Court has repeatedly fixed counsel fees on a <u>quantum
<span class="SpellE">meruit</span></u> basis whenever the fees stipulated appear
ex­cessive, unconscionable, or unreasonable, because a lawyer is primarily a
court officer charged with the duty of assisting the court in administering
impartial justice between the parties, and hence, his fees should be subject to
judicial control."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fixing fees
on a <u>quantum <span class="SpellE">meruit</span></u> basis, Rule 138, section
24 provides three essential factors: (1) the importance of the subject matter
of the controversy; (2) extent of the services rendered; and (3) the
professional standing of the attorney.</p>

<p class="BODY">These factors in determining an attorney's fair compensa­tion
were long amplified upon and discussed in Delgado vs. De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
as follows: "The amount and character Of the servi­ces rendered; the
labor, time, and trouble involved; the nature and importance of the litigation
or business in which the services were rendered; the responsibility imposed;
the amount of money or the value of the property affected by the controversy,
or in­volved in the employment; the skill and experience called for in the
performance of the services; the professional character and social standing of
the attorney; the results secured; and whether or not the fee is absolute or
contingent, it being a recognized rule that an attorney may properly charge a
much larger fee when it is to be contingent than when it is not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The financial ability of the defendant may
also be considered by the jury, not to enhance the amount above a reasonable
compensation, but to determine whether or not he is able to pay a fair and just
compensation for the services rendered, or as an incident in ascertaining the
im­portance and gravity of the interests involved in the litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But what is a reasonable fee must in a large
measure depend upon the facts of each particular case, and be determined like'
any other fact in issue in a judicial proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While opinions are receivable and entitled to
due weight, the courts are also well qualified to form an independent judgment
on such questions and it is their duty to do so."</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition to the foregoing, the novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved, the customary charges of the bar for similar services (and
this should include a survey of the charges of manage­ment lawyers, who have
complained that labor lawyers charge much more than they) and the character of
the employment, whe­ther casual or for an established client.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
An additional vital factor in labor cases is that although hundreds or
thousands of workers may be involved in the controversy, thus giving rise to
the large amounts involved, the controversy involved is generally the same and
does not call for the exertion of special and addi­tional services and efforts
in proportion to the number of workers involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the litigation is supported by the
workers' union dues, a 20%-30% fee from the monetary benefit resulting to the
indivi­dual worker would not appear to be a reasonable nor contingent fee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be justified to the Court that the
union leadership explained fully to the rank and file the extent and amount
involved in contingent fee contracts and that they were given the alterna­tive
of opting for a fixed fee contract for the attorney's services.</p>
