				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A rather unique feature of this administrative complaint for immorality
as well as malpractice filed against respondent Martin V. <span class="SpellE">Delgra</span>,
Jr., was that complainant was a third party, not the alleged victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basis for the former was his relationship
with a, certain Francisca <span class="SpellE">Cañada</span> with whom he was
alleged to have lived <span class="SpellE">maritally</span> for some time without
benefit of clergy, as a result of which two children were born, her consent to
such relationship being based on a promise of his loving her "until death"
but which thereafter was conveniently forgotten.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An affidavit was signed by her to that
effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was apparently written <span style="">by </span><span style="">a person </span>with more than just a cursory acquaintance with the
English language.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The malpractice
complaint was based on the alleged acquisition through fraud by<span style=""> </span>him of a parcel of land in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.
Respondent was required to answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">charge </span>of immorality he sought to meet
by a retraction <span style="">from </span>Francisca <span class="SpellE">Cañada</span>, who in <span style="">her </span>affidavit,
very likely prepared likewise for her, asserted: "that while Atty. Martin <span class="SpellE">Delgra</span>, Jr. and I were not lucky to be married, perhaps by
the will of fate, I am still proud of him and grateful to him, especially that
with his attention our two children, [<span class="SpellE">Nimfa</span>] and [<span style="">Fe <span class="SpellE">Luchi</span>], </span>have
graduated from college with honors:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[<span class="SpellE">Nimfa</span>] having graduated from <span class="SpellE">Colegio</span>
<span style="">de San Jose-<span class="SpellE">Recoletos</span>
in April, 1970, with the degree of B.S.C., cum laude, and [</span><span style="">Fe <span class="SpellE">Luchi</span>] </span><span style="">from the University of San Carlos in March,
1975 with the degree of B.S.C., also </span>cum <span style="">laude, and the latter -- </span><span style="">by
</span><span style="">the grace of God, and with </span>his
father's attention -- recently passed the Board for C.P.A."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
There was a denial therein of the alleged acquisition through fraud of the
parcel of land <span style="">"for </span>being
unsubstantiated."</p>

<p class="BODY">The matter was then <span style="">referred
</span>to the Office of the Solicitor General for investigation, report and
recommendation on <st1:date year="1977" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting Solicitor General Vicente V.

City requesting him to conduct an investigation to ascertain whether it was
Atty. Martin V. <span class="SpellE">Delgra</span>, Jr. who had reportedly died
on February 7, 1977, and if so, to furnish our Office with <span style="">a </span>certified true copy of the death
certificate of the said person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * On
May 23, 1977, the Office of the Solicitor General received an 'Investigation
Report' from Capt. Benjamin A. <span class="SpellE">Ibones</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Metro Police District, to the effect that it was Atty.
