THE PHILIPPINES, INC., AND THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> Dealers Association <span style="">of </span>the Philippines Inc. is a duly
organized Labor Union composed of operators of company-owned outlets of the
petroleum pro­ducts of petitioner CALTEX (<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>)
Inc. and is duly registered with the Department of Labor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Case No. 3970-ULP filed by said Association with the respondent
court against petitioner is for alleged unfair labor practice consisting of the
latter's refusal to meet, confer and bargain with the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's defense was that it is not under
any obligation to meet and bargain with the Association because, as between
them, there <span class="GramE">existed</span> no employer-employee relationship,
said Association being composed of independent entrepreneurs or businessmen
and/or independent contractors.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">In
the course of the hearing of said case, the res­pondent court, upon motion of
the Association, issued </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">a </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">subpoena <span class="SpellE">duces</span> <span class="SpellE">tecum</span>
pursuant to which petitioner produced documents known as "<span class="SpellE">DAPLs</span>", meaning District Authorized Price Letters.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">In
a subsequent hearing held on November 29, 1965, </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">upon motion of </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">the Association,
the respondent court again issued, over the objection of herein petitioner,
another subpoena <span class="SpellE">duces</span> <span class="SpellE">tecum</span>
requiring the production in court of similar documents covering the following
dealers of petitioner:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Pian</span>, Tan Bong <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Nocum</span>, <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> Tan, Pedro Interior and <span class="SpellE">Torquato</span>
Carlos, for the years 1964 and 1965. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>On
December 4, 1965 petitioner moved to quash </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">said </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">subpoena on the
ground that the documents sought to be produced were immaterial and merely
cumulative; that the subpoena was unreasonable and oppressive, and that the
apparent purpose of the Association was </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">merely to "fish for evidence".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was denied by the trial court in </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">its order of </span></span><st1:date year="1966" day="6" month="1"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">January 6, 1966</span></span></st1:date><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">, and
petitioner's motion for reconsideration filed thereafter was likewise denied by
the Court of Industrial Relations en banc on March 12 of the same year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon petitioner filed with said court a
notice of appeal, and on </span></span><st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="3"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">March 30, 1966</span></span></st1:date><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> it filed the
present petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>
praying that the respondent court's order of </span></span><st1:date year="1966" day="6" month="1"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">January 6, 1966</span></span></st1:date><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> and resolution of </span></span><st1:date year="1966" day="12" month="3"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">March 12, 1966</span></span></st1:date><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> be reversed.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">Petitioner's
contention that the documents which the subpoena <span class="SpellE">duces</span>
<span class="SpellE">tecum</span> requires it to produce are immaterial or, at
best, merely cumulative do not sustain its claim that the respondent court
erred in issuing said process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
first place, if they are of the same nature as the documents which it bad
already produced at a previous hearing of the case before the respondent court
by virtue of a previous subpoena <span class="SpellE">duces</span> <span class="SpellE">tecum</span>, there is every reason to believe that the documents
covered by the second subpoena <span class="SpellE">duces</span> <span class="SpellE">tecum</span> are also material because the petition under
consideration makes no claim or pretense that the documents already pro­duced
are immaterial to the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To a certain
extent, therefore, petitioner is already <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
from raising this question.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">As
regards petitioner's contention that the same documents are merely cumulative,
the following must be taken into consideration: the <span class="SpellE">DAPLs</span>
already produced by petitioner cover the CALTEX service stations in the area
under the supervision of a certain Mr. Rafael <span class="SpellE">Monserrat</span>,
its supervisor for a portion of Manila, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City
and Sun Juan, while the <span class="SpellE">DAPLs</span> sought to he produced
under the questioned subpoena cover service stations located in a different
area of supervision and are intended to prove the extent of the particular
control and supervision of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>petitioner
company over the members of the Association <span style="">in </span>that area - which might or might not be the same as the control
and supervision exercised by the same party over members of the Association in
other areas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Strictly speak­ing,
therefore, the documents required of petitioner are not purely cumulative in
character.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">Petitioner's
claim that the subpoena is unreasonable and oppressive by reason of the
voluminous documents to be produced <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> is
likewise untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Association
alleges - and this has not been sufficiently <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
- that said documents are definite, particular­ized, refer to specific periods
and, in fact: lesser in number than the documents produced by petitioner heretofore.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">As
far as the Association’s purpose "to fish for evidence" is concerned,
it must be observed that "fishing for evidence" is not prohibited but
allowed under the present Rules of Court on Discovery and Deposition, for the
reason that it enables litigants adequately to prepare their pleadings and for
trial, this, in turn, resulting often in the simplification or reduction of <span class="SpellE">triable</span> issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
this is the practice under the Rules of Court, a fortiori it may be allowed in
courts' of the nature of the respondent court whose proceedings are not even
strictly subject to the ordinary rules of procedure.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">, the order and resolution appealed from are
hereby affirmed, with costs.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
