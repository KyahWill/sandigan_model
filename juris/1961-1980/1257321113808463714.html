				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On February 1, 1956, Bernardino Albuera, husband of Proserfina Buelo, 
subscribed to a complaint charging Protacio Mandapas and Heracleo Inopia with 
the crime of attempted rape with robbery before the Justice of the Peace Court 
of Baleno, Masbate. Having pleaded not guilty to the charge and waived their 
right to the preliminary investigation, on motion of the accused, the court 
forwarded the record of the case to the court of first instance. On May 9, 1956, 
on motion of the fiscal praying that the case be returned to the court of origin 
for further proceedings on the ground that the complaint was not signed by the 
offended woman but by her husband, the record was returned as prayed for.
<p>Conformably to the order of the court of first instance, a new complaint for 
attempted rape with robbery was subscribed by the offended woman, after which 
the record was again forwarded to the court of first instance, where, on June 
29, 1956, the fiscal filed the corresponding information. It appears that the 
accused waived their right to be informed of the nature of the information at 
the same time entering a plea of not guilty to the charge. It also appears that 
defense counsel raised the question of the court's jurisdiction and asked for a 
five-day period to present a motion to quash, but before this could be done, the 
court, on July 16, 1956, upon finding that no preliminary investigation was 
conducted by the justice of the peace on the amended complaint, <i>motu 
proprio</i> dismissed the case "without prejudice to the refiling of the same in 
the proper court."</p>
<p>On July 17, 1957, another complaint subscribed by the same offended party 
charging the two accused with the same offense was filed before the Justice of 
the Peace Court of Baleno, Masbate. And having waived their right to the second 
stage of the preliminary investigation, the justice of the peace court 
transmitted the case to the court of first instance where, on November 29, 1957, 
the fiscal filed the corresponding information. On July 7, 1958, counsel for the 
accused filed a motion to quash on the ground of double jeopardy. This was 
opposed by the fiscal and, acting on both the motion and the opposition, the 
court <i>a quo</i> granted the motion and dismissed the information on the 
ground of double jeopardy. Hence this appeal. </p>
<p>It appears that after the complaint herein was amended by having it 
subscribed by the proper offended party, without conducting the requisite 
preliminary investigation, the justice of the peace court forwarded the record 
to the court of first instance where the fiscal filed the corresponding 
information as required by law, and that, upon finding that no such 
investigation has been made on the amended complaint, the court <i>a quo</i>, 
<i>motu proprio</i>, dismissed the case "without prejudice to the refiling of 
the same in the proper court." But after the case was refiled, on motion of 
defense counsel, the court <i>a quo</i> dismissed the information on the ground 
of double jeopardy. The government now comes before us complaining that the 
court <i>a quo</i> committed a miscarriage of justice in quashing the 
information on the aforesaid ground.</p>
<p>There is merit in the appeal. The thing that strikes our attention right from 
the start is the unwarranted attitude of the court <i>a quo</i> in dismissing 
the case <i>motu proprio</i> based on the wrong premise that the amended 
complaint was given due course by the justice of the peace court without first 
conducting the requisite preliminary investigation, albeit "without prejudice to 
the refiling of the same in the proper court." And then, after the case. was 
rented as suggested, the same court, without hesitation, granted the motion of 
defense counsel to quash on the ground of double jeopardy. This stand is not 
only erroneous but unwarranted. Erroneous because the court had no justification 
whatever in dismissing the case on the simple ground that it was given due 
course without the inferior court first conducting the requisite preliminary 
investigation, since this right, being waivable, does not argue against the 
validity of the proceeding, the most that could have been done being to remand 
the case in order that such investigation may be conducted. And it is 
unwarranted because after expressly providing that the dismissal was without 
prejudice to the refiling of the dame in the proper court, the court <i>a 
quo</i> adopted an inconsistent attitude when it dismissed the new information 
on the ground of double jeopardy. It is action such as this that gives rise to a 
miscarriage of justice. The court <i>a quo</i> should be admonished to be more 
careful in the performance of its official duties so that mistakes such as this 
may be avoided in the future.</p>
<p>The question that now confronts us is: Having the case been dismissed by the 
court <i>a quo</i> after the accused had pleaded not guilty, does the dismissal 
have the effect of barring further prosecution of the accused on the ground of 
double jeopardy?</p>
<p>Of course, there being a valid information before a competent court, and 
after the accused had pleaded not guilty, the dismissal of the original 
information may have the effect of barring further prosecution for the same 
offense, in the light of Section 9, Rule 113, of our Rules of Court. But here 
the dismissal was qualified; it was made without prejudice to the refiling of 
the case in the proper court. This, in our opinion, takes this case out of the 
purview of the rule regarding double jeopardy.</p>
<p>Thus, in Jaca vs. Blanco, 86 Phil., 452; 47 Off. Gaz. Sup. 12, p. 108, we 
held that the dismissal contemplated in the abovementioned section of the rule 
is a definite or unconditional dismissal which terminates the case, and not a 
dismissal without prejudice as in the present case. "In the absence of any 
statutory provision to the contrary, we find no reason why the court may not, in 
the interest of justice, dismiss a criminal case provisionally, i.e., without 
prejudice to reinstating it before the order becomes final or to the subsequent 
filing of a new information for the offense." And this ruling was reiterated in 
the recent case of People vs. Jabayab, G.R. Nos. L-9238-39, 100 Phil., 307<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>The court <i>a quo</i> therefore, erred in dismissing the case on the ground 
of double jeopardy.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order appealed from is hereby set aside. The case is remanded 
to the court a quo for further proceedings. No costs.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, 
Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br>
<hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<font color="#ff0000">[1]</font> "I concur. In my humble opinion the decisive fact 
which determines whether jeopardy attached upon the issuance of the order of 
dismissal is the provisional nature of the dismissal and the reservation of the 
right of the fiscal to 'refile these two cases if he so desires in the interest 
of Justice.' Jeopardy can be invoked only if the case is <i>finally</i> disposed 
of or terminated. Dismissal under Section 9 of Rule 113 implies <i>final 
dismissal</i>, a positive termination of the case. If the dismissal contains a 
reservation of the right to file another action, the case can not be said to 
have terminated and jeopardy does not attach. This is the reason for our ruling 
in Jaca vs. Blanco, 86 Phil., 452." (Concurring opinion of Justice Labrador)</div>
