conducted several hearings and on the basis of the documentary and testimonial

of First Instance, Branch I, <span class="SpellE">Marawi</span> City, and is
presently detailed in the Court of First Instance at <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span>
City; that the respondent was recommended as Deputy Clerk of Court, Court of
First Instance, Branch IV, <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City and to support
this recommendation, he attached his information sheet, dated August 19, 1975,
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "B"); that the respondent in
compliance with the Memorandum Circular (unnumbered), dated <st1:date year="1975" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1975</st1:date>, of Honorable Chief
Justice <span class="SpellE">Querube</span> <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>,
requiring all personnel of the Courts of First Instance, among others, to
accomplish their Information Sheet and Service Record Form to update their
personal files (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "H"), the respondent
accomplished and filed with the Supreme Court his Information Sheet and Service
Record Form, dated <st1:date year="1975" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1975</st1:date>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "C" to "C-5").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In both information sheets the respondent
made it appear that he is a graduate in Associate in Arts (Pre-Law) of the
University of the East, Manila, in 1952 and a graduate of law of the University
of Manila, Manila in 1967; that these information sheets are now filed in the
records of the Supreme Court; that <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copies of
these information sheets were obtained by the complainant from the Supreme
Court as a result of his letter-request dated July 28, 1976 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "A"); that the <st1:place><st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place> has no "such name of
the respondent as student who has been enrolled or graduated from the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Law</st1:placename></st1:place>" of the University (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "F"); that the records of the University of
the East failed to show that the respondent was enrolled in that institution (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "G").</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Respondent in his answer (and his written evidence which is a
substantial reproduction of his answer) maintains that his information sheet,
dated <st1:date year="1975" day="19" month="8">August 19, 1975</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "B"), <u>was made and filed for no specific
purpose.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not intended to seek
any promotional appointment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
assertion is contrary to Annex "O" of his answer (p. 55, Records)
which shows that he "was recommended to the position of Deputy Clerk of
Court, CFI and/or Clerk III in CFI, Branch V.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The evidence disclosed that this information sheet was used to accompany
that recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was used to show
his qualifications to the position to which he was recommended.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Respondent also maintains that his information sheet, dated
May 23, 1975, was '<u>just to update his 201 files</u>' in compliance with the
Memorandum Circular dated April 29, 1975 of the <span class="SpellE">CHief</span>
Justice of the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
no doubt that the Honorable Chief Justice has the authority to issue this
Memorandum Circular and faithful and honest compliance is expected of the
subject officials and personnel.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is nothing in respondent's answer (nor in his written
evidence) which substantiates his statements in his information sheets (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "B" and "C" to "C-5")
that he is a graduate of Associate in Arts (Pre-Law) of the University of the
East, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, in 1952 and a
graduate of law of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, in 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, the respondent asserts that these
information sheets were obtained by the complainant in violation of
respondent's right to be secured against unreasonable searches and seizures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This allegation, however, finds no support
from the records and the evidence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In brief, the respondent has made untruthful statements in
his information sheets (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "B",
"C", "C-1" to "C-5").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is misrepresentation as to his educational
attainment which constitutes an act of dishonesty and for this he cannot escape
disciplinary action in this administrative proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the length of service he has
rendered in the judiciary <span style="">since 1955,
it is recommended that the respondent be made to pay a fine equivalent to his
three (3) months salary as Clerk, Court of First Instance, </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Marawi</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">." (Emphasis </span>supplied).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Notwithstanding the
numerous documents and affidavits submitted by respondent to convince Us of his
worthiness as a public servant, there is, however, a dismal failure on his part
to contradict the concrete evidence of the charge <span class="SpellE">levelled</span>
against him, specifically, in making untruthful statements and
misrepresentations in his personal data sheets.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The evaluation of the evidence by the Investigating Judge is amply
supported by documentary proofs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent's answer to
the complaint to the effect that the questioned personal data sheets have not
been used by him in seeking promotion or any transaction for his retention and
that these have no purpose but to update his 201 file is an admission of the
fact of misrepresentation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
ought to know that whatever qualifications he labels himself in his information
sheet would be of much influence in the determination of his retention and/or
promotion in the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The finding by
the Investigating Judge that the information sheet of the respondent was used
to accompany the recommendation for the promotion of the respondent to the
position of Deputy Clerk of Court, CFI and/or Clerk III in CFI, Branch V
correctly disproved and demolished respondent's defense that said information
sheet was filed for no specific purpose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that respondent had repeated the same act of dishonesty and misrepresentation
as to his schooling in different universities and at different times comprising
the period from 1950 to 1967, showing that he finished Pre-Law, 4th year Law
and 1st year in Customs Administration shows a decided and not merely a <span class="SpellE">routinary</span> purpose to deceive and mislead his superior
officers in the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second and
subsequent act of misrepresentation clearly confirmed his duplicity and deceit
for which reason We hold that, although We agree with the findings of the
Investigating Judge that respondent is guilty of dishonesty as charged, the
recommended penalty of a fine equivalent to three months salary </span>is too
light, amounting to no more than a simple token or fee to quash this betrayal
of the public trust, a serious violation of a constitutional mandate committed
by the respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">One of the new and
salient features of the present Constitution is Art. XIII, entitled
Accountability of Public Officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
provision has enshrined the basic principle of good government that a public
office is a public trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 1 of
said Article is very explicit and clear that public officers and employees
shall serve with the highest degree of responsibility, integrity, loyalty and
efficiency, and shall remain accountable to the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted that it is the highest or the
superlative degree of integrity that is demanded of every officer and employee
in the government under this constitutional provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We shall be recreant to Our official duty of
upholding and defending the Constitution were We to ignore or treat lightly the
clear and <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span> betrayal of the public trust
committed by the respondent </span>in the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The people expects that the dishonest and the
corrupt must be weeded out from the government in order to maintain and
preserve inviolate the respect and confidence of the sovereign people.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding the respondent employee, a clerk in the
Court of First Instance, Branch I, <span class="SpellE">Marawi</span> City and
presently detailed in the Court of First Instance at <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span>
City, guilty of betraying public trust through his acts of dishonesty duly
established and admitted, he is hereby ordered dismissed from the service with
forfeiture of all retirement benefits and privileges and with prejudice to
reinstatement in any branch or agency of the public service, including government-owned
or controlled corporations.</p>
