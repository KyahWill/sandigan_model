				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a review of the decision dated July 26, 1963 of the Court
of First Instance of Bohol, Branch I, in criminal case 3670, convict­ing the
herein appellants Zosimo Equipilag, Liberato Bayotlang and Ricardo Bayotlang of
robbery with homicide under article 294(1) of the Revised Penal Code and
sentencing them to death in view of the presence of the aggravating
circumstances of dwelling, nighttime and abuse of superior strength.</p>

<p class="BODY">The acts imputed to the appellants occurred inside the house of
the spouses Isidoro and Filomena Orillosa situated in barrio Calunasan,
municipality of Calape, province of Bohol.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Filomena Orillosa narrated on the witness stand that in the wee hours of
March 29, 1963 she was awakened on hearing her husband, then in a room
adjoining hers, ask what it was that dropped.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After she replied that it might be a cat, Isidoro rejoined:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Please light the lamp in our room
because it is very dark."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As she
stood up to do so, she was confronted by a man holding a revolver and a
flashlight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The intruder pointed his gun
at Filomena and asked where her money was.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On being given a box with P10.00 inside, the intruder pointed his gun
once more at Filomena and, pulling her blouse violently, <span style="">asked </span>if that was <span style="">all </span>she had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man then entered the room where Isidoro
was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Filomena who followed the
intruder was about to leave the room, she saw him, upon turning her face, shoot
her husband while the latter stood with his hands raised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The robber then turned to her, saying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Get out or I will shoot you."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She hurried to the living room with her head
bent down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she raised her head, the
culprit hit her face with the revolver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
also shot her but missed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, someone from outside demanded that the door be
opened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The intruder inside, after
hitting Filomena a second time, ordered her to open the door; a second man,
with a revolver and flashlight in hand, entered and, going to a room inside,
ordered Filomena to open the wardrobe and suitcases there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man got P7.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Asked for more, Filomena handed to the second
intruder the pants of her husband which contained P150.00 and also gave her
wallet which contained P100<span style="">.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>She then went back to the living room
where her daughters Gabriela, Wenefreda and Democrita, her niece Anastacia
Josol, a 10-year old nephew, Qesario Josol, and a cousin of her husband,
Leonides Erbolengo, were herded.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the middle of the living room was an image of the Sacred Heart
of Jesus which at the time was illumined by a small lamp with a small wick.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the first intruder asked Filomena's children for their money
Filomena answered that <span style="">they had no more
money left, which prompted th</span>e man to remark: "I do not believe
that is the only money you have.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Calape people told me that you are rich."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Filomena replied:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is
true that we could make a little money, but that little money we make is not
even enough to defray the expenses for the two students we have in
Cebu."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The robber then asked the
children where their watches were.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Filomena's daughters pointed to their wardrobes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first intruder got the keys and asported
two wristwatches.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about that same
moment, Filomena heard two male voices downstairs, one saying, "Continue
skinning Bay," and the other answering, "No more Bay."</p>

<p class="BODY">Shortly thereafter, the second robber went to the dining room and
opened the cabinets there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile,
the first man, who was watching the inmates of the house, told them he did not
believe that they had no more money and valuables left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the girls replied:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Even if you will kill us, Manoy (used
when addressing <span style="">an older </span>person),
those are the things and money we have."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The culprit took Filomena's youngest daughter to the dining room and
trussed her up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the mean­time a male
voice down below was heard to say, "Go ahead Bay, we have no more seeds
here."</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, the inmates who were in the living room were
ordered to enter another room, and the first intruder said, "Watch out, if
the P.C. arrives here and overtakes us you will all be liquidated."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, the victims were herded back to the
sala near the image of the Sacred Heart.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Filomena heard a male voice say that they were leaving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about this time, the second culprit went
downstairs while the first ordered the offended parties to go inside one of the
rooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This man then closed the door,
put out the lamp in the sala, and immediately stepped out of the house.</p>

<p class="BODY">Noting that the culprits were gone, the children shouted:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Tia Posang, Tio Tasio, please bring us
light <span style="">because </span>we do not have
light here."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A neighbor who responded
found Isidoro dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to
Filomena, the robbery caused the family, aside from the loss of her husband's
life, the loss of P500.00 in cash and valuables, and a radio, four pairs of
earrings, two bracelets, four necklaces, three rings and two wristwatches, all
with an estimated value of P1<span style="">,000.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Filomena's narrative was corroborated by her daughter Gabriela,
then a third-year medical student.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
testified that on that early morning she heard her father <span style="">ask </span>for a box of matches.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A short time later <span style="">she </span>also heard a gun report.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She then went up to their window and shouted for help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She heard somebody knock on the door of the
room where she, her sisters and other relatives were, and when she opened it a
man (the one whom Filomena first met) got inside and told her and her
companions to repair to the living room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There, this man got their <span style="">keys </span>and
after opening a cabi­net and finding nothing asked Gabriela and the others for
their money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gabriela replied that they
had no money because they were mere students.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On hearing this, the man brandished his guy and threatened to kill
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While this intruder was making
further threats, Gabriela heard gunfire downstairs, and somebody outside the
house said, "We have no more seeds, Bay."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also heard another male voice say,
"Let them sleep, Bay."</p>

<p class="BODY">The relevant issues raised in this appeal are:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. whether it was at all likely, considering the means of
livelihood and moral reputation of the appellants, that they perpetrated the
crimes complained of;</p>

<p class="NUM">2. whether the environmental circums­tances obtaining during the
commission of the offenses were such as to enable the victims thereof to
identify or recognize the offenders;</p>

<p class="NUM">3. whether the appellants during their subsequent detention were
in fact identified by the offended victims;</p>

<p class="NUM">4. whether the failure of the military authorities concerned to
subject the appellants to a paraffin test after they were arrested and to
recover from them the articles stolen from the Orillosa family militate against
a finding of guilt.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. Relative to the first issue, counsel for the defense maintains
that the appellants could not have perpetrated the crime of robbery with
homicide because (a) Liberato Bayotlang, 33 years old, a Catholic, married with
three children, a resident of barrio Atsila, munici­pality of Ubay, province of
Bohol, cultivated a four-hectare rice farm owned by his father from which he
obtained an annual share of about 40 cavans of palay; Liberato furthermore
engaged in the business of selling precious stones, together with his
co-appellants Ricardo and Zosimo, in which venture they went to various places
in Bohol, Leyte and Mindanao, and had municipal permits from the authorities
concerned; (b) Ricardo Bayotlang, 45 years old, a Catholic, married with two children,
a barriomate of his uncle Liberato, was also a farmer cultivating a
seven-hectare rice farm from which he derived from 40 to 80 cavans of palay
every harvest; (c) Zosimo Equipilag, 39 years old, a Catholic, married, a
resident of barrio Camambugan, Ubay, Bohol and a tenant of Ricardo Bayotlang,
obtained more than 15 cavans of palay and corn as his annual share, and was
also engaged in fishing from which he earned P30.00 to P40.00 a month; <span style="">his </span>wife earned P5.00 weekly as a
mat-weaver; and he was also a helper of Ricardo and Liberato in carrying pigs
and chickens that were bartered for precious stones, which the latter peddled
in various places; and (d) the appellants were of good moral character for they
had never been charged with any offense, and, as testified to by the chief of
police and the vice-mayor of Ubay, they had never been reported to be in posses­sion
of deadly weapons.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="">That a person cultivated a small farm
and, during off seasons, peddled precious stones may, indeed, have weight in
the overall determination of whether such a person had a propensity to commit
robbery, especially in a far-flung place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are not persuaded, however, that for those reasons the appellants
should be acquitted of the crime charged, particularly where the level of
earnings of the appellants cannot be said to be such as to foreclose entirely
the probability that they would rob a house in a rural area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their incomes, considering the size of the
families they supported, did <span style="">not </span>place
them even in the middle economic level, judged by rural standards, as to make a
reasonable man conclude that they would absolutely entertain no thought of
robbing another persons house <span style="">in </span>another
town.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Likewise, the fact that the appellants
were never reported as persons who possessed deadly weapons is no guarantee
that they had no such weapons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor does
the fact that they have never been accused of any offense before constitute a
warranty that the appellants have not committed or could not have committed
robbery with homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, the
good moral charac­ter of an accused person does have weight in the total
appreciation of the evidence in a criminal case, such as the one at bar, and we
have duly taken note of the evidence adduced by the defense on the appellants'
moral character.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. On the second issue, the appellants insist that on March <span style="">4, </span>1963, they went for the first time
to Calape, Bohol, to peddle precious stones and secured a mayor's permit for
the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They stayed there for five
days, visiting the barrios of Candungao and Masonoy where they boarded in the
house of one named Emang.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that trip
Ricardo realized P40.00 in cash, and Liberato P50.00 in cash with P15.00 on
credit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They <span style="">also </span>received a pig and <span style="">six </span>chickens.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Zosimo received P20.00 as compensation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 12, 1963, Ricardo and Liberato returned to Calape to
sell precious stones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They boarded in
the same house of Emang <span style="">in </span>Masonoy
and returned home on March 16.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that
trip, they realized P40.00 of which P10.00 was on credit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 22, 1963, the three appellants traveled once more to
Calape to sell precious stones.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to Liberato, they stayed in the house of his
"cumpadre" in Masonoy, but according to Zosimo they stayed in
Candungao.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this trip, Zosimo realized
P15.00 and Ricardo P70.00 in cash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
March 28, 1963, while the trio were in a restaurant in Calape, they met Pio de
la Peña, a barriomate and close relative of the appel­lants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pio joined them in the appellants' boarding
place as Pio expressed a desire to go home <span style="">with </span>them to Ubay the next day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the evening of March 28, 1963, Ricardo, Zosimo and Pio had supper and
passed the night in Emang<span style="">'</span><span style="">s</span> house,
while <span style="">Liberato </span>slept in a nearby
house owned by a certain Peryang.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants further narrated that at about three o'clock in
the morning of March 29, 1963 Ricardo awakened his two companions as they had
to catch the first passenger bus to Ubay.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The owner of the house also woke up to prepare breakfast, but they did
not wait for it as they wanted to take the first available bus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ricardo, Zosimo and Pio proceeded to where
Liberate was, and took a light breakfast which had already <span style="">been </span>prepared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The group then walked towards the main road
with Ricardo, who was carrying a bag and holding a torch, leading the
group.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about five o'clock, they
boarded a bus bound for Ubay.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the town of Buenavista, a uniformed Philippine Constabulary
corporal, Marcelo Pi<span style="">quero </span>(who,
as a prosecution witness, corroborated th??s meeting with the appellants
boarded the bus and sat beside Ricardo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At about nine <span style="">o'clock </span>in
the morning, the bus <span style="">stopped </span>at
Talibon, Bohol, for the passengers to take breakfast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four took theirs with Cpl. <span style="">Piquero; </span>Ricardo paid the bill for
all; and then they returned to their bus.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This time Liberato and Zosimo sat beside Cpl. Piquero.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each of the appellants paid their own fare of
P1.70 each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ricardo also gave P5.00 to
Pio who said he had no money and promised to sell Ricardo his four chickens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the bus reached the barrio of
Camambugan, Ubay, Bohol, Zosimo disembarked.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After reaching his house, Zosimo applied straws on coconut trees, ate
lunch, and took a nap.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the afternoon,
he proceeded to the seashore to catch fish, where he was appre­hended by P.C.
soldiers and taken to the <span style="">P.C. </span>detachment
headquarters in the <u><span style="">poblacion</span></u><span style=""> </span>of <span style="">Ubay<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Ricardo stepped down from the bus when it reached barrio Atsila,
Ubay, Bohol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Arriving at his house, he
gave the fish he bought during the trip to his children, delivered his bag to
his daughter, and then repaired his plow.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At about three o'clock, while Ricardo was taking a nap, Cpl. Piquero
came to his house and told him that he (Piquero) was looking for somebody
believed to be hiding in the barrio.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ricardo went later to Liberato's house to <span style="">ask </span>for spare parts <span style="">for
his plow and </span>there met the chief of police of Calape, Panfilo C.
Rodriquez, who informed him that <span style="">a </span>robbery
had taken place that morning in <span style="">Calunasan,
</span>Calape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ricardo admitted having
come from Calape early that morning, and together with Liberato went with the
police chief to Ubay upon being informed that the latter was making a check on
persons who came from Calape that day.</p>

<p class="BODY">Liberato declared that at about three o'clock on March 29, 1963,
he was walking past the house of a "cumpadre" in barrio Atsila when the
latter inquired how much was the fish he was carrying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went inside the house of his
"cum-padre" and saw the chief of police of Calape and Cpl.
Piquero.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Liberato admitted he came from
Calape on the first bus that morning together <span style="">with </span>Ricardo, Zosimo and Pio.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The police chief asked Liberato to go with him to Ubay for
identification purposes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pio was contacted by P.C. soldiers <span style="">in </span>his house and then taken to the P.C. detachment head­quarters
in Ubay, Bohol.</p>

<p class="BODY">The chief of police of Calape, Panfilo C. Rodriguez, testified
that at about five o'clock in the morning of March 29, 1963, one of his men
informed him of the robbery and homicide perpe­trated in the house of the
Orillosas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He forthwith repaired thereto
with some of his men and conducted an investigation of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Filomena Orillosa furnished him with a
description of the culprits, and a neighbor told him that the robbers had pro­ceeded
northward from the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moments later,
a bus inspector came and told him there were "four people that suited the
descriptions given by Mrs. Orillosa who were bound for Ubay."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The descriptions given by Filomena of the two
men who entered her house were as follows:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"a regular built man <span style="">barely
30 </span>years over, wearing blue jacket, blue shirt, dark pants, style
hair-cut, fair complexion, and the other one, printed dark shirt with black
maong pants....<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fellow who was with
printed shirt was cross-eyed."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the basis of the bus inspector's information that the "four people"
disembarked somewhere -in Camambugan, Ubay, Bohol, the police chief, together
with his men and Gabriela Orillosa, went to Camambugan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At Ubay, Panfilo informed the P.C. detachment
of the robbery and homicide that had been perpetrated in Calunasan, that
morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of his search,
the police chief also met Cpl. Piquero, and the latter told him that he
(Piquero) "was with the persons which suited the descriptions" he
gave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due time, <span style="">as </span>disclosed earlier, the appellants
as well as Pio de la Peña were brought to Ubay, Bohol.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the P.C. detachment headquarters, the four were told to enter
a given room one at a time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Inside the room were Gabriela Orillosa and
the </span>chief of police of Calape, Bohol.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the four were being brought in one after another to her presence,
Gabriela never spoke a word; however, after she <span style="">had </span>seen the four, Gabriela told the police chief and a P.C.
sergeant that she could recognize only Zosimo Equipilag and was not sure of
Liberato Bayotlang.</p>

<p class="BODY">From Ubay, the four suspects were taken by P.C. soldiers to the
municipal building of Calape where they arrived at about three o'clock in the
morning of March 30, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The chief of
police of Calape, who rode in another vehicle, stopped by the house of <span style="">Filomena </span>who,
together with her daughter Wenefreda and Leonides, went <span style="">with the </span>former to the municipal building of Calape to identify
the suspects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As before, the appellants
and Pio <span style="">were </span>told
to enter the office of the chief of police, one after another, which was then
lighted with a 100-watt bulb lamp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
three women likewise did not utter a word as the four suspects were presented
to them one by one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As with Gabriela, it
was only after they saw them all that the three women told the chief of police
of Calape whom they <span style="">recognized </span>as the ones who <span style="">robbed their house the evening before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Filomena and Wenefreda identified Zosimo </span>Equipilag,
who was cross-eyed, as the one who first entered the house and Liberato
Bayotlang as the second intruder; Leonides said she recognized Liberato only.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the witness stand, Gabriela explained that she did not
identify Zosimo on the spot because she was afraid that <span style="">his </span>relatives might retaliate against
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gabriela and her mother declared <span style="">th</span>a<span style="">t </span>they were able to recognize the two, Zosimo and Liberato,
because of the combined illumination from the lighted lamp near the Sacred
Heart's image in their living room and the flashlights of the two robbers, as
their reflections criss­crossed in the living room.</p>

<p class="BODY">Filomena, during her cross-testimony, stated that while she was
at the office of the chief of police of Calape the latter asked her if she
wanted to see the four persons whom he had arrested, and told her that the said
four persons were the ones responsible for the robbery and homicide committed
in her house.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimonies regarding the responsibility of the appellants
for the crime charged were corroborated by Pio <span style="">de </span>la Peña who was excluded from the information and made a state
witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Pio, he met the
appellants on March 28, 1963, while the latter were drinking beer inside a
restaurant near the market in Calape, Bohol.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ricardo invited him to join the group in barrio Candungao, Calape, where
they were staying because a girl there was then engaged to be married Pio and
the other accused, except Liberato, passed the night in the house of the girl
who was getting married.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about two
o'clock in the morning of March 29, 1963, Pio and his two companions woke up
pursuant to instructions given previously by Ricardo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Along the way, Ricardo told the group that
they were going to rob a house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Rica</span>rdo<span style=""> </span>told Pio that it was up to him (Pio) whether or not he would come
along for the proposed venture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
the group was walking, Pio noticed for the first time that a gun, which Ricardo
told him later was a .45 caliber firearm, was tucked in the waistline of
Ricardo, and that Liberato had a .38 caliber revolver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ricardo, however, did not tell them that
there would be any killing during the robbery.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ricardo and Pio stood as guards and stayed on the grounds on both ends
of the house. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Pio allegedly did not know
at that time that someone had been killed, although he heard several gun bursts
and the voice of a woman crying for help.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pio further testified that after the gun bursts, Ricardo told those
upstairs to go ahead and "skin them" off, while he urged them to
hurry up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ricardo then said that they
had no more "peanuts" by which he meant "bullets."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about that moment, they heard the sound of
an on-coming truck which caused Pio and Ricardo to scamper away and hide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, the two reached a schoolhouse where
they defecated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ricardo and Pio
continued hiking until they reached the barrio of Mandaug, about a kilometer
from Calunasan, where Ricardo previously told his companions they would meet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, Pio saw Liberato and Zosimo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four thereafter boarded a Bohol Land
bus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the bus stopped at a place
called Mahawan, Ricardo and Liberato stepped out, but went back aboard
later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the town of Buenavista where
the bus stopped once more, Pio took a cup of coffee, Cpl. Piquero came aboard
and, as pre­viously narrated, sat beside Ricardo.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a thoroughgoing examination of the evidence adduced below,
we are convinced that it is unlikely that the offended parties could not have
figured out the exact identities of the persons who entered their house on that
early morning of March 29, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although the lighted lamp near the image of the Sacred Heart in the
Orillosa's living room did not, by itself, project enough light sufficient for
the offended parties to identify the robbers - - a fact admitted by Filomena
--the illumination from the lighted lamp was intermittently intensified by the
light coming from the two flashlights of the robber-assailants who wielded them
about the living room and other parts of the house while in search of
valuables.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The robbery in the case at
bar was not done secretly and quickly but during a spread of time before
wide-awake witnesses with whom the culprits conversed from time to time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The robbers even fired their guns a number of
times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are of the opinion that under
the circumstances the inmates of the house of the deceased Isidoro Orillosa had
sufficient available illumination and time to fix the identities of the persons
who entered their house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record in
fact shows that Filomena was able to describe the outward appearance and the
nature and color of the apparel of the two culprits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The descriptions she gave and the <span style="">information </span>volunteered by the Bohol
Land bus inspector led to the arrest of the appellants.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. The appellants argue, upon the third issue, that the
identification made by Filomena and her daughter Gabriela was spurious because
they did not immediately and on the spot identify Zosimo and Liberato as the
ones who robbed their house when these two were presented to them for identification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That behaviour, according to the appellants'
counsel, was unnatural, since the head of the family was killed during the
alleged robbery and the identification of the suspects was required of them
only a few hours after the crimes were perpetrated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the chief of police of Calape
uttered a statement to Filomena before she saw the appellants that suggested
that the persons who had been arrested, that is, the appellants, were in fact
the ones who committed the robbery and homicide <span style="">in </span>her house.</p>

<p class="BODY">Gabriela satisfactorily explained why she did not, immediately <span style="">and on </span>the spot, identify Zosimo and
Liberato as the culprits who entered their house:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>she was afraid that the relatives of these
appellants might take revenge on her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
our opinion, that behaviour is not unnatural.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the appellants were presented for identifi­cation to Gabriela,
Filomena, Wenefreda and Leonides, <span style="">less </span>than
twenty-four hours had elapsed from the time the robbery and homicide in
question were committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that
the robbers were armed, had no qualms about shooting a helpless man, and, in
seeming disregard of per­sonal harm, audaciously fired their guns several
times, are factors which must be considered in evaluating the terror and fear
that gripped these witnesses and led them not to point to the culprits face to
face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These witnesses are, moreover,
women unaccustomed to gunfire and they had just witnessed the brutal slaying of
the head and only male in the family.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the circumstances, we are of the view that the behavioral theory
advanced by the appellants' counsel cannot avail them any.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it is not correct to say that Gabriela and Filomena did
not immediately name Zosimo and Liberato as the culprits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that after the appellants, <span style="">including </span>Pio de la Peña, were
presented to Gabriela in the afternoon of March 29, 1963, she forthwith
informed the chief of police of Calape and a P.C. sergeant that she recognized
Zosimo but was not sure of Liberato.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
following morning, however, when the four suspects were presented to Filomena,
Wenefreda and Leonides, the first two told the chief of police of Calape, right
after they had seen the four, that they recognized Zosimo as the one who first
entered their house and Liberato as the second intruder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Leonides could identify Liberato only.</p>

<p class="BODY">The statement made by the chief of police of Calape to Filomena
that the four were the ones who robbed her house is unfortunate and should not
have been made at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not
persuaded, how­ever, that such statement had unduly influenced her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be noted that there were four
persons brought one after another before Filomena, her daughter Wenefreda and
cousin Leonides inside the office of the chief of police <span style="">of </span>Calape, and they were able to
corroborate each other on the iden­tity of Liberato, while Filomena and
Wenefreda were both in agreement about Zosimo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The identi­fication of Zosimo squared with the earlier decla­ration of
Gabriela to whom the four were presented for identification in the afternoon of
March 29, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not one of the other
two, Ricardo and Pio, was pointed to by these witnesses as among those who
committed the crime in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, Ricardo's participation was amply established by the
testimony of Pio de la Peña who, as earlier stated, was utilized as a state
witness.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. Finally, we do not consider the failure to administer paraffin
tests on the appellants and the failure to recover the money and articles
stolen from the Orillosas as sufficient to over­come the positive identification
of the appellants by the wife, daughters and cousin of the deceased Isidoro
Orillosa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These witnesses had not had
any previous relationship or acquaintance with the appellants, excepting
Ricardo who, according to Filomena, used to buy tobacco at her store prior to
the incident in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said
witnesses, therefore, had no evil motive or<span style=""> </span>particular prejudice against Zosimo and Liberato when they
pointed to them as the ones who committed the robbery and homicide in their
dwelling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that early
that same morning, after the perpetration of the crimes, Filomena was able to
give the chief of police of Calape, who went to her house to investigate, a
physical description of two of the culprits: their physical build, style of
hair, wearing apparel, and that one was cross-eyed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants do not deny that early that
morning of March 29, 1963, they came from Masonoy, a barrio of Calape, Bohol,
and walked along the way to the place where they could <span style="">get </span>transporta­tion to go home; that
there were four of them in the group; and that one, Zosimo, was
cross-eyed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cpl. Piquero, who sat beside
Ricardo and then Zosimo and Liberato in the same bus that took the appellants
to their residences in Ubay, Bohol and who ate breakfast with the latter at one
of the bus stops, told the chief of police of Calape that the descriptions of
the robbers which the police chief gave at the house of the Orillosas fitted
those of the persons he rode with, that is, the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pio de la Peña, who turned state witness,
confirmed that he and the appellants robbed the Orillosa house in the early
morning of March 29, 1963.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not depreciate the value of paraffin tests and the recovery
of the objects and instru­ments of a crime as aids to criminal investigation
and analysis as well as to judicial appreciation of the probability of guilt;
we are of the opinion, however, that their absence does not constitute a bar to
a judgment of conviction where, on the basis of the evidence adduced, we are
convinced, with moral certainty, that the accused are guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find the indispensable elements of the
offense of robbery with homicide proven beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The portion of the judgment awarding compensatory damages in the
total amount of P7,267.00 to the <span style="">heirs </span>of
the deceased should be modified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Compensatory damages for death resulting from crime have been increased
to P12,000.00 (People v. Pantoja, No. L-18793, Oct. 11, 1968; 25 SCRA, 469-475
and other cases).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The total amount
stolen (cash and valuables) has been assessed at P1,500.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment appealed from is hereby
affirmed, with the sole modification that the civil liability of the appellants
by way of compensatory damages to the heirs of the deceased Isidoro Orillosa is
hereby increased to THIRTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED (P13,500.00) PESOS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against the appellants.</p>
