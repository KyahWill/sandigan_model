<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On February 26, 1954 , <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> Lim, claiming to be a nephew of the late Jose <span class="SpellE">Millarez</span> who died intestate on October 22, 1953 , filed with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental a petition for his appointment as judicial administrator of the estate of the deceased. The petition alleged that the deceased left no relatives such as descendants, ascendants or surviving spouse, except collaterals. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">To the said petition, <span class="SpellE">Basilisa</span> Diaz-Millarez, claiming to be a widow of the late Jose <span class="SpellE">Millarez</span>, filed an opposition on two grounds: that the petitioner has an adverse interest in the estate; and that the properties of the estate are the subject matter of a litigation between her as plaintiff and <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> Lim as defendant in Civil Case No. 2986. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Trial of the case was postponed several times. When the case was called for hearing on March 7, 1959 , both parties manifested the existence of a litigation between them over the properties of the estate. Hence, the trial court issued the following order: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"When this <span class="SpellE">expediente</span> was called for hearing today, Atty. Enrique <span class="SpellE">Mariño</span> for the petitioner and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Parreño</span>, Sr. for the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> appeared. Both manifested that there is an ordinary civil case between the parties herein, that is <span class="SpellE">Basilisa</span> Diaz <span class="SpellE">Millarez</span>, as plaintiff and <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> Lim, as defendant, litigating between them on the ownership of the properties belonging to the deceased Jose <span class="SpellE">Millarez</span>, in the sense that while plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Basilisa</span> Diaz-<span class="SpellE">Millarez</span> in said civil case, now <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> in the special proceeding alleged that she is the legitimate widow of the deceased Jose <span class="SpellE">Millarez</span>, yet defendant <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> Lim in said Civil case, now petitioner herein, alleged that he is contesting said allegation because she is not the legitimate spouse of the deceased; that the said civil case was already decided in favor of the defendant therein and against the plaintiff by the Second <span class="SpellE">Sala</span> of this Court and now pending appeal in the Court of Appeals. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Under the above considerations, the present <span class="SpellE">expediente</span> is of no consequence. However, upon the final termination of said civil case, the parties concerned without prejudice can file another application for the judicial administration of the property involved in this administration. It is to be noted that this expedience was filed way back on February 26, 1954 that is more than 5 years and neither a special nor a regular administrator has been appointed so that the dismissal of the <span class="SpellE">expediente</span> would not be prejudicial to any of the parties interested in the same. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"PREMISES CONSIDERED, this <span class="SpellE">expediente</span> is ordered dismissed." <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Failing in his motion for the reconsideration of this order, the petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> Lim, brought the case to the Court of Appeals but that court has certified the appeal to Us for the reason that there is no question of fact involved. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Meanwhile, the civil case between the parties which was also elevated to the Court of Appeals <span class="GramE">( </span></span><st1:place><st1:city><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">CA</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">-G.R.</span></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:postalcode><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">24561</span></st1:postalcode></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> -R.) was decided on </span><st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="2"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 18, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. From the body of the decision, it appears that <span class="SpellE">Basilisa</span> Diaz-<span class="SpellE">Millarez</span> sought to recover from <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> Lim one-half of the total amount of P22,000 allegedly delivered to him by her and the deceased Jose <span class="SpellE">Millarez</span> on various occasions and to declare her as the owner of 1/2 of the profits and gains derived <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, on the ground that Jose <span class="SpellE">Millarez</span> and she used to live as husband and wife for about 23 years and as such she is entitled to 1/2 of the property held in common by them. She asserted further that since she contributed capital and labor to the tobacco business in which she and the deceased were engaged and from which they gave P22<span class="GramE">,000</span> in cash to <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> Lim, she would be entitled to 1/2 of the capital and 1/2 of the proceeds and profits derived from such capital. In answer, <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> Lim alleged that the money he received from Jose <span class="SpellE">Millarez</span> on various occasions was handed to one Tan <span class="SpellE">Suaco</span> for investment in the tobacco business. While the trial court, after hearing, ordered Lim to make an accounting of the P22<span class="GramE">,000</span> invested in the tobacco business to be submitted to court, the Court of Appeals, on the other hand, made the following conclusion: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"We agree with the court<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> a quo </span></em>that the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Basilisa</span> is entitled to 1/2 of the estate of the late Jose because she contributed labor and capital in the form of cash to a common fund with Jose during the period from 1930 up to the date of the death of Jose in 1953. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Accordingly, the judgment <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">a quo</span></em> is set aside and the records of this case are hereby remanded to the court a quo with instructions (1) that it appoint a qualified certified public accountant to examine with painstaking care the documentary evidence presented and to determine how much over And above the amount of P12,500 was invested by the late Jose <span class="SpellE">Millarez</span> and the plaintiff in the tobacco business together with the defendant Lim, and to assess the extent of the profits and gains derived from such investment; (2) to admit such other evidence as the court may consider material and relevant; and (3) to render judgment anew on the basis of the examination to be conducted by the qualified certified public accountant and such further evidence, if any, as shall be presented, adjudicating in favor of the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Basilisa</span> Diaz-<span class="SpellE">Millarez</span> 1/2 of the capital and 1/2 of the profits and gains derived <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> that properly pertain to the late Jose <span class="SpellE">Millarez</span> after the accounting shall have been accomplished. No pronouncement as to costs." <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">From what appears above, the claim which <span class="SpellE">Basilisa</span> has against <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> in the civil case supposed to be now again pending in the trial court, is based on her declared right to one-half of the estate of the deceased. It cannot, therefore, be denied that <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> Lim, as a relative of the deceased, has some interest adverse to that of <span class="SpellE">Basilisa</span>. Shown to have some liabilities to <span class="SpellE">Basilisa</span> and to the estate as a whole, <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> can not compatibly perform the duties of an administrator. In this jurisdiction, one is considered to be unsuitable for appointment as administrator when he has adverse interest of some kind or hostility to those immediately interested in the estate. (<span class="SpellE">Sioca</span> <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">v.</span></em> Garcia, 44 Phil. 711; <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span>, 69 Phil. 656) <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The determination of a person's suitability for the office of judicial administrator rests, to a great extent, in the sound judgment of the court exercising the power of appointment and said judgment is not to be interfered with on appeal unless the said court is clearly in error. (<span class="SpellE">Sioca</span> <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">v. </span></em>Garcia, <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">supra) </span></em><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">IN VIEW HEREOF</span></em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the order appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against the petitioner-appellant. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Concepcion</span></em></span><em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, C.J., Reyes, J.
