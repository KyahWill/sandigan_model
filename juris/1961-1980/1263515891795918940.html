morning of May 1, 1963 and that on the occasion of the robbery the small

<p class="BODY">Recognition of the fact is made in the decision that the husband,
<span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> <span class="SpellE">Malong</span>, one of
the two alleged eye-witnesses, "refused to point <span class="SpellE">Feling</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lavarias</span> alias ‘<span class="SpellE">Tawel</span>’ as
one of those who stole and robbed and killed his wife and injured his daughter,
* * *.”<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, he was "considered a
hostile witness and instead of believing in his testimony given in court, this
court believes in his affidavit, exhibit 'A', wherein he pointed clearly that
the accused Felix <span class="SpellE">Lavarias</span> alias ‘<span class="SpellE">Feling</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tawel</span>' was one of those whom he was able to recognize
as having stolen the animals and fired shots at them causing the death of his
wife and injury to his daughter."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the testimony of the other alleged

in refusing to live up to their previous affidavits and that Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Capua</span> refused to include Felix <span class="SpellE">Lavarias</span>
alias ‘<span class="SpellE">Feling</span> <span class="SpellE">Tawel</span>', as
one of those he identified, this court also considers Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Capua</span> as a hostile witness and instead of giving credence
to what he testified in open court, believes in his statement given on June 1,
1963, whereby he also pointed as one of those whom he recognized the accused
Felix <span class="SpellE">Lavarias</span> alias '<span class="SpellE">Feling</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tawel</span>', exhibit 'C’."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus undeniable that there was such a failure on the part
of both alleged eye-witnesses to identify appellant <span class="SpellE">Lavarias</span>
as one of those responsible for the robbery.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus when the husband, <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> <span class="SpellE">Malong</span>, was asked whether he knew who shot his wife, this
was his answer:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I was not able to
identify them, sir, because it was nighttime. I was then inside the house, and
the malefactors were downstairs."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, when the question was repeated,

the name of appellant <span class="SpellE">Lavarias</span> as one of those
identified by him, he repeated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I
did not recognize him that night, sir, because it was dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides that, I was attending to my wife who
was shot and to my daughter who was injured, sir."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is equally undeniable that the other alleged eye-witness,
Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Capua</span>, likewise failed to identify on the
witness stand appellant <span class="SpellE">Lavarias</span> as one of the
malefactors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When asked whether he could
tell the court what was declared by him before a consta­bulary sergeant
investigating the robbery, he answered in this wise:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I did not relate anything to Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Castulo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked me
only whom I recognized and I said, I did not recognize anybody, sir.”<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>He continued by saying that he heard two

clarified:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I did not see,
sir."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>He denied being maltreated at the PC

where his house was located and that it was not true what was mentioned in the
affidavit, signed by him, as to his having recognized the persons therein
named.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He reiterated when he was
specifically asked why he told the constabulary sergeant that he recognized
some persons who went to rob the house of <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> <span class="SpellE">Malong</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I did

not know "because I did not see anything, sir."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The decision appealed from would thus predicate a conviction on
affidavits executed by two alleged eye-witnesses who thereafter repudiated the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Independently of the motives that
must have occasioned such a change of heart, the conviction of appellant cannot
be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The constitutional rights
guaranteed the accused stands in the way of the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>
of the appealed decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
elementary that in all criminal prosecutions, there is a presumption of
innocence in his favor and he has the right to the confrontation of witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Certainly, the presumption of innocence here was bolstered by
positive and categorical testimony that appellant could not be identified as
one of the perpetrators of the offense charged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering, more­over, that the alleged eye-witnesses presented were
the husband of the woman slain, as well as the father of the child who was hurt
and the other witness was a relation by affinity, both of whom therefore could
be expected to see to it that the guilty party would not go un­punished, this
failure to identify the appellant goes very far indeed in calling for a
reversal of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only by proof
beyond reasonable doubt, which requires moral certainty, "a certainty that
convinces and satisfies the reason and conscience of those who are to act upon
it," may the presumption of innocence be overcome.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This has been the constant holding of this
Court from <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. Reyes,<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
a 1903 decision, to People v. <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
promulgated barely a month ago.</p>

<p class="BODY">May the conviction be sustained by virtue of the affidavits
previously executed by the above witnesses wherein appellant was pointed at as
one of those who participated in the offense charged?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The constitutional right to confrontation
precludes reliance on such affidavits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such a constitutional safeguard cannot be satisfied unless the
opportunity is given the accused to test the credibility of any person who, by
affidavit or deposition, would impute the commission of an offense to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be to disregard one of the most
valuable guarantees of a person accused if solely on the affidavits presented,
his guilt could be predicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
parti­cular case, this observation gains added weight in view of the
repudiation of such affidavits coming from persons who ordinarily would be
expected to uphold and maintain what was therein stated.</p>

<p class="BODY">There should be a <span class="SpellE">reaffirmance</span> of the
doctrine announced by this Court in a 1918 decision interpreting an analogous
provision of the then Bill of Rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
that case of United States v. Javier,<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Justice Malcolm, speaking for the Court, quoted an American Supreme Court
decision of Philippine origin,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
to the effect that this right to confrontation "intends to secure the
accused in the right to be tried, so far as facts provable by witnesses are
concerned, by only such witnesses as meet him face to face at the trial, who
give their testimony in his presence, and give to the accused an opportunity of
cross-examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was intended to
prevent the conviction of the accused upon depositions or <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> affidavits, and particularly to preserve the
right of the accused to test the recollection of the witness in the exercise of
the right of cross-examination."</p>

<p class="BODY">Such a doctrine valid then continues to be authoritative today.
it cannot be too strongly emphasized that the conviction of the accused may not
be made to rest on depositions or <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
affidavits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That would be to reduce to a
barren form of words this constitutional guaranty.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the sentence appealed from is reversed and
appellant Felix <span class="SpellE">Lavarias</span> is acquitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With costs de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span>.</p>
