				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for the review of a decision of respondent Court of
Appeals, arising allegedly from its failure to apply the Civil Code provision
requiring a contractor to "execute <span style="">the
work in such a manner that it has the qualities agreed upon" and is free from
"defects which destroy or lessen its value, or fitness" for its use,
whether ordinary or stipulated,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> was given due course as the question raised
on a novel provision of </span><span style="">the
Civil Code</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> has not hitherto been passed upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner, The Philippine American Life
Insurance </span><st1:place><span style="">Co.</span></st1:place><span style="">, imputing negligence and incompetence to
respondent <span class="SpellE">Honorato</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Santamaria</span>,
the contractor for a topographic survey work, as a result of which it suffered
damages, would hold him liable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
prevailed in the lower court, but on appeal, it lost in the Court of Appeals,
the decision now on review having diligently and meticulously sifted the
competent facts to arrive at the conclusion that far from respondent <span class="SpellE">Santamaria</span> being guilty of negligence or incompetence, he
did live up strictly to the terms of the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus it reversed the judgment of the lower
court and dismissed the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence
this petition for review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is an admitted fact that in a letter dated September 3, 1952
to petitioner, respondent <span class="SpellE">Santamaria</span> submitted a
written proposal to conduct both a topographic and a subdivision survey of
petitioner's 45 hectare lot in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, the
topographic survey at the rate of P80.00 per hectare of the area surveyed and
mapped and the subdivision survey at the rate of P28.00 for the first 400 lots
and P25.00 for each succeeding lot thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was an acceptance by petitioner of such proposal limited to the
topographic survey only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="9" day="23" year="1952">September 23, 1952</st1:date>, respondent <span class="SpellE">Santamaria</span> sought to clarify the terms of such topographic
survey by him by stating that it would be "in accordance with a 10-meter
cross-sectioning and profile survey and a contour interval of 25
centimeters." He also obligated himself to furnish a map at scale 1 to 100
upon the completion of the survey. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Petitioner was agreeable.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The decision of respondent Court of Appeals then continued with the facts as
found thus: "The topographic survey work on the property of plaintiff was
done by the defendant during the period from October 3 to <st1:date month="11" day="15" year="1952">November 15, 1952</st1:date>. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Thereafter, defendant submitted to the
plaintiff the result of his survey topographic map, Exhibit 1, for which
plaintiff paid him the agreed sum of P3,600.00 as his fees."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Why petitioner, as plaintiff in the original action, felt it <span style="">was </span>entitled to damages was noted in
such decision thus: "Plaintiff, in seeking to recover damages from the
defendant, claims that it incurred additional <span style="">expenses caused </span>by the resurvey of the property, the additional
grading work done in the new road lay-out, the changes in the designs of the
buildings and residential houses to be constructed as prepared for the project
by architect Arguelles and the change in the shopping center area which became
smaller due to the fact that the actual area of the project is less than what appeared
in the topographic map.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also seeks to
recover losses it sustained as a consequence of the delay in the progress of
the project work caused, according to the plaintiff, by <span style="">the fault of </span>defendant in the preparation of the topographic map,
Exhibit I."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent's defense was next taken up by respondent Court of
Appeals in its decision. "For his defense, the defendant contends in the
first place that under his contract with the plaintiff, he is not required to
prepare a plan which shows the exact boundaries of the project nor the exact
measurement of said boundaries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also
contends that before preparing the topographic map he called the attention of
Mr. A. G. <span class="SpellE">Capellan</span>, representative of the plaintiff <span style="">as well </span>as architect <span class="SpellE">Nakpil</span>, architect Arguelles and representative of the <span class="SpellE">Monina</span> Construction Company of the fact that there was then
no plan indicating the exact measurement of the lot which he was to survey
topographically and that he was informed that he should proceed even without a
survey plan because time was then of the essence and that whatever
discrepancies may arise as a result of the absence of such horizontal survey
could be remedied later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant
further contends that inasmuch as a topographic survey could be prepared on a
property even without indicating definitely its metes and bounds, he proceeded
with the topographic survey and submitted the result of his work, topographic
map Exhibit I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the foregoing
contentions of the defendant he disclaims any liability for losses arising from
the discrepancy above referred to."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What respondent <span class="SpellE">Santamaria</span> was obliged
to do under its contract with petitioner was next discussed in the decision:
"To our mind, the correct interpretation of the extent of appellant's duty
under the contract contained <span style="">in Exhibit
</span>C is found in the very same exhibit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It should be noted that in his letter, Exhibit C, defendant offered to
make two surveys: (1) a topographic and (2) a subdivision survey of a 45
hectare housing project for the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <span style="">his description of the job
for the proposed 'subdivision survey', defendant stated among others that he
would relocate <span style="">all </span></span><span style="">the </span><span style="">boundary monuments of the project area."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The considerations that led the Court of <span style="">Appeals to </span>reject contention of petitioner were set forth in
detail in its decision: "Plaintiff accepted the offer only in so far as
the topographic survey is concerned, thereby rejecting the offer of defendant
to make a subdivision survey.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch
as the work of relocating all boundary monuments is included in the rejected
offer to make a subdivision survey, <span style="">defendant
was </span>justified in not determining the boundary of the project area in his
topographic survey.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
considering the period during which the topographic survey was to be done
pursuant to the offer of the defendant as accepted by the plaintiff, it was
impossible for the defendant to determine the exact boundary of the project
area of 45-hectare because when plaintiff accepted defendant's offer plaintiff
has not yet definitely decided to purchase the 45-hectare site from the
Philippine <span class="SpellE">Homesite</span> and Housing Corporation
(PHHC).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only on <st1:date month="10" day="15" year="1952">October 15, 1952</st1:date> that an agreement
entitled 'Sale Agreement' (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A), that the
plaintiff and the PHHC entered into a contract.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It should be noted that under the offer of the defendant contained in
Exhibit C as accepted by the plaintiff dated September 23, 1952, field work and
drafting had to commence three days after the signing of the contract and the
resulting topographic map should be submitted to the plaintiff within a period
of 18 working days with additional extension for every day of rain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is admitted that defendant started work on
his topographic map on <st1:date month="10" day="3" year="1952">October 3, 1952</st1:date>
twelve days before plaintiff signed the sales agreement with the PHHC."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">With the foregoing circumstances in mind, the Court of Appeals
yielded its conformity to the stand taken by respondent <span class="SpellE">Santamaria</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "We agree with the contention of
the appellant as deduced from his testimony and that of his witness Mr. Jorge
that when a topographic map which is not linearly plotted and whose boundaries
are consequently not accurate is used in sketching the road lay-out and other
parts of the subdivision scheme, such procedure would be improper unless the
sketch is intended to be merely a preliminary lay-out subject to final
adjustment after a fixed boundary survey has been made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this point, we note with interest the
disquisition about city planning contained in <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
brief (pp. 12-13).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be no
question about the correct­ness of the stand and the soundness of the reasoning
that in planning a scheme for <span style="">a </span>new
housing project, there should be not only <span style="">a </span>topographic survey of the <span style="">entire </span>project area but <span style="">also
</span>an accurate <span class="SpellE">planimetric</span> survey of the same
indicating the exact boundaries thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Its conclusion, now subject of this petition for review was thus
a necessary consequence: "In view of all the foregoing considerations, we
rule that defendant has not been at fault nor remiss in the performance of his
duty to prepare the topographic map, Exhibit 1, pursuant to his contract with
the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently the decision
declaring him liable in damages to the plaintiff should be reversed."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, with the utmost care and conscientious effort in the
scrutiny of the proven facts, respondent Court of Appeals specifically held
that respondent <span class="SpellE">Santamaria</span> was neither "at fault
nor remiss in the performance of his duty to prepare the topographic map,
Exhibit I, pursuant to his contract with the plaintiff." With such a
finding based, as above noted, on the most meticulous appraisal of the
respective contentions of the parties in accordance with their proof, it would
necessarily follow that the lower court decision that would hold respondent <span class="SpellE">Santamaria</span> liable in damages could not stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, its reversal by respondent Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must have been <span style="">a realization on the part of petitioner of
the difficult task it had to face, this Court being bound on questions of fact
by the determination of the Court of Appeals, that must have prompted it to
invoke what for it is the correct interpretation of Art. 1715 of the Civil
Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As set forth at the outset, this novel question was the decisive
factor in giving this petition due course.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even if the matter be viewed most favorably from the standpoint of
petitioner, it would be unjustifiable, on the facts as duly proved, to decide
the matter contrary to the conclusion reached by respondent Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner would have us
construe the obligation of the contractor to execute the work in such a manner
that it had the qualities agreed upon and was free from defects which destroyed
or lessened its value or fitness as well-nigh absolute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would impose the duty on the party thus
bound to perform such work to attain, in each and every case, a degree of
perfectibility on pain of being visited with a liability for damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to misread Art. 1715.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to give it an interpretation at war
with the demands of reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It might
have been otherwise if the work agreed upon to be performed consisted of
machinery, which must be constructed according to specification, otherwise it
would not serve the purpose contemplated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such is not the case, however.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
Justice Holmes noted, there is no such principle "against using common
sense in construing laws."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, however, appears to be of a different mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ignoring the vital circumstance that
precluded respondent <span class="SpellE">Santamaria's</span> work from being as
satisfactory as <span style="">was </span>hoped for, for which it could not escape responsibility as it
rejected his offer to conduct both a topographic and a subdivision survey, it
would interpret this <span class="SpellE">codal</span> provision without any
thought of the canons of fairness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
would stretch its meaning in an unwarranted manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No legal norm should be susceptible to such a
reproach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the facts were other than
that so carefully considered in detail by respondent Court of Appeals, then
perhaps this contention of petitioner, which, at bottom, is the <span style="">basis of </span>the three alleged errors
committed by respondent Court of Appeals, would not be so lacking in any
persuasive quality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, no less
than petitioner, must, however, pay heed to such facts duly established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our supervisory power, as petitioner could
not be unaware, is thus necessarily limited.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the application of the law, we cannot ignore what had been
ascertained by the Court of Appeals as to the manner an obligation was
fulfilled.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged negligence or incompetence on which this action was
based by petitioner in its complaint in the lower court was found not to exist
by respondent Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Santamaria</span> was not at fault; he was
not remiss in the performance of his duty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He lived up to the terms of the contract as agreed upon between him and
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be said, then,
that he did incur liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would
follow, thus, that the reliance on this legal norm by petitioner does not call
for the judgment of the Court of Appeals being set aside as being contrary to
law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of respondent Court of Appeals of <st1:date month="9" day="28" year="1966">September 28, 1966</st1:date> is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With costs against petitioner, The Philippine
American Life Insurance Company.</p>

Art. 1715 of the Civil Code provides in full: "The contractor shall
execute the work in such a manner that it has the qualities agreed upon and has
no defects which destroy or lessen its value or fitness for its ordinary or
stipu­lated use. Should the work be not of such quality, the employer may
require that the contractor remove the defect or execute another work. If the
contractor fails or refuses to comply with this obligation, the employer may

cost."</p>
