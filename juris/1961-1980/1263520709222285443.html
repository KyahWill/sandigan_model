<p class="BODY">It appears that on <st1:date month="11" day="23" year="1962">November
 23, 1962</st1:date>, plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> commenced an
action against the defendant-appellant in the Municipal Court of Manila, praying
that judgment be rendered against the latter as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pay the plaintiff the aggregate sum of
P3,245.11 as representing the value of goods lost and/or pilfered while in the
custody of and due to the inexcusable negligence of defendant, with legal
interest from dates of their first demands until full payment;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pay
the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as attorney's fees; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pay
costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Judgment in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> having
been rendered in said court, appellant appealed to the Court of First Instance
of Manila who, after due trial, rendered the appealed judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The total amount <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> sought to
recover represents the value of goods either lost or pilfered while under
appellant's custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said goods came in
six different shipments from the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
destined for the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Port</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place>
where appellant - a subsidiary of the Manila Railroad Company - was the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> contractor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon arrival of the vessels at said port, the cargoes were discharged
unto appellant's custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon their
delivery to the respective consignees, the latter found that some of the goods
were either in damaged condition or short of the quantity manifested in the
corresponding bills of lading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
losses thus sustained by the consignees were, upon demand, paid by herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, their insurer, who later filed the necessary suit
to recover from appellant the amounts it had paid to the consignees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The short-deliveries and the damage to some of the goods
delivered are admitted to have taken place while the cargoes were under
appellant's custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter,
however, invoking the provisions of Section 15 of the Management Contract,
disclaims liability <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> upon the ground that the
consignees of the shipments had failed to file the requisite claim within 15
days <u>from the date of the discharge of the last package from </u><u><span style="">the carrying vessel</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Appellant
further claims that, if liable at all, its liability was for sums much <span style="">less </span>than
those claimed by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is an established <span class="GramE">fact,</span> however, that
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed provisional claims in connection with
the missing or damaged goods <u>after</u> the discharge of several of the
packages although <u>before</u> the discharge of the <u><span style="">last package</span></u> from the respective carrying vessels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These provisional claims - appellant contends
- are ineffective in law because they were not in accordance with the provision
of the Management Contract mentioned heretofore.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are unable to accept the view that the contractual <span style="">provision </span>relied upon does not allow a
consignee of goods discharged from a vessel to file a claim based on damage or
short-landing <u><span style="">until after the discharge
of the last package from the carrying vessel</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>While We agree that a
claim filed <u><span style="">before</span></u><span style=""> </span>the actual commencement of the
discharge of goods carried by a vessel is legally ineffective under the
provision of the Management Contract relied upon, because it would be a pureÂ­ly
speculative claim (Universal Insurance etc., <span style="">vs. </span>Manila Railroad Company, L-24600, April 27, 1970, 32 SCRA
364), We see no cogent reason to outlaw a claim similar to the ones involved in
this case filed <u><span style="">after the discharge
of several or a majority of the packages</span></u><span style=""> </span>carried by the vessel, belonging to the same consignee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have heretofore upheld this view in
Malayan Insurance Co. Inc. vs. Manila Port Service et al., L-22687, March 28,
1969; Switzerland etc. vs. Manila Railroad etc. et al., L-22150, April 22,
1968; Insurance Company etc. vs. Manila Port Service, L-24887, April 22, 1968, 23
<span style="">SCRA </span>114.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have held heretofore that some features of Section 15 of the
Management Contract mentioned heretofore appear to be harsh and unreasonable
(Sun Bros. Co. vs. Manila Port Service, G. R. No. L-13500, <st1:date month="4" day="29" year="1960"><span style="">April 29, </span>1960</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is, therefore, our duty to tone them down and give them a reasonable
and humane interpretation.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the value of the goods short-landed or damaged, <span class="GramE">We</span> are satisfied that the finding of both lower courts is
sufficiently sustained by the evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from being in accordance
with law, <span style="">the </span>same is hereby
affirmed.</p>
