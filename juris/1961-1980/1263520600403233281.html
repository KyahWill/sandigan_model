with prayer for a writ of preliminary mandatory and prohibitory
injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their petition Bache
&amp; Co. (Phil.), Inc., a corporation duly organized and existing under the
laws of the Philippines, and its President, Frederick E. <span class="SpellE">Seggerman</span>,
pray this Court to declare null and void Search Warrant No. 2-M-70 issued by
respondent Judge on February 25, 1970; to order respondents to desist from
enforcing the same and/or keeping the documents, papers and effects seized by
virtue thereof, as well as from enforcing the tax assessments on petitioner
corporation alleged by petitioners to have been made on the basis of the said
documents, papers and effects, and to order the return of the latter to
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We gave due course to the
petition but did not issue the writ of preliminary injunction prayed for
therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent facts of this case, as gathered from the record,
are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 24, 1970, respondent <span class="SpellE">Misael</span>
P. Vera, Commissioner of Internal Revenue, wrote a letter addressed to
respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Vivencio</span> M. Ruiz requesting the
issuance of a search warrant against petitioners for violation of Section 46(a)
of the National Internal Revenue Code, in relation to all other pertinent provisions
thereof, particularly Sections 53, 72, 73, 208 and 209, and authorizing Revenue
Examiner Rodolfo de Leon, one of herein respondents, to make and file the application
for search warrant which was attached to the letter.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the afternoon of the following day, <st1:date year="1970" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1970</st1:date>, respondent de Leon and his
witness, respondent Ar­turo <span class="SpellE">Logronio</span>, went to the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They brought with them the following
papers:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>res­pondent Vera's aforesaid
letter-request; an application for search warrant already filled up but still
unsigned by respondent de Leon; an affidavit of respondent <span class="SpellE">Logronio</span>
subscribed before respondent de Leon; a deposition in printed form of
respondent <span class="SpellE">Logronio</span> already accom­plished and signed
by him but not yet subscribed; and a search warrant already accomplished but
still unsigned by respondent Judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">At that time respondent Judge was hearing a cer­tain case; so, by
means of a note, he instructed his De­puty Clerk of Court to take the
depositions of respond­ents de Leon and <span class="SpellE">Logronio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the session had ad­journed, respondent
Judge was informed that the deposi­tions had already been taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stenographer, upon re­quest of respondent
Judge, read to him her stenographic notes; and thereafter, respondent Judge
asked respondent <span class="SpellE">Logronio</span> to take the oath and warned
him that if his de­position was found to be false and without legal basis, he
could be charged for perjury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
Judge signed respondent de Leon's application for search warrant and respondent
<span class="SpellE">Logronio's</span> deposition, Search Warrant No. 2-M-70 was
then signed by respondent Judge and accor­dingly issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">Three days later, or on <st1:date year="1970" day="28" month="2">February
 28, 1970</st1:date>, which was a Saturday, the BIR agents served the search
warrant on petitioners at the offices of <span class="GramE">petitioner
corporation</span> on <st1:address><st1:street>Ayala Avenue</st1:street>, <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:city></st1:address>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners' lawyers protested the search on
the ground that no formal com­plaint or transcript of testimony was attached to
the warrant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The agents nevertheless
proceeded with their search which yielded six boxes of documents.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 3, 1970, petitioners filed a petition with the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> praying that the search
warrant be quashed, dissolved or recalled, that preliminary prohibitory and
mandatory writs of injunction be issued, that the search warrant be declared
null and void, and that the respondents be ordered to pay peti­tioners, jointly
and severally, damages and attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1970" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1970</st1:date>,
the respondents, thru the So­licitor General, filed an answer to the
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing, the court,
presided over by respondent Judge, issued on <st1:date year="1970" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1970</st1:date>, an order dismissing the petition for
dissolution of the search warrant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the meantime, or on <st1:date year="1970" day="16" month="4">April 16, 1970</st1:date>,
the Bureau of Internal Revenue made tax assessments on petitioner corporation
in the total sum of P2<span class="GramE">,594,729.97</span>, partly, if not en­tirely,
based on the documents thus seized.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners came to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition should be granted for the following reasons:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge failed
to personally examine the complainant and his witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent provisions of the Constitution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and of the Revised Rules of Court are:</p>

<blockquote>"(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right of the people to be secure in their
persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures
shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, to
be determined by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the
complainant and the witnesses he may produce, and particu­larly describing the
place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized." (Art. III,
Sec. 1, Constitution.)</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 3.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Requisites for issuing search warrant</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- A search warrant shall not issue but upon
probable cause in connection with one specific offense to be determined by the
judge or justice of the peace after examination under oath or affirmation of the
com­plainant and the witnesses he may produce, and particularly describing the
place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"No search warrant shall issue for more than one specific
offense.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 4.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Examination of the
applicant</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The judge or
justice of the peace must, before issuing the warrant, personally examine on
oath or affirmation the complainant and any witnesses he may produce and take
their depositions in writing, and attach them to the record, in addition to any
affidavits presented to him." <span class="GramE">(Rule 126, Revised Rules
of Court.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The examination of the complainant and the witnes­ses he may
produce, required by Art. III, Sec. 1, par. 3, of the Constitution, and by <span class="SpellE">Secs</span>. 3 and 4, Rule 126 of the Revised Rules of Court,
should be conducted by the judge himself and not by others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The phrase "which shall be determined by
the judge after examination un­der oath or affirmation of the complainant and
the wit­nesses he may produce," appearing in the said constitutional
provision, was introduced by Delegate Francis­co as an amendment to the draft
submitted by the Sub-Committee of Seven.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The following discussion in the Constitutional Convention (Laurel,
Proceedings of the Philippine Constitutional Convention, Vol. III, pp. 755-757)
is enlightening:</p>

reason why we are in favor of this amendment is be­cause we are incorporating
in our consti­tution something of a fundamental charac­ter. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Now, before a judge could issue a search
warrant, he must be under the obligation to examine personally under oath the
complainant and if he has any witness, the witnesses that he may pro­duce.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The implementing rule in the Revised Rules of Court, Sec. 4, Rule
126, is more emphatic and candid, for it re­quires the judge, before issuing a
search warrant, to "personally examine on oath or affirmation the
complainant and any witnesses he may produce x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Personal examination by the judge of the complainant and his
witnesses is necessary to enable him to de­termine the existence or
non-existence of a probable cause, pursuant to Art. III, Sec. 1, par. 3, of the
Constitution, and Sec. 3, Rule 126 of the Revised Rules of Court, both of which
prohibit the issuance of warrants except "upon probable cause." The
determination of whether or not a probable cause exists calls for the exercise
of judgment after a judicial appraisal of facts and should not be allowed to be
delegated in the absence of any rule to the contrary.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, no personal examination at all was conducted
by respondent Judge of the complainant (respondent de Leon) and his witness
(respondent <span class="SpellE">Logronio</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that the complainant's
application for search warrant and the witness' printed-form deposition were
subscribed and sworn to before respondent Judge, the latter did not ask either
of the two any question the an­swer to which could possibly be the basis for
determining whether or not there was probable cause against herein pe­titioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the participants seem to have
attached so little significance to the matter that notes of the pro­ceedings
before respondent Judge were not even taken.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At this juncture it may be well to recall the salient facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The transcript of stenographic notes (pp.
61-76, April 1, 1970, Annex J-2 of the Petition) taken at the hearing of this
case in the court below shows that per instruction of respondent Judge, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Eleodoro</span> V. Gonzales, Special Deputy Clerk of Court, took
the depositions of the complainant and his witness, and that stenographic notes
thereof were taken by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time respondent Judge was at the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> hearing a case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After respondent Judge was through with the hearing, Deputy Clerk
Gonzales, stenographer <span class="SpellE">Gas­par</span>, complainant de Leon
and witness <span class="SpellE">Logronio</span> went to res­pondent Judge's
chamber and informed the Judge that they had finished the depositions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge then requested the
stenographer to read to him her stenographic notes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Special Deputy Clerk Gonzales testified as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
after finishing reading the stenographic notes, the Honorable Judge requested
or in­structed them, requested Mr. <span class="SpellE">Logronio</span> to raise
his hand and warned him if his depo­sition will be found to be false and with­out
legal basis, he can be charged criminal­ly for perjury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Honorable Court told Mr. <span class="SpellE">Logronio</span> whether he affirms the facts contained in his
deposition and the affida­vit executed before Mr. Rodolfo de Leon.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
thereafter?</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And</span>
thereafter, he signed the deposition of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Logronio</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Who
is this he?</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The</span>
Honorable Judge.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
deposition or the affidavit?</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
affidavit, Your Honor."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Thereafter, respondent Judge signed the
search warrant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The participation of respondent Judge in the proceed­ings which
led to the issuance of Search Warrant No. 2-M-70 was thus limited to listening
to the stenographer's read­ing of her notes, to a few words of warning against
the commission of perjury, and to administering the oath to the complainant and
his witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This cannot be consi­dered
as a personal examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there was
an exami­nation at all of the complainant and his witness, it was the one
conducted by the Deputy Clerk of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But, as already stated, the Constitution and the rules require a
personal examination by the judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was precisely on account of the intention of the delegates to the
Constitutional Convention to make it a duty of the issuing judge to personally
examine the complainant and his witnesses that the question of how much time
would be consumed by the judge in examining them came up before the Convention,
as can be seen from the record of the proceedings quoted above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reading of the stenographic notes to
respondent Judge did not constitute sufficient compliance with the
constitutional mandate and the rule; for by that manner respondent Judge did
not have the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the complainant and his
witness, and to propound initial and fol­low-up questions which the judicial
mind, on account of its training, was in the best position to conceive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These were important in arriving at a sound
inference on the all-im­portant question of whether or not there was probable
cause.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The search warrant was
issued for more than one specific offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Search Warrant No. 2-M-70 was issued for "[v]<span class="SpellE">iolation</span> of Sec. <span class="GramE">46(a</span>) of the
National Internal Revenue Code in re­lation to all other pertinent provisions
thereof particu­larly <span class="SpellE">Secs</span>. <span class="GramE">53, 72,
73, 208 and 209."</span> The question is:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Was the said search warrant issued "in connection with one spe­cific
offense," as required by Sec. 3, Rule 126?</p>

<p class="BODY">To arrive at the correct answer it is essential to examine
closely the provisions of the Tax Code referred to above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus we find the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">Sec. 46(a) requires the filing of income tax returns by
corporations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sec. 53 requires the withholding of income taxes at source.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sec. 72 imposes surcharges for failure to render in­come tax
returns and for rendering false and fraudulent returns.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sec. 73 provides the penalty for failure to pay the income tax,
to make a return or to supply the information required under the Tax Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sec. 208 penalizes "[a]<span class="SpellE">ny</span> person
who distills, recti­fies, repacks, compounds, or manufactures any article sub­ject
to a specific tax, without having paid the privilege tax <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
or who aids or abets in the conduct of illicit distilling, rectifying,
compounding, or illicit manufacture of any article subject to specific tax x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>," and provides that in
the case of a corporation, partnership, or associa­tion, the official and/or
employee who caused the violation shall be responsible.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sec. 209 penalizes the failure to make a return of re­ceipts,
sales, business, or gross value of output removed, or to pay the tax due
thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">The search warrant in question was issued for at least four
distinct offenses under the Tax Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first is the violation of Sec. <span class="GramE">46(a</span>), Sec.
72 and Sec. 73 (the filing of income tax returns), which are interrelated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second is the violation of Sec. 53 (withholding
of income taxes at source).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third is
the violation of Sec. 208 (unlawful pursuit of business or occupation); and the
fourth is the violation of Sec. 209 (failure to make a return of receipts,
sales, business or gross value of output actually removed or to pay the tax due
thereon).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even in their classifica­tion
the six above-mentioned provisions are embraced in two different titles:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Secs</span>. 46(a), 53, 72
and 73 are under Title II (Income Tax); while <span class="SpellE">Secs</span>.
208 and 209 are under Title V (Privilege Tax on Business and Occupation).</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents argue that <span class="SpellE">Stonehill</span>, et
al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>, et al., L-19550, June 19, 1967 (20
SCRA 383), is not ap­plicable, because there the search warrants were issued
for "violation of Central Bank Laws, Internal Revenue (Code) and Revised
Penal Code;" whereas, here Search Warrant No. 2-M-70 was issued for
violation of only one code, i.e., the National Internal Revenue Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The distinction is more ap­parent than real,
because it was precisely on account of the <span class="SpellE">Stonehill</span>
incident, which occurred sometime before the present Rules of Court took effect
on January 1, 1964, that this Court amended the former rule by inserting
therein the phrase "in connection with one specific offense," and
adding the sentence "No search warrant shall issue for more than one
specific offense," in what is now Sec. 3, Rule 126.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus we said in <span class="SpellE"><u>Stonehill</u></span>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"Such is the seriousness of the irregula­rities committed in
connection with the disput­ed search warrants, that this Court deemed it fit to
amend Section 3 of Rule 122 of the former Rules of Court by providing in its
counterpart, under the Revised Rules of Court that 'a search warrant shall not
issue but upon probable cause <u>in connection with one specific offense</u>.'
Not satisfied with this qualification, the Court added thereto a paragraph,
directing that 'no search warrant shall issue for more than <u>one</u> specific
offense.'"</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The search warrant does
not particularly describe the things to be seized.</p>

<p class="BODY">The documents, papers and effects sought to be seized are
described in Search Warrant No. 2-M-70 in this manner:</p>

<blockquote>"Unregistered and private books of ac­counts (ledgers,
journals, <span class="SpellE">columnars</span>, receipts and disbursements
books, customers ledgers); receipts for payments received; certificates of
stocks and securities; contracts, promis­sory notes and deeds of sale; telex
and coded messages; business communications; accounting and business records;
checks and check stubs; records of bank deposits and withdrawals; and records
of foreign remittances, covering the years 1966 to 1970."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The description does not meet the requirement in Art. III, Sec.
1, of the Constitution, and of Sec. 3, Rule 126 of the Revised Rules of Court,
that the warrant should par­ticularly describe the things to be seized.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Stonehill</u></span>, this Court,
speaking thru Mr. Chief Justice Roberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
said:</p>

<blockquote>"The grave violation of the Constitu­tion made in the
application for the con­tested search warrants was compounded by the
description therein made of the effects to be searched for and seized, to wit:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Books of accounts, financial re­cords, vouchers, journals,
correspon­dence, receipts, ledgers, portfolios, credit journals, typewriters,
and other documents and/or papers showing all business transactions including
disburse­ment receipts, balance sheets and relat­ed profit and loss
statements.'</p>

<blockquote>"Thus, the warrants authorized the search for and seizure of
records pertaining to <u>all business transactions</u> of petitioners herein,
regardless of whether the transactions were <u>legal</u> or <u>illegal</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The warrants sanctioned the seizure of <u>all</u>
records of the petitioners and the aforementioned corporations, whatever their
nature, thus openly contravening the explicit command of our Bill of Rights -
that the things to be seized be <u>particularly</u> described - as well as
tending to defeat its major objective:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the elimination of general warrants."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">While the term "all business
transactions" does not appear in Search Warrant No. 2-M-70, the said
warrant nevertheless tends to defeat the major objective of the Bill of Rights,
i.e., the elimination of general warrants, for the language used therein is so
all-embracing as to include all conceivable records of petitioner corporation,
which, if seized, could possibly ren­der its business inoperative.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kheytin</span>,
et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>, etc., et al., 42 Phil. 886,
896, this Court had occasion to explain the purpose of the requirement that the
warrant should particularly describe the place to be searched and the things to
be seized, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Both the Jones Law (sec. 3) and Gen­eral Orders No. 58 (sec. 97) specifically
require that a search warrant should <u>particularly describe</u> the place to
be searched and the things to be seiz­ed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The evident purpose and intent of this require­ment is to limit the
things to be seized to those, and only those, particularly described in the
search warrant - to leave the officers of the law with no discretion regarding
what articles they shall seize, to the end that 'unreasonable searches and
seizures' may not be made, - that abuses may not be committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That this is the correct interpretation of
this con­stitutional provision is borne out by American autho­rities."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The purpose as thus explained could,
surely and effectively, be defeated under the search warrant issued in this
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">A search warrant may be said to particularly describe the things
to be seized when the description therein is as specific as the circumstances
will ordinarily allow (People vs. Rubio, 57 Phil., 384); or when the
description expresses a conclusion of fact - not of law - by which the warrant
officer may be guided in making the search and seizure (<u>idem</u>., dissent
of <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos, <u>J</u>.); or when the things
describes are limited to those which bear direct relation to the offense for
which the warrant is being issued (Sec. 2, Rule 126, Revised Rules of
Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The here­in search warrant does
not conform to any of the foregoing tests.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the articles desired to be seized have any direct relation to an
offense committed, the applicant must necessarily have some evidence, other
than those articles, to prove the said offense; and the articles subject of
search and seizure should come in handy merely to strengthen such
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this event, the description
contained in the herein disputed warrant should have mentioned, at least, the
dates, amounts, persons, and other pertinent data regarding the receipts of
payments, certificates of stocks and securities, contracts, promissory notes,
deeds of sale, messages and communications, checks, bank deposits and
withdrawals, records of foreign remittances, among others, enu­merated in the
warrant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents contend that <i>certiorari</i> does not lie because
petitioners failed to file a motion for reconsideration of respondent Judge's
order of <st1:date year="1970" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention is with­out merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, when the questions raised
before this Court are the same as those which were squarely rais­ed in and
passed upon by the court below, the filing of a motion for reconsideration in
said court before <i>certiorari</i> can be instituted in this Court is no
longer a prerequisite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Pa­jo</span>, etc., et al. vs. Ago, et al., 108
Phil., 905).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the se­cond
place, the rule requiring the filing of a motion for re­consideration before an
application for a writ of <i>certiorari</i> can be entertained was never intended
to be applied without considering the circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Matutina</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Buslon</span>, et al. 109 Phil., 140.)</span> In the
case at bar time is of the essence in view of the tax assessments sought to be
enforced by respond­ent officers of the Bureau of Internal Revenue against <span class="GramE">peti­tioner corporation</span>, on account of which immediate and
more di­rect action becomes necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Matute</span> vs. Court of Appeals, et al., 26
SCRA 768.)</span> Lastly, the rule does not apply where, as in this case, the
deprivation of petitioners' fundamental right to due process taints the
proceeding against them in the court below not only with irregularity but also
with nul­lity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Matute</span> vs. Court of Appeals, et al., <u>supra</u>.)</span><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">It is next contended by respondents that a corporation is not
entitled to protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, we find no merit in the contention.</p>

<blockquote>"Although, for the reasons above stated, we are of the opinion
that an officer of a corporation which is charged with a violation of a statute
of the state of its creation, or of an act of Congress passed in the exercise
of its constitutional powers, cannot refuse to produce the books and papers of
such corporation, we do not wish to be understood as holding that a corporation
is not entitled to immunity, under the 4th Amendment, against <u>unreasonable</u>
searches and seizures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A corporation is,
after all, but an association of individuals under an assumed name and with a
distinct legal entity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In organizing
itself as a collective body it waives no constitutional immunities appropriate
to such body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its property cannot be
taken without compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can only
be proceeded against by due process of law, and is protected, under the 14th Amendment,
against unlawful discrimination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span>
(Hale v. <span class="SpellE">Henkel</span>, 201 <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
43, 50 L. ed. 652.)</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"In Linn v. </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE">United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE">, 163 C.C.A. 470, 251 Fed.</span> 476, 480, it was thought that a
differ­ent rule applied to a corporation, on the ground that it was not
privileged from producing its books and papers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the rights of a corporation against unlawful search and seizure are
to be protected even if the same result might have been achieved in a lawful
way." (Silverthorne Lumber Company, et al. v. <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States of Ame­rica</st1:place></st1:country-region>, 251 <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
385, 64 L. ed. 319.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In <span class="SpellE">Stonehill</span>,
et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>, et al., <u>supra</u>, this Court
impliedly recognized the right of a corporation to object against unreasonable
searches and seizures, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"As regards the first group, we hold that petitioners herein
have <u>no</u> cause of action to assail the legality of the contested warrants
and of the seizures made in pursuance thereof, for the simple reason that said
corporations have their respective personalities, separate and distinct from
the personality of herein petitioners, regardless of the amount of shares of
stock or of the interest of each of them in said corporations, and whatever the
offices they hold therein may be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Indeed,
it is well settled that the legality of a seizure can be contested only by the
part whose rights is have been impaired thereby, and that the objection to an
unlawful search and seizure is purely personal and cannot be availed of by
third parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, petitioners
herein may not validly object to the use in evidence against them of the
documents, papers and things seized from the offices and premises of the
corporations adverted to above, since the right to object to the admission of
said papers in evidence belongs exclusively to the corporations, to whom the
seized effects belong, and may not be invoked by the corporate of­ficers in
proceedings against them in their individual capacity</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In the <span class="SpellE"><u>Stonehill</u></span>
case only the officers of the various corporations in whose offices documents,
papers and effects were searched and seized were the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the corporation to whom
the seized documents belong, and whose rights have thereby been impaired, is
itself a petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that score, <span class="GramE">petitioner corporation</span> here stands on a different footing
from the corporations in <span class="SpellE"><u>Stonehill</u></span>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The tax assessments referred to earlier in this opinion were, if
not entirely - as claimed by petitioners - at least partly - as in effect
admitted by respondents - based on the documents seized by virtue of Search
Warrant No. 2-M-70.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the
fact that the assessments were made some one and one-half months after the
search and seizure on <st1:date year="1970" day="25" month="2">February 25,
 1970</st1:date>, is a strong indication that the documents thus seized served
as basis for the assessments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
assessments should therefore not be enforced.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the petition is granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, Search Warrant No. 2-M-70 issued
by respondent Judge is declared null and void; respondents are permanently
enjoined from enforcing the said search warrant; the documents, papers and
effects seized <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> are ordered to be returned
to petitioners; and respondent officials of the Bureau of Internal Revenue and
their representatives are permanently enjoined from enforcing the assessments
mentioned in Annex "G" of the present petition, as well as other
assessments based on the documents, papers and effects seized under the search
warrant herein nullified, and from using the same against petitioners in any
criminal or other proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
pronouncement as to costs.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur.</p>

<p class="BODY">I agree with the ruling that the search <span class="GramE">warrants
in question violates</span> the specific injunction of Section 3, Rule 126 that
"No search warrant shall issue for more than one specific offense."
There is no question in my mind that, as very clearly pointed out by Mr.
Justice <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>, the phrase "for violation of
Section 46(a) of the National Internal Revenue Code in relation to all other
pertinent provisions thereof, particularly Sections 53, 72, 73, 208 and
209" refers to more than one specific of­fense, considering that the
violation of Section 53 which refers to withholding of income taxes at the
sources, Section 208 which punishes pursuit of business or occupation without
payment of the corresponding specific or privilege taxes, and Section 209 which
penalizes failure to make a return of receipts sales, business or gross value
output actually removed or to pay the taxes thereon in connection with Title V
on Privilege Taxes on Business and Occupation can hardly be absorbed in a
charge of alleged violation of Section 46(a), which merely requires the filing
of in­come tax returns by corporations, so as to constitute with it a single
offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I perceive here the danger that
the result of the search applied for may be used as basis not only for a charge
of violating Section 46(a) but also and separately of Section 53, 208 and
209.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, it is to be admitted
that Sections 72 and 73, also mentioned in the application, are really directly
related to Section 46(a) because Section 72 provides for surcharges for failure
to render returns and for rendering false and fraudulent returns and Section 73
refers to the penalty for failure to file returns or to pay the corresponding
tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Taken together, they constitute one
single offense penalized under Section 73.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I am not and cannot be in favor of any scheme which amounts to an
indirect means of achieving that which is not allowed to be done directly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By merely saying that a party is being
charged with violation of one section of the code in relation to a number of
other sections thereof which in truth have no clear or direct bearing with the
first is to me condemnable because it is no less than a shotgun device which
trenches on the basic liber­ties intended to be protected by the unequivocal
limitations imposed by the Constitution and the Rules of Court on the privilege
to secure a search warrant with the aggravating circumstance of being coupled
with an attempt to mislead the judge before whom the application for its issuance
is presented.</p>

<p class="BODY">I cannot close this brief concurrence without expressing my
vehement disapproval of the action taken by respondent internal revenue
authorities in us­ing the documents and papers secured during the search, the
legality of which was pending resolution by the court, as basis of an
assessment, no matter how highly motivated such action might have been.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This smacks of lack of respect, if not
contempt for the court and is certainly intolerable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the very least, it appears as an attempt
to render the court proceedings moot and academic, and dealing as this case
does with cons­titutionally protected rights which are part and parcel of the
basic concepts of individual liberty and democracy, the government agents
should have been the first ones to refrain from trying to make a farce of these
court proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is to be
regret­ted that the government agents and the court have acted irregularly, for
it is highly doubtful if it would be consistent with the sacredness of the
rights here­in found to have been violated to permit the filing of another
application which complies with the consti­tutional requirements above
discussed and the making of another search upon the return of the papers and
documents now in their illegal possession.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This could be an instance wherein taxes properly due the State will
probably remain <span class="SpellE">unassessed</span> and unpaid only because
the ones in charge of the execution of the laws did not know how to respect
basic constitutional rights and liberties.</p>
