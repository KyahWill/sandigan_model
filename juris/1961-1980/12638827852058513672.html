the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission which denied the grant of
death compensation benefits to petitioner under the provisions of the Workmen's
Compensation Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, Catalina V. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Labuca</span>, filed the present petition in her capacity as the
widow of the late Domingo <span class="SpellE">Labuca</span> who has been
employed by respondent Bureau of Public Schools as a public schoolteacher since
1938 up to the time of his death on <st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="3">March
 6, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was during his
employment that he was afflicted with pulmonary tuberculosis and which illness
eventually led to his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After his
death, his widow, the petitioner herein filed a claim for death benefits with
the Workmen's Compensation Unit of Regional Office No.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>VII which claim respondent Republic failed to
controvert on time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing the
case on the merits, the Acting Referee issued an award in favor of petitioner,
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the respondent is hereby ordered to pay, through
this Office, the following pecuniary obligations, to wit:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To claimant, in lump sum, the total amount
of FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY FOUR and 76/100 (P5,794.76) PESOS
(P4,680.00 as death benefits plus P914.76-reimbursable medical and hospital
expenses plus P200.00-burial expenses equals P5,794.76) as death benefits;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To Atty. Uri al <span class="SpellE">Leopando</span>,
the counsel who helped the claimant litigate this claim, the amount of TWO
HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR (P234.00) PESOS, as attorney's fee; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To this Office the amount of FORTY SEVEN
(P47.00) PESOS, as administrative fee, pursuant to Section 55, Act No. 3428, as
amended."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Bureau of Public Schools appealed the award of the
Acting Referee to the respondent Workmen's Compensation Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon review of the case, the respondent Commission sustained the
compensability of the claim but disallowed the payment of benefits to
petitioner on the ground that "(T)he records is bereft of such evidence to
sustain the findings that she is the legal wife of the decedent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the respondent Commission the
certificate of marriage issued by the Parish Priest of Lila, <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span>, attesting to the fact that they were married cannot
be considered authentic document to prove <span class="SpellE">filiation</span>
between the deceased and the herein claimant but only a proof of the solemnization
of their marriage sacrament."</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot agree with the respondent Commission's ruling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, it lost sight of the presumption
found in Section 5 of Rule 131<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Rules of Court which stands in petitioner's favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased and petitioner have lived
together as husband and wife and during all the years of their married life
they have several children who are now all of legal age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Undoubtedly existing jurisprudence<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
supports petitioner's cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the
Office of the Solicitor General has taken cognizance of this fact and
accordingly recommended the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the Acting
Referee's decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Beside, aside from
her own testimony<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
petitioner has submitted the certificate of marriage issued by the parish
priest of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bohol</span></st1:place> attesting to
the fact that she was legally married to the late Domingo <span class="SpellE">Labuca</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said certificate is sufficient to prove the
fact of marriage (<span class="SpellE">Pugeda</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Trias</span>,
supra, 4 SCRA 849, 855).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner even
presented the certificate of registration of her marriage issued by the Civil
Register of <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span> when she filed her memorandum with
this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not present this at
the first instance because she thought that a certificate issued by the church
is more credible than one issued by the civil authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, respondent Republic
(Bureau of Public Schools) has not disputed or presented any evidence to
dispute petitioner's claim that she is the widow of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the Solicitor General's Office has
recommended payment of benefits to petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, as it has been aptly pointed out, the Workmen's Compensation
Commission being a body not governed by the technical rules of evidence,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
it should have acted favorably on petitioner's claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be remembered that the Workmen's
Compensation Act is a social legislation<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
intended to benefit the workingman or his dependent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of his death and in case of doubt,
the same should be resolved in favor of the laborer and his dependents.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
This policy finds greater cause in petitioner's case because she has been left
without her source of support and in the pursuit of the present petition, she
was compelled to litigate as a pauper.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, </b>the decision of the respondent
Commission is hereby reversed and set aside and that of the Acting Referee
modified, requiring respondent Republic of the Philippines (Bureau of Public
Schools), to pay petitioner in lump sum the total amount of P6,000.00 as death
compensation benefits; the amount of P914.76 as reimbursement for medical and hospital
expenses and the amount of P200.00 for burial expenses; to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Urial</span> <span class="SpellE">Leopando</span> the amount of
P600.00 as attorney's fees and to the proper office, the amount of P61.00 as
administrative fee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without
