				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This <i>mandamus</i> proceeding presents one of those cases,
hopefully rare, where a respondent Judge appears to be less than duly mindful
of what the controlling doctrines of this Court require—very much less.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would deny <st1:place><st1:placename>petitioner</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Republic</st1:placetype></st1:place> the right to appeal from
an order allowing private respondent <span class="SpellE">Choa</span> Peck to
take his oath as a naturalized citizen on the ground of the late filing of the
record on appeal, counting such period from the time notice of such order was
furnished the Provincial Fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
rule is well-settled however that it is only upon receipt thereof by the
Solicitor General that the time commences for elevating the matter to this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Mandamus</i> is thus the
appropriate remedy to which <st1:place><st1:placename>petitioner</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Republic</st1:placetype></st1:place> is entitled.</p>

<p class="BODY">As noted in the petition, private respondent <span class="SpellE">Choa</span>
Peck filed with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
a petition for naturalization on <st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="12">December
 22, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, due
hearing was appealed to obtain a favorable decision on <st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1966</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
There was a motion for reconsideration denied by respondent Judge.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
While the proper step for an appeal was taken, it was not allowed as respondent
Judge denied the motion for extension of time to file the record on appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1968" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1968</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Choa</span> Peck filed a petition to take his
oath with respondent Judge setting the same for hear­ing on December 27 of that
year.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
This was followed, on <st1:date year="1969" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1969</st1:date>,
with an order from respondent Judge direct­ing the issuance of the certificate
of naturalization to respondent <span class="SpellE">Choa</span> Peck after
taking the oath as provided according to law, notice of which was received by
the office of the Solicitor General on <st1:date year="1969" day="22" month="1">January
 22, 1969</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
On February 17, 1969, within the thirty-day period, petitioner Republic filed a
notice of appeal and simultaneously a record on appeal based according to the
petition on "five (5) fundamental grounds, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the jurisdiction of the lower Court to
hear the case considering that the petition was not published as required by
law (2) the insufficiency of the alleged income of the petitioner-applicant,
herein respondent <span class="SpellE">Choa</span> Peck alias <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>
Peck (3) his use of an alias name, without judicial authority (4) his lack of
good moral character, and (5) the irregularity in the hearing of the petition
for oath-taking * * *." <a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> As
respondent Judge failed to take any action on the record on appeal, <st1:place><st1:placename>petitioner</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Republic</st1:placetype></st1:place>, on <st1:date year="1969" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1969</st1:date>, moved that the record on appeal be
approved.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came the challenged order of respondent Judge on August 9, 1969 dis­approving
the record on appeal and dismissing the appeal on the ground that it was filed
out of time, the period being counted from the time the Provincial Fiscal
received the order of January 10, 1969, which was on the next day, January 11,
1969, rather than from the receipt by the Solicitor General on February 21,
1969.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> <st1:place><st1:placename>Petitioner</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Republic</st1:placetype></st1:place> decided to take up the
matter with this Court in this <i>mandamus</i> proceeding in view of what it
considered the utter futility of respondent Judge harboring a change of mind
and manifesting conformity to what has been decided by this Court as to the
period for filing an appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent portion of the order of respondent Judge of <st1:date year="1969" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1969</st1:date>, complained of in this <i>mandamus</i>
suit, reads as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The
petitioner, in his opposition, claims that the appeal was filed out of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The order of this Court issued after the final hearing allowing the
petitioner to take his oath after the two-year period from the rendition of the
judgment dated January 10, 1969 was received by the State through the
Provincial Fiscal on January 11, 1969 and the notice of appeal filed by the
Solicitor General is dated February 17, 1969 but received by the Court on
February 21, 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record on appeal
was received by the Court on <st1:date year="1969" day="21" month="2">February
 21, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is very evident
therefore, that from January 11, 1969, the date of the receipt of the order by
the Solicitor General through the Provincial Fiscal up to February 21, 1969,
the filing of the notice of appeal by the Solicitor General, a period of forty-one
days had lapsed so that the present appeal interposed by the Solicitor General
was really filed out of time."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Its <span class="SpellE">dis­positive</span> portion states the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Considering that the appeal taken by
the Solicitor General was filed out of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period, the record on appeal is hereby disapproved and the appeal
dismissed."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">1. Thus on its face there is a failure to abide by what this Court
has consistently decided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Republic v.
Chiu,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
a 1964 decision, the opinion being penned by Justice Barrera, it was expressly
stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"As the Solicitor General
received copy of the decision of the lower court on <st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1962</st1:date>, the period to appeal would have
expired on <st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The filing of the notice of appeal and record
on appeal on September 4 and 6, 1962, respectively, were therefore made on
time."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Then in Qua v. Republic,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
decided the next year, such a doctrine was reiterated in an opinion written by
the same jurist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In the present case, the Solicitor
General was not furnished copy of the order of the lower court of December 22,
1962, allowing petitioner to take the required oath of allegiance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Strictly speaking, therefore, no proper
service of said order was ever made on the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, considering that <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>-appellant
admits that copy of the disputed order was received by the Solicitor General on
March 13, 1963, it is this date, not the date of receipt thereof by the
Provincial Fiscal, that should be considered in determining the timeliness or <span class="SpellE">untimeliness</span> of the motion for reconsideration filed by the
former."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor does it avail private
respondent to state that since the previous appeal was disallowed the
substantive matters that would form the basis for a review of the grant of
citizenship to respondent Peck could no longer be taken up in this appeal from
the order of <st1:date year="1969" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was so clearly stated in Yong <span class="SpellE">Sai</span> v. Republic,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
in an opinion by Justice <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is a settled rule that the decision
of the court of first instance in naturalization cases does not become final
until after the expi­ration of the period to appeal from the order of the court
authorizing the taking of the oath of allegiance as provided in Section 1 of
Republic Act No. 530 - and this, notwithstanding that the applicant for citizenship
had already taken his oath of allegiance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, it is a settled rule that an appeal from the order of the
court of first instance authorizing the taking of the of allegiance, under
Section 1 of Republic Act 530, subjects the <u>entire</u> naturalization
proceedings to scrutiny by the Supreme Court, so that any matter pertinent to
the determination of:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>whether or not the
applicant for naturalization is really qualified to become a Filipino citizen,
whether or not the original petition had complied with all the requirements of
the law, and whether or not the procedural requirements in the lower court had
been complied with, may be reviewed on appeal by this Court if those matters
are not touched in the briefs or pleadings of the parties."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Only last May, this Court, through Justice <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>,
made manifest anew its adherence to the doctrine that the merits for the
petition for naturalization are still open for an inquiry when the question is
elevated to us from an order allowing the oath-taking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"This High Tribunal never deviated from its ruling that a
naturalization proceeding is not simply a private contest between the applicant
and the Solicitor General but is a matter impressed with the highest public
interest, involving as it does an inquiry as to when an alien should be allowed
to enjoy the coveted boon of Filipino citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is for this reason that the burden of
proof is upon the applicant to show full and complete compliance with the
requirements of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The government
can at all stages of the proceeding raise the issue of such non­-compliance
even without filing a formal opposition to the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the government, it is never too
late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal from the order of the
lower court authorizing the taking of the oath of allegiance subjects the <u>entire</u>
naturalization proceedings to scrutiny by the Supreme Court to determine
whether the applicant has all the qualifications and none of the
disqualifications and whether he has complied with the procedural requirements
of the law, even if those matters are not touched in the briefs or pleadings of
the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if the government files
an opposition, it is not duty bound to specify the grounds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the applicant fails to establish by
affirmative proof his compliance with the legal require­ments, the court should
deny his application."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>
