				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner appealed
from </span><span style="">a
</span><span style="">decision of the Court of First
Instance of </span>Manila <span style="">dismissing
her petition for mandamus and prohibition with preliminary injunction, which
seeks to compel the respondent City Mayor to file, with the Municipal </span><span style="">Board of </span><span style="">Manila, </span><span style="">administrative charges </span>against certain
members of <span style="">the
Manila Police Department</span> without having the matter first investigated by
the Inspection <span style="">Division of the Manila Police </span>Department.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Sometime in 1963, the
petitioner, Elena L. <span style="">Gar­cia, </span>allegedly
the victim of an illegal arrest commit­ted by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Patrocinio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sembrano</span> and Pat <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span> de
Vera of the Manila Police Department (referred to hereinafter as the MPD),
lodged a complaint against the latter in the office of the City Mayor of
Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting upon the complaint, the
Mayor indorsed it to the Inspection Division of the MPD "in order to
determine whether there <span style="">is </span>a
cause of action." Appear</span><span style="">ing before </span><span style="">said </span><span style="">office, the
petitioner contested its jurisdiction to investigate her complaint, but the
objection was overruled upon an opinion given by a legal officer of the MPD.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence, petitioner
instituted the instant proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner
takes the view that upon receipt by the City Mayor of her complaint against the
two po­licemen, it became the Mayor's ministerial duty, under section 1 of
Republic Act 557, to prefer and file charges against them with the Municipal
Board of Manila, based on the allegations of her complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In
dismissing the petition, the lower court upheld the contention advanced by the
respondents that "the City Mayor is not duty bound to prefer and file the
corresponding charges with the Municipal Board, for the law gives him the
discretion to prefer and file or refuse to prefer and file, the corresponding
charges, depending on whether or not he finds a pro­bable or </span><u><span style="">prima</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">facie</span></u><span style=""> case against the policemen."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The view of the trial
court is sound and persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
section 1 of the law provides that </span><span style="">for the purposes of securing disciplinary action
against a member of the city police force, charges shall be preferred by the
city mayor and investigated by the city council, this provision does not
preclude the city mayor from conducting a prior inquiry in order to ascertain
whether the complaint lodged in his office, is </span><u><span style="">prima</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">facie</span></u><span style=""> meritorious or sham, before he himself files formal charges with the
city council or municipal board, and in so ascertaining, he can delegate the
investigation of the case to any capable person or group of persons subordinate
to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, to hold that it is the
ministerial duty of the city mayor to file charges <span class="SpellE">everytime</span>
he receives complaint from private citizens, regardless of whether the charges
have </span><u><span style="">prima</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">facie</span></u><span style=""> merit, is to make the office of the Mayor an
instrument for persecution if the case turns out later on to be without basis
and reason.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The case relied upon by
the petitioner-appellant (<span class="SpellE">Covacha</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Amante</span>, 99 Phil. 1037), is not squarely in point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, the investigation of a member
of the police force, after the charges were formally filed, was conducted by a
committee created by the city mayor of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bacolod</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead of the city council, it was the committee that was assigned to
determine whether the policeman was going to be suspended or removed or
otherwise punished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar,
however, no charges had as yet been filed by the City Mayor of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inquiry that was to be conducted by the
Investigation Division of the MPD was only for the mayor's own purposes and not
in substitution for the investigation contemplated in section 1 of Republic Act
557, which would be conducted by the municipal board should charges be filed by
the City Mayor himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Be that as it may, the
question, however, has become academic with the enactment of the Police Act of
1966</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> creating the Police Commission, which
provides in its section 14 that -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Members of the local police agency shall not be suspended or
removed except upon written complaint filed under oath with the Board of
Investigators herein provided for misconduct or <span class="SpellE">incompetency</span>,
dishonesty, disloyalty to <span style="">the </span><span style="">Government, serious irregularities </span><span style="">in the performance of their duties, and
violation of law."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Under
</span><span style="">this
provision of the law, it is not a require­ment that charges against the peace
officer be pre</span><span style="">ferred </span><span style="">by the city or
municipal mayor or provincial governor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 24 of the law makes provision for the repeal or modification of
the provisions of Republic Act 557 which are inconsistent with the Act, </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">Saving Clause thereof (sec. 25) decrees that all pending administrative
cases involving police service and personnel shall be absorbed by the Police
Commission one hundred days after the publication of the Police Manual
containing rules and regu­lations relative to such matters."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">WHEREFORE</b><span style="">, the decision is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs </span><span style="">at </span><span style="">this instance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
