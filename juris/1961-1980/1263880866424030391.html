				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">It was an unfortunate
turn of events that led to appellant Vicente Montero y <span class="SpellE">Bragas</span>
taking a hand in a street brawl where </span>a neighbor, <span class="SpellE">Rufo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Naboa</span> by name, was involved with two brothers,
Salvador <span class="SpellE">Balacano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balacano</span>, the former of whom died, with the latter
having survived and having lived to testify as the sole eyewitness against
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prosecuted for frustrated homicide
with <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> as the offended party, and for murder in
the case of <st1:city><st1:place>Salvador</st1:place></st1:city> as the victim,
Montero was acquitted of the former charge and convicted of the latter offense,
being sentenced to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
with indemnification to the heirs of the <span style="">deceased
in the sum of P12,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main basis for seeking a
reversal by appellant is the failure of </span>the prosecution to overcome the
constitutional presumption of innocence.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
A careful study of the evidence discloses that a more careful and intensive
scrutiny thereof would sustain the stand of appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While there were five witnesses for the
prosecution, the sole testimony directly pointing to him as the one who fired
the fatal shot came from one of the offended parties, <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balacano</span>, but contradictions of a serious character
minimized the worth of his assertions on the stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true a sister, <span class="SpellE">Editha</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balacano</span>, testified, but she came to the scene of the
affray after her brother <st1:city><st1:place>Salvador</st1:place></st1:city>
was shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, she was quite
certain that he held in his hand a long gun, presumably the one used, but the
declaration of an objective and neutral witness was that the slug recovered
from the body of the deceased did not come from the rifle of the accused, but
possibly from a firearm, like a local <span class="SpellE"><u>sumpak</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, there was no proof of any motive
that could have led appellant to perpetrate the act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reference then to the authoritative principle
that only by proof beyond reasonable doubt could the constitutional presumption
of innocence be overcome, affords more than ample warrant for the appealed
judgment being overturned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We reverse.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">According to the appealed
decision: "The only issue is who inflicted the injuries on the
victim."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">This
was the answer: "The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Balacano</span> strongly yields the conclusion that accused was
the one who shot the deceased Salvador <span class="SpellE">Balacano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Balacano</span> testified in a spontaneous, candid, frank and
straightforward manner that while he and his brother </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Salvador</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> were walking along the railroad track and
upon reaching the house of the accused, they were immediately followed by the
accused and his companions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused was
armed with a short gun while his companions were with lead pipes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, he was immediately stabbed by the
son of the accused, Henry, and for which he shouted to his brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This caused his brother to look back and at
that precise moment, he was shot on the forehead causing him to fall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, the companions </span>of the
accused immediately stabbed and hit him with lead pipes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Balacano</span>
was corroborated by her sister <span class="SpellE">Edita</span> who likewise
declared that when she was</span> informed by <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>
that their brother Salvador was shot, she immediately went to the railroad
track and there found her brother Salvador sprawled and [beside] him was
Vicente Montero holding a gun together with his companions like Carding, Henry
Montero, Eden Negro and <span class="SpellE">Rufo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Henry was with a bladed instrument and the
other companions were with lead pipes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When she shouted for help, they all ran away."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
That was all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court concluded
that appellant, who was the only one prosecuted, was the guilty party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out at the outset, had there been
a more thorough appraisal of the evidence submitted, without the grave
contradictions having been ignored, and with the other circumstances casting
doubt on the guilt of the accused considered as well as the lack of motive
evaluated, the judgment could have been different.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The rest of the opinion
will be devoted to a discussion of the </span>a<span style="">bove propositions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1. It is undoubted that the only person who could testify as an
eyewitness to the alleged guilt of appellant was <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balacano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After alleging that he was stabbed, it was to be expected that he would
run away from the scene of the occurrence, after warning his brother <st1:city><st1:place>Salvador</st1:place></st1:city>
that he should do the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was what
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was hardly in a position
then to be quite precise as to what transpired next.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is not open to question was that <st1:city><st1:place>Salvador</st1:place></st1:city>
was shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did categorically declare
on the stand that it was appellant who did it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the circumstances, such affirmation coming from a single witness
should have been the subject of a thorough and dispassionate appraisal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, in a number of cases, had
precisely based its judgment of acquittal on the insufficiency for conviction
based on a testimony of a single individual.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So it was held in People v. <span class="SpellE">Ricarte</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
where this Court, through Justice Perfecto, noted the lack of persuasiveness of
such evidence when it betrayed "contradiction" and "an attitude
apparently inconsistent with the truth."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The testimony that led to the conviction came from the lone eyewitness, <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Balacano</span>, as noted,
brother of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On direct
testimony, he was quite positive that appellant, armed with a short-gun,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>shot the deceased.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
On cross-examination, he admitted that he testified differently when there was a
police investigation of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
quote his exact words: "Hindi <span class="SpellE">ko</span> <span class="SpellE">nakita</span> kung <span class="SpellE">anong</span> <span class="SpellE">baril</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">ginamit</span>
<span class="SpellE">niya</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">kapatid</span>
<span class="SpellE">ko</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Nor did he inform the police, again
as shown in cross-examination, that the one who stabbed him was a son of the
accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came People v. <span class="SpellE">Cauilan</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
where this Court, with Chief Justice Moran as <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span>,
spoke of the worthless character of the testimony of a single witness as
"self-contradictory" and "inconsistent with previous
statements" made by him.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
It was the same Justice Perfecto whose opinion in People v. <st1:country-region><st1:place>Valencia</st1:place></st1:country-region><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
rightfully disregarded the lone, unreliable and uncorroborated testimony of a
single witness.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2. This is by no means to assert that acquittal would necessarily
be entailed by the inability of the prosecution to have available more than one
witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far back as 1902, in United
States v. <span class="SpellE">Cabe</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
reported in the first volume of the Philippine Reports, Chief Justice Arellano
spoke for this Court thus: "The fact that only one witness testified is
not an obstacle to our becoming fully convinced as to the certainty of the
occurrence and of the guilt of the defendants, because, in addition to the
testimony of this witness, we find grave and conclusive circumstantial
evidence, based upon proven facts, * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The <span class="SpellE">Cabe</span> decision was cited with approval in
subsequent cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
So it should be, if the weakness associated by the lone testimony is remedied
by circumstantial evidence "grave and conclusive" in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this prosecution on the contrary, the
circumstantial evidence pointed the other way.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appealed decision summarized the testimony on cross-examination of
Simeon Molina, the chief of the ballistics section of the Manila Police
Department thus: "In said cross-examination this witness declared that he
cannot say with certainty whether Exhibit G-1 is a slug.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is possible that it is a fragment of a
projectile or pellet like a bullet fired from a rifle barrel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pellet was fired from a firearm like
shotguns or the local '<span class="SpellE">sumpak</span>' which has a GI pipe
used as a barrel and another pipe welded on a rear and where a firing pin
device is placed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cartridge is
placed inside the GI tube and made to meet with the other tube.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the improvised firing pin hits the
primer of the cartridge, it causes a discharge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The weight of Exhibit G-1 is 23-1 grains while the bullet weight used in
Exhibit H-1 is 37 to 40 grains.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
possible that Exhibit G-1 might have been fired from a '<span class="SpellE">sumpak</span>"
because of the shape and weight of Exhibit G-1.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It resembles the deformed birdshot, pellet 18.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit H-1 appeared not to have been
tampered."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
It is worth noting that in a recent case, People v. <span class="SpellE">Tiongson</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
what was testified to by the same Simeon F. Molina proved decisive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As summarized in the opinion of the then
Justice, later Chief Justice, <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>: "The
above firearms, as well as the cartridge cases and bullets found at the scene
of the crime, and the bullets extracted from the bodies of the victims, were
all submitted to the Criminal Investigation Laboratory of the Manila Police
Department to determine which firearms but allege certain circumstances which,
they contend conducted by Simeon F. Molina, ballistics technician of said
laboratory, who submitted a report (Exhibit P) and testified in court on his
findings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Molina, except
for four .30 caliber fired bullets and one .30 caliber fired carbine cartridge
case, as to which no conclusions could be made because of their deformed or
mutilated condition, all the bullets and cartridge cases examined by him came
from the firearms marked Exhibits G-3, G-4, G-5 and G-6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of them, he said, could have been
discharged from appellant <span class="SpellE">Yacat's</span> weapon (Exhibit
G-1) which, although also of caliber .30, is not of the carbine type but a
Browning automatic rifle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as far as
appellant Antonio's <span class="SpellE">Garand</span> rifle (Exhibit G-2) was
concerned, no bullets or empty shells from such a firearm were submitted to
Molina for examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
significant to note further in this connection that when Exhibits G-1 and G-2
were surrendered the first had its magazine still containing 17 live
ammunition, and the second had its clip with 8 rounds, likewise <span class="SpellE">undischarged</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
It went on to state that in convicting two of the appellants reliance was
placed "on the testimony of Ramon Lopez and <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span>
<span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> to the effect that all the soldiers took part
in the shooting, and on the statement of Detective Napoleon <span class="SpellE">Albano</span>
that they made an admission to that effect when he questioned them."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Then the opinion made clear why the findings of the ballistics expert should
prevail: "The evidence given by Lopez and <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>
implicating appellants <span class="SpellE">Yacat</span> and Antonio is, as
previously observed, contradicted by the finding of the ballistics expert
presented by the prosecution that not a single bullet or cartridge case found
in the premises or extracted from the victims' bodies came from the firearms of
said appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>
testified as to the number of soldiers who participated, but could not
positively identify them individually at the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the exciting and rather confused
events of the evening, it is not improbable for him to be mistaken as to the
exact number of the assailants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
testimony of Ramon Lopez concerning the part played by <span class="SpellE">Yacat</span>
and Antonio is hardly <span style="">any better."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The result was acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it should have been in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That would have been to accord deference to
the landmark <span class="SpellE">Cabe</span> ruling of Chief Justice Arellano.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">3. The conclusion that the appellant ought to have been acquitted
is reinforced by the doctrine announced by Justice Trent in United States v. <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Quingco</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
a 1910 decision: "While it is true that the testimony of one witness is
sufficient to sustain a conviction, if such testimony establishes the guilt of
the accused beyond reasonable doubt, we think that the testimony of the one witness
in this case is not sufficient for this purpose. * * * The appellants have the
presumption of innocence in their favor until the contrary is proven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The positive testimony of the two appellants
is sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to their guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This doubt must be resolved in favor of the
appellants."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Mention may likewise be made of <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. <span class="SpellE">Olais</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
where Justice Malcolm warned against considering lone testimony being
"sufficient to support a judgment of conviction [unless] it satisfies
beyond reasonable doubt."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Certainly unless there be an unwarranted relaxation of such standard to justify
a verdict against an accused, appellant should have been acquitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appealed decision would assume that the
aggressors against the <span class="SpellE">Balacano</span> brothers were
companions of appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no
competent proof that such was the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of fact, they apparently remained at large.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was the only one charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was also indicted for stabbing the lone
eyewitness, <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Balacano</span>,
but he was acquitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not serve
the cause of clarity for the decision concerned with the prosecution of a
single individual to harp repeatedly on the participants of a street brawl
whose connection with the appellant was assumed rather than proved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There would likely have been no departure
from the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> authoritative precedents, if
greater attention were paid by the lower court to the testimony of
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He started by saying that he
was peacefully at home in <span class="SpellE">Gagalangin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span> around <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">ten o'clock</st1:time>
in the evening of <st1:date year="1970" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1970</st1:date>,
when he heard his neighbor, <span class="SpellE">Rufo</span> <span class="SpellE">Naboa</span>,
shouting for help.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
He went down and "saw him grappling and rolling with his enemy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[He] shouted at them to stop."<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
He was armed with his rifle.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
His interference was purely for the purpose of pacifying them, but evidently
the <span class="SpellE">Balacano</span> brothers resented what he was doing, and
they both rushed at him.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he fired successive shots upwards,
purely a defensive measure on his part.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
Nor was there anything out of the ordinary for both brothers to run away.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
Thereafter, he "heard loud gunshots and also not so loud gunshots."<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
By that time, they had gone quite far, and he himself "was by the door of [his]
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not notice anymore what
else happened."<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
He was intensively cross-examined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
remained steadfast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing to the
contrary was elicited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If at all, the
additional questions added to the credibility of what was testified to by
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the question as to how he tried
to stop the brawl, he answered that he said: "<span class="SpellE"><u>Itigil</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">iyang</span> away <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">iyan</span></u>.”<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
He admitted that in addition to <span class="SpellE">Naboa</span> and the two <span class="SpellE">Balacano</span> brothers, there were many other persons, but he
could not remember their names as his attention was focused on the two persons
grappling.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
He then reaffirmed that he saw the brothers running away from the scene of the
quarrel.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
The lower court however failed to accord any weight to his testimony as well as
to that of his witness, one Leonardo de <span class="SpellE">Asis</span>, a
laborer living on the same street where his house was located and likewise an
eyewitness to what transpired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
cannot escape attention is that appellant's version was not at all
discredited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor could it be said that
there was any motive on his part to inflict any injury on the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is thus more than ample justification

v. <span class="SpellE">Cabe</span>, negating appellant's guilt and the
"positive testimony" to quote from <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Quingco</span> pointing to lack of culpability on his part, the
constitutional presumption of innocence ought to have dictated a different
result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without proof of guilt beyond

"By reasonable doubt is not meant that which of possibility may arise, but
it is that doubt engendered by an investigation of the whole proof and an
inability, after such investigation, to let the mind rest easy upon the
certainty of guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Absolute certainty
of guilt is not demanded by the law to convict of any criminal charge but moral
is required, and this certainty is required as to every proposition of proof
requisite to constitute the offense."<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>

decision: "Only if the judge below and the appellate tribunal could arrive
at a conclusion that the crime had been committed precisely by the person on
trial under such an exacting test should the sentence be one of
conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus required that
every circumstance favoring his innocence be duly taken into account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proof against him must survive the test

defendant could be laid the responsibility for the offense charged; that not
only did he perpetrate the act but that it amounted to a crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is required then is moral
certainty."<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">5. Nor is there any persuasive force to the argument that as a
general rule, respect is to be accorded to the findings of fact by the trial
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has never allowed such
a principle to take precedence over the consti­tutional provision that an
accused is presumed innocent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quite <u>apropos</u>
then is this excerpt from People v. <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>:<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a>
"In essence, what is contended for by counsel is that the constitutional
right to be presumed innocent is not to be nullified by the application of the
well-settled doctrine that matters of credibility are<span style=""> </span><span style="">for </span>the lower
court to decide in the absence of a fact or circumstance which has been
overlooked or the significance of which has been misinterpreted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a principle may without inaccuracy be
looked upon likewise as a presumption, one moreover borne out by
experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is easy to discern that a
trial judge is better situated than an appellate court in the appraisal of the testimony
offered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The witnesses are there before
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He hears them testify; he observes
their demeanor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He can sense the
tell-tale signs of prevarication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
not too difficult for him to distinguish between honest mistakes and deliberate
fabrications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus a judge, especially
one who has had years on the bench and with the training and habitude in the
art, may be trusted to sift the false from the true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not likely that he can be easily taken
in by the adroitness and skill of counsel or the well rehearsed performance of
the individual on the stand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, such a doctrine certainly cannot rise above the
constitutional presumption of innocence which can only be overcome if the proof
of guilt is beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
doctrine of this Tribunal, however well-grounded in our past decisions, cannot
prevail as against a mandate of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that sense, it is understandable why
counsel for the accused would invoke such a right."<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a>

free.</p>
