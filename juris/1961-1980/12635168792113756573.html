Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> dismissing the
complaint in Civil Case No. 6880 of that court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 23, 1956, a passenger bus of the Victory Liner
Transportation Co., Inc. driven by <span class="SpellE">Felardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Paje</span>, collided within the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Lubao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, with a jeep
driven by <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> Marcia, resulting in the latter’s
death and in physical injuries to two other persons,</p>

<p class="BODY">An information for homicide and double serious physical injuries
through reckless imprudence was filed against <span class="SpellE">Felardo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Paje</span> in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The heirs
of <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> Marcia reserved their right to institute
a separate civil action for damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
November 7, 1960, the accused, <span class="SpellE">Felardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Paje</span>, was found guilty and convicted of the crime charged
in the infor­mation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said defendant
appealed the judgment of conviction to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 21, 1961, <span style="">while defendant's appeal was pending decision in the Court of Appeals, <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> Marcia's heirs, namely, his widow, Laura Corpus,
and their minor children, instituted in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> a separate civil </span><span style="">action </span><span style="">(Civil Case No. </span>6880)
<span style="">for damages based upon the criminal act
of reckless imprudence against <span class="SpellE">Felardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Paje</span> and the Victory Liner Transportation Co., Inc.,
defendants, praying </span>that <span style="">said
defendants be ordered to pay jointly and severally the amounts of damages
claimed by the plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November </span><span style="">9, </span><span style="">1962, the Court of Appeals promulgated its decision in the appeal of <span class="SpellE">Felardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Paje</span> reversing the ap­pealed
judgment and acquitting the appellant after finding that the reckless
imprudence charged against him did not exist, and that the collision was a case
of pure accident.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="12"><span style="">December
 </span><span style="">29, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">the defendants filed in the civil action a motion to dismiss on the
ground that the action was barred by the acquittal by the Court of Appeals of
the defendant <span class="SpellE">Felardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Paje</span>
in the criminal action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was
denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At the pre-trial of the </span><span style="">civil </span><span style="">case, the defendants asked the court to rule
on their special defense that plaintiffs' cause of action n based upon a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> had prescribed con­sidering that the complaint was
brought four years and eleven months after the collision and that according to
Article 1144 of the Civil Code an action based upon a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>
must be instituted within four years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lower court, in </span><span style="">its order </span><span style="">of May 31, </span>1966, <span style="">dismissed
the complaint on the ground that plaintiffs’ action was based upon a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> and that it had prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs appealed direct to this Court
on </span><span style="">questions </span><span style="">of law from the order dismissing the
complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plaintiffs-appellants
contend that the lower court erred in dismissing the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention is unmeritorious in view of
the following considerations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The acquittal of the
defendant <span class="SpellE">Felardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Paje</span> by
the Court of Appeals in the criminal action on the ground that the reckless
imprudence or criminal negligence charged against him did not exist and that the
collision was a case of pure accident, was a bar to the civil action for
damages for the death of <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> Marcia, which
action was based upon the same criminal negligence of which the defendant <span class="SpellE">Felardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Paje</span> was acquitted in the
criminal action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the celebrated case
of <span class="SpellE">Chantangco</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Abaroa</span>,
which was an appeal from the Philippine Supreme Court to the United States <span style="">Supreme Court, 218 U.S. 476; 54 L. Ed., 1116;
40 Phil., 1056, Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Lurton</span>, speaking for the
Supreme Court of the United States, said:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is true that one of the plaintiffs in the present case
reserved whatever right he may have had to bring a civil action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was obviously of no avail, inasmuch as
there resulted a judgment for the defendant, and the plain inference from the
foregoing is that a verdict of acquittal <span style="">must
</span>carry with it exemption from civil responsibility."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Criminal negligence, that
is, reckless imprudence, is not one of the three crimes mentioned in Article </span>33
<span style="">of the Civil Code which authorizes the
institution of an independ</span>ent civil action, that is, of an entirely
separate and dis­tinct civil action for damages, which shall proceed
independently of the criminal prosecution and shall be proved only by a
preponderance of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said article
mentions only the crimes of defamation, fraud (<span class="SpellE">estafa</span>)
and physical injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although in the
case of <span class="SpellE">Dyogi</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>,
et al., G. R. No. L-9623, January 22, 1957, this Court held that the term
"physical injuries" used in article 33 of the Civil Code includes
homicide,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
it is to be borne in mind that the charge against <span class="SpellE">Felardo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Paje</span> was for reckless imprudence resulting in
homicide, and not for homicide and physical injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="">the
case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Buan</span>, G.R. No. </span>L-25366, <span style="">March </span>29,1968, Mr. Justice J.B.L.
Reyes, speaking for the Supreme Court, said that the "offense of criminal
negligence under article 365 of the Revised Penal Code lies in the execution of
an im­prudent or negligent act that, if intentionally done, would be punishable
as a felony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law penalizes thus the
negli­gent or careless act, not the result thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The gravity of the consequence is only taken
into account to determine the penalty; it does not qualify the substance of the
offense." It is, therefore, clear that the charge against <span class="SpellE">Felardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Paje</span> was not for homicide
but for reckless imprudence, that is, criminal negligence resulting in homicide
(death of <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> Marcia) and double physical
injuries suffered by two other persons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As reckless imprudence or criminal negligence is not one of the three
crimes mentioned in Article 33 of the Civil Code, there is no independent civil
action for damages that may be instituted in connection with said offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, homicide through reckless imprudence
or criminal negligence comes under the general rule that the acquittal of the
defendant in the criminal action is a bar to his civil liability based upon the
same criminal act notwithstanding that the injured party re­served<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
his right to institute a separate civil action (<span class="SpellE">Chan<span style="">tangco</span></span><span style=""> vs. <span class="SpellE">Abaroa</span>, </span><u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">In the language of the Rules of </span><span style="">Court (Rule 111, Sec. </span>3), <span style="">the extinction of the criminal action by
acquittal of the defendant on the ground that the criminal act charged against
him did not exist, necessarily extinguished also the civil action for damages
based upon the same act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming, <span class="SpellE">arguendo</span>, that the civil action for damages for the death
of <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> Marcia was based upon a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
the trial court's finding that on that basis the action had prescribed is
correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An action upon a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> must be instituted within four <span style="">(4) </span>years (Article 1146, Civil
Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four-year prescriptive period
began to run from the day the quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> was
committed, or from <st1:date year="1956" day="23" month="12">December 23, <span style="">1956</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">and the running of the said period was not interrupted </span>by the
institution of the criminal action for reckless imprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Paulan</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>, G.R. No. L-10542, July 31, <span style="">1958.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

This and the following footnotes express <u><span style="">my</span></u><span style=""> </span>opinion on
certain controversial articles of the New Civil Code, which was drafted when I
was a member of the Code Commission.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;">(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The holding in the case of <span class="SpellE">Dyogi</span>,
et al. <i>vs.</i> <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>, etc., et al., <u>supra</u>,
that the term "physical injuries" used in Article 33 of the Civil
Code includes homicide or murder, is contrary to the letter and spirit of the
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I recall that when the draft of
what is now Article <span style="">33 </span>of the
New Civil Code was presented for deliberation by Code Commission Chairman Dean
Jorge C. <span class="SpellE">Bocobo</span>, a great civilian, before the Code
Commission (then composed of, besides Chairman <span class="SpellE">Bocobo</span>,
Professor Guillermo B. <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, Dean Pedro Y. <span class="SpellE">Ylagan</span>, and Dean Francisco R. Capistrano, members), said
Chairman made, in substance, the following remarks:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In America the injured party in crime has the
initiative, through his lawyer he immediately files a civil action for damages
against the offender.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the Philippines
the offended party depends upon the fiscal to demand in the criminal action the
damages he has suffered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think it is
about time to educate our people the American way by giving the injured party
in crime the initiative to go to court through his lawyer to demand damages,
and for this purpose we should give him an independent civil action for
damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let us begin with just three
crimes which are of common occurrence, namely, defamation, fraud, and physical
injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Depending upon the success of
the experiment, when the new Civil Code may come up for revision about fifty
(50) or one hundred (100) years from now, it will be up to our successors in
the Code Commission to add more crimes to the three already mentioned or make
the provision comprise all crimes causing damages to the injured party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This civil action, as in <st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
should proceed independently of the criminal action and should be proved only
by preponderance <span style="">of </span>evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defamation may be oral or written.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fraud comprises all forms of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Physical
injuries is to be understood in its ordinary meaning and does not include homicide
or murder because where physical injuries result in homicide or murder, the
reason for the law (namely, to give the injured party personally the initiative
to demand damages by an independent civil action) ceases, for the reason that a
dead person can no longer personally, through his lawyer, institute an
independent civil action for damages.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(All the members of the Code Commission agreed with the Chairman and the
draft of the article was unanimously approved.)</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 27pt;">In the Revised
Penal Code, the crime of homicide is treated in Title Eight (Crimes Against
Persons), Chapter One (Destruction of Life), while the crime of physical
injuries is separately treated in Chapter Two of the same title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This shows that the two crimes are distinct
from each other, that physical injuries is not included in homicide.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;">(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 32 (drafted by Code Commission
Chairman <span class="SpellE">Bocobo</span>) of the Civil Code is also intended,
insofar as it provides for an independent civil action, to educate the Filipino
the American way by going immediately to the courts to file a civil action for
damages in vindication of his constitutional rights and liberties enumerated in
the article in case of vio­lation of any of them.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;">(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 34 of the Civil Code, insofar as it
authorizes the institution of an independent civil action, is also intended for
the same purpose.</p>





<p class="FOOTNOTES"><a style="" href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crime of reckless imprudence
resulting in the death of <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> Marcia and
physical injuries to two other persons not being one of the three crimes
mentioned in Article 33 of the Civil Code which authorizes the institution of
an independent civil action for damages, the heirs of the deceased correctly
reserved their right to institute a separate civil action for damages against
the bus driver, <span class="SpellE">Felardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Paje</span>,
who stood charged with the crime of homicide and double physical injuries
through reckless imprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reservation
was in accordance with what is now Rule 111, Section 1, of the Rules of Court,
which provides:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 27pt;"><span style="">"<u>Institution of criminal and </u></span><u>civil actions</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- When a criminal action is instituted, the
civil action for recovery of <span style="">a civil
liability arising from the offense charged is impliedly instituted with the
criminal action, unless the offended party expressly waives the civil action or
reserves his right to institute it separately."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 27pt;">The civil
action for damages against <span class="SpellE">Felardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Paje</span> was prematurely instituted in view of Rule 111,
Section <span style="">3, </span>which, in part,
provides:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 27pt;">"Criminal and civil actions
arising from the same offense may be instituted separately, but after the criminal
action has been commenced the civil action can not be instituted until final
judgment has been rendered in the criminal action."</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 0in;">At any rate, said
civil action was correctly suspended in the Court of First Instance until final
judgment by the Court of Appeals in the criminal action was rendered pursuant
to Section of said Rule 111 which provides that:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 27pt;">"After a criminal action has
been commenced, no civil action arising from the same offense can be
prosecuted, and the same shall be suspended, in whatever stage it may be found,
until final judgment in the criminal proceeding has been rendered."</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 0in;">The decision of
the Court of Appeals acquitting the appellant <span class="SpellE">Felardo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Paje</span> of the crime of reckless imprudence charged
against him on the ground that it did not exist, extinguished the civil action
for damages filed against him, in accordance with Section 3(c) of Rule 111
which states that:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 27pt;">"Extinction of the penal
action does not carry with it ex­tinction of the civil, unless the extinction
proceeds from a declaration in a final judgment that the fact from which the
civil might arise did not exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* *
*."</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 0in;">This rule finds
support in the celebrated case of <span class="SpellE">Chantangco</span> <i>vs</i>.
<span class="SpellE">Abaroa</span>, <i><u><span style="">supra</span></u></i><span style="">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;">(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 2 of Rule 111 which provides:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 27pt;"><span style="">"<u>Independent civil action</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- </span>In the cases provided for in Articles 31, 32, <span style="">33, </span>34 and 2177 of the Civil Code of
the Philippines, an independent civil action entirely separate and distinct
from the criminal action, may be brought by the injured party during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the criminal case, provided the right is
reserved as required in the preceding section.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such civil action shall proceed independently of the criminal
prosecution, and shall require only a preponderance of evidence."</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 0in;">is defective and
imperfect in many ways:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 27pt;"><u>First</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 31 of the Civil Code does not provide
for an independent civil action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An
independent civil action is an action that is based upon the same criminal act
as in the case of Articles 32, 33 and 34.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the civil action is based on an obligation not arising from the act
or omission complained of as a felony, such civil action being based upon an
obligation not arising from the criminal act but from a different source, is
not an independent civil <span style="">action </span>within
the meaning of Articles 32, 33 and 34.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Article 31 (drafted by Code Commissioner Capistrano) which provides
that:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">"When the civil action is
based on an obligation not arising from the act or omission complained of as a
felony, such civil action may proceed independently of the criminal proceedings
and regardless of the result of the latter."</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 0in;">states a
self-explanatory rule different and distinct from that laid down in Articles
32, 33 and 34.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>A</u> is prosecuted for the crime of
reckless imprudence resulting in homi­cide.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The heirs of the deceased institute a civil action for damages against
him based upon quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>, under Article 2177 of
the Civil Code, which is separate and distinct from criminal negligence
punished as a crime or <span class="SpellE">delict</span> under the Revised Penal
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>
is <u><span style="">culpa <span class="SpellE">aquiliana</span></span></u><span style=""> </span>and is separate and distinct from
criminal negligence, which is a <span class="SpellE">delict</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dis­tinction is made in Article 2177
itself which in part provides that:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 27pt;">"Responsibility for fault or
negligence under the pre­ceding article is entirely separate and distinct from
the civil liability arising from negligence under the Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the plaintiff cannot recover damages
twice for the same act or omission of the defendant."</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 0in;">Code Commission
Chairman <span class="SpellE">Bocobo</span>, who drafted Article 2177 of the New
Civil Code, took the distinction from modern authori­ties in civil law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the report of the Code Commission
on the Project of Civil Code makes reference to the sources of the distinction,
thus:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 27pt;">"The foregoing provision
though at first sight startling, is not so novel or extraordinary when we
consider the exact nature of criminal and civil negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The former is a violation of the criminal
law, while the latter is a distinct and independent negligence, which is the <span style="">'<u>culpa</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>aqui</u><u><span style="">liana</span></u></span></span>' or quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>, of ancient origin, having always had its own
foundation and individuality, separate from criminal negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such distinction between criminal negligence
and 'culpa extra-contractual' or <span style="">'<u>quasi-<span class="SpellE">delito</span></u>' </span>has been sustain­ed by decisions of the
Supreme Court of Spain and maintained <span style="">as
clear, sound, and perfectly tenable by Maura, an outstanding Spanish jurist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 27pt;">"Therefore,
under the proposed article 2177, acquittal from an accusation of criminal
negligence, whether on reasonable doubt or not, shall not be a bar to a
subsequent civil action, not for civil liability arising from criminal
negligence, but for damages due to a 'quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>'
or '<u>culpa <span class="SpellE">aquiliana</span></u>.' But said article <span style="">forestalls a double recovery."
(Capistrano, Civil Code of the Phi</span>lippines, With Comments and
Annotations, Vol. 4, p. 470.)</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 27pt;"><u>Second</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As above explained, Article 2177 of the Civil
Code does not provide for an independent civil action in crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The article precisely distinguishes quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> or civil negligence from criminal negligence
(reckless imprudence) and authorizes the institution of a civil action for
damages based upon quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> and not upon criminal
negligence, which is a <span class="SpellE">delict</span> and not a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
accordance with Article 31, the civil action for damages based upon quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> may proceed independently of the criminal proceeding
for criminal negligence and regardless of the result of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, even if the defendant is acquitted in
the criminal action of the charge of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide,
the civil action for damages for the death of the deceased based upon quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> may proceed to judgment.</p>

with reference to the correctly cited Articles 32, 33 and 34 of the Civil Code,
is contrary to the letter and spirit of the said articles, for these articles
were drafted for the purpose explained in footnote one and are intended to
constitute as exceptions to the general rule stated in what is now Section 1 of
Rule 111.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>proviso</u>, which is
procedural, may also be regarded as an unauthorized amendment of substantive
law, Articles 32, 33 and 34 of the Civil Code, which do not provide for the
reservation required in the <u>proviso</u>.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 27pt;">In view of all
the foregoing, Section 2 of Rule 111 should be amended so as to read as
follows:</p>

The prayer of the complaint in the civil action asked that the defendants, <span class="SpellE">Felardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Paje</span> and the Victory
Liner Transportation Co., Inc., be ordered to pay jointly and severally the
damages claimed by plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
prayer, considering the action as one upon a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>,
is not in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>, according to Article 2180 of the Civil Code, the
obligation to pay damages is demandable not only for one's own acts or
omissions, but also for those of persons for whom one is responsible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The article then, in part, continues:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The owners and managers of an
establishment or enterprise are likewise responsible for damages caused by
their employees in the service of the branches in which the latter are employed
or on the occasion of their functions." Hence, the bus driver, <span class="SpellE">Felardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Paje</span>, was responsible for
the quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>, he being, in the language of the
American law, a tort-<span class="SpellE">feasor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the bus operator, Victory Liner
Transportation Co., Inc., was liable for the quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>
of its bus driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This liability is not
<span class="SpellE">solidary</span> but primary, with right to full
reimbursement pursuant to Article 2181, which provides:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 27pt;">"Whoever pays for the
damages caused by his de­pendents or employees may recover from the latter what
he has paid or delivered in satisfaction of the claim."</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 0in;">The prayer of the
complaint, based upon a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>, against the bus
driver, <span class="SpellE">Felardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Paje</span>, and
the bus operator, Victory Liner Transportation Co., Inc., should have been that
the plaintiffs recover the damages claimed from either of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bus operator defendant Victory Liner
Transportation Co., Inc., could have filed a third-party complaint against the
defendant bus driver, pleading its right for reimbursement under Article 2181.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 27pt;">When is the bus
operator <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable with the bus driver?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 2184 of the Civil Code provides:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 27pt;">"In motor vehicle mishaps, the
owner is <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable with his driver, if the
former, who was in the vehicle, could have by the use of due dili­gence,
prevented the misfortune.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 27pt;">"If the owner was not in the
motor vehicle, the provisions of article 2180 are applicable."</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 0in;">This article
(drafted by Code Commission Chairman <span class="SpellE">Bocobo</span>) is
intended to cover only the owners of private motor vehicles for private
use.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not generally applicable to
motor vehicles for public use and convenience because the operator thereof,
usually a corporation, cannot in the very nature of things, be in the motor
vehicle at the time of the mishap.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, if the manager of the bus company was in the bus at the time of
the mishap, Article 2184 may be applied by analogy.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 27pt;"><span style="">In the case of De Leon Brokerage Co., Inc. <i>vs</i>.
Court of Appeals, et al., G.R. No. L-15247, February 28,1962, it was held that
in quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>, the bus operator is <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable with the bus driver in view of article
2194 of the Civil Code which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 27pt;"><span style="">“The responsibility of two or more persons who are liable for a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> is <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 0in;">This article
(drafted by Code Commissioner Capistrano) merely restates the basic rule in
American law that joint tort-<span class="SpellE">feasors</span> are jointly and
severally liable for the tort.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
case of a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> committed by bus driver, he
alone is the tort-<span class="SpellE">feasor</span>; the bus operator is not a
joint tort-<span class="SpellE">feasor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For this reason the liability of the bus operator is not governed by
Article 2194 but by Article 2180.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 27pt;">Joint tort-<span class="SpellE">feasor</span> in American law are the same as co-authors or
co-principals of a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> in the civil law, and
it is only to them that Article 2194 is applicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A bus operator is not a co-author or
co-principal of the tort committed by its bus driver; hence, it cannot be made <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable with the bus driver under Article 2180,
with right to full reimbursement under Article 2181.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 27pt;">To make the bus
operator <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable with the driver would
diminish its right to full reimbursement from the driver because in passive
solidarity, the <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> debtors share equally in the
obligation (Article 1208, Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, if the bus operator's liability were <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>,
in the event of full payment by it of the obligation, its right to reimbursement
from the bus driver would only be of one-half of the obligation because its
share of the <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> obligation would be
one-half.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would result in reducing
by one-half its right to full reimbursement under Article 2181.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 27pt;">The prayer for <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> liability in the complaint against the defendants <span class="SpellE">Felardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Paje</span> and the Victory
Liner Transportation Co., Inc., considering the complaint as based upon
criminal negligence, is likewise not in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In crime committed by an employee within the
scope of his duties, the employer's liability is subsidiary, not <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>, in accordance with Article 103 of the Revised
Penal Code which provides:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 27pt;">"ART. 103.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Subsidiary civil liability</u> <u>of other
persons</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The subsidiary liability
established in the next preceding article shall also apply to employers,
teachers, persons, and corporations engaged in any kind of industry for
felonies committed by their servants, pupils, workmen, ap­prentices, or
employees in the discharge of their duties."</p>
