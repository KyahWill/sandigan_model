<st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> leaving properties worth 
P600,000.00. She left a will written in Spanish which she executed at her 
residence in <st1:street><st1:address>No. 2 <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> 
St.</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span>, 
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city>. She 
affixed her signature at the bottom of the will and on the left margin of each 
and every page thereof in the presence of <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> G. Sanchez, and 
Modesto <span class="SpellE">Formilleza</span>, who in turn affixed their 
signatures below the attestation clause and on the left margin of each and every 
page of the will in the presence of the testatrix and of each other. Said will 
was acknowledged before Notary Public <span class="SpellE">Niceforo</span> S. 
<span class="SpellE">Agaton</span> by the testatrix her witnesses.</p>
<p>In said will the testatrix made the following preliminary statement: that she 
was possessed of the full use of her mental faculties; that she was free from 
illegal pressure or influence of any kind from the beneficiaries of the will and 
from any influence of fear or threat; that she freely and spontaneously executed 
said will and that she had neither ascendants nor descendants of any kind such 
that she could freely dispose of all her estate.</p>
<p>Among the many legacies and devises made in the will was one of P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to Rene A. <span class="SpellE">Teofico</span>, married 
to the testatrix's niece named Josefina <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span>. To 
said spouses the testatrix left the usufruct of her interest in the <span class="SpellE">Calvo</span> building, while the naked ownership thereof she left 
in equal parts to her grandchildren who are the legitimate children of said 
spouses. The testatrix also instituted Josefina <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span> as her sole and universal heir to all the remainder 
of her properties not otherwise disposed of in the will.</p>
<p>On <st1:date month="7" day="17" year="1955">July 17, 1955</st1:date>, Vicente 
B. <span class="SpellE">Teotico</span> filed a petition for the probate of the 
will before the Court of First Instance of Manila which was set for hearing on 
<st1:date month="9" day="3" year="1955">September 3, 1955</st1:date> after the 
requisite publication and service to all parties concerned.</p>
<p>Ana del Val Chan, claiming to be an adopted child of Francisca <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span>, a deceased sister of the testatrix, as well as an 
acknowledged natural child of Jose <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span>, a deceased 
brother of the same testatrix, filed on September 2, 1955 an opposition to the 
probate of the will alleging the following grounds: (1) said will was not 
executed as required by law; (2) the testatrix was physically and mentally 
incapable to execute the will at the time of its execution; and (3) the will was 
executed under duress, threat or influence of fear.</p>
<p>Vicente B. <span class="SpellE">Teotico</span> filed a motion to dismiss the 
opposition alleging that the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> had no legal 
personality to intervene. The probate court, after due hearing, allowed the 
<span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> to intervene as an adopted child of 
Francisca <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span>, and on June 17, 1959, the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> amended her opposition by alleging the additional 
ground that the will is inoperative as to the share of Dr. Rene <span class="SpellE">Teotico</span> because the latter was the physician who took care 
of the testatrix during her last illness.</p>
<p>After the parties had presented their evidence, the probate court rendered 
its decision on <st1:date month="11" day="10" year="1960">November 10, 
1960</st1:date> admitting the will to probate but declaring the disposition made 
in favor of Dr. Rene <span class="SpellE">Teofico</span> void with the statement 
that the portion to be vacated by the annulment should pass to the testatrix's 
heirs by way of intestate succession.</p>
<p>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Teofico</span>, together with the universal 
heir <span class="SpellE">Josefin</span> a <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span>, 
filed a motion for reconsideration, of that part of the decision which declares 
the portion of the estate to be vacated by the nullity of the legacy made to Dr. 
Rene <span class="SpellE">Teofico</span> as passing to the legal heirs, while the 
<span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> filed also a motion for reconsideration of 
the portion of the judgment which decrees the probate of the will. On his part, 
Dr. Rene <span class="SpellE">Teofico</span> requested leave to intervene and to 
file a motion for reconsideration with regard to that portion of the decision 
which nullified the legacy made in his favor.</p>
<p>The motions for reconsideration above adverted to having been denied, both 
petitioner and <span class="SpellE">Oppositor</span> appealed from the decision, 
the former from that portion which nullifies the legacy in favor of Dr. Rene 
<span class="SpellE">Teofico</span> and declares the vacated portion as subject of 
succession in favor of the legal heirs, and the latter from that portion which 
admits the will to probate. And in this instance both petitioner and <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> assign several errors which, stripped of 
non-essentials, may be boiled down to the following: (1) Has <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> Ana del Val Chan the right to intervene in this 
proceeding?; (2) Has the will in question been duly admitted to probate?; and 
(3) Did the probate court commit an error in passing on the intrinsic validity 
of the provisions of the will and in determining who should inherit the portion 
to be vacated by the nullification of the legacy made in favor of Dr. Rene <span class="SpellE">Teofico</span>?</p>
<p>These issues will be discussed separately.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1. It is a well-settled rule that in order that a person may 
be allowed to intervene in a probate proceeding he must have an interest in the 
estate, or in the will, or in the property to be affected by it either as 
executor or as a claimant of the estate (Ngo The <span class="SpellE">Hua</span> 
vs. Chung <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> <span class="SpellE">Hua</span>, et al., 
L-17091, September 30, 1963); and an interested party has been defined as one 
who would be benefited by the estate such as an heir or one who has a claim 
against the estate like a creditor (<u>Idem.</u>). On the other hand, in <span class="SpellE">Saguinsin</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Lindayag</span>, et al., 
L-17750, <st1:date month="12" day="17" year="1962">December 17, 1962</st1:date>, 
this Court said: </p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"According to Section 2, Rule 80 of the Rules of Court, a petition for 
letters of administration must be filed by an 'interested person<span class="GramE">. '</span>An interested party has been defined in this connection as 
one who would be benefited by the estate, such as an heir, or one who has a 
claim against the estate, such as a creditor (Intestate Estate of Julio <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> 40 O.G. 1171). And it is well settled in this 
jurisdiction that in civil actions as well as special proceedings, the Interest' 
required in order that a person may be a party thereto must be material and 
direct, and not merely indirect or contingent. <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Trillana</span> <span class="SpellE">vs</span> <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>, G. R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-3370, 
</span><st1:date month="8" day="22" year="1951"><span class="GramE">August 22, 
1951</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">; <span class="SpellE">Rapinosa</span> vs. 
<span class="SpellE">Barrion</span>, 70 Phil. 311)."</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The question now may be asked: Has <span class="SpellE">Oppositor</span> any 
interest in any of the provisions of the will, and, in the negative, would she 
acquire any right to the estate in the event that the will is denied 
probate?</p>
<p>Under the terms of the will, <span class="SpellE">Oppositor</span> has no right 
to intervene because she has no interest in the estate either as heir, executor, 
or administrator, nor does she have any claim to any property affected by the 
will, because it nowhere appears therein any provision designating her as heir, 
legatee or devisee of any portion of the estate. She has also no interest in the 
will either as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> or executrix. Neither 
has she any claim against any portion of the estate because she is not a 
co-owner thereof, and while she previously had an interest in the <span class="SpellE">Calvo</span> building located in <span class="SpellE">Escolta</span>, 
she had already disposed of it long before the execution of the will.</p>
<p>In the supposition that the will is denied probate, would the <span class="SpellE">Oppositor</span> acquire any interest in any portion of the estate 
left by the testatrix? She would acquire such right only if she <span class="GramE">were</span> a legal heir of the deceased, but she is not under our 
Civil Code. It is true that <span class="SpellE">Oppositor</span> claims to be an 
acknowledged natural child of Jose <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span>, a deceased 
brother of the deceased, and also an adopted daughter of Francisca <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span>, a deceased sister of the testatrix, but such claim 
cannot give her any comfort for, even if it be true, the law does not give her 
any right to succeed to the estate of the deceased sister of both Jose <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span> and Francisca <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span>. And 
this is so because being an illegitimate child she is prohibited by law from 
succeeding to the legitimate relatives of her natural father. Thus, Article 992 
of our Civil Code provides: "An illegitimate child has no right to inherit <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">intestato</span></u> from 
the legitimate children and relatives of his father or mother; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." And the philosophy behind 
this provision is well expressed in Grey vs. <span class="SpellE">Fabie</span>, 68 
Phil., 128, as follows:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>Between the natural child and the legitimate relatives of the father or 
mother who acknowledged it, the Code denies any right of succession. They cannot 
be called relatives and they have no right to inherit. Of course, there is a 
blood tie, but the law docs not recognize it. In this, article 943 is based upon 
the reality" of the facts and upon the presumptive will of the interested 
parties; the natural child is disgracefully looked down upon by the legitimate 
family; the legitimate family is, in turn, hated by the natural Child; the 
latter considers the privileged condition of the former and the resources of 
which it is thereby deprived; the former, in turn sees in the natural child 
nothing but the product of sin, a Palpable evidence of a blemish upon the 
family. Every relation is ordinarily broken in life; the law does not more them 
recognize this truth, by avoiding further grounds of resentment.' (7 
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Manresa</span></st1:place></st1:city>, 
3d ed., p. 110.)"</p></blockquote>
<p>The <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> cannot also derive comfort from the 
fact that she is an adopted child of Francisca <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span> 
because under our law the relationship established by adoption is limited solely 
to the adopter and the adopted does not extend to the relatives of the adopting 
parents or of the adopted child except only as expressly provided for by law. 
Hence, no relationship is created between the adopted and the collaterals of the 
adopting parents. As a consequence, the adopted is an heir of the adopter but 
not of the relatives of the adopter.</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"The relationship established by the adoption, however, is limited to the 
adopting parent, and does not extend to his other relatives, except as expressly 
provided by law. Thus, the adopted child cannot be considered as a relative of 
the ascendants and collaterals of the adopting parents, nor of the legitimate 
children which they may have after the adoption, except that the law imposes 
certain impediments to marriage by reason of adoption. Neither are the children 
of the adopted considered as descendants of the adopter. The relationship 
created is exclusively between the adopter and the adopted, and do not extend to 
the relatives of either." (<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Civil Code of 
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>, 
Vol. 1, p. (652)</p>
<p>"Relationship by adoption is <u>limited to adopter and adopted</u>, and does 
not extend to other members of the family of either; but the adopted is 
prohibited to marry the children of the adopter to avoid scandal." (An Outline 
of Philippines Civil law by Justice Jose B. L. Reyes and Ricardo C. <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>, Vol. 1, p. 313; <u>See also </u><span class="SpellE">Caguioa</span>, Comments and Cases on Civil law, 1955, Vol. 1, pp. 
312-313; <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, Civil Code of the Philippines, 1959 
ed., Vol. 1, p. 515)</p></blockquote>
<p>It thus appears that the <span class="SpellE">Oppositor</span> has no right to 
intervene either as testamentary or as legal heir in this probate proceeding 
contrary to the ruling of the court a quo.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2. The next question to be determined is whether the will 
Exhibit A was duly admitted to probate. <span class="SpellE">Oppositor</span> 
claims that the same should not have been admitted not only because it was not 
properly attested to but also because it was procured thru pressure and 
influence and the testatrix affixed her signature by mistake believing that it 
contained her true intent. </p>
<p>The claim that the will was not properly attested to is contradicted by the 
evidence of record. In this respect it is fit that we state briefly the 
declarations of the instrumental witnesses.</p>
<p><span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> testified 
that the testatrix was In perfect state of health at the time she executed the 
will for she carried her conversation with her intelligently; that the testatrix 
signed immediately above the attestation clause and on each and every page 
thereof at the left-hand margin in the presence of the three instrumental 
witnesses and the notary public; that it was the testatrix herself who asked her 
and the other witnesses to act as such; and that the testatrix was the first one 
to sign and later she gave the will to the witnesses who read and signed it.</p>
<p><span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> G. Sanchez also testified that she knew the 
testatrix since 1945; that it was the testatrix herself who asked her to be a 
witness to the will; that the testatrix was the first one to sign and she gave 
the will later to the witnesses to sign and afterwards she gave it to the notary 
public; that on the day of the execution of the will the testatrix was in the 
best of health.</p>
<p>Modesto <span class="SpellE">Formilleza</span> also testified that he was asked 
by the testatrix to be one of the witnesses to the will; that he read and 
understood the attestation clause before he signed the document, and that all 
the <span class="GramE">witnesses</span> spoke either in Spanish or in <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>. He finally said that the instrumental witnesses and 
the testatrix signed the will at the same time and place and identified their 
signatures.</p>
<p>This evidence which has not been successfully refuted proves conclusively 
that the will was, duly executed because it was signed by the testatrix and her 
instrumental witnesses and the notary public in the manner provided for by 
law.</p>
<p>The claim that the will was procured by improper pressure and influence is 
also belied by the evidence. On this Point the court <u>a quo</u> made the 
following observation:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"The circumstance that the testatrix was then living under the same roof with 
Dr. Rene <span class="SpellE">Teofico</span> is no proof adequate in law to 
sustain the conclusion that there was improper pressure and undue influence. Nor 
is the alleged fact of isolation of the testatrix from the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> and her witnesses, for their supposed failure to 
see personally the testatrix, attributable to the vehemence of Dr. Rene <span class="SpellE">Teofico</span> to exclude visitors, took place years after the 
execution of the will on <st1:date month="5" day="17" year="1951">May 17, 
1951</st1:date>. Although those facts may have some weight to support the theory 
of the <span class="SpellE">Oppositor</span>, yet they must perforce yield to the 
weightier fact that nothing could have prevented the testatrix, had she really 
wanted to, from subsequently revoking her 1951 will if it did not in fact 
reflect and express her own testamentary dispositions. For, as testified to by 
the <span class="SpellE">Oppositor</span> and her witnesses, the testatrix was 
often seen at the <span class="SpellE">Escolta</span>, in <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span> and in Sta. Cruz, 
<st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, walking and accompanied by 
no one. In fact, on different occasions, each of them was able to talk with 
her."</p></blockquote>
<p>We have examined the evidence on the matter and we are fully in accord with 
the foregoing observation. Moreover, the mere claim that Josefina <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span> and her husband Rene <span class="SpellE">Teafico</span> had the opportunity to exert pressure on the 
testatrix simply because she lived in their house several years prior to the 
execution of the will and that she was old and suffering from hypertension in 
that she was virtually isolated from her friends for several years prior to her 
death is insufficient to disprove what the instrumental witnesses had testified 
that the testatrix freely and voluntarily and with full consciousness of the 
solemnity of the occasion executed the will under consideration. The exercise of 
improper pressure and undue influence must be supported by substantial evidence 
and must be of a kind that would overpower and subjugate the mind of the 
testatrix as to destroy her free agency and make her express the will of another 
rather than her own (<span class="SpellE">Coso</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Deza</span>, 42 Phil., 696). The burden is on the person 
challenging the will that such influence was exerted at the time of its 
execution, a matter which here was not done, for the evidence presented not only 
is sufficient but was disproved by the testimony of the instrumental 
witnesses.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">3. The question of whether the probate court could determine 
the intrinsic validity of the provisions of a will has been decided by this 
Court in a long line of decisions among which the following may be cited: </p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"Opposition to the intrinsic validity or legality of the provision of the 
will cannot be entertained in Probate proceeding because its only purpose is 
merely to determine if the will has been executed in accordance with the 
requirements of the law." (Palacios v. Palacios, 58 O.G., p. 220)</p>
<p>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The authentication 
of a will decides no other questions than such as touch upon the capacity of the 
testator and the compliance with those requisites or solemnities which the law 
prescribes for the validity of wills. It does not determine nor even by 
implication prejudge the validity or efficiency of the provisions; these may be 
impugned as being vicious or null, notwithstanding its authentication. The 
questions relating to these points remain entirely unaffected, and may be raised 
even after the will has been authenticated. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </p>
<p>"From the fact that the legalization of a will does not validate the 
provisions therein contained, it does not follow that such provisions lack of 
efficiency, or fail to produce the effects which the law recognizes when they 
are not impugned by anyone. In the matter of wills it is a fundamental doctrine 
that the will of the testator is the law governing the interested parties, and 
must be punctually complied with in so far as it is not contrary to the law or 
to public morals." (<span class="SpellE">Montefiano</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Suesa</span>, 14 Phil., pp. 676, 679-680)</p>
<p><span class="GramE">"To establish conclusively as against everyone, and once 
for all, the facts that a will was executed with the formalities required by law 
and that the testator was in a condition to make a will, is the only purpose of 
the proceedings under the new code for the probate of a will.</span> <span class="GramE">(Sec. 625.)</span> The judgment in such proceedings determines and 
can determine nothing more. In them the court has no power to pass upon the 
validity of any provisions made in the will. It can not decide, for example, 
that a certain legacy is void and another one valid." <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Alemany</span>, 3 Phil., 
426, 428)</p></blockquote>
<p>Pursuant to the foregoing precedents the pronouncement by the court <u>a 
quo</u> declaring invalid the legacy made Dr. Rene <span class="SpellE">Teofico</span> in the will Exhibit A must be set aside as having 
been made in excess of its jurisdiction. Another reason why said pronouncement 
should be set aside is that the legatee was not given an opportunity to defend 
the validity of the legacy for he was not allowed to intervene in this 
proceeding. As a corollary, the other pronouncements, touching on the 
disposition of the estate in favor of some relatives of the deceased should also 
be set aside for the same reason.</p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, with the exception of that portion of the decision which 
declares that the will in question has been duly executed and admitted the same 
to probate, the rest of the decision is hereby set aside. This case is ordered 
remanded to the court <u>a quo</u> for further proceedings. No pronouncement as 
to costs.</p>
