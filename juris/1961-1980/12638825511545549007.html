<p class="BODY">The decision sought to be reversed speaks for itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the question of the failure to bargain
collectively, it was stated: "It appears that during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of Case No. 744-MC, the complainant union [private
respondent Manila Bay Watchmen Association] sent <span style="">to, </span>and received by, the Company on May 7, 1950, a letter * * *
containing 11 sets of labor proposals for collective bargaining.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Company refused to act upon the union
proposals, as testified to by <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span> M. Padilla,
shipping manager of the company, <span class="SpellE">viz</span>: 'Q - Did you,
as shipping manager, did you make a reply to this demand filed by the Manila
Bay Watchmen Association?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A - <u>No, I </u><u><span style="">did not.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As recommended by our president, Mr. Bradley, I did not make any written
reply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If my memory serves me right, I
did not make any written reply.' <span class="GramE">* * <span style="">*</span><span style="text-decoration: none;"> (Underlining supplied).</span></span></span></u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records <span style="">also </span>show that following the
certification of the union by this Court on November 18, 1960 as the sole
bargaining agent, as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, it again sent a
letter * * * to, and duly received by, the company on December 29, 1960,
reiterating its labor demands of May 7, 1960 * * *, with the warning that the
company's failure to take appropriate and prompt action on the labor proposals
will force the union to take measures to protect its rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In spite of the fact that all the while the
company knows that the watchmen working on board its vessels are members of the
union * * *, and that said union has been certified by this Court as the sole
representative of all the watchmen or guards working in its vessels, the
company still stubbornly resisted and disregarded the union's request and
bargaining proposals. 'These demands being made by the Manila Bay Watchmen Association,
we disregarded the request and demands.' <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
p. 39, F. M. Padilla, <u><span style="">ibid</span></u><span style="">.)</span></span><span style=""> </span>It could, therefore, be concluded under the foregoing
established facts that there is clear and evident refusal to bargain
collectively on the part of the management of respondent company."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
As to the reinstatement ordered by the respondent Court, there is this excerpt
from the appealed decision: "The evidence discloses that the company's
vessel '<span class="SpellE">Eurymedon</span>' was in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place> on <st1:date year="1961" day="2" month="1">January 2, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the morning of that day, the members of the complainant reported for
work but were stopped from boarding the said ship by the manager of the
company, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span>, <span style="">telling </span>them that 'you have a case in Court, so we have already
changed you with another watchmen, the Sea Watchmen Agency. * * It must be
stressed that the testimonies of witnesses for the complainant to the effect
that the union members were not allowed by respondent's manager, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span>, to board the S/S <span class="SpellE">Eurymedon</span>
on January 2, 1961, and that since then have been refused employment because
they have filed a case in Court, was never refuted or denied by the
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact and other facts
and circumstances well established in the record clearly preponderate in favor <span style="">of the complainant's claim that the discharge
of the 59 subject-workers was due to union affiliation and activities of
requesting union recognition and for better terms and conditions of employment
and for bringing an action against the company before this Court."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts as found by
respondent Court cannot be any clearer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a well-settled doctrine that they are well-high conclusive on this
Tribunal except in the absence of a showing that they are not supported by
substantial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no such
showing in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both the petition
and the brief filed by petitioner's counsel, the then law office of <span class="SpellE">Ozaeta</span>, Gibes and <span class="SpellE">Ozaeta</span>, are
impressive for their scholarship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
cannot, in the light of what was found as established by respondent Court, </span><span style="">justify, </span><span style="">as noted at the outset, a reversal of the decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1. Under the Industrial Peace Act,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
it was <span class="GramE">an unfair labor practice</span> for an employer
"[t]<span style="">o</span> refuse to bargain
collectively with the representatives of his employees subject to the
provisions of sections thirteen and fourteen."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
When there is such a refusal to bargain collectively by an employer was
discussed at length in Herald Delivery Carriers Union v. Herald <span style="">Publications, Inc.:</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> "1<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The</span> Industrial Peace Act specifically
provides: 'In the absence of an agreement </span><span style="">or </span><span style="">other voluntary
arrangement providing for a more expeditious manner of collective bargaining,
it shall be the duty of an employer and the representative of his employees to
bargain collectively in accordance with the provisions of this Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such duty to bargain collectively means the
performance of the mutual obligation to meet and confer promptly and
expeditiously and in good faith, for the purpose of negotiating an agreement
with respect to wages, hours, and/or other terms and conditions of employment,
and of executing a written contract incorporating such agreement if requested
by either party, or for the purpose of adjusting any grievances or question
arising under such agreement, but such duty does not compel any party to agree
to a proposal or to make concession. * * * In the first case dealing with the
above statutory provision, <span class="SpellE">Buklod</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span>
<span class="SpellE">Saulog</span> Transit v. <span class="SpellE">Casalla</span>,
Justice Padilla for the Court made clear that the literal language of the above
section should be adhered to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is it </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">be lost sight of that implicit </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">BCI Employees and
Workers Union v.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">Mountain</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Province</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> Workers </span><st1:place><span class="GramE"><span style="">Union</span></span></st1:place><span class="GramE"><span style="">,</span></span><span style=""> is the <u>notion</u> </span>that the labor
organization designated as the collective bargaining representative <span style="">should </span>have a reasonable time within
which it could negotiate with the employer to conclude <span style="">a </span>collective, bargaining agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * It is worthy of note that this duty to
bargain in good faith was given added dimension in Republic Savings Bank v.
Court of Industrial Relations, where the then Justice, now Chief Justice,
Castro, as <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span> stated: 'For collective
bargaining does not end with the execution of an agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a continuous process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The duty to bargain imposes on the parties
during the term of their agreement the mutual obligation "to meet and
confer promptly and expeditiously and in good faith * * * for the purpose of
adjusting any grievances or question arising under such agreement" and a
violation of this obligation is, by section 4(a) (6) and (b) (13) an unfair
labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the same hospitable
scope to the statutory command should be apparent in American law should
occasion no surprise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The regime of
collective bargaining would be a wreck if it were otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Professor
Archibald Cox, one of the most eminent authorities in the field, did note that
even before the Wagner Act, the major source of our Industrial Peace Act, it
was the prevailing view that a true collective bargaining agreement 'involves
more than the holding of conferences and the exchange of pleasantries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * While the law does not compel the
parties to reach agreement, it does contemplate that both parties will approach
the negotiations with an open mind and </span><span style="">will </span><span style="">make a reasonable
effort to reach a common ground of agreement.' The same thought found
expression in a later decision, with its stress on 'the incontestably sound
principle' that the employer 'had a duty to negotiate in good faith with his
employees' representatives, to match their proposals, if unacceptable, with
counterproposals; and to make every reasonable effort to reach an agreement.'
The Wagner Act called for a more explicit declaration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * Professor </span><span style="">Cox </span><span style="">added: 'Although the law cannot open a man's mind, it can at least </span><span style="">compel </span><span style="">him to conduct himself as if he were trying to persuade </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">were willing to be persuaded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
offer the union a contract saying, "Take it or leave it," is not </span><span style="">bargaining </span><span style="">collectively within the meaning of the act.'"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In this particular decision, it was shown
that respondent employer, after it was served with written bargaining proposals
by petitioner union, acted unilaterally and </span><span style="">without notice to </span><span style="">the
latter on the question of whether or not the work performed by the delivery and
carrier workers should be assumed by the so-called independent
contractors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not even bother to
submit an answer or reply concerning the bargaining proposals submitted by
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, there was an
evasion of duty to bargain collectively through unfulfilled promises of
submitting an answer or counterproposal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was quite clear, as found by respondent Court, that it betrayed
indifference to its duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it is in
this controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A similar resolution
finding an unfair labor practice is thus indicated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2. Equally <span style="">so, </span>there
can be no valid objection to the reinstatement ordered in the decision under
review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Industrial Peace Act cannot
be any clearer: "If, after investigation, the Court shall be of the
opinion that any person named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in
any unfair labor practice, then the Court shall state its findings of fact and
shall issue and cause to be served on such person an order requiring such
person to cease and desist from such unfair labor practice and take such
affirmative action as will effectuate the policies of this Act, including (but
not limited to) reinstatement of employees with or without back-pay and
including rights of the employees prior to dismissal including seniority."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
As a matter of fact, the statute was quite categorical that the duty of
respondent Court to take affirmative action included but was not limited to the
"reinstatement of employees with or without <span class="SpellE">backpay</span>
* * *." Petitioner certainly cannot be heard to allege that in requiring
such reinstatement, there was an infringement both of the equal protection and <span class="SpellE">nonimpairment</span> guarantees of the <span style="">Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The futility of
the equal protection plea is quite apparent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With the Constitution specifically committed to protection to labor, the
more general </span><span style="">provision </span><span style="">on equal protection certainly does not call
for application</span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Moreover,
the very philosophy of the 1935 Constitution, stressed even </span><span style="">more in the </span><span style="">present fundamental </span><span style="">law,
</span><span style="">calls for state solicitude and
concern </span><span style="">for </span><span style="">the lower-income groups in our society.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> With such explicit declaration, reliance on
the general provision on equal protection is certainly misplaced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is equally futile to rely on the
prohibition against any law impairing the obligation of contracts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a finding of an unfair labor practice,
respondent had no choice except to assure the continuance in their work of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">employees in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it was
provided by the Industrial Peace Act.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is a </span><span style="">valid </span><span style="">police power measure enacted pursuant to the
constitutional mandates of social justice and protection to labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine that the <span class="SpellE">nonimpairment</span>
clause yields to the police power has an impress of orthodoxy.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It would be much too late in the day to
