<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In Criminal Case No. 285-A filed 
with the Municipal Court of the city of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Davao</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> against Francisco <span class="SpellE">Nu√±ez</span> and others, for Robbery with Rape, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span> <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> was arrested by 
virtue of a warrant of arrest issued by said court. After proper proceedings, 
said court, forwarded the case to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Where it was docketed as Criminal Case No. 7155. Prior 
to the filing of the information in the latter court, petitioner filed a motion 
for bail, but the same was denied by the respondent judge on the ground that it 
was filed prematurely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">A second motion for bail was 
filed subsequently by Petitioner, and after a hearing held thereon, the 
respondent Judge issued a verbal order on </span><st1:date month="11" day="24" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 24, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
granting the motion and fixing the bail bond in the sum of P40.000.00. In the 
afternoon of the same date, however, the fiscal moved for a reconsideration of 
the order, claiming that he had just received sufficient evidence to prove the 
guilt of petitioner. The Court stayed the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> 
of the order granting bail and, after a hearing on the motion for 
reconsideration, the order was finally set aside and another was issued denying 
the motion for bail. Petitioner's motion for reconsideration of this last order 
having been denied, he filed the present special civil action of certiorari, 
claiming that, in denying his motion for bail, the respondent judge committed a 
grave abuse of discretion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the order of the respondent 
judge complained of, His Honor states the following: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The hearing of an application 
for bail is summary in nature. On such hearing, the Court 'does not seek to try 
the merits or to enter into any nice inquiry as to the weight that would be 
allowed to the evidence for or against the accused, nor will it speculate on the 
outcome of the trial or on what further evidence may be therein offered and 
admitted. <span class="GramE">(8 C. J. S., 93, 94).'</span> <span class="GramE">(Padilla, Criminal Procedure 1955 ed. p. 270 citing <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> et al., 77 
Phil. 55).</span> It has also been held that 'to sustain a refusal of bail in a 
capital case it is enough that evidence induces the belief that the accused have 
committed the offense.' <span class="GramE">(Ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> 
Page, 255, p. 887, 82, Cal. App. 576).</span> According to the law as 
interpreted by the courts like the case cited above it appears that in an 
application for bail the Court does not go into the merits of the case. 
Therefore, inconsistency or contradiction in the testimony of a witness for the 
prosecution is not sufficient in itself to entitle the accused to bail. It is 
enough, for the denial of bail, that the proof of guilt is evident or the 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">presumption great</span></em>. It is 
sufficient that the evidence presented by the prosecution induces the belief 
that the accused had committed the offense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Guided by the above ruling the 
Court is of the opinion that the accused shall be denied bail. He is accused of 
a capital offense. The evidence presented during the hearing of the petition for 
bail, without passing upon the merits of the evidence, shows that the accused 
<span class="SpellE">Pepito</span> <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> has 
participated in the commission of the offense of which he is charged with other 
persons. The least that can be said about the evidence on record, without 
passing on the merits, is that the proof of guilt of the accused is 
presumptively strong."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is petitioner's contention 
that, while under the Constitution and the Rules of Court, a person charged with 
a capital offense may be denied bail, before conviction, only if the evidence of 
guilt against him is strong, the respondent judge denied him bail only on the 
strength of a strong <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">presumption</span></em> of guilt, thereby 
committing a grave abuse of discretion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner's contention is 
without merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">A reading of the order complained 
of clearly shows that, in the opinion of the respondent judge, the evidence 
presented during the summary hearing on the motion for bail showed "that the 
accused <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span> <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> has 
participated in the commission of the offense of which he is charged with other 
person". Casting aside unnecessary pronouncements made in the order complained 
of, we believe that what the respondent judge really found and held was that the 
evidence of guilt presented against petitioner was strong and justified denial 
of his motion for bail. At this stage of the proceeding, there is nothing before 
<span class="GramE">Us</span> sufficient to justify the conclusion that His Honor 
erred or abused his discretion in so holding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">PREMISES 
CONSIDERED</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
the petition under consideration is dismissed and the writ prayed for denied, 
with costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
