				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">An appeal from an Order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City acting as a Court of Land Registration on a
petition filed under Section 112 of the Land Registration Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span>
Vicente originally filed his petition in the Court <u><span style="">a </span>quo</u> alleging that he has one of the registered owners of
Lot No. 4098 of the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> Cadastre, evidenced by
Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-8883 of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City, which he and his co-owners had mortgaged on
July 14, 1959 to the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City Rural Bank for
the amount of P2,000.00; that for non­payment of the mortgage debt, the said
mortgage had been foreclosed and the land was sold at public auction by the
City Sheriff on September 15, 1960 to <span class="SpellE">Oppositor</span>-Appellant
Benito de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos as the highest bidder, and in
whose favor the City Sheriff issued a Certificate of Sale which was duly
annotated on said Transfer Certificate of Title No. 8883; that on <span style="">September 5, 1961 and within the redemption
period, he tendered the redemption price and interest to de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Santos, who refused to accept the same, and consequently, he depo­sited the
redemption amount and interest in the total sum of </span><span style="">P3,</span><span style="">360.00 with the City Sheriff, who issued a Certificate of Redemption
which was likewise duly annotated on the said Certificate of Title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Vicente, therefore, asked the
Court <u>a quo</u> to issue an order to the Register of <span style="">Deeds </span>of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City to cancel
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 8883 and in lieu thereof to issue a new
Transfer Certi­ficate of Title in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His petition dated October 28, 1961 carried a notice to Messrs. <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> Vicente, <span class="SpellE">Abun­dia</span>
Vicente, <span class="SpellE">Salvina</span> Vicente, <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span>
Vicente, Rodrigo Vicente, <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> Ventura and <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span> Ventura, purportedly his co-owners of the land,
and to the City Register of Deeds that he would present the petition for the
Court's approval on the following Saturday, November 4, 1961; and below said
notice, said co-owners affixed their thumb marks, with the exception of Rodrigo
Vicente and <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span> Ventura, who affixed their signatures,
manifesting that they "have no objection to the granting of the
petition."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Oppositor</span> De <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Santos, apparently having learned of Vicente's petition although he was not
served with notice thereof; timely filed his Opposition thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He alleged that after his purchase of the
land in question as the highest bidder at the public auction sale, Vicente's
co-owners had for consideration transferred to him their redemption rights for
the repurchase of the land and that Vicente could therefore redeem only his own
share therein, to the exclusion of the shares of his co-owners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More importantly, De <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Santos questioned the jurisdiction of the Court <u>a quo</u>, acting as a Court
of Land Registration to take cognizance of Vicente's petition, citing
jurisprudence of this Court that the remedy provided in Section 112 of Act 496
is summary and not ade­quate for the litigation of issues pertaining to an
ordinary civil action, and that controversial issues properly pertain to the
general jurisdiction of the Court in ordinary civil actions and should not be
brought to them as Courts of Land Registration with the limited and special
jurisdiction charac­teristic of such Courts.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition, after several postponements, was submit­ted to the
Court <u>a quo</u><i> </i>on January 13, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to its Clerk of Court's letter of transmittal of the records
to this Court, "there is no exhibit presented by both parties <span style="">in this
case."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The Court <u>a quo</u>
thereafter issued its <span style="">disputed Order </span>of
February 22, 1962, wherein after a mere recital of the fact of the filing of
the petition and the opposition thereto, he ruled that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"After a careful consideration of the petition and the
opposition thereto, the Court believes that the petition is <span style="">proper and in order and the opposition is not
well founded."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and granted the petition for the
cancellation of Transfer Cer­tificate of Title No. 8883 and the issuance of a
new certificate of title in favor of petitioner Vicente, by the City Register
of <span style="">Deeds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On Appeal, <span class="SpellE">Oppositor</span> De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos has
raised anew the issue of lack </span>of jurisdiction of the Court <u>a quo</u>
to render its <span style="">disputed </span>Order,
without reception of evidence, notwithstand­ing the serious controversial
issues raised in his Opposition, which took the case out of the scope of
Section 112 of the Land Registration Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal must be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">As far back as 1933, this Court has consistently held that
controversial issues, such as the question of cancellation of annotation of a
second mortgage, which necessarily involves the question of validity of such
mortgage, can be adjudicated by the Court of First Instance only in an ordinary
action, and not under the summary proceedings provided in Section 112 of the
Land Registration Act for <span style="">erasure, </span>alteration
or amendment of a certificate of title, entry of a new certificate or entry or
cancellation of a memorandum upon a certificate.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Time and again, this Court under reiterated the well settled doctrine that
summary relief under Section 112 of the Land Registration Act "can only be
granted if there is unanimity among the par­ties, or there is no adverse claim
or serious objection on the part of any party in interest; otherwise, the case
becomes controversial and should be threshed out in an ordinary case or in the
case where the incident properly belongs."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Enriquez v. <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court again pointed out that "(T)he proceedings under (Sec. 112 of
the Land Regis­tration Act) have been aptly described as summary in nature, and
are allowed when a scrutiny of the allegations discloses that the issues
presented by the pleadings need not be tried because they are so patently
unsubstantial as not to be ge­nuine issues." This Court, reviewing all its
decisions deal<span style="">ing with the application
of said Section 112, went on to state clearly that "by 'unanimity among
the parties' is meant the absence of serious controversy between the parties </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">inter­est as to the title of the party seeking relief u</span><span style="">nder </span><span style="">said sec­tion."
A long line of cases was again cited by this Court in its latest decision in
1968, where it again explained that it is in cases when there is no
disagreement as to the facts alleged in the pleadings, such as to rule out the
existence of a </span><u><span style="">personal action</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">between
the parties, that the petition may be considered a mere incidental matter in
the land regis­tration case, which is an </span><u><span style="">in <span class="SpellE">rem</span></span></u><span style=""> action operating directly on the land, and
may be validly acted upon by the Land Registration Court.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the pleadings readily show the exis­tence of
a <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> of facts and issues between
petitioner and <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner alleged that he had validly
redeemed the land subject of the public action sale with no objection on the
part of his co-owners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Oppositor</span> disputed petitioner's claim, alleging in turn
that petitioner's co-owners had for consideration transferred their redemption
rights in his (<span class="SpellE">oppositor's</span>) favor, and that
petitioner could only redeem his own share of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both petitioner's Certificate of Redemption
as well as the <span class="SpellE">O<span style="">pposi</span>tor's</span>
Certificate of Sale, as issued by the City Sheriff, were annotated on the
Certificate of Title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of the
pertinent doc­uments supporting the conflicting claims of the parties was submitted,
for as earlier stated, the parties did not present any evidence at all, and the
records support <span class="SpellE">oppositor's</span> statement in his brief
(pages 3 and 9) that the Court <u><span style="">a quo</span></u><span style=""> </span>received no evidence whatever.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The Court <u>a quo</u>, without any finding of fact or statement of the law,
merely issued a summary <u><span style="">pro-forma</span></u>
Order, expressing his belief in the propriety of the petition and granting the
same.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the Court <u><span style="">a
quo</span></u><span style=""> </span>erred in so doing
and that it did not have jurisdiction in the summary proceedings under Section
112 of the Land Registration Act to order the cancel­lation of Transfer
Certificate of Title No. T-8883 and the issuance of a new certificate of title
in favor of petitioner <span style="">as </span>against
the adverse claim of <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Parties litigants and
their counsels should bear in </span>mind that while the <span style="">summary </span>proceeding under Section 112
of the Land Registration Act where the Court is vested with limited and special
jurisdiction as a land registration court, is certainly more expeditious in
appropriate <span style="">non-controver­sial </span>matters
than an ordinary civil action, to insist on such summary procedures when there
exists a genuine contro­versy between the parties would be productive of the
opposite result, as shown in this case and other numerous similar cases heretofore
decided by this Court; it would ultimately be to their advantage and benefit to
ventilate controversial issues and personal actions in the proper courts of <span style="">general </span>jurisdiction, where proofs may
<span style="">be duly adduced at a regular trial and
damages and attorney's</span> fees<span style=""> </span>may
be awarded, where warranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, while
there may be merit in petitioner's<span style=""> assertion of his right as a co-owner to redeem the
property in its totality, and not merely his original share therein, the Court <u>a
quo</u> lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the contro­versy between him and <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> in the summary proceeding under Section 112 of
the Land Registration Act, as timely and correctly raised by <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>, and this Court, in the absence of any facts or
evidence </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the record, likewise lacks jurisdiction in this instance to put an end
to the con­troversy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the Order appealed from is set aside, without costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
