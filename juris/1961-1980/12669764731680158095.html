<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On March 2, 1959, the respondent 
Western Pacific Corporation, was assessed for P3<span class="GramE">,731.00</span>, as deficiency income tax for the year 1953. This 
assessment was brought about by the disallowance of P8<span class="GramE">,265.82</span>, listed in respondent's return for 1953, as expense 
items, and P10,387.50, as written off "bad debts." The assessment was received 
by respondent on the same date (</span><st1:date month="3" day="2" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 2, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">). On 
March 5, 1959, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue wrote the respondent 
corporation a letter of demand for the payment of the amount, including therein 
a breakdown of said assessment. Under date of June 29, 1959, respondent 
corporation, thru <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Melo</span> &amp; Company, Consulting and Examining Auditors, 
requested for non-assessment, claiming" that there has been prescription in 
making the assessment, that the expense items and bad debts were allowable 
deductions. The letter was accompanied by a Resolution of the corporation, dated 
February 2, 1954, where it was resolved to write off the debts of the people 
appearing in another annex. The Commissioner on </span><st1:date month="7" day="30" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 
30, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
replied to the request, denying the same, and demanding the payment of the 
amount due within thirty (30) days from receipt of said demand. On 
</span><st1:date month="9" day="19" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 19, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
<span class="GramE">respondent corporation</span> requested that it be permitted 
until </span><st1:date month="9" day="25" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 25, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, to 
submit formal objections to the assessment. The formal objections appearing in 
the letter of September 22, 1959, were identical to those of the June 29, 1959 
communication, reason for 'which the Commissioner did not give any favorable 
action. The last letter of the Commissioner, dated October 28, 1959, among 
others, requested payment of the assessment within ten (10) days from receipt 
thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On December 18, 1959, respondent 
Western Pacific Corporation, presented with the Court of Tax Appeals a petition 
for Review the assessment made by the Commissioner, on three (3) counts, to 
wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(1) <span class="GramE">whether</span> or not the making of the assessment had 
prescribed;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(2) <span class="GramE">whether</span> expenses incurred in securing ICC Licenses are 
capital expenditures, and, as such, not deductible from the income; 
and<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(3) <span class="GramE">whether</span> the bad debts written off should likewise be 
deducted.<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">When the issues 
were joined, by the filing of the Answer, end after hearing, the CTA rendered 
judgment absolving the Western Pacific Corporation from the 
assessment.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
It, however, ruled out prescription, stating that March 2, 1959, was the last 
day of the five (5) year period within which to make the assessment. On this 
point, the CTA ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"However, we do not agree with 
petitioner that the assessment Â«n question was issued beyond the 5-year 
statutory limitation. February 28, 1959 fell on a Saturday. Pursuant to Republic 
Act No. 1880, as implemented by Executive Order No. 25, effective July 1, 1959, 
all bureaus and offices of the government, except schools, courts, hospitals and 
health clinics, hold office only five days a week or from Monday to Friday. 
Saturday and Sunday are constituted public holidays or days of exemption from 
labor or work as far as government offices, including that of respondent 
Commissioner, are concerned. The offices and bureaus concerned are officially 
closed on those days. So that on February 28, 1959, which <span class="GramE">were</span> Saturday and Sunday, respectively, the office of 
respondent was officially closed. And where the last day for doing an act 
required by law falls on a holiday, the act may be done on the next succeeding 
business day. (Section 31, Revised Administrative Code.) Similarly, in computing 
any period of time prescribed by statute, the day of the act after which the 
designated period of time begins to run is not included. But the last day of the 
period so computed is to be included, unless it is a Sunday or a legal holiday, 
in which event the time shall run until the end of the next day which is neither 
a Sunday or a holiday (Section 1, Rule 28, Rules of Court). Consequently, since 
February 28, 1959 was a Saturday and the next day, March 1, 1959, a Sunday, 
respondent had until the next succeeding business day, March 2, 1959, Monday, 
within which to issue the deficiency assessment. The assessment in question 
having been issued on March 2, 1959, it was, therefore, seasonably 
made."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We concur in the above findings 
and conclusions, convinced as we <span class="GramE">are,</span> that they are 
factually and legally correct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The above ruling notwithstanding, 
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, appealed against the judgment which 
absolved respondent Western Pacific Corporation from liability, alleging that 
the CTA erred:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(1) In taking cognizance of the 
case, notwithstanding lack of jurisdiction; and<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(2) Granting it had jurisdiction, 
in considering the expense items and the written off bad debts, as 
deductible.<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Without going into the merits of 
the decision absolving the respondent corporation of tax liability, <span class="GramE">We</span> find that the assessment made by the Commissioner should 
be maintained, for the simple reason that when the petition for review was 
brought to the CTA by the respondent corporation, the said Court no longer had 
jurisdiction to entertain the same. The assessment had long become final. A 
petition for review should be presented, within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, as provided for in Section 11, Republic 
Act No. 1125, which is "thirty (30) days from receipt of the assessment." The 
thirty (30) day period is jurisdictional (<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> 
Transportation Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Blaquera</span>, 107 Phil., 
975).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It will be noted that the 
assessment was received by the respondent corporation on March 2, 1959. It was 
only on June 29, 1959, when said corporation formally assailed the assessment, 
on the grounds of prescription in making the assessment and the impropriety of 
the disallowance of the listed deductions. From March 3 to June 29, 1959, 
manifestly more than thirty (30) days had lapsed and the assessment became 
final, <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and demandable (<span class="SpellE">Entanilla</span> vs. Bd. of Tax Appeals, et al., L-7384, Dec. 
19,1955). Of course, in the interim, a number of communications were exchanged 
between the parties, the latest of which was dated </span><st1:date month="10" day="28" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 28, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
Even if this date is considered PS the commencement of the thirty (30) day 
period, still the petition for review with the CTA was out of time, because it 
was only on December 18, 1959, that said petition was presented. Failure to 
comply with the thirty day statutory <span class="GramE">period,</span> would bar 
appeal and deprive the CTA of its jurisdiction to entertain and determine the 
correctness of the assessment (Gibbs &amp; Gibbs vs. Coll. of Int. Rev. &amp; 
CTA, 107 Phil., 232).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In view of the foregoing, the 
decision of the CTA is hereby set aside for having been rendered without 
jurisdiction, the assessment in question having been already final, <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and demandable before the petition for Review was 
presented; and another entered, ordering the respondent Western Pacific 
Corporation to pay the assessments made by the Collector of Internal Revenue, 
and the further amounts of 5% surcharge and 1% monthly interest on the amount 
assessed, from April 1, 1959 until date of full payment. <span class="GramE">Costs 
against the respondent corporation.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
