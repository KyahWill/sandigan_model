				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span>the <span style="">elections </span>of <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1967</st1:date> petitioner Jose Tuburan and <span style="">respondent </span>Frank Ballener were among
the seven candidates for the office of Mayor of the newly created <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>President <span style="">Roxas</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="">, </span>Cotabato.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first can­<span style="">vass </span><span style="">was </span>made on <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="12">December 13, 1967</st1:date> by the provincial board
sitting as municipal board of canvassers, and on the basis thereof Ballener was
proclaimed duly elected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tuburan,
through counsel, interposed an objection to the proclamation and asked that it
be suspended on the ground that the election return from precinct No. 18 of the
said municipality which was used <span style="">in </span>the
canvass was on its face tampered with and falsified, the falsification
consisting of <span style="">the super-imposition in
blue pencil of the name </span>of another candidate, Jose Riveral, <span style="">over the </span>name of <span style="">petitioner, thereby crediting t</span>o the
former the sixty-four (64) votes obtained by the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same manner petitioner's name was
super­imposed over that of Jose Riveral, making it appear that the former
received only two (2) votes, which <span style="">was
</span>the number apparently obtained by the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the tampering and falsification, if true, involved a
sufficient number of votes to affect the results of the election is not
disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sixty-four (64) votes, if
credited to petitioner, would make him the winner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The objection was, however, disregarded and Ballener was proclaimed,
for which reason petitioner dispatched <span style="">a
</span>telegram to the Commission on Elections on December 16, 1967, alleging
the foregoing facts, with a statement that a formal petition would follow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 21, 1967 the petition was
prepared, asking that the <span style="">canvass </span>and
proclamation of December 13 be annulled and that another canvass <span style="">be </span>made on the basis of <span style="">a </span>true and authentic copy of the
election return from precinct No. 18.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petition was hand-carried to Manila for filing by a messenger sent
by petitioner, but for some reason was not actually filed until the afternoon
of December 26.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, so
petitioner avers, he remained in Cotabato, and failing to receive news about
the fate of his petition and becoming apprehensive that the period for filling
an election protest would expire on December 27, 1967, filed such <span style="">a </span>protest in the Court of First
Instance of Cotabato in the afternoon of December 26.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The step he took, he alleges in his petition
before us, was a precautionary measure for the protection of his rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition before the Commission on Elections was heard on
December 28.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The election return used in
the <span style="">canvass </span>was produced in
evidence and compared by the Commission with the copy in its possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said copy was clean and showed no
erasures or superimpositions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also
submitted in evidence were the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">(1) An indorsement, dated December 15, 1967, by the municipal
treasurer of Kidapawan, Cotabato, acting as deputy of the Commission on
Elections for the newly created municipality of President Roxas, stating that
according to the tally board in precinct No. 18, duly signed by the members of
the board of inspectors, Jose Riveral obtained one (1) vote (not two <span style="">as </span>indicated in the questioned
return) and petitioner Jose Tuburan obtained sixty-four (64) votes.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">(2) A sworn statement of the chairman of the said board of
inspectors attesting to the fact that the original election return for precinct
No. 18, as accom­plished and signed by her and by the ether members, had no
erasures <span style="">or superimpositions </span>in
blue pencil, particularly that of the name "Riveral" over the name
"Tuburan," and vice-versa, and that Tuburan obtained sixty-tour (64)
votes in said precinct.</p>

<p class="BODY">(3) A similar sworn statement of the poll clerk who, like the
chairman, <span style="">was </span><span style="">a public whoa </span>teacher.</p>

<p class="BODY">(4) A sworn statement of <span style="">Jose
</span>Riveral himself <span style="">to </span>the
effect that in precinct <span style="">No. </span><span style="">18 </span>he obtained only one (1) vote - <span style="">a </span>fact personally known<span style=""> to </span>him because he copied the results
of the canvassing from the tally board - while Jose Tuburan received sixty-four
votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the evidence presented before it the Commission on
Elections, on December 28, 1967, resolved to set aside the proclamation of
respondent Frank Ballener and directed the provincial board of Cotabato, acting
as municipal board of canvassers, "to reconvene and recanvass precinct No.
18 of the said municipality (of President Roxas) using the election returns
copy for the Commission on Elec­tions and thereafter, to proclaim the winning
candidates per canvass made."</p>

<p class="BODY">The new canvass was carried out on December 31, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner was credited with sixty-four (64)
votes in said precinct and proclaimed elected on the same date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day, January 1, 1968, he took his
oath and assumed the office of Municipal Mayor.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 13, 1968 respondent Ballener filed an election-protest
against petitioner in the Court of First Instance of Cotabato.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 31, 1968 he filed with the <span style="">Commissi</span>on on Elections a motion for
reconsidera­tion of its resolution of December <span style="">28 </span>on the <span style="">ground that </span>the
said body had no jurisdiction to entertain Tuburan's petition to annul the
proclamation of Ballener, since at the time said petition was filed there was
already a pend­ing election protest instituted by petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Petitioner opposed the
motion, but the Commission granted it in a resolution dated February 23, 1968,
giving petitioner, however, a period of 10 days within which "to <span style="">go </span>to the Supreme Court for
appropriate relief." Petitioner moved to reconsider but was turned down,
and hence commenced the instant petition for certiorari with preliminary injunc­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was given due course and the
injunction was issued.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The issued posed by the
parties are two:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) whether or not the
Commission on Elections had<span style=""> </span>jurisdiction
<span style="">to entertain Tuburan</span>'s<span style=""> </span>petition to annul Ballener’s
proclamation, considering that when it was filed there was already a pending
election protest lodged <span style="">by Tuburan</span>
with the Cotabato Court of First Instance; and (2) whether or not Ballener’s
motion for reconsideration January 31, 1968 was filed beyond the reglementary
period.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the first issue respondents maintain that the Commission on
Elections was <span style="">without </span>jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The general rule is, of course, that once a
Court of First Instance has <span style="">acquired </span>jurisdiction
by virtue of the filing of an election protest all questions relative thereto
must be decided in the case itself and not in a separate proceeding before a
different forum (Reyes vs. Reyes, G. R. No. <span style="">L-28476, </span>January 31, 1968; Acain vs. Board of Canvassers, G. R.
No. L-16445, May 23, 1960).</p>

<p class="BODY">The peculiar circumstances obtaining in the present case, in our
opinion, justify <span style="">its </span>being
treated as an exception to the general rule.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In Reyes vs. Reyes, the petition for annulment of the proclamation was
filed in the Commission on Elections on December 2, 1967, and the election
protest was filed by the same petitioner in the Court of First Instance on
December 4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was clearly a
deliberate intent to aban­don the proceeding in the Commission by a subsequent
voluntary submission of the same question to the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A choice or option was open to the party
seeking relief, with full knowledge of the fact that when he filed his protest
his petition for annulment had already been lodged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present case there is reason to
believe petitioner's allegation that he went to the Court of First Instance on
December 26, 1967 merely as <span style="">a </span>precautionary
measure for the protection of his rights, because the period for filing a
protest was due to expire the next day, December 27, and he had yet no
knowledge or information as to whether or not the formal petition he had sent
by personal courier to the Commission since December 21 had actually been
filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The uncertainties of travel and
transportation from Cotabato to Manila and the fact that two successive
holidays intervened<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
could really have given causer for apprehension; and the step taken by
petitioner to solve the dilemma in which he found himself should not be taken
as necessarily foreclosing the remedy he had first sought and which, after all,
would be not only adequate but the most expeditious under the circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is one overriding fact that projects itself above all
others:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the evidence of falsification,
on which presumably the Commission on Elections based its resolution December
28, 1967, is strong and convincing, and there <span style="">is no </span>attempt to dispute its veracity for any reference <span style="">to </span>contrary evidence which if
presented would tend to overthrow the said resolution on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The annulment of petitioner's proclamation
and the reinstatement of that of respondent would in effect entrench the latter
in the contested office and shift the burden of attack to the former notwithstanding
the import of the <span style="">finding </span>the
Commission that respondent's right rests upon the falsified return from
precinct <span style="">No. </span>18, The situation
runs counter to the elementary norms of justice and fair play, and, should not
be countenanced under the circumstances of this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second issue is procedural in nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission on Elections annulled
respondent's proclamation by resolution dated December 28, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said respondent filed his motion to
reconsider thirty-four days thereafter, on January 31, 1968, or beyond the
ten-day reglementary period and therefore the resolution had already become
final.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Ballener contends that since he <span style="">was </span>served
notice of said resolution merely by telegram<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the service was<span style=""> </span>defective and
hence the period within which to file a motion for reconsideration had not even
commenced to run when he did file <span style="">his </span>motion
on January 31, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A number of facts
militate against this contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First,
respondent <span style="">was </span>represented by
counsel <span style="">in
the recanvass </span>held on December 31, 1967, and raised <span style="">no </span>objection thereto on the ground of
lack of proper notice The inference that may be gathered from this is that
respondent then considered the telegraphic notice <span style="">as </span>sufficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second, on
January 13, 1968 he instituted an election protest against petitioner in the
Cotabato Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">This </span>again is a re­cognition of
petitioner’s proclamation, since such <span style="">a
</span>protest may be lodged only against a proclaimed candidate and within
fourteen days thereafter (Sec. 174, Rev. Election Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">Apropos it may be observed that when respondent chose to file a
regular election protest it war long before he moved to reconsider the
resolution setting aside his proclamation and consequently he was under no
apprehension that such a motion might not reach the Commission on time for
causes beyond his control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, the protest was not instituted <u>ad</u> <u>cautelam</u>; and the rule
that an election contest in court forecloses proceedings in the Commission on
Elections should, if it has any application here at all, apply <span style="">to respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The writ prayed for is
granted; and the resolution of respondent Commission</span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>on
Elections </span><span style="">dated</span><span style=""> February 23, 1968 annulling the proclamation
