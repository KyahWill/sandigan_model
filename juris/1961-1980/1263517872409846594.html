				<H3>REP. FELIPE J. ABRIGO, PETITIONER, VS. THE COMMISSION ON ELEC­TIONS, HON. FELIX T. CARO, AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF SAMAR, BRANCH VIII, THE PROVINCIAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS OF EASTERN SAMAR, THE MUNI­CIPAL TREASURER OF ORAS, EASTERN SAMAR, AND VICENTE O.

				<BR><STRONG>SANCHEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Upon the averment that the copies for the municipal treas­urer of
<span class="SpellE">Oras</span>, Eastern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, of the
election returns - in so far as they affect the office of Congressman - from
precincts 9, 9-A, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18-A, 21-A and 22 have been falsified to show
that in those precincts petitioner Felipe J. <span class="SpellE">Abrigo</span>
obtained only 49 votes and respondent Vicente O. Valley 885 votes, contrary to
the genuine returns which show 417 votes for petitioner and 463 for respondent;
that the ballot boxes corresponding to said pre­cincts have been tampered with;
that the provincial board of canvassers had so far advanced in the counting of
the votes that it would appear that petitioner was the winner in that election,
petitioner went to this Court on December 22, 1969<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
on <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> with prayer to stop
respondent judge from further proceeding with the petition for recount of votes
in the precincts mentioned lodged by respondent Vicente O. Valley in Election
Case No. 42 of the Court of First Instance of Eastern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>;<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
to nullify the preliminary injunction issued by respondent judge in said case
directing the provincial board of canvassers to desist and refrain from
proclaiming petitioner as Congress­man elect; to annul the resolution of the
Commission on Elec­tions (<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>) dated December 18,
1969 directing said canvassing board to refrain from proclaiming the winning
candidate; and to direct petitioner's proclamation, further averment having
been made that the terms of Congressmen would start on December 30, 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We issued a cease-and-desist order against
respondent judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the averments of the petition and the returns thereto and
the statements made at the hearing on oral arguments on January 12, 1970
together with the documents presented, following are the facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">Amongst the registered candidates for the congressional seat of
the lone district of Eastern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> during the 1969
elections are Felipe J. Abrigo, petitioner, and <st1:place><st1:placename>Vicente</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>O.</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Valley</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Forming the backdrop of the dispute are the events subsequent to <st1:date year="1969" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1969</st1:date>, the day of the
election.</p>

<p class="BODY">The canvass of the election returns by the provincial board of
canvassers of <st1:place>Eastern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>
was started on <st1:date year="1969" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1969</st1:date>
in the Philippine Constabulary barracks at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Acedillo</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span class="GramE"> in <span class="SpellE">Borongan</span>, the provincial capital.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">During the board's meeting on November 29 and December 1, 1969,
respondent Valley called the attention of the board that for precincts 9 of the
municipality of <span class="SpellE">Hernani</span>, and 5-A, 9, 9-A of <span class="SpellE">Oras</span>, their "record" showed a different result
from that of the provincial treasurer's copy of the returns then being used by
the board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This "record"
turned out to be the certificate of votes by precinct purportedly issued by the
board of inspectors to the respective watchers of the candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this was not an election return, much less
an authentic copy of the election return required by Section 163 of the Revised
Election Code, the board conditionally suspended the canvass of the questioned
returns until <st1:date year="1969" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1969</st1:date>
so that Valley could produce the contradictory authentic copies of those
returns or such other returns as might be similarly questioned.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1969</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, at petitioner's behest, directed that the
canvass be transferred to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1969</st1:date>,
respondent Valley presented to <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> a petition to
authorize the board to use the municipal treasurer's copies of the questioned
election returns and for this purpose to order the municipal treasurers of the
municipalities involved to produced before the board their election return
copies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition listed the
following returns and the respective objections thereto: (a) Precinct 5-A, <span class="SpellE">Oras</span> - the name and votes of Valley were omitted in the
copy for the provincial treasurer but the certificate of votes issued by the
inspectors to Valley's watchers showed that he obtained 42 votes; (b) Pre­cinct
9, <span class="SpellE">Oras</span> - the provincial treasurer's copy showed that
<span class="SpellE">Abrigo</span> got 26 votes and Valley 67 votes but the
certificate of votes gave <span class="SpellE">Abrigo</span> 6 votes and Valley
87 votes; (c) Precinct 9-A, <span class="SpellE">Oras</span> - the provincial
treasurer's copy credited <span class="SpellE">Abrigo</span> with 34 votes and
Valley 51 votes but the certificate of votes listed 4 for <span class="SpellE">Abrigo</span>
and 81 for Valley; and (d) Precinct 9, <span class="SpellE">Hernani</span> - in
the provincial treasurer's copy <span class="SpellE">Abrigo</span> was credited
with 47 votes but in the certificate <span class="SpellE">Abrigo</span> only had
27 votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, December 5, Valley was granted by <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, in a telegraphic order to the municipal treasurer
of <span class="SpellE">Oras</span> quoted below, the authority to photograph the
municipal treasurer's copy of the questioned election returns:</p>

<blockquote>"Pursuant Commission resolution of Dec 5 1969 <span class="SpellE">cma</span> be advised that candidate Vicente O Valley is

<p class="BODY">The photographing was done in the morning of December 10 at the
office of the municipal treasurer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither petitioner nor anyone in his behalf was present thereat, because
the treasurer's notice which was sent on December 9 was received by petitioner
only on December 11.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the meeting of the canvassing board at the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
office in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> on December 9,
disagreement cropped up between representatives for petitioner and respondent
Valley over the canvass of the questioned returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On advice of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
<span class="SpellE">supervisor<span class="GramE">,Atty</span></span>. Adolfo <span class="SpellE">Alagar</span>, the meeting was adjourned to enable him to refer
the question to <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the afternoon of the same day, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Alagar</span> presented before the board <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
resolution instructing the board, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the provincial
treasurer's copy of any particular return is clean on its face and does not
show any sign of alteration or tampering, the same should be included in the
canvass by the Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Resort to other
copies of said returns is not necessary;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Should any candidate
question the inclusion of said returns on other grounds, such as that although
said returns are clean, they have been prepared under duress or "gun
point", the Board shall note said objections but nonetheless include said
returns in the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The adverse
party may, however, at the end of the canvass, appeal to the Commission from
the ruling of the Board including said returns in the canvass;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Individual appeals
from each ruling of the Board will not be countenanced by the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, all appeals or petitions for
review by any of the parties on the ruling of the Board should be elevated only
after the determination of the canvass and said appeals should be consolidated;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In case there are
questions involving the inclusion or exclusion of any return, the Board shall
desist from proclaiming the winner to give an opportunity to the parties to
elevate their exceptions or appeals from the ruling of the Board to the
Commission; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board shall
follow strictly Resolution No. RR-650 of the Commission dated <st1:date year="1969" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1969</st1:date>, except as herein
modified."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The board then continued with the canvass on the same day,
December 9, and on December 10, 11 and 12, 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1969" day="12" month="12">December
 12, 1969</st1:date>, the canvass was concluded, except for precinct 5-A of <span class="SpellE">Oras</span> where the parties agreed to defer the tally because
the <span class="GramE">name of Valley as well as the votes received by him were</span>
not recorded in the return.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Representatives for Valley asked that they be given time to present the
photographs of the copies for the municipal treasurer of all the returns
questioned by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> representative decided to adjourn the meeting in
order to give Valley a chance to raise the issue on the questioned returns to <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
tabulated result which does not in included the 42 votes for Valley in precinct
5-A of <span class="SpellE">Oras</span> was a follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Felipe J. <span class="SpellE">Abrigo</span> -
23,389 votes; <st1:place><st1:placename>Vicente</st1:placename> <st1:placename>O.</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Valley</st1:placetype></st1:place> - 23,103 votes; Jose T.
Ramirez –8,319 votes; <span class="SpellE">Remigio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabulao</span>
- 50 votes; and Honor <span class="SpellE">Moslares</span> -10 votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">The corresponding statements of votes in each munici­pality were
signed by all the members of the board,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
except that for the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Oras</span></st1:placename></st1:place> the following three
members did not sign:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vice-Governor
Federico <span class="SpellE">Mengote</span> and board mem­bers Fernando <span class="SpellE">Lugay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Galo</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvor</span>, Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
apparent reason being that the returns for the provincial treasurer from
precincts 9-A, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18-A, 21-A and 22 were disputed due to the
alleged discrepancy with the corresponding returns for the municipal treasurer;
and that as to precinct 5-A the name of Valley and the votes obtained by him
were omitted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The certificate of canvass and proclamation of petitioner was
also prepared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, four members signed
the certificate, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Governor Victor
<span class="SpellE">Amasa</span>, board member <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sabate</span>, Highway District Engineer Benito Ramos and
District Health Officer Faustino Reyes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The other four members did not sign, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provincial Fiscal Vicente Ramirez,
Vice-Governor Federico <span class="SpellE">Mengote</span>, board members
Fernando <span class="SpellE">Lugay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Galo</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvor</span>, Jr.</p>

<p class="BODY">The deadlocked board thus adjourned and set the next hearing for <st1:date year="1969" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1969</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on December 13, respondent Valley went to the Court of
First Instance of Eastern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> on petition dated
December 11 (Election Case 42 heretofore mentioned), for a recount of votes
cast in the nine precincts (9, 9-A, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18-A, 21-A and 22) of <span class="SpellE">Oras</span> <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 15, 1969, respondent Valley did two things: (1) He
presented before the canvassing board photo­graphs of the municipal treasurer's
copies of the questioned returns from the precincts just enumerated; and (2) he
obtained from the Court of First Instance of Eastern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>,
upon the basis of the photographs of the municipal treasurer's returns from
said precincts, the disputed writ of preliminary injunction directing the board
to refrain from proclaiming <span class="SpellE">Abrigo</span> as the
Representative-elect of Eastern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing on oral arguments before this
Court on <st1:date year="1970" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1970</st1:date>,
respondent judge manifested that it was after he issued the injunctive writ
that he went on leave of absence for medical check-up.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1969</st1:date>,
petitioner Felipe <span class="SpellE">Abrigo</span>, upon learning of the
preliminary injunction just <span class="GramE">mentioned,</span> filed before
this Court the present petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and <i>mandamus</i>
against the presiding judge of the Court of First Ins­tance of Eastern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> and <st1:place><st1:placename>Vicente</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>O.</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Valley</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, petitioner received the telegraphic order of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> dated <st1:date year="1969" day="18" month="12">December
 18, 1969</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="2" month="1">January 2, 1970</st1:date>,
in pursuance of the resolution of this Court of December 22, 1969, petitioner
amended his petition to include as party respondents <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
the provincial board of canvassers of <st1:place>Eastern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>,
and the municipal treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Oras</span>, <st1:place>Eastern
 <span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on December 23, 1969, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
heard respondent Valley's petition of November 5 heretofore adverted to, to use
the municipal treasurer's copies in place of the questioned copies of the
provincial treasurer, and made the following rulings: (1) as to precincts 1, 2,
3 and 4 of <span class="SpellE">Arteche</span>, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
overruled respondent Valley's objection that all the returns were prepared by a
single person, after a finding by the NBI that the returns were not prepared by
a single hand; (2) as to precinct 5-A of <span class="SpellE">Oras</span>, the
board of inspectors of said precinct having wired <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
that they inadvertently omitted to write 42 votes for Valley, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> deferred the disposition of the return <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> so that the board of inspectors could file a
petition for correction; (3) as to precinct 9 of <span class="SpellE">Hernani</span>,
respondent Valley verbally with­drew his objection; and (4) as to precinct 4 of
<span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> wherein the entry of votes for the
congressional candidates <span class="SpellE">appearsto</span> have been crossed
out by a single diagonal line, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> directed the
taking of depositions of the members of the board of inspectors.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case is now before us for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is conceded on both sides that the difference in the number of
votes from the nine precincts, the subject of the recount petition, as
appearing in the copies of the returns for the municipal treasurer, on the one
hand, and that recorded in the originals of said returns for the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> and the carbon copies thereof for the provincial
treasurer, on the other (which last two are both confirmed by the copies for
the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party and the affidavit of the
chairman of the Liberal Party), is decisive of the result of the election for
Congressman.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crucial issue is this:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Can the Court of First Instance validly act upon a petition for recount
under Section 163 of the Revised Election Code, absent an averment that the
canvassing board or <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has found a discrepancy
between two authentic copies of the election returns and upon mere presentation
of photographs of copies of the election returns which photographs reflect
apparent alterations and tampering of the originals?</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The controlling
statute, Section 163 of the Revised Election Code, in its pertinent portion
reads:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 163.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>When statements of a pre­cinct are
contradictory</u>.- In case it appears to the provincial board of canvassers
that another copy or other authentic copies of the statement from an election
precinct submitted to the board give to a candidate a different number of votes
and the difference affects the result of the elec­tion, the Court of First
Instance of the province, upon motion of the board or of any candidate
affected, may proceed to recount the votes cast in the precinct for the sole
purpose of deter­mining which is the true statement or which is the true result
of the count of the votes cast in said precinct for the office in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">codal</span> provision just quoted
significantly starts with the requirement of an <u>initial</u> <u>finding</u>
by the board of canvassers of a discrepancy in the number of votes given to a
candidate between authentic copies of election returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This provision does not impart a meaning
other than what the plain wording literally gives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statutory authority to the Court of First
Instance to recount is preconditioned upon, <u>first</u>, the averment that a
discrepancy exists between two or more genuine returns; <u>second</u>, the
alleged discrepancy being brought to the attention of the board of canvassers; <u>third</u>,
the board of canvassers ruling that such a discrepancy in the authentic copies
of the returns exists; and <u>fourth</u>, "the difference [in the number
of votes]" which "affects the result of the election." Speaking
thru Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, we have ruled in <span class="SpellE"><u>Dizon</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Tizon</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
that "the dis­crepancy <u>must</u> be brought to the attention of the
board in the process of canvass"; otherwise the Court of First Instance
has no author­ity to order a recount of the votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">And this requirement, we must say, follows the prac­tical
mechanics of a canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the
preparation of the election returns by the board of inspectors, the next step
out­lined by the law is the canvass thereof by the canvassing board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is before this body that a candidate must
present any question regarding the election returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Code, of course, recognizes the right of
the inspectors, by a unanimous vote, to petition for correction of the returns
under <span class="SpellE">codal</span> Section 154.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law envisions that while the board is
doing its work in canvassing the election returns and tallying the results, its
attention should be called to any question which could affect its work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The board should be given an opportunity, as
Section 163 plainly directs, to decide whether - on the existence or
non-existence of discre­pancy - to defer the canvass or to continue with
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, it is upon this body that
the duty to canvass is reposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
function, it would seem to us, complements its authority to canvass only
election returns which are in due form and to exclude those which are
"obviously manufactured or palpably irregular."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that on <st1:date year="1969" day="15" month="12">December
 15, 1969</st1:date>, respondent Valley presented to the board of canvassers
photographs of the copies of the returns from the disputed precincts for the
municipal treasurer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But petitioner
objected upon the <span class="GramE">ground that even</span> the photographs on
their face show that the copies of the returns for the municipal treasurer have
been tampered with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These photographs
are not the <u>authentic</u> <u>copies</u> of the returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No effort was made by Valley to produce the
municipal treasurer's copies of the returns themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The board was thus deprived of its authority
to rule on the question of whether or not there was a mere case of discrepancy
amongst authentic returns or one of tampering.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Tagoranao</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <u>Commission</u>
<u>on</u> <u>Elections</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court, thru Mr. Justice Castro, specifically ruled that "[w]<span class="SpellE">hether</span> the returns in question are spurious is a question
that should have been laid before the board of canvassers, not before the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>." As timely it is to recall the guidelines we
have formulated in <span class="SpellE"><u>Ong</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <u>Commission</u>
<u>on</u> <u>Elections</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
thus -</p>

<blockquote>"Where before or during canvassing or before proclamation
representations are made that returns are falsified, it becomes the primary
duty, first of the board of canvassers, and then of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
to ascertain this fact.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If finally the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> summarily finds
that there was falsification of the copies to be used for canvassing purposes,
then canvassing must be made upon the basis of authentic copies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Because a falsified return
or spurious return amounts to no return at all.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>If, on the other hand, the discrepancy in the returns was the
result of honest mistakes of the board of inspectors, two courses of action are
open in the court of first instance: (1) a peti­tion for correction of returns
with the consent of all the members of the board of inspectors under Section
154 of the Revised Election Code; and (2) a petition by the said board or any
candidate affected for summary judicial recount under Sections 163 and 168 of
the same code."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We have not overlooked the fact that at the board's meeting on
November 29, 1969, respondent Valley sought to prove discre­pant entries with a
certificate of votes by precinct issued to the watchers of the registered
candidates and another certificate of votes based on the advance copies for the
municipal treasurer signed allegedly on November 18, 1969 by the assistant
municipal treasurer.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
These are not returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The board could
have disregarded them and proceeded with the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the board still accommodated respondent
Valley by granting him time to produce authentic copies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet he did not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is appropriate to note here that another
certificate of votes<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
issued by the same assistant municipal treasurer at an earlier date, <st1:date year="1969" day="14" month="11">Novem­ber 14, 1969</st1:date>, does not contain
any discrepant entries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This last
certificate precisely confirms the votes which petitioner all along has been
claiming were the actual votes received by him and Valley in those nine
precincts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the original advance
election results<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
issued to the municipal treasurer reflect the same entries.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without evidence upon which the board of canvassers could
properly draw a conclusion as to the alleged discrepan­cies, and it appearing
upon the copy of the returns for the pro­vincial treasurer and the original
thereof for the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> that the entries in these
documents are clean on their face and do not show any sign of alteration or
tampering, we rule that necessity there was none for a petition for recount
under Sec­tion 163 of the Revised Election Code.</p>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Argument has been
advanced that the Court of First Instance of Eastern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>
may, in a petition for recount, resolve the question of whether or not there is
discrepancy amongst authentic returns or outright falsification, <u>even</u> <u>before</u>
this question is resolved either by the board of canvassers during canvass or
thereafter by <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Concurrence of jurisdiction is thus
advocated.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Revised Election Code is a special law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mechanics of its enforcement are therein
delineated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For so long as the law
requires that the board of canvassers <u>first</u> resolve the question of
whether such discrepancy exists, we cannot subscribe to the view that courts of
first instance should be given equal jurisdic­tion to determine the question of
falsification or mere discrepancy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because, the court's jurisdiction in this respect only arises after a
determination by the board of canvassers that discrepancy is between genuine -
not falsified tampered or spurious - returns.</p>

<p class="BODY">A view that has become stabilized is that judicial recount of
votes under <span class="SpellE">codal</span> Sections 163 and 168 is but a special
authority conferred on the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
language of this Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Lawsin</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Escalona</u></span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
it [court's authority to recount] "<u>must</u> <u>be</u> <u>restrictively</u>
<u>construed</u>, so as not to extend to other cases that may, more or less,
bear some resemblance to the situation described in said sections." We
cannot thus simply write off the prerequisite that before a court of justice
may exercise jurisdiction under Sections 163 and 168, the alleged discrepancy
must first be brought to the attention of the board of canvassers and an
administrative ruling thereon had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
is the scheme of the election law which has chosen to grant to the court of
first instance but a delimited power.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even conceding that
such a concourse of jurisdiction exists, the canvassing board and <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> have already acquired priority of
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Long accepted is the rule
that in case of parity of jurisdiction between two bodies, one which first
acquires jurisdiction in point of time has the power to continue and decide the
dispute.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
We adhere to, rather than deviate from, so wholesome a rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No two courts should simultaneously take
cognizance of and hear one and the same case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A contrary rule would foment confusion; it would give a party
opportunity to harass the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
litigant should be required to shuttle from one court to another to defend his
rights in a case.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nor may the board of canvassers or <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
for that matter, abdicate its jurisdiction to hear and determine the question
of discrepancy here presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The duty
to so hear and determine is by law imposed upon them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it is an exercise of futility to
throw the burden upon a court which, after all, has no jurisdiction to
entertain the case.</p>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One more reason there
is why respondent Valley may not go to court on judicial recount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is because he has to rely on the copy for
the municipal treasurer of each of the returns from precincts 9, 9-A, 12, 15,
16, 17, 18-A, 21-A and 22 of <span class="SpellE">Oras</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We have examined these returns.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have compared them with those for the provincial treasurer and for
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We find that both the copies for the municipal treasurer and the
provincial treasurer are but carbon impressions of those - the originals - for <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It simply
is unreal to palm off the copies for the municipal treasurer as genuine
returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We note with interest that the
changes in votes therein were <u>solely</u> for the office of Congressman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such changes do not even bear the initials of
any one member of the board of inspectors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nothing there is to attest to the legitimacy of the material changes in
the votes, which worked to the prejudice of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span>
need not be resorted to; a handwriting expert with a trained mind need not be
summoned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The falsification in the
returns is so patent to the naked eye.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Let us take the case of precinct No. 9.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the original for <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> and the carbon
copy for the provincial treasurer, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Abrigo</span>
garnered 26 votes in words and figures, while respondent Valley obtained 67
votes, also in words and figures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
contrast, in the carbon copy for the municipal treasurer, it would appear that
the words "twenty six" representing <span class="SpellE">Abrigo's</span>
votes were erased and signs of erasure still exist; and the <st1:time minute="58" hour="17"><u>2</u> before <u>6</u></st1:time> in the figures <u>26</u>
was likewise erased, so that only <u>6</u> remains; and Valley's original <u>67</u>
votes were upped to <u>87</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The word <u>six</u>
of <u>sixty</u> <u>seven</u> was changed to <u>eight</u> and the figure <u>6</u>
of <u>67</u> was retouched with pencil to read <u>8</u> to make out <u>87</u>
votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pattern is the same with the
returns from the other eight precincts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another interesting case study, is precinct 21-A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The original of this return for <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> shows 56 votes for <span class="SpellE">Abrigo</span>
and 54 for Valley.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One other
congressional candidate, Jose T. Ramirez, obtained 5 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The total number of votes cast for
Congressman is 115 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
municipal treasurer's copy, the words <u>fifty</u> <u>six</u> corresponding to
the votes for <span class="SpellE">Abrigo</span> were erased and replaced with <u>six</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The figure <u>5</u> of <u>56</u> was erased,
leaving <u>6</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ramirez, who obtained <u>5</u>
votes, was credited with <u>zero</u> in the municipal treasurer's copy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Valley's 54 votes swelled to 112.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The fact that the word <u>one</u>
in <u>one</u> <u>hundred</u> <u>and</u> <u>twelve</u> was written to the left
and way out of alignment speaks a lot about the brazenness with which the
falsifications were committed.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The doer did not even as much as attempt at pre­cision-tooling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not escaping notice, too, is that in the
falsified municipal treasurer's return, the total number of votes is not 115,
as heretofore stated, but 118.</p>

<p class="BODY">We may not thus regard the copies for the municipal treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Oras</span> as authentic returns.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have said, and repeatedly, that a falsified <span class="GramE">return</span>
or spurious return amounts to no return at all.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the foregoing and the fact that there was no prior
ruling by the board of canvassers on the question of dis­crepancy between
authentic copies of the returns<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
and that judicial recount is not thus the remedy,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
respondent judge acted without jurisdiction in entertaining and proceeding to
act on respondent Valley's petition for recount.</p>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another trespass upon
orderly election process is brought to the attention of this Court by
petitioner in his aver­ment that the ballot boxes corresponding to the nine
precincts in <span class="SpellE">Oras</span> just mentioned have been tampered
with allegedly for the purpose of altering the ballots therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inability to produce before this Court
the ballot boxes for inspection com­pounds the weakness of respondent Valley's
petition for recount.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Suggestion there is in the record, in the form of a report of a
constabulary major and affidavits as well as the proceedings had on <st1:date year="1969" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1969</st1:date> for the delivery
of the ballot boxes to the court of first instance, that an inquiry <span class="GramE">be</span> made into the alleged tampering of these ballot
boxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present is not the time nor
is this Court the forum for a full-dress investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, sufficient reasons there are
already in the record on which to base our decision in the case herein.</p>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are here
confronted with the determination of the appropriate remedy, one which should
avoid the mischief of <span class="SpellE">unjustifiedly</span> delayed
proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Congressman-elect for
the lone district of Eastern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> should have taken
his oath of office on <st1:date year="1969" day="30" month="12">December 30,

sessions of Congress - <st1:date year="1970" day="26" month="1">January 26,
 1970</st1:date> - is fast approaching.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Time then is of the essence.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The record of this case discloses that the returns from all the
precincts in all towns of <st1:place>Eastern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>,
with the exception of precinct No. 5-A of <span class="SpellE">Oras</span>, have
been canvassed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that precinct, it will
be remembered, both the name of and the 42 votes cast for respondent Valley
were omitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
suggested that the members of the board of inspectors file a petition for
correction of the return before the Court of First Instance as authorized by Section
154 of the Revised Election Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is no necessity for this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because,
during the course of the oral arguments before this Court, petitioner conceded,
for proclamation purposes, that Valley should be credited with 42 votes in that
precinct.</p>

<p class="BODY">Only one other question remains.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is whether the votes for petitioner and respondent Valley in precinct
No. 4 of <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, <st1:place>Eastern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>, had been correctly tallied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would appear that in that precinct, <span class="SpellE">Abrigo</span> obtained 66 votes and Valley 49 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even as petitioner had expressed willingness,
undoubtedly for expediency, to concede and have deducted the 17 votes'
difference, it would seem proper that we look into the matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The problem arose because there is a diagonal line appear­ing in
pencil running from above the line <u>1</u> of "Felipe <span class="SpellE">Abrigo</span>"
down to the word "by" in printed words at the left bottom side of the
election return which reads: "Excess spaces after writing the names of all
candidates for REPRESENTATIVE shall be can­celled by a diagonal line." In
a telegram by Election Registrar <span class="SpellE">Garrado</span> for <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, <st1:place>Eastern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>,
to <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, he explained that said line was
inadvertently placed in that space before the board of inspectors discovered
their failure to enter the names of the candidates for Congressman and the
votes obtained by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The depositions
of all the inspectors, the poll clerk and the substitute poll clerk, separately
executed on <st1:date year="1969" day="26" month="12">December 26, 1969</st1:date>,
required by and now on file with <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, all confirm
the statement of the election registrar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The net result then is that the total number of votes obtained by
Felipe <span class="SpellE">Abrigo</span> remains to be and is 23,389 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Valley's votes, which originally were 23,103,
should be increased by the 42 votes (precinct 5-A, <span class="SpellE">Oras</span>)
to make a total of 23,145 votes, the total number of votes which should really
have been credited to him.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
For proclamation purposes, <span class="SpellE">Abrigo</span> still holds a
majority of 244 votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find it difficult to stand mute at the undisguised effort -
once again resorted to - to frustrate proclamation by falsification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This vicious election tactic is a chisel-blow
to the constitutional precept of "free, orderly, and honest elec­tions."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
