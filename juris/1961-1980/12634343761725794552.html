and <st1:date year="1976" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1976</st1:date> of the
civil Circuit Criminal Court of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental
ordering the transfer to the military tribunal, upon joint motion of <st1:date year="1976" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1976</st1:date> of the Provincial Fiscal
and the Constabulary Judge Advocate, of Criminal Case No. CCC-XII-927 docketed
with it against the said accused for frustrated murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal was certified to this Court by the
Eighth Division<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a> of the Court
of Appeals per its resolution of <st1:date year="1978" day="16" month="10">October
 16, 1978</st1:date> as involving purely questions of law and jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1979</st1:date>,
the accused filed a motion stating <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>
that</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 2, 1979,
the Chief, Prosecution Division, Military Tribunals, for the Judge Advocate
General, AFP, transmitted the illegal possession charge (Violation of General
Orders Nos. 6 and 7 in relation to Presidential Decree 9) filed against him to
the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental 'pursuant
to Presidential Letter of Instruction No. 772, dated November 27, 1978;'<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental filed the
corresponding information for 'Violation of General Orders Nos. 6 and 7, in
relation to Presidential Decree No. 9' in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, where it was docketed as Criminal Case
No. 3484;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was allowed to post
bail for his provisional liberty;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“4. There seems no reason why the related frustrated homicide
charge filed against him should not now be also transferred to the civil courts
from the military tribunals pursuant to the same Presidential Letter of
Instruction No. 772 dated November 27, 1978 - save for the circumstance that
its transfer by the civil Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental to the Military Tribunals was challenged by him in the
above-entitled appeal which is pending;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

Instruction No. 772 on November 27, 1978, however, there is no reason why the
instant frustrated murder case should not be included within the purview of
'the announced policy towards normalization' that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'All criminal cases to be filed by the Judge
Advocate General or by any personnel of the Ministry of National Defense and/or

Courts and no longer to the Military Commission.'"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused prayed that "plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
be directed to inform the Court whether or not the above-entitled frustrated
murder case will be transferred to the civil courts pursuant to Presidential
Letter of Instruction No. 772 and, with an affirmative reply from the
plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, that the above-entitled appeal be
declared moot and academic and therefore dismissed."</p>

<p class="BODY">Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span> P. Mendoza,
pursuant to the Court's Resolution of <st1:date year="1979" day="25" month="7">July
