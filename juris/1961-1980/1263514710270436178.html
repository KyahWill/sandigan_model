				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Congress in 1960 enacted the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> to
deter public officials and employees from committing acts of dishonesty and improve
the tone of morality in public service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was declared to be the state policy "in line with the principle
that a public office is a public trust, to repress certain acts of public
officers and private persons alike which constitute graft or corrupt practices
or which may lead thereto."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Nor was it the first statute of its kind to deal with such a grave problem in
the public service that unfortunately has afflicted the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in the post-war era.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An earlier statute
decrees the forfeiture in favor of the State of any property found to have been
unlawfully acquired by any public officer or employee.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">One of the specific provisions of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt
Practices Act of 1960 is that every public officer, either within thirty (30)
days after its approval or after his assumption of office "and within the
month of January of every other year thereafter", as well as upon the
termination of his position, shall prepare end file with the head of the office
to which he belongs, "a true detailed and sworn statement of assets and
liabilities, including a statement of the amounts and sources of his income,
the amounts of his personal and family expenses and the amount of income taxes
paid for the next preceding calendar year; * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In this declaratory relief proceeding, the periodical submission
"within the month of January of every other year thereafter" of such
sworn statement of assets and liabilities after an officer or employee had once
bared his financial condition upon assumption of office was challenged for
being <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of due process as an oppressive
exercise of police power and as an unlawful invasion of the constitutional
right to privacy, implicit in the ban against unreasonable search and seizure
construed together with the prohibition against self-incrimination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court in the decision appealed from
sustained plaintiff, then as well as now, a judge of repute of a court of first
instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it, such requirement of
periodical submission of such sworn statement of assets and liabilities exceeds
the permissible limit of the police power and is thus offensive to the due
process clause.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not view the matter thus and accordingly reverse the lower
court.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reversal could be
predicated on the absence of evidence to rebut the presumption of
validity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For in this action for
declaratory relief filed with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> on January 31, 1962, plaintiff, after asserting
his belief "that it was a reasonable requirement for employment that a
public officer make of record his assets and liabilities upon assumption of
office and thereby make it possible thereafter to determine whether, after
assuming his position in the public service, he accumulated assets grossly
disproportionate to his reported incomes, (sic) the herein plaintiff [having]
filed within the period of time fixed in the aforesaid Administrative Order No.
334 the prescribed sworn statement of financial condition, assets, income and
liabilities, * * *,"<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
maintained that the provision on the "periodical filing of sworn statement
of financial condition, assets, income and liabilities after an officer or
employee had once bared his financial condition, upon assumption of office, is
oppressive and unconstitutional."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier noted, both the protection of due profess and the
assurance of the privacy of the individual as may be inferred from the
prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure and self-incrimination were
relied upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was also the
allegation that the above requirement amounts to "an insult to the personal
integrity and official dignity" of public officials, premised as it is
"on the unwarranted and derogatory assumption" that they are
"corrupt at heart" and unless thus restrained by this periodical
submission of the statements of "their financial condition, income, and
expenses, they cannot be trusted to desist from committing the corrupt practice
defined * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It was further asserted that there was no need for such a provision as
"the income tax law and the tax census law also require statements which
can serve to determine whether an officer or employee in this Republic has
enriched himself out of proportion to his reported income."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Then on February 14, 1962, came an Answer of the then Executive
Secretary and the then Secretary of Justice as defendants, where after
practically admitting the facts alleged, they denied the erroneous conclusion
of law and as one of the special affirmative defenses set forth:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"1. That when a government official,
like plaintiff, accepts a public position, he is deemed to have voluntarily
assumed the obligation to give information about his personal affair, not only
at the time of his assumption of office but during the time he continues to
discharge public trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private life
of an employee cannot be segregated from his public life * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The answer likewise denied that there was a violation of his constitutional
rights against self-incrimination as well as unreasonable search and seizure
and maintained that "the provision of law in question cannot be attacked
on the ground that it impairs plaintiff's normal and legitimate enjoyment of
his life and liberty because said provision merely seeks to adopt a reasonable
measure of insuring the interest of general welfare in honest and clean public
service and is therefore a legitimate exercise of the police power."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1962</st1:date>,
plaintiff filed a Motion for judgment on the pleadings as in his opinion all
his material allegations were admitted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then on March 10, 1962, an order was issued giving the parties thirty
days within which to submit memoranda, but with or without them, the case was
deemed submitted for decision the lower court being of the belief that
"there is no question of facts, * * * the defendants [having admitted] all
the material allegations of the complaint."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The decision, now on appeal, came on July 19, 1962, the lower
court declaring " Constitutional, null and void ` Section 7, Republic Act
No. 3019, in so far as it required periodical submittal of sworn statements of
financial conditions, assets and liabilities of an official or employee of the
government after he had once submitted such a sworn statement upon assuming
office; * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Ermita-Malate</span> Hotel and Motel Operators
Association v. The Mayor of Manila,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
it was the holding of this Court that in the absence of a factual foundation,
the lower court deciding the matter purely "on the pleadings and the
stipulation of facts, the presumption of validity must pre­vail."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present case likewise there was no
factual foundation on which the nullification of this section of the statute
could be based.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence am noted the
decision of the lower court could be reversed on that ground.</p>

<p class="BODY">A more extended consideration is not inappropriate however, for
as likewise made clear in the above <span class="SpellE">Ermita-Malate</span>
Hotel case "What cannot be stressed sufficiently is that if the liberty
involved were freedom of the mind for the person, the standard for the validity
of governmental acts is much more rigorous and exacting, but where the liberty
curtailed affects at the most rights of property, the permissible scope of
regulatory measure is wider."</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, in the Resolution denying the Motion for
Reconsideration in the above case, we expressly affirmed:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"This is not to discount the possibility
of a situation where the nullity of a statute, executive order, or ordinance
may not be readily apparent but the threat to constitutional rights, especially
those involving the freedom of the mind, present and ominous,"<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
In such an event therefore, "there should not be a rigid insistence on the
requirement that evidence be presented."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Also, in the same Resolution Professor Freund was quoted thus: "In
short, when freedom of the mind is imperiled by law, it is freedom that
commands a momentum of respect; when property is imperiled, it is the
lawmakers' judgment that commands respect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This duals standard may not precisely reverse the presumption of
constitutionality in civil liberties cases, but obviously it does set up a
hierarchy of values with the due process clause."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We inquire first whether
or not by virtue of the above requirement for a periodical submission of sworn
statement of assets and liabilities, there is an invasion of liberty protected
by the due process clause.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the Anti-Graft Act of 1960, after the statement of policy<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>

there is an enumeration of corrupt practices declared unlawful in addition to
acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They include persuading, inducing, or influencing
another public officer to perform an act constituting a violation of rules and
regulations duly promulgated by competent authority or an offense in connection

receiving directly or indirectly any gift, present, share, percentage, or

or transaction between the government and any other party, wherein the public
officer in his official capacity, has to intervene under the law; requesting or
receiving directly or indirectly any gift, present, or other pecuniary or
material benefit, for himself or for another, from any person for whom the public
officer, in an manner or capacity, has secured or obtained, or will secure or
obtain, any Government permit or license, in consideration for the help given
or to be given; accepting or having any member of his family accept employment
in a private enterprise which has pending official business with him during the
<span class="SpellE">pendency</span> thereof or within one year after its

or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference
in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial functions through
manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence;
neglecting or refusing, after due demand or request, without sufficient
justification, to act within a reasonable time on any matter pending before him

for the purpose of favoring his own interest or giving undue advantage in favor
of or discriminating against any other interested party; entering, on behalf of
the Government, into any contract or transaction manifestly and grossly

profit thereby; having directly or indirectly financial or pecuniary interest
in any business, contract or transaction in connection with which he intervenes

Constitution or by any law from having any interests; becoming interested
directly or indirectly, for personal gain, or having a material interest in any

he is a member, and which exercises discretion in such approval, even if he
votes against the same or does not participate in such action; approving or

<p class="BODY">Nothing can be clearer therefore than that the Anti-Graft Act of
1960 like the earlier statute<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
was precisely aimed at curtailing and minimizing the opportunities for official
corruption and maintaining a standard of honesty in the public service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is intended to further promote morality in
public administration. A public office must indeed be a public trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nobody can cavil at its objective; the goal
to be pursued commands the assent of all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The conditions then prevailing called for norms of such character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The times demanded such a remedial device.</p>

<p class="BODY">The statute was framed with that end in view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is comprehensive in character,
sufficiently detailed and explicit to make clear to all and sundry what practices
were prohibited and penalized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More than
that, an effort was made, so evident from even a currency perusal thereof, to
avoid evasions and plug loopholes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
such feature is the challenged section.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereby it become much more difficult, by those disposed to take
advantage of their positions to commit acts of graft and corruption.</p>

<p class="BODY">While in the attainment of such public good, no infringement of
constitutional rights is permissible, there must be a showing, clear,
categorical, and undeniable, that what the Constitution condemns, the statute
allows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More specifically, since that is
the only question raised, is that portion of the statute requiring periodical
submission of assets and liabilities, after an officer or employee had preciously
done so upon assuming office, so infected with infirmity that it cannot be
upheld as valid?</p>

<p class="BODY">Or, in traditional terminology, is this requirement a valid
exercise of the police power?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
aforesaid <span class="SpellE">Ermita-Malate</span> Hotel decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
there is a reaffirmation off its nature and scope as embracing the power to
prescribe regulations to promote the health, morals, education, good order,
safety, or the general welfare of the people.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It has been negatively put forth by Justice Malcolm as "that
inherent and plenary power in the state which enables it to prohibit all things
hurtful to the comfort, safety and welfare of society."<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As currently in use both in Philippine and American decision
then, police power legislation usually has reference to regulatory measures
restraining either the rights to pro­perty or liberty of private
individuals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is undeniable however
that one of its earliest definitions, valid then as well as now, given by Marshall's
successor, Chief Justice Taney does not limit its scope to curtailment of
rights whether of liberty or property of private individuals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"But what are the police powers of a State?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are nothing more or less than the powers
of government inherent in every sovereignty to the extent of its
dominions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And whether a State passes a
quarantine law, or a law to punish offenses, or to establish courts of justice,
or requiring certain instruments to be recorded, or to regulate commerce within
its own limits, in every case it exercises the same power; that is to say, the
power of sovereignty, the power to govern men and things within the limits of
its domain."<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Text writers like Cooley and Burdick were of
a similar mind.<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What is under consideration is a statute enacted under the police
power of the state to promote morality in public service necessarily limited in
scope to officialdom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>May a public
office claiming to be adversely affected rely on the due process clause to
annul such statute or any portion thereof?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The answer must be in the affirmative the police power extends to
regulatory action affecting persons in public or private life, then anyone with
an alleged grievance can invoke the protection of due process which permits
deprivation of property or liberty as long as such requirement is observed.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the soundness of the assertion that a public office is
public office trust and as such not amounting to property in its usual sense
cannot be denied, there can be no disputing the proposition that from the
standpoint of the security of tenure guaranteed by the Constitution the mantle
of protection afforded by due process could rightfully be invoked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was so implicitly held in <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> v. Romero,<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a>

that procedural due process in the form of an investigation at which he must be
given a fair hearing and an opportunity to defend himself must be observed
before a civil service officer or employee may be removed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a re­affirmation of the view in

<span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a>
declared that even without express provision of law, "it is established by
the great weight of authority that the power of removal or suspension for cause
can not, except by clear statutory authority, be exercised without notice and
hearing."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is likewise the
import of a statement from the then Justice, now Chief Justice, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, speaking for the Court in <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span>

<p class="BODY">To the same effect is the holding of this Court extend­ing the
mantle of the security of tenure provision to employees of government-owned or
controlled corporations entrusted with governments functions when through
Justice Padilla in <span class="SpellE">Tabora</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Montelibano</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a>
it stressed:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"That safeguard,
guarantee, or feeling of security that they would hold their office or
employment during good behavior and would not be dismissed without justifiable
cause to be determined in an investigation, where an opportunity to be heard
and defend themselves in person or by counsel is afforded them, would bring
about such a desirable condition."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Reference was there made to promoting honesty and efficiency through an
assurance of stability in their employment relation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was to be expected then that through
Justice Labrador in <span class="SpellE">Unabia</span> v. City Mayor,<a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court could categorically affirm:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"As the removal of petitioner was made without investigation and
without cause, said removal is null and void ** *."</p>

<p class="BODY">It was but logical therefore to expect an explicit holding of the
applicability of due process guaranty to be forthcoming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did in <span class="SpellE">Cammayo</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Viña</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></span></span></a>

</span>"Evidently, having these facts in view, it cannot be pretended that
the constitutional provision of due process a law for the removal of the
petitioner has not been complied with."</p>

<p class="BODY">Then came this restatement of the principle from the pen of
Justice J. B. L. Reyes:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"We are thus
compelled to conclude that the positions formerly held by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>

this Court, through Justice Sanchez, emphasized "that the vitality of the
constitutional principle of due process cannot be allowed to weaken by
sanctioning cancellation" of an employee's eligibility or "of his
dismissal from service - without hearing - upon a doubtful assumption that he
has admitted his guilt for an offense against Civil Service rules" Equally
emphatic is this observation from the same case:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A civil service employee should be
heard before he is condemned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jurisprudence
has clung to this rule with such unrelenting grasp that by now it would appear
trite to make citations thereof."</p>

<p class="BODY">If as is so clearly and unequivocally held by this Court, due
process may be relied upon by public official to protect the security of tenure
which in that limited sense in analogous to property, could he not likewise
avail himself of such constitutional guarantee to strike down what he considers
to be an infringement of his liberty?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both
on principle, reason and authority, the answer must be in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even a public official has certain rights to
freedom the government must respect. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>To
the extent then, that there is a curtailment thereof, it could only be
permissible if the due process mandate is not disregarded.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since under the constitutional scheme, liberty is the rule and
restraint the exception, the question raised cannot just be brushed aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a leading Philippine case, <span class="SpellE">Rubi</span> v. Provincial Board,<a style="" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></span></span></a>
liberty as guaranteed by the Constitution was defined by Justice Malcolm to
include "the right to exist and the right to be free from arbitrary
personal restraint or servitude.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The term
cannot be dwarfed into mere freedom from physical restraint of the person of
the citizen, but is deemed to embrace the right of man to enjoy the facilities
with which he has been endowed by his Creator, subject only to such restraint
as are necessary for the common welfare."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In accordance with this case therefore, the rights of the citizens to be
free to use his faculties in all lawful ways; to live and work where he will;
to earn his livelihood by any lawful calling; to pursue any avocation, are all
deemed embraced in the concept of liberty, This Court in the same case,
however, gave the warning that liberty as understood in democracies, is not
license.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Implied in the term is
restraint by law for the good of the individual and for the greater good, the
peace and order of society and the general well-being.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one can do exactly as he pleases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every man must renounce unbridled
license.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the words of <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> as quoted by Justice Malcolm, "liberty is
freedom to do right and never wrong; it is ever guided by reason and the
upright and honorable conscience of the individual."</p>

<p class="BODY">The liberty to be safeguarded is, as pointed out by Chief Justice
Hughes, liberty in a social organization,<a style="" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></span></span></a>

slight the restraints which the society consciously imposes."<a style="" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The above statement from Lipton, however,
should be understood in the sense that liberty, in the interest of public
health, public order or safety, of general welfare, in other words through the
proper exercise of the police power, may be regulated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The individual though, as Justice <span class="SpellE">Cardoso</span> pointed out, has still left a "domain of free
activity that cannot be touched by government or law at all, whether the
command is specially against him or generally against him and others."<a style="" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Is this provision for a periodical submission of sworn statement
of assets and liabilities after he had filed one upon assumption of office
beyond the power of government to impose?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Admittedly without the challenged provision, a public officer would be
free from such a require­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the
extent then that there is a compulsion to act in a certain way, his liberty is
affected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be denied however
that under the Constitution, such a restriction is allowable as long as due
process is observed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The more crucial question therefore is whether there is an
observance of due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That leads us
to an inquiry, into its significance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"There is no controlling and precise definition of due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It furnishes though a standard to which
governmental action should conform in order that deprivation of life, liberty
or property, in each appropriate case, be valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What then is the standard of due process
which must exist both as a procedural and as substantive requisite to free the
challenged ordinance, or any governmental action for that matter, from the
imputation of legal infirmity sufficient to spell its doom?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is responsiveness to the supremacy of
reason, obedience to the dictates of justice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Negatively put, arbitrariness is ruled out and unfairness avoided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To satisfy the due process requirement,
official action, to paraphrase <span class="SpellE">Cardoso</span>, must not
outrun the bounds of reason and result in sheer oppression. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Due process is thus hostile to any official
action marred by lack of reasonableness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Correctly has it been identified as freedom from arbitrariness. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It is the embodiment of the sporting idea of
fair play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It exacts fealty 'to those
strivings for justice' and judges the act of officialdom of whatever branch 'in
the light of reason drawn from considerations of fairness that reflect
[democratic] traditions of legal and political thought.' <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It is not a narrow or 'technical conception
with fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances,’ decisions based
on such a clause requiring a 'close and perceptive inquiry into fundamental
principles of our society.' <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Questions of
due process are not to be treated narrowly or pedantically in slavery to form
or phrases."<a style="" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It would be to dwell in the realm of abstractions and to ignore
the harsh and compelling realities of public service with its ever-present
temptation to heed the call of greed and avarice to condemn as arbitrary and
oppressive a requirement as that imposed on public officials and employees to
file such sworn statement of assets and liabilities every two years after having
done so upon assuming office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The due
process clause is not susceptible to such a reproach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was therefore no unconstitutional
exercise of police power.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The due process question
touching on an alleged deprivation of liberty as thus resolved goes a long way
in disposing of the objections raised by plaintiff that the provision on the
periodical submission of a sworn statement of assets and liabilities is <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the constitutional right to privacy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is much to be said for this view of
Justice Douglas:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<st1:city><st1:place>Liberty</st1:place></st1:city>
in the constitutional sense must mean more than freedom from unlawful
governmental restraint; it must include privacy as well, if it is to be a

let alone is indeed the beginning of all freedom."<a style="" href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></span></span></a>
As a matter of fact, this right to be let alone is, to quote from Mr. Justice
Brandeis "the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by
civilized men."<a style="" href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The concept of liberty would be emasculated if it does not
likewise compel respect for his personality as a unique individual whose claim
to privacy and interference demands respect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As <span class="SpellE">Laski</span> so very, aptly stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Man is one among many, obstinately

that they are the basis on which his civic obligations are built.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cannot abandon the consequences of his
isolation, which are, broadly speaking, that his experience is private, and the
will built out that experience personal to himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he surrenders his will to others, he
surrenders his personality. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>If his will
is set by the will of others, he ceases to be master of himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I cannot believe that a man no longer master
of himself is in any real sense free."<a style="" href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, in view of the fact that there is an express
recognition of privacy, specifically that of communication and correspondence
which "shall be inviolable except upon lawful order of Court or when
public safety and order"<a style="" href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></span></span></a>

the alleged repugnancy of such statutory requirement of further periodical
submission of a sworn statement of assets and liabilities deserves to be
further looked into.</p>

<p class="BODY">In that respect the question is one of first impression, no
previous decision having been rendered by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not so in the United States where, in
the leading case of Griswold v. <st1:state><st1:place>Connecticut</st1:place></st1:state>,<a style="" href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></span></span></a>
Justice Douglas, speaking for five members of the Court, stated:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"Various guarantees create zones of
privacy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right of association
contained in the penumbra of the First Amendment is one, as we have seen. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The Third Amendment in its prohibition against
the quartering of solders 'in any house' in time of peace without the consent
of the owner is another facet of that privacy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Fourth Amendment explicitly affirms the 'right of the people to be
secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable
searches and seizures.’<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Fifth
Amendment in its Self-Incrimination Clause enables the citizen to create a zone
of privacy which government may not force him to surrender to his
detriment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Ninth Amendment
provides:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'The enumeration in the
Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage
others retained by the people.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"After referring to various American Supreme Court decisions, <a style="" href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></span></span></a>
Justice Douglas continued:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"These
cases bear witness that the right of privacy which presses for recognition is a
legitimate one."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Griswold case invalidated a <st1:state><st1:place>Connecticut</st1:place></st1:state>
statute which made the use of contraceptives a criminal offense on the ground
of its amounting to an unconstitutional invasion of the right of privacy of
married persons; rightfully it stressed "a relationship lying within the
zone of privacy created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees."<a style="" href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></span></span></a>
It has wider implications though.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
constitutional right to privacy has come into its own.</p>

<p class="BODY">So it is likewise in our jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right to privacy as such is accorded
recognition independently of its identification with liberty; in itself, it in
fully deserving of constitutional protection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The language of Prof. Emerson is particularly apt:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The concept of limited government has
always included the idea that governmental powers stop short of certain
intrusions into the personal life of the citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is indeed one of the basic distinctions
between absolute and limited government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ultimate and pervasive control of the individual, in all aspects of his
life, is the hallmark of the absolute state. In contrast, a system of limited
government safe guards a private sector, which belongs to the individual firmly
distinguishing it from the public sector, which the state can control.
Protection of this private sector - protection, in other words, of the dignity
and integrity of the individual - has become increasingly important as modern
society has developed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the forces of
a technological age - industrialization, urbanization, and organization -
operate to narrow the area of privacy and facilitate intrusions into it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In modern terms, the capacity to maintain and
support this enclave of private life marks the difference between a democratic
and a totali­tarian society."<a style="" href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Even with due recognition of such a view, it cannot be said that
the challenged statutory provision calls for disclosure of information which
infringes on the right of a person to privacy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It cannot be denied that the rational relationship such a requirement
possesses with the objective of a valid statute goes very far in precluding
assent to an objection of such character.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is not to say that a public officer, by virtue of a position he
holds, is bereft of constitutional protection; it is only to emphasize that in
subjecting him to such a further compulsory revelation of his assets and
liabilities, including the statement of the amounts and sources of income, the
amounts of personal and family expenses, and the amount of income taxes paid
for the next preceding calendar year, there is no unconstitutional intrusion
into what otherwise would be a private sphere.</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Could it be said,
however, as plaintiff contends, that in so far as the challenged provisions
requires the periodical filing of a sworn statement of financial condition, it
would be <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the guarantees against unreasonable
search end seizure and against self-incrimination?</p>

<p class="BODY">In affirming the conviction the United States Supreme Court,
through justices Douglas emphasized that the Court was dealing in this case

it."<a style="" href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></span></span></a>
He made it clear that the opinion was not to be understood as suggesting
"that officers seeking to reclaim government property may proceed
lawlessly and subject to no restraints.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor [does it] suggest that the right to inspect under the re­gulations
subjects a dealer to a general search of his papers for the purpose of learning
whether he has any coupons subject to inspection and seizure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The nature of the coupons is important here
merely as indicating that the officers did not exceed the permissible limits of
persuasion in obtaining them."<a style="" href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup></span></span></a></p>

 <st1:placetype>State</st1:placetype></st1:place> decision is of
relevance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, a statutory
provision requiring any person operating a motor vehicle, who knows that injury
has been caused a person or property, to stop and give his name, residence, and
his license number to the injured party or to a police officer was sustained as
against the contention that the information thus exacted may be used as
evidence to establish his connection with the injury and therefore compels him
to incriminate himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was stated in
the opinion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"If the law which
exacts this information is invalid, because such information, although in
itself no evidence of guilt, might possibly lead to a charge of crime against
the informant then all police regulations which involve identification may be
questioned on the same ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are
not aware of any constitutional provision designed to protect a man’s conduct
from judicial inquiry, or aid him in fleeing from justice. But, even if a constitutional
right be involved, it is not necessary to invalidate the statute to secure its
protection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, in this particular case,
the constitutional privilege justified the refusal to give the information
exacted the statute, that question can be raised in the defense to the pending
prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether it would avail, we

that only congressional power or competence, not the wisdom of the action
taken, may be the basis for declaring a statute invalid. This is as it ought to

offender should be courts of justice, to which rightly litigants submit their
controversy precisely to maintain unimpaired the supremacy of legal norms and

separated from a generalized concept of freedom, may be fairly well encompassed
by the twin ideas of <u>secrecy</u>, which protects the nondisclosure interest,
and <u>solitude</u>, which protects against coercions of belief or,
derivatively; against actions designed to make the holding of belief
uncomfortable, or against any undue social intrusions on the intimacies and
dignities of life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already noted,
