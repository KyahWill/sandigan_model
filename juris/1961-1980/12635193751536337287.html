First Instance, as above intimated, respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>

of land with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Branch IV (Civil Case No. Q-7668), and prayed,
among others, that herein petitioners-appellants (defendants in the lower
court), who have been illegally occupying since 1953 and 1955, be ordered to
vacate, Lots Nos. 2 and 3, Block 159, San Francisco Subdivision, covered by
transfer certificates of title nos. 70981 and 68207, respectively, of the
Office of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City (pp.
1-5, rec. on appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 19, 1963, defendants filed their answer, denying the
material allegations of the complaint, and alleging that they are the true owners
of the lots respectively occupied by them (lot No. 2 by defendant Pedro Garcia
and lot No. 3 by defendant Felipe <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>), having
bought the same from "<span class="SpellE">Tiyaga</span> at <span class="SpellE">Pagtitipid</span>," its former owner, and that in 1933 they
entered into the possession of the same peacefully and the full knowledge and
consent of "<span class="SpellE">Tiyaga</span> at <span class="SpellE">Pagtitipid</span>
(pp. 6-8, rec. on appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On July 3, 1964,
defendants filed </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">motion for leave </span><span style="">to amend their answer alleging that plaintiff
perpetrated fraud in securing the certificates of title covering said lots, and
as the answer </span><span style="">does not </span><span style="">allege the fraud with sufficient fullness and
particularity, said answer needs to be amended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Also on the same day,
July 3, 1964, defendant Pedro Garcia filed a motion for leave to file a
third-party complaint against one Simeon B. Samson as a buyer in bad faith of
lot no. 2, attaching to said motion a true copy </span>of the deed of sale of
August 15, 1963, executed by vendors spouses Feliciano Felipe and <span class="SpellE">Faustina</span> Contreras in favor of vendees-spouses Simeon
Samson and <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span> Samson (pp.12-19, rec. on appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 6, 1964, the defendants’ two motions hereinabove
mentioned were both orally and simultaneously denied, the trial court ruling
that the certificates of title being relied upon by the plaintiff cannot be
attacked collaterally but only by means of a separate action to that
effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court directed that the
trial proceed at that very moment as scheduled, and a subsequent motion for
reconsideration of the ruling met the same fate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As trial could not be finished that day,
continuance thereof was set for the next day, July 1964, despite defendants’
plea for postponement of the trial to a later date to afford them time to file
a separate action for annulment of title or <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
<span style="">as </span>ruled (pp. 19-20, rec. on
appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1964</st1:date>,
defendants instituted their separate action, Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">Q-8114

of the lots in question.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the
<span style="">continuation </span><span style="">of the </span><span style="">hearing of Civil </span><span style="">Case
No. </span><span style="">Q-7668 was called that <span class="GramE">morning,</span> defendants moved that said hearing be held in
abeyance, to be consolidated with the action just instituted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion for consolidation of trial was
denied, trial proceeded as scheduled, and was continued on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="7"><span style="">July 8,
 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, when said
trial was terminated and Civil Case No. 7668 was submitted for decision (p 20,
rec. on appeal).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 20, 1964, defendants filed a motion to hold the instant
case in abeyance until after the action for annulment or <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
should have been terminated and disposed of, alleging that "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> there is therefore that
necessity x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> because,
should the <span style="">defendants </span>be now
ordered to vacate the <span style="">premises in

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1964</st1:date>,
plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion to hold in abeyance, alleging that
said motion is merely dilatory, that the claim of defendants over the lots in
question is without any legal or factual basis, and that it is contrary to the
constitutional precept of speedy administration of justice (pp. 24-31, rec. on
appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="7"><span style="">July 27,
 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, defendants
filed their rejoinder to plaintiff's opposition to their motion to hold in
abeyance (pp. 31-26, rec. on appeal).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On August 12, 1964, defendants filed a motion to drop defendant
Pedro Garcia from the case on the ground that plaintiff does not have any cause
of action against him <span style="">because plaintiff
had already sold lot No. 2, and, consequently, cannot be prejudiced anymore by
the possession of said lot by defendant Pedro Garcia (pp. 36-37, rec. on
appeal; Exhibit </span><span style="">D).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, on <st1:date year="1964" day="18" month="10">October 18,

<blockquote>"The defense interposed by the defendants, particularly Felipe
<span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> and Pedro Garcia, <span style="">is </span>that they, on the contrary, and not the plaintiff, are the
respective owners of Lots 3 and 2 of the San Francisco del Monte Subdivision,
having been purchased from the mutual loan and savings association '<span class="SpellE">Tiyaga</span> at <span class="SpellE">Pagtitipid</span>' composed
exclusively of employees of the said San Francisco del Monte Subdivision, and
to this effect they exhibited the receipts for installment payment (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 1, 1-A and 1-B) issued by ‘<span class="SpellE">Tiyaga</span>
at <span class="SpellE">Pagtitipid</span>’ in favor of defendant Felipe <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>, as well as the tax declaration and a certificate
of tax payment of <span style="">Lot </span>3; that
said defendants have been in possession openly, continuously and in concept of
owner for more than <span style="">30 </span>years,
and that<span style=""> all these facts were known to
the plaintiff </span>as he was their co-employee in the '<span class="SpellE">Tiyaga</span>
at <span class="SpellE">Pagtitipid</span>', reason for which they were never
asked by him to vacate the premises in question until he filed the present
action.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This being an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case, the
Court believes and so hold, that the only question to be determined is whether
the plaintiff is the registered owner of the lots under litigation and whether
the defendants unlawfully entered into possession of said lots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While on one hand, the plaintiff presented
Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 70981 and 68207, which shows that he is the
absolute owner of the land in litigation, the defendants on their part failed
to introduce any evidence or document with any color of title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The possession of the plaintiff is an
attribute of ownership, and the contention of the defendants that they have
purchased said lots from "<span class="SpellE">Tiyaga</span> at <span class="SpellE">Pagtitipid</span>" without having been issued any valid title
to the property, cannot in any way operate to legalize the occupation and
enjoyment thereafter of the premises by said defendants who are mere intruders
in the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, conformably with an
owner's right to possess his property, plaintiff, as the registered owner, has
the right to possess and enjoy subject land to the exclusion of the
defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their efforts to amend the
answer to allege that said titles were obtained thru fraud, cannot be brought
up as an issue in the present case, this being a mere action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
issue should be brought in an independent action.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

plaintiff and against the defendants Felipe <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>,

claiming under them, ordering said defendants to vacate their respective lots
in question and to remove their houses and other construc­tion <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>; ordering the aforesaid defendants to pay such to
the plaintiff the sum of P20.00 per month by way of rentals from the date of
their respective occupation above-stated until the plaintiff is restored to the

their right to the possession and enjoyment of the property to the exclusion of
all other persons cannot be questioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">And <span style="">so even t</span>he

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Consolidation of the two
cases might not be proper, if the joint hearing were to be conducted by the
judge presiding over Branch IX to which Civil Case No. Q-8114 was assigned, </span><span style="">under </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">principle </span><span style="">enunciated in the case </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">PAL vs. <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> </span><span style="">(<u>supra</u>.); </span><span style="">because the judge presiding over Branch IX
was not the one who partly tried Civil Case No. Q-7668 and therefore did not
observe the witnesses who testified on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="7"><span style="">July 6, 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> in Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">Q-7668
before the trial judge of Branch IV.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But that is not so in these two </span>cases where precisely <span style="">Civil </span><span style="">Case No. Q-8114 was to be transferred to Branch IV and con­solidated
with Civil Case No. Q-7668, which was then already <span class="GramE">partly</span>
tried by the trial judge presiding over Branch IV the same Court of </span><span style="">First </span><span style="">Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Quezon</span></span><span style=""> City</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After denying the
separate motions of Feliciano Felipe and San Francisco del Monte, Inc., to
dismiss the complaint filed by Felipe <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>, Pedro
Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Crispulo</span> D. Felipe in Civil Case No.
Q-8114, the trial judge presiding over Branch IX of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
  City</st1:place></st1:city>), after conducting a pre-trial of said Civil Case
No. <span class="GramE">Q-8114 and without a hearing on the merits, erred in
dismissing said Civil Case No.</span> Q-8114 thru the order dated June 22, 1967
on the ground that "it has no jurisdiction to hear this case it having
been decided not only once but twice, by a court of equal jurisdiction and it
being the subject of an appeal" referring to Civil Cases Nos. Q-6882 and
Q-7668, which were <span class="GramE">both</span> decided by the trial judge
presiding over Branch IV the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, with Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">Q-7668 having been appealed to the
Court of Appeals (now L-30887 before US) by Felipe <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>,
Pedro Garcia and Cesar <span class="SpellE">Obligacion</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems that the trial judge of Branch IX
misapprehended the nature and purpose of the complaint filed by herein
appellants Felipe <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>, Pedro Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Crispulo</span> Felipe in Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">Q-8114.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Pursuant to the ruling of
the trial judge in Case No.</span> Q-7668 that the herein plaintiffs-appellants
should institute a separate action for annulment or <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>,
Civil Case No. Q-8114 was precisely filed by said plaintiffs-appellants to annul
the titles over the two disputed lots, issued in the name of the defendant
Feliciano Felipe and his successors-in-interest Alfredo G. Villanueva, Simeon
B. Samson and <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span> V. Samson on the ground that
said titles were secured fraudulently by said defendant Feliciano Felipe in
Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">Q-6882, in which the aforesaid plain­tiffs
were not parties and were not even notified of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of said Civil Case No.</span> <span class="GramE">Q-6882.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The herein plaintiffs-appellants (in L-29754)
were again denied their day in Court in Civil Case No. Q-8114, for the simple
reason that their complaint was dismissed without giving them the opportunity
to submit evidence to demonstrate their claim of ownership and of fraud
allegedly perpetrated by the herein defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Feliciano Felipe in securing the titles to the two disputed lots, which they
allegedly have been possessing since 1933, when they purchased the same from
the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> San Francisco del Monte, Inc.
thru their association known as "<span class="SpellE">Tiyaga</span> <span style="">at </span><span class="SpellE">Pagtitipid</span>,"
which was their pre-war mutual savings and loan association composed of
employees of the San Francisco del Monte Subdivision, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs-appellants were vexed by and
exposed to a long and expensive litigation; because thru deceit, Feliciano
Felipe despoiled them of their lots in Civil Case No. Q-6882 in which they were
not parties and about which they were not notified, aggravated by the unjust
refusal of the trial judge presiding over Branch <span style="">IV to consolidate the hearing of the two Civil Cases Nos. Q-7668 and
Q-8114, with the latter case precisely having been filed pursuant to the order
of said trial judge that any claim for the annulment of the titles of Feliciano
Felipe and for the conveyance or the lots and of the said titles to
plaintiffs-appellants should be thru a separate action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the</span> <span style="">unkindest cut of all </span>was <span style="">the
dismissal without a trial on the merits of said separate action in Civil Case
No. <span class="GramE">Q-8114 <span style="">by </span>the
