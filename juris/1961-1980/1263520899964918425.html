				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This joint decision is rendered on an iden­tical question of law
on two separate appeals by the State from the dismissal orders issued by the
city court of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span>
in two cri­minal cases, on the common ground that the accused therein were not
granted a preliminary investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is called upon to decide whether in the prosecu­tion
before the city courts of offenses falling within the <u>concur­rent
jurisdiction of city courts and the courts of first instance</u>, the accused
is entitled to be heard in a preliminary investigation conducted by the city
fiscal or his assistants, before the filing of the information against the
accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Case L-29715</u>, the accused <span class="SpellE">Adelo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span> was charged by an assistant fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City in an
information filed on June 26, 1968, with the city court of the city, of the
crime of qualified trespass to the dwelling of one <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pagaan</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The affidavits of the offended party and three witnesses were submitted with
the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the filing of the
in­formation, the lower court issued the warrant of arrest which was served on
the accused the next day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused
subse­quently posted the bail fixed at P1,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the arraignment on <st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1968</st1:date>, his counsel manifested that he was
filing a motion to quash the information on the ground that the accused had
been deprived of the right of preliminary investigation, which motion was filed
on <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting upon the motion, the lower court
ordered on <st1:date year="1968" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1968</st1:date> the
dismissal of the case for lack of preliminary investigation and cancella­tion
of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> bail bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Case L-29833</u>, the accused Vidal <span class="SpellE">Endan</span>
was likewise charged by an assistant fiscal of the same city in an information
filed on September 10, 1968, with the same lower court, of the crime of grave
oral defamation against one <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> de <span class="SpellE">Lecmoan</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The affidavits of the offended party and two witnesses were sub­mitted with the
information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The arrest warrant was
served on <st1:date year="1968" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1968</st1:date>,
and the bail bond of P2,000.00 was posted by the accused on the same day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the arraignment on <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="10">Octo­ber 4, 1968</st1:date>, he pleaded not guilty after
which his counsel moved to quash the information of the accused for not having
been afforded the right of preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same lower court issued its order of the
same date dismissing the case for the same ground of lack of preliminary
investigation and <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> the bail bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">The State's separate motions for reconsideration in the two cases
were denied in the lower court's extended orders of <st1:date year="1968" day="2" month="10">October 2, 1968</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1968" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lower court opined that the provisions of Rule 112, section 14 of
the Rules of Court, entitled "Preliminary examination and investigation by
provin­cial or city fiscal or by state attorney in <u>cases cognizable by the
Court of First Instance</u>" and decreeing that -?</p>

<blockquote>in the absence of an investigation by a
judge of first instance, municipal judge or other author­ized officer, "no
information <u>for an offense cog­nizable by the Court of First Instance</u>
shall be filed by the provincial or city fiscal, or state attorney, without
first giving the accused a chance to be heard in a preliminary investigation
conduct­ed by him or by his assistant by issuing a corresponding subpoena"
and that "the fiscal or state attorney shall certify under oath in the
information to be filed by him that the defendant was given a chance to appear
in person or by counsel at said examination and investigation" --</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">are applicable to prosecutions for
offenses within the concurrent jurisdiction of both the city courts and the
courts of first instance, such as the prosecutions at bar for qualified
trespass to dwelling and for grave oral defamation, notwithstanding the mandate
of the second paragraph of section 10 of the same Rule 112 that --</p>

<blockquote>“<u>In cases <span class="SpellE">triable</span>
in the justice of the peace or municipal courts (now municipal or city courts</u>),<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
the accused <u>shall not be entitled as a matter of right to a preliminary
investigation</u> in accord­ance with this section."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The lower court reasoned that "(C)<span class="SpellE">onsidering</span>
that all offenses cognizable by the Court of First Instance, the accused is
entitled to a preliminary investigation prior to the filing of an information
before said court (Sec. 14, Rule 112 of the Rev­ised Rules of Court) it follows
that the accused, in the case at bar, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> is entitled to a preliminary investigation notwith­standing
that the case against him is to be tried by the City Court under its concurrent
jurisdiction since the latter court in trying said offense sits with equal
authority as the Court of First Instance, the proceedings are recorded and
judgment thereof is taken directly to the Court of Appeals or to the Supreme
Court as the case may be. (Sec. 87, Rep. Act 296, as amended by Rep. Act 2613,
and Rep. Act 3828; Antonio <span class="SpellE">Esperat</span> vs. David P.
Avila, G. R. No. L-25922, promulgated <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="6">June
 30, 1967</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To hold the
contrary view, it would establish two different standards in the administration
of justice and procedure in connection with prosecution of offenses which are
cognizable by the Court of First Instance or the City Court under its
concurrent jurisdic­tion, because if the City Fiscal chooses to file an
information x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> directly
before the Court of First Instance, the accused is entitled to be heard in a
preliminary investigation conducted by the City Fiscal or his assistants in
which the accused is allowed to be present, cross-examine the complainant and
his witnesses, and to offer evidence in his favor, before filing an information
against accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, if the City
Fiscal chooses to file an information for the same offense x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> be­fore the City Court under
its concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of First Instance, the accused is
denied said substantial right to which said accused is entitled if the case is
to be filed directly before the Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court believes that the framers of the
Revised Rules of Court did not have this situation in mind, when they
incorporated the provision of Sec. 14, Rule 112 of the Revised Rules of Court by
establishing double standard in the administration of justice and procedure in
the prosecution of offenses within the concurrent jurisdiction­al boundary of
said two courts. " It concluded that the specific provision of section 10
of Rule 112, quoted above, that the accused is not entitled as a matter of
right to a preliminary in­vestigation in <u>cases <span class="SpellE">triable</span>
in the municipal or city courts</u> "applies only to cases which are <span class="SpellE">triable</span> by the inferior court under its original exclusive
jurisdiction", where the proceed­ings are not recorded and judgment
therein is <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to and tried <u>de novo</u> by
the court of first instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">The State has therefore filed these appeals, assigning as
principal error the lower court's dismissal of the cases below for lack of
preliminary investigation, when the accused were not entitled thereto as a
matter of right under section 10 of Rule 112, since their cases were <span class="SpellE">triable</span> by the lower court under its concurrent
jurisdiction with courts of first instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeals are meritorious and should be sustained.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. It is settled dogma that the right to a preliminary
investigation is of statutory character and the right thereto may be invoked
only when specifically granted by the statute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In promulgating the present Revised Rules of Court effective Jan­uary 1,
1964, the Court's intention to withhold the right of preliminary investigation
from the accused in <u>cases <span class="SpellE">triable</span> by municipal and
city courts</u> was made manifest and of record in the proceedings of the U. P.
Law Center's Institute of the Revised Rules of Court conducted on December
12-14, 1963, by Mr. Jus­tice <span class="SpellE">Alejo</span> Labrador (now
retired), chairman, with Mr. Justice J. B. L. Reyes, as member, of the Court's
Committee on Rules, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>Now, Section 11 of Rule 108 of the old rules has been
amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Please turn to Section 10 of
Rule 112 of the Revised Rules of Court on the right of the accused to
preliminary investigation</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the
arrest of the accused and his delivery to the court, he shall be in­formed of
the complaint or information filed against him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He shall be given access to the testimony and evidence presented against
him at the preliminary exa­mination, and, if he desires to testify or to
present wit­nesses or evidence in his favor, he shall be allowed to <span class="SpellE">to</span> do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony
of the witnesses presented at this investigation need not be reduced in writing
but the testimony of the accused shall be taken in writing and subscribed by
him. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> .</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Now look at the second paragraph.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We inserted that provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It provides that <u>in cases <span class="SpellE">triable</span> by the justice of the peace or municipal courts,
the accused shall not be entitled as a matter of right to a prelimi­nary
investigation </u>in accordance with this section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>He is not entitled to it because the case
goes to trial already.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the rule
the practice, rather</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a new
provision."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">During the interpellation period of the proceedings, when queried
whether such withholding of the right of preliminary in­vestigation in cases <span class="SpellE">triable</span> by municipal and city courts would work against the
<span class="SpellE">accused's</span> right “from being taken by surprise",
Mr. Justice Labrador emphasized that "that <u>preliminary investigation
can be exercised at the trial</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
"As a matter of fact, the very contention of the lower court against
"two different standards in the administration of justice and
procedure" was likewise raised in the proceedings and was thus answered
and clarified:</p>

<blockquote>'Atty. <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But <u>this
makes a great deal of differ­ence to the accused where a preliminary inves­tigation
is a matter of right when the case is to be tried in the Court of First
Instance, but not anymore if the case is to be tried in the justice of the
peace of the court</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Justice
Labrador:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, <u>but in the cases <span class="SpellE">triable</span> in the justice of the peace courts or municipal
courts, there is no preliminary investigation because they involve only minor
offenses,</u> only misdemeanors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Therefore,
there is no need for preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The case goes to trial right away</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, balancing the considerations, the withholding of the
right of the preliminary investigation from the accused in cases <span class="SpellE">triable</span> by the inferior courts involving offenses with
lower penalties than those exclusively cognizable by courts of first instance,
could not be termed an unjust or unfair distinc­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The loss of time entailed in the conduct of
preliminary in­vestigations with the consequent extension of deprivation of the
<span class="SpellE">accused's</span> liberty, in case he fails to post bail,
which at times outlasts the period of the penalty provided by law for the
offense, besides the mental anguish suffered in protracted litigations, are
eliminated with the assurance of a speedy and expeditious trial for the
accused, upon his arraignment (without having to undergo the second stage of
the preliminary investigation), and of a prompt verdict on his guilt or
innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the
so-called first stage of preliminary investigation or the preliminary examination,
conducted by the duly authorized officer,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
as borne out by the examination and sworn written statements of the com­plainants
and their witnesses, generally suffices to establish the existence of
reasonable ground to charge the accused with having committed the offense
complained of.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. The lower court's construction of the provisions in question is
difficult to sustain, furthermore, because it would insert double
qualifications in the Rules, where none has been provided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it would qualify section 14 of the Rule
by tak­ing the rule to mean that "no information for an offense cog­nizable
by the Court of First Instance <u>concurrently with the inferior courts</u>
shall be filed" without the accused having been given a chance to be heard
in a preliminary investigation - when the rule is clearly expressed and
intended to apply only when the case is <u>cognizable the Court of First
Instance</u>, be it one of its exclusive jurisdiction, or of concurrent
jurisdic­tion <u>filed with it</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
addition, the lower court would further qualify section 10 of the Rule by
straining its clear and unam­biguous provision to mean that the withholding of the
right of preliminary investigation applies only in cases which are <span class="SpellE">triable</span> by the inferior courts <u>under their exclusive
original jurisdiction</u> - when the rule plainly provides that there shall be
no right of preliminary investigation in cases <span class="SpellE"><u>triable</u></span>
by the inferior courts, <u>without distinction</u> as to whether such cases be
of their exclu­sive or concurrent jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. The lower court's observation that the State's construction of
the Rule's provisions, as sustained by the Court, would leave to the city
fiscal the choice of allowing or denying the accused the right of preliminary
investigation by filing the information for an offense of concurrent
jurisdiction with the court of first instance, or the city court, as the case
may be, does not militate against the validity of the rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be assumed that the right of choice
of forum granted to the city fiscal will be exercised properly in the interests
of an expedi­tious and orderly administration of justice, and experience has
borne out that <span class="SpellE">informations</span> for such offenses have
been invar­iably filed with the inferior courts - absent an overriding com­pelling
reason to file the same with the courts of first instance whose dockets are
generally more taken up with cases requir­ing protracted trials - for
considerations equally of benefit to the State as well as to the accused<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
since their decisions are given the same weight as those of the courts of first
instance and are <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> directly to the Court of
Appeals or the Supreme Court, as the case may be.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Similarly, provincial and city fiscals have been granted the choice of forum
with regard to the filing of <span class="SpellE">informations</span> for serious
crimes within the concur­rent jurisdiction of the courts of first instance and
the circuit criminal courts,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
with a case filed with the circuit court having the advantage or disadvantage,
depending upon the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> viewpoint, of continuous
trial until termination and a prompt ver­dict within thirty days from submittal
of the case for decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
but the validity of the law cannot be seriously challenged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Never­theless, in order to obviate any
apprehension that the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> choice of forum may be
exercised arbitrarily and motivated by considerations other than the interests
of justice, the Court deems it desirable that definite administrative
guidelines for the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> exercise of such choice
be issued by the Secretary of Justice, e. g. formalizing the present practice
that <span class="SpellE">informations</span> for such offenses of concurrent
jurisdiction be filed with the inferior courts rather than the courts of first
instance and provid­ing for the proper cases, if any, when the practice may be
de­viated from.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. Furthermore, the lower court's observation holds true mainly in
cities where prosecutions are generally initiated by the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span>
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Elsewhere, however, in municipal
courts of capitals of provinces and sub-provinces, which receive an equal, if
not greater number of cases, and which courts are given the same concurrent
jurisdiction as city courts with the courts of first instance, criminal actions
are principally com­menced by complaint of the offended party or peace officer
filed with the municipal court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
municipal judge, in the same manner as the city fiscal, conducts the
preliminary examina­tion and takes the sworn written statements of the
complainant and his witnesses, and upon being satisfied on the existence of
reasonable ground to hold the accused answerable for the crime complained of,
is vested with power (unlike the fiscal) to issue a warrant for his arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Sections 5 and 6 of Rule 112).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the arrest of the accused and his
delivery to the court, is when the provisions of section 10 of the Rule come
into play, and even though the offense be one of concurrent jurisdiction with
the court of first instance, “the accused", as stated by Mr. Justice
Labrador, <u>supra</u>, "shall not be entitled as a matter of right to a
preliminary investigation in accordance with this section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is not entitled to it because the case
goes to trial already. "</p>

<p class="NUM">5. The lower court's contention whereby it would qualify the
application of section 10 of the Rule providing for no preli­minary
investigation in cases which are <span class="SpellE">triable</span> by the
inferior courts only to cases falling under their exclusive original juris­diction,
- because the trial in such cases is "more of summary in nature since the
proceedings are not recorded and judgment thereof is <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
to the court of first instance and it is tried de novo before the appellate
court"<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> -is
untenable, in the light of the rule's rationale, as expounded by Mr. Justice
Labra­dor, <u>supra</u>, that the ensuing trial on the merits takes the place
of preliminary investigation, without needless waste or duplica­tion of time
and effort, and a final verdict on the innocence (or guilt) of the accused is
thereupon rendered, rather than an in­conclusive dismissal of the charge by the
fiscal in a preliminary investigation which would not constitute jeopardy.</p>

<p class="NUM">6. The State's ancillary assignment of error that even on the
assumption that the accused-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> were entitled
to a preliminary investigation and were denied the same, the lower court erred
in dismissing the cases below, is well taken.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court has consistently held in a series of decisions, the latest of
which was last month's decision in <u>People vs. La Caste</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
'pointing out once more, as in <u>Figueroa</u><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></u></span></a>
and <span class="SpellE"><u>Bandiala</u></span><u> vs. Court of First Instance</u><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></u></span></a>
that where the absence of a proper preliminary investigation has been timely
raised and has not been waived, the trial court is called upon 'not to dismiss
the information but hold the case in abeyance and conduct its own investigation
or require the fiscal to hold a reinvestigation.' This Court, speaking through
now Mr. Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, in <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span>,</u><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
had stressed this as the proper procedure, pointing out that the 'absence of
such investigation did not impair the validity of the information or otherwise
render it defective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much less did it
affect the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance over the present
case.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>People vs. Marquez</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, speaking for the Court,
emphasized that "the settled doctrine in this juris­diction is that the
right to the preliminary investigation itself must be assorted or invoked
before the plea, Otherwise, it is deemed waived. " In <span class="SpellE"><u>Zacarias</u></span><u>
vs. Cruz</u><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>

the Court per Mr. Justice Sanchez<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
under­scored "that the absence of a preliminary investigation does not
impair the validity of a criminal information, does not otherwise render it
defective, does not affect the jurisdiction of the court over the case."
When the right to a preliminary investigation is seasonably invoked and denied
by the trial court, <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition lie to prevent trial
until the accused shall have been granted the statutory and substantial right
of a prelimi­nary investigation, as in <span class="SpellE"><u>Bandiala</u></span><u>,
supra</u>, where the Court, per Mr. Justice Castro, ordered "that the
respondent fiscal shall grant the petitioners (accused) a new preliminary
investi­gation; (and) the respondent court is hereby directed to hold the case

that would justi­fy the <span class="SpellE">quashal</span> or dismissal of the
case, rather than the holding in abeyance of the case pending the outcome of
the preliminary investigation ordered, since the jurisdiction of the court is
not affected and the right to a preliminary investigation is statutory and not
a constitutional mandate as affirmed by Justice Laurel<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>

"rule and practice" referred to by Mr. Justice Labrador of no preli­minary
investigation for the accused in <u>cases <span class="SpellE">triable</span> by
inferior courts</u> was but in accordance with existing laws which uniformly
provided for such preliminary investigation <u>only in cases involving crimes

carried over in Rep. Act 5180, enacted Sept. 8, 1967, long after adoption of

provision of no preliminary investiga­tion “i<u>n cases <span class="SpellE">triable</span>

This no longer holds true under Rep. Act No. 6031 (Aug. 4, 1969), which
provides that decisions of inferior courts in such cases of exclusive original
jurisdiction, when appealed to the court of first instance shall be decided by
the latter "on the basis of the evidence and records transmitted from the
city or municipal courts" and "the decision of the latter shall be
final: provided that the findings of facts contained in said decision are

In this case, the Court actually upheld the <span class="SpellE">quashal</span>
of the information due to the obstinate refusal of the city fiscal (who was
himself the offended party in a libel case) to afford the accused the right of
a proper preliminary investigation, notwith­standing his having been ordered to
do so by the trial court on the strength of an earlier decision of this Court
on the same issue.</p>
