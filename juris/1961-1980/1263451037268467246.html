<blockquote>"WHEREAS, there is now pending before the Supreme Court a case

and ATLAS CONSOLIDATED MINING AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORA­TION, MINDANAO MOTHER

G. URBINA, ALVARO PASTOR, JR., and EFRAIN C. PELAEZ as defendants-appellants;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, the parties in the above-mentioned case have agreed,
to settle the disputes and claims being litigated in the case under the following
terms and conditions, to wit:</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">1. In consideration of the sum of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS
(P100,000.00), Philippine Currency, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged by
Gualberto Tenchavez (hereinafter referred to as 'TENCHAVEZ'), as full and
complete payment, settlement and discharge of any and all claims and causes of
action of TENCHAVEZ involved or being litigated in G.R. No. L-26153 and of any
and all claims and causes of action of whatso­ever kind and nature that
TENCHAVEZ had, now has or could or might have against Atlas Con­solidated
Mining &amp; Development Corporation (here­inafter referred to as 'ATLAS'),
Mindanao Mother Lode Mines, Inc., Manuel Lim, James E. Norton, Jose Tiong Sen
Ben, Marcelo P. Karaan, Jesus Urbina, Jr., Pilar G. Urbina, Alvaro Pastor, Jr.,
Escolastico Cruz, S. Z. Misa, Carlos Guidotti, Sebastian Ugarte, Gerry Urbina,
Pilar Urbina, Jose Trillo, Mercedes Urbina and Efrain C. Pelaez, TENCHAVEZ
hereby relinquishes and waives any and all rights arising out of the award in
Civil Case No. R-4848 of the Court of First Instance of Cebu entitled
'Gualberto Tenchavez vs. Atlas Consolidated Mining and Develop­ment
Corporation, et al.’</p>

<p class="NUM">2. TENCHAVEZ relinquishes and waives in favor of ATLAS any and all
interests, claims and rights that TENCHAVEZ, if any, has or could or might have
in the properties and assets of Toledo Mining Co., Inc., a defunct corporation,
including but not limited to the mineral claims listed in Annex 'A' hereof and
the parcels of land listed in Annex 'B' hereof, which are in the possession of
and now belong or pertain exclusively to ATLAS.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. The aforementioned case has caused TEN­CHAVEZ the alienation
from him of the love and affection of the other members of his family and of
his friends, because of certain accusations which TENCHAVEZ made against them
and he hopes that with the dismissal of the complaint and the appeal in said
case, the whole incident will be forgotten.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. TENCHAVEZ hereby acknowledges, confirms and ratifies the
validity of (a) the dissolution of Toledo Mining Co., Inc. on June 30, 1953,
and the distribution of its assets on December 11, 1953, among Manuel Lim, Jose
Tiong Sen Ben, James E. Norton, Sebastian Ugarte, Carlos Guidotti, Marcelo P.
Karaan, Jesus Urbina, Escolastico Cruz and S. Z. Misa; (b) the transfer and con­veyance
of such assets to Mindanao Mother Lode Mines, Inc.; and (c) the subsequent
transfer and conveyance of those assets to ATLAS.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. TENCHAVEZ now acknowledges, admits and confirms that he did not
and does not have any interest, claim or right of whatsoever kind and nature on
any of the properties previously or presently possessed, owned and/or operated
by ATLAS and on any of the income and profits received, to be received, and/or
pertaining to ATLAS.</p>

<p class="NUM">6. ATLAS, Mindanao Mother Lode Mines, Inc., Manuel Lim, James E.
Norton, Jose Tiong Sen Ben, Marcelo P. Karaan, Escolastico Cruz, S. Z. Misa,
Carlos Guidotti, Sebastian Ugarte, Gerry Urbina, Jesus Urbina, Jr., Pilar
Urbina, Jose Trillo, Mercedes Urbina, Pilar G. Urbina, Efrain C. Pelaez and
Alvaro Pastor, Jr. declare and confirm that all claims and causes of action
which they have, could or might have against TENCHAVEZ have been and hereby are
fully dis­charged, waived, cancelled and declared null and void.</p>

<p class="NUM">7. It is expressly understood by the parties herein that this
Compromise Agreement novates and supersedes the judgment rendered by the Court
of First Instance of Cebu in Civil Case No. R-4848 of that court entitled 'Gual­berto
Tenchavez vs. Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation, et al.’</p>

<p class="NUM">8. The parties herein agree and undertake to file with the Supreme
Court a joint petition for the approval of this Compromise Agreement.</p>

<p class="NUM">9. The parties herein will bear their res­pective attorney's fees
and costs of the pro­ceedings before the Court of First Instance and Supreme
Court.</p>
