				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The law – and understandably so – looks with repugnance at the
crime of rape, but never is the com­mission of such an offense attended with
such infamy as when the victim is a girl of tender years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The predi­cament, therefore, in which
appellant <span class="SpellE">Remigio</span> <span class="SpellE">Conchada</span>
y <span class="SpellE">Astrera</span> found himself was far from enviable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was accused of the crime of raping the
complainant, then only eight years of age, in three separate complaints.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
After trial, he was duly convicted, the penalty imposed being <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> in each one of the above cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely because the sympathy of the Court
is with the complainant, whose traumatic experience could have repercussions
lasting in its effects, there is all the more reason for a strict and close
scrutiny of the evidence to ascertain whether or not his guilt had been shown
beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of that, we are
convinced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The most rigorous appraisal
of the evidence on record would not justify a reversal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to L-39367, the brief for appellant summarized the evidence
for the prosecution in this wise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
sometime in the morning of January, 1974, that the accused <span class="SpellE">Remigio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Conchada</span>, who was on the ground floor of the <span class="SpellE">Luzonian</span> Building, <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> City,
asked complainant Eden <span class="SpellE">Lingcoran</span> to go to the
library, located at the fourth floor of the same building.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The pretext, according to her, was that she would be given a newspaper for her
father.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Another girl, one Marilyn <span class="SpellE">Albaciete</span>, was with her.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon reaching the library, she was immediately taken to a place near the
bookshelves where her panties were taken off.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Then appellant took off his pants and inserted his male organ into her private
parts.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
To make up for her lack of height, she was made to stand on a pile of
newspapers, the <span class="SpellE"><u>Balita</u></span>, about a foot thick,
folded one on top of the other.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
In that position, she was made to spread her legs about 1-1/2 feet apart.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The result, according to her, was that her private parts became wet; after
which, appellant moved his body back and forth against her.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
He wiped the wet parts of her thighs and legs; then gave her the newspaper, the
<u>Bulletin</u>, which she brought to her father.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Complainant went downstairs where "Marilyn" was waiting for me
because the bag I have was in the possession of Marilyn."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> <st1:city><st1:place>Eden</st1:place></st1:city>
did not tell her parents that she was dragged by <span class="SpellE">Conchada</span>
to the library, nor what was done to her on that occasion.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The brief for appellant summarizing the evidence of the
prosecution in L-39368 admitted the existence of testimony to the effect that on
the afternoon of February 14, 1974, during the celebration of the University
week of the <span class="SpellE">Luzonian</span> Colleges, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Conchada</span>, a son of appellant, informed Eden, who was one of
the contestants in the spelling contest, that they would practice for the event.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they arrived at the library, appellant
brought <st1:city><st1:place>Eden</st1:place></st1:city> behind the
bookshelves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was abused anew
sexually by appellant, who, after removing his trousers as well as her panties,
succeeded in putting his male organ into her private parts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant was again made to stand on a
one-foot thick pile of <span class="SpellE"><u>Balita</u></span> newspapers.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The testimony came from the complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the third case against appellant, L-39369, his brief took
due note of what had been testified to, namely, that on March 4, 1974, Eden <span class="SpellE">Lingcoran</span>, Marilyn <span class="SpellE">Albaciete</span>, and
Romeo <span class="SpellE">Conchada</span> were sent by their teacher, one <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Orinday</span>, to the library
of the <span class="SpellE">Luzonian</span> University, ostensibly for the
purpose of being taught spelling by appellant, who was the librarian.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did so twice, the first time at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="10">10:30</st1:time> and then at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 o'clock</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, it was appellant who made the request, as shown by this
letter:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<st1:date year="1974" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1974</st1:date> Mr. <span class="SpellE">Orinday</span>,

The three students complied with the order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>First, they read magazines, and later they were taught spelling by
appellant, who once again took complainant behind the bookshelves and repeated
the act of inserting his male organ inside her private parts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"After the intercourse, [appellant]
wiped <st1:city><st1:place>Eden</st1:place></st1:city>'s thighs and legs with a
piece of rag."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
When appellant was putting on his trousers, Elizabeth <span class="SpellE">Lingcoran</span>,
mother of <st1:city><st1:place>Eden</st1:place></st1:city>, arrived at the
library.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That particular act, she
witnessed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was stunned, but she did
not say anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She just took
complainant home, who, soon after, with tears in her eyes, told her of the
sordid acts perpetrated on her person.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What the brief for appellant failed to mention was that such narration
came not only from complainant<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
but also from her mother, Elizabeth <span class="SpellE">Lingcoran</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
It was also corro­borated in part by her classmate, Marilyn <span class="SpellE">Albaciete</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Outside of the testimonial evidence of record, the lower court
judge, Delia P. Medina, who wrote an exhaustive and carefully written decision
of sixty-five pages, relied on the findings of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Lucita</span>
D. <span class="SpellE">Goyma</span>, the resident physician who examined the
complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is her
certification:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"This is to certify
that [Eden <span class="SpellE">Lingcoran</span>], age 8 years, female, student
and a resident of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lucena</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> had been examined in this
hospital on the above date.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>[Findings]:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Body - no signs of
external injury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vulva - reddish all
around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hymen - open, 1-1/2 cm. in
diameter, rounded, small laceration at 5 and <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6
 o'clock</st1:time> positions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vagina
admits one finger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vaginal smear for
presence of spermatozoa - none seen." <a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To repeat, in view of the seriousness of the accusation and the
severity of the penalty imposed, this Court took particular pains in the study
of the records of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As set forth
at the outset, nothing was elicited that would justify a reversal of the
conviction.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The first fifty-seven pages of the
appealed decision set forth the testimonies of both the prosecution and the
defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Judge Medina
explained why she arrived at a finding of guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Insofar as the testimony of the com­plainant
was concerned, this is what was stated in her decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The Court finds it quite difficult to
disregard the direct, spontaneous, candid and consistent testimony of Eden <span class="SpellE">Lingcoran</span>, the 8-year-old offended party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is highly extra-ordinary, if not
improbable, for a girl of her age to concoct and fabricate or retain in her
memory a concoction and fabrication of such a sordid event, which happened not
only once but three times, without omitting a single material circumstance,
such as the embrace and kisses of the accused, the pile of newspapers, the
pain, the wetting of her thighs and legs, the wiping of said wetness by the
accused, and above all, the act of the accused in inserting his penis into her
private parts, the child being able to relate well and quite naturally at that,
despite the rigid cross-examination, each and every detail of the incidents, including
the sending out of <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> child to buy '<span class="SpellE">pansit</span>', which apparently was the <u>modus</u> employed by
the accused to discard a witness while he consummated his lustful desire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not to be overlooked is the <span class="SpellE">unswayed</span> and unpretentious decla­rations of 9-year-old
Marilyn <span class="SpellE">Albaciete</span> who corroborated </span><st1:city><st1:place>Eden</st1:place></st1:city>'s
testimony on some of the incidents that happened in the library on <st1:date year="1974" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1974</st1:date>."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
The testimony of complainant's mother was appraised thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The Court finds it equally difficult to
ignore the testimony of Eden's mother, Elizabeth <span class="SpellE">Lingcoran</span>,
since it is certainly against the human nature and the ordinary course of
things for a mother to sacrifice the honor, dignity and the bright future of
her daughter, who is so young, so lovely and intelligent, by exposing her to
the shame and public scandal of this trial * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is unbelievable that to give vent to an
alleged grudge against the accused, which certainly has not been satisfactorily
established, Elizabeth would resort to a measure that would necessarily cover
her own daughter with the infamous stigma of having been the victim of rape
that would cause both of them a life­long grief and embarrassment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no proof in the records that
Elizabeth <span class="SpellE">Lingcoran</span> and her husband are so
degenerated and wicked that they would sacrifice the future happiness of their
own daughter to satisfy a personal urge for a petty vengeance * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
The appealed decision likewise took into consideration the testimony of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Goyma</span>, who was grilled in an intensive cross-examination,
but whose findings survived the test of the most searching questions:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Likewise, quite significant are the
findings and observations made by the doctor, an expert, who examined <st1:city><st1:place>Eden</st1:place></st1:city>
and who corroborated the child's testimony in material points.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The opening and laceration of <st1:city><st1:place>Eden</st1:place></st1:city>'s
hymen, the doctor declared, was abnormal for a girl of <st1:city><st1:place>Eden</st1:place></st1:city>'s
age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reddening of her vulva 'all
around' added even more in making the doctor observe that such abnormal opening
and laceration could have been caused by an attempt to have sexual intercourse
with the child or by a male organ coming in contact with the vagina of Eden,
notwithstanding the absence of spermatozoa."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The first two assigned errors,
namely, that the lower court erred in believing the testimony of Eden <span class="SpellE">Lingcoran</span>, and in not rejecting such testimony, may be
discussed jointly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is pertinence
to this excerpt from People v. <span class="SpellE">Angcap</span>:</span><a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
"Appellant would raise a question of credibility in the second error
assigned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would charge the trial
court of 'giving more weight and credence to the testimony of the complaining
witness than to that of the appellant.' He should realize that his plea for
reversal does rest on a weak and infirm foundation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is need to stress anew that the Court
has long been committed to the principle that the determination by a trial
judge who could weigh and appraise the testimony as to the facts duly proved is
entitled to the highest respect, unless it could be shown that he ignored or disregarded
circum­stances of weight or influence sufficient to call for a different
finding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it was announced by Justice
Moreland in 1910 in the first case of consequence enunciating such a doctrine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he pointed out, in the event of a conflict
in the testimony of the witnesses, 'the peculiar province of the trial court is
to resolve the question of credibility, and, unless there is something in the
record impeaching by fair interpretation the resolution of the trial court in
relation to that question, this court will assume that he acted fairly, justly,
and legally in the exercise of that function.' So it has been since then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a case reported in the latest volume of
the Philippine Reports, Justice <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, speaking for
this Court, succinctly stated 'that with respect to the credibility of
witnesses, the trial court's findings and conclusions, command great respect
and weight.' Its more usual formulation was also set forth by Justice Malcolm
in these words:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'After everything is
said and done, we come back, as we invariably do in cases of this nature, to a
recognition of the rule that the Supreme Court will not inter­fere with the
judgment of the trial court in passing on the credibility of the opposing
witnesses, unless there appears in the record some fact or circumstances of
weight and influence, which has been overlooked or the significance of which
has been misinterpreted.' The three-page discussion in the brief for appellant
could hardly make a dent in the appraisal made by the trial court of the competent
and credible evidence of record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
could be no other conclusion then except to declare as bereft of merit this
second assignment of error."<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Since <span class="SpellE">Angcap</span>, there had been other decisions in
prosecutions for rape, where such a doctrine was reiterated.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">3.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Appellant assigns as the third error the
finding of the lower court that rape was committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the light of the testimony of the evidence
for the prosecution, given credence by the trial court, it would necessarily
follow that the proof offered sufficed for a judgment of conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The brief for appellant did not even discuss
the evidence for the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower
court did so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"On the other hand, the defense relies
mainly on denial, the accused declaring that on February 14 and March 4, there
were many persons inside the library; that Exhibit D, which is his sworn
statement that he did not rape Eden <span class="SpellE">Lingcoran</span> but
only toyed with her private parts using merely his fingers, on March 4, 1974,
was signed by him without reading it intelligibly, although he admits that he
was not threatened by the police officer who interrogated him on March 4 and
neither was he threatened by Fiscal Romeo <span class="SpellE">Dato</span>,
before whom he executed Exhibit D, to sign the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused further claims that he was not even
fur­nished with a copy of Exhibit D, but on cross-examination admitted that he
did not ask for a copy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused contends
that the charges against him are ill-motivated (<u>sic</u>) by revenge because
the accused did not lend money to </span><st1:city><st1:place>Eden</st1:place></st1:city>'s
parents when they were borrowing from him."<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
When the respective testimonies of both the prosecution and the defense are
compared, especially the certification of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Goyma</span>,
the allegation that the lower court erred in finding that rape was committed on
the three occasions charged in the complaint is shown to be bereft of any
persuasive force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to run counter
to the authoritative doctrines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
People v. Oscar,<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court, through Justice <span class="SpellE">Ostrand</span>, relying on the
American decisions, was quite emphatic in its holding that any penetration by
the entry of the labia or lips of the female organ even without rupture of the
hymen suffices to warrant conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
it was held likewise in the following cases:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>People v. <span class="SpellE">Selfaison</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>

"The crime committed by Gonzales is simple rape or rape without the
attendance of any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in article 335 of
the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its basic
element is the carnal knowledge of a girl below twelve years of age."<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a></p>
