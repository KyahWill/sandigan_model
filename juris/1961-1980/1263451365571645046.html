				<BR><STRONG>ZALDIVAR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This <span style="">is </span>a petition
for certiorari, filed by the Na­tional Shipyards and Steel Corporation
(hereinafter referred to as NASSCO) to review: (1) the order of Judge <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> I. Martinez of the Court of Industrial Relations
(hereinafter referred to as CIR) dated July 30, 1962 deny­ing the motion to
dismiss the complaint of respondent Domingo de Jesus; (2) the decision of Judge
Martinez dated March 12, 1963; and (3) the resolution of the CIR <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
dated <span style="">May </span>24, 1963 denying
petitioner's motion for recon­sideration of the decision of Judge
Martinez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The orders and decision,
herein mentioned, are incidents in CIR Case <span style="">No. </span>1674-V.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 21, 1962, respondent Domingo de Jesus filed <span style="">a </span>complaint with the CIR alleging,
among other things, that he was employed as welder by the NASSCO since its
initial operation, with a daily wage of P9.02; that he had rendered overtime
services for which he was not paid; and that on October 14, 1960, he was
suspended from his employment for three months but when he reported for work
after the suspension the NASSCO refused to reinstate him, hence he prayed that
he be reinstated to his former employment with back <span class="GramE">wages</span>
and that he be paid his overtime compensation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 6, 1962, the NASSCO filed its answer deny­ing the
material allegations of the complaint and setting up special defenses, to wit:
(1) that the Court of Industrial Relations has no jurisdiction over the case;
(2) that the complaint states no cause of action; (3) that the action is
already barred by <span class="SpellE">laches</span> or prescription; and (4)
that the dismissal of De Jesus was legal and done through due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, or on <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1962</st1:date>, the NASSCO moved for the dismissal of the
complaint upon the first three grounds <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>,
which motion was denied by Associate Judge <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> I.
Martinez in his order dated <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="7">July 30,
 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the trial, De Jesus testified that he had been employed by the
NASSCO as a welder since 1937; that on October 14, 1960, he received a
memorandum requiring him to explain within 72 hours why no administrative
action should be taken against him for having taken or kept welding rods in his
locker; that after making his explanation his case was set for hearing; that at
the hearing which lasted for only five minutes the investigator, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> <span class="SpellE">Macalingcag</span>, only
reprimanded him and he was not given a chance to explain his side; that later
he came to know through his union president that said investigator recommended
his one-month suspension; that after one month he reported for work but the
president of his union told him to wait for the de­cision of the General
Manager of the NASSCO; that thereafter he learned from the manager that he was
suspended for 90 days; that after the lapse of the 90-day period he again
reported for work but the management did not accept him; that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Macalingcag</span> advised him to wait for the decision of the
Board of Directors; that he returned to the NASSCO after six months from the
date of his suspension and he was informed that he was already dismissed from
the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>De Jesus further testified
that from June to September, 1960, he was required to work overtime because
there <span class="GramE">were plenty of work</span>; and that he had actually
worked 20 hours overtime a month for which he was only paid 12 hours, leaving a
monthly balance of 8 hours unpaid, or 32 hours for four months from June to
September, 1960.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner NASSCO, on the
other hand, presented as its sole witness Atty. <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Macalingcag</span> who testified that it was he who
investigated the administrative case against De Jesus; that on the date of the
hearing, October 27, 1960, he apprised De Jesus of his right to be re­presented
by counsel but that De </span><span style="">Jesus </span><span style="">told him that the service of the president of
their union was enough; that this notwithstanding the investigator appointed
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> Trinidad to act as counsel <u>de</u> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">oficio</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">for
him; that after the investigation he (Atty. <span class="SpellE">Macalingcag</span>)
submitted his report to the Board of Directors finding De Jesus guilty of the
charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This witness, however, did not
touch on, nor refute, the testimony of De Jesus on his claim for overtime pay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1963</st1:date>,
Judge <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> I. Martinez rendered a decision finding
the dismissal of respondent De Jesus illegal or without just cause, and ordered
his <span class="GramE">reinstatement,</span> and the payment to him of the
additional amount equivalent to 25% of his daily wage of P9.02 as overtime compensation
for 32 hours covering the period from June to September, 1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">NASSCO's</span></span><span style=""> </span>motion
for reconsideration of the decision of Judge Martinez having been denied by the
CIR <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, it interposed the present petition for review,
raising issues which may be consolidated <span style="">as
</span>follows: (1) whether the CIR has jurisdiction to take cognizance of the <span style="">case; </span>(2) whether the action of
respondent De Jesus for reinstatement had already prescribed, or had been
barred by <span class="SpellE">laches</span>; and (3) whether the CIR erred in
awarding overtime compensation to said respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner questions the jurisdiction of the CIR over this case
upon the ground that although respondent had asked for reinstatement the case
does not relate to violation of the Minimum Wage Law, or the Eight-Hour Labor
Law, or unfair labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find
this contention untenable for it misses the doctrine laid down in the <span class="SpellE">Prisco</span> case,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
as amplified in the case of Campos, et al. v. Manila Railroad Company, et al.,
L-17905, May 25, 1962, wherein this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"We may, therefore, restate, for the benefit of the bench and
the bar, that in order that the Court of Industrial Relations may acquire
jurisdiction over a controversy in the light of Republic Act No. 875, the
following circumstances must be present: (a) there must exist between the
parties an em<span style="">ployer-employee
relationship, or claimant must seek his reinstatement; and (b) the controversy
must relate to </span>a <span style="">case certified
by the President to the C.I.R. as one involving national interest, or must have
</span>a <span style="">bearing on an unfair labor
practice charge, or must arise either under the Eight-Hour Labor Law, or under
the Minimum Wage Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In default of any
of these circumstances, the claim becomes a mere money claim that comes under
the jurisdiction of the regular courts.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the case at bar, it is undisputed that petitioner merely
seeks his reinstate­ment with back wages.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He does not claim any salary differential nor overtime pay that may make
his case come either under the Eight-Hour Labor Law or the Minimum Wage
Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nei<span style="">ther </span><span style="">does he prefer any </span><span style="">unfair labor practice </span>charge against
his employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the Court of
Industrial Relations has no power to act on his claim for the same is a mere
money claim that comes under the jurisdiction of the regular courts."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">And
elucidating further, this Tribunal, in another case, declared:</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"A mere claim for reinstatement, therefore, does not suffice
to bring a case within the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is necessary also that the case be one of
the four enumerated cases as amplified in the <st1:city><st1:place>Campos</st1:place></st1:city>
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, a reading of the allegations
of the complaint shows that while plaintiff-appellant seeks her reinstatement
in the company, nothing is alleged therein to indicate that
plaintiff-appellant's dismissal from the service amounted to an unfair labor
practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is it claimed that
this is a case certified by the President to the Court of Industrial Relations
as involving national interest x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> or a case arising under the Eight-Hour Labor Law, x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>or the
Minimum Wage Law <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</span><span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"For plaintiff-appellant merely seeks her reinstatement with
back wages, the recovery of moral and exemplary damages suffered as a result of
allegedly malicious criminal actions filed against her at the instance of
defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>; the recovery of her contributions
to <span style="">a </span>pension and <span style="">saving </span>plan; and the recovery of the
money value of her accrued sick leave.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
erred therefore in holding that the case is cognizable by the Court of
Industrial Relations and in dismissing the <span style="">case." </span>(<span class="SpellE">Barranta</span> v. International
Harvester Company of the Philippines, L-18198, April 22, 1963)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing rulings it can be deduced that a mere action
for reinstatement or one coupled with a claim for back wages and/or damages is
not enough to confer jur<span style="">isdiction </span>upon
the industrial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither should the
claim for reinstatement be related to the Eight-Hour Labor Law or the Minimum
Wage Law, etc., as insinuated by petitioner, for what is required is that said
action for reinstatement must be accompanied by another claim arising out of
the Minimum Wage Law or the Eight-hour Labor Law in order that the case would
fall under the jurisdiction of the Court of <span style="">Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span>court's
jurisdiction over the subject matter of the litigation is determined by the
allegations in the complaint, and <span class="GramE">We</span> find that the
allegations in the complaint in the court below are sufficient to confer
jurisdiction to the CIR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since in the
instant case the complaint prayed for reinstatement of res­pondent with payment
of back wages and also for the <u><span style="">payment
of overtime compensation</span></u><span style="">, </span>the
latter necessarily involving the Eight-Hour Labor Law, following the rule enunciated
in the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">aforecited</span></span><span style=""> cases, </span>the CIR <span style="">has </span>jurisdiction to hear and decide
the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of Serrano
v. Serrano, et al., L-19562, <st1:date year="1964" day="23" month="5">May 23,
 1964</st1:date>, this Court declared:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">“x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> It being settled that the Court </span>of
Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over claims for overtime compensation
when coupled with a prayer for reinstatement, <span style="">it is </span>clear that the satisfaction of the unpaid wages may <span style="">likewise be </span>ordered incidentally to
said jurisdiction (Gomez vs. North <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Lumber
Co., Inc., L-11945, <span style="">August 18, 1958).</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Having disposed of the first issue, the next question to be
resolved is whether respondent De Jesus has <span style="">incurred in <span class="SpellE">laches</span> in seeking his </span><span style="">reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">It
is </span>not denied that respondent De Jesus, being a welder of the NASSCO
which is a corporation owned or controlled by the government, belongs to the
unclassified service and covered by the <span style="">Civil
Service </span>Law.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
It is also undisputed that he was separated from the service as of <st1:date year="1960" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1960</st1:date> and he instituted
the present action for his reinstatement only on <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1962</st1:date>, or after the lapse of 17 months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without ruling on whether or not the industrial
court could still modify or reverse the decision in the administrative case
dismissing respondent, or inquire and/or declare his dismissal with or without
just cause, considering that said respondent filed the present action for
reinstatement more than one year from his removal from the service, We declare
that his action is now barred by <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span>,
et al. v. Rodriguez, et al., L-17336, <st1:date year="1963" day="26" month="12">December
 26, 1963</st1:date>, this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> In
the case of <span class="SpellE">Unabia</span> vs. City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, et al., x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> we held that 'in view of the policy of the State contained
in the law fixing the period of one year within which actions for <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">warranto</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>may be instituted, any person
claiming right to a position in the civil service should also be required to
file his petition for reinstatement within the period of one year, otherwise he
is thereby considered as having abandoned his office.' The defense of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> in the present case was therefore correctly
sustained by the lower court."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">In the more recent case of
Morales v. <span class="SpellE">Patriarca</span>, </span><span style="">et </span><span style="">al., L-21280, </span><st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="4"><span style="">April
 30, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, this Court
held:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Petitioner, however, cannot be reinstated, since the present
action for reinstatement is filed more than one year from his removal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a public official in the service, he shall
have begun his court action for reinstatement, be it by quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span>
or <i>mandamus</i>, within one year from his removal or separation, otherwise
his action is barred (Sec. 16, Rule 66, Rules of Court; <span class="SpellE">Unabia</span>
vs. Mayor, 53 O.G., 132; Velasquez vs. Gil, 53 O.G. 5615; Jose vs. <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>, L-10477, May 17, 1957; <span class="SpellE">Cuyo</span>

vs. Rodriguez, L-17336, December 26, 1963)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Anent the third issue
raised in this appeal, <span class="GramE">We</span> agree with the finding </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the industrial court that respondent De Jesus should be awarded
overtime compensation equiva­lent to 25% </span><span style="">of his daily </span><span style="">wage </span><span style="">of P9.02 for 32 hours corresponding to the
period from June to September, 1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
quote the pertinent part of the lower court's decision, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"With respect to the first issue, it is opined that petitioner
has rendered overtime services in <span class="GramE">respondent corporation</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the evidence on record, it has been
established that petitioner had rendered a total of 20 hours overtime a month
starting from June up to September, <span style="">1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Out </span>of these 20 hours a month, he was
only paid 12 hours a month thus leaving a balance of 8 hours unpaid per
month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, petitioner had
not been paid a total of 32 hours during the 4-month period in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">This </span>fact
has been creditably <span class="GramE">portrayed</span> in the direct <span style="">and cross-examination of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No </span>evidence was introduced by
respondent to deny or overcome such fact.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> <span class="SpellE">Macalingcag</span>,
the only witness presented by respondent, testified on the manner how the
investiga­tion of the administrative charge against pe<span style="">titioner was conducted, without touching on petitioner's claim of
overtime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of any proof,
testimonial or documentary, to contradict the overtime claim there is no
plausible reason why the Court should not grant petitioner's claim on the face
of such situation, since the burden of proof lies upon respondent to dispute
such claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the light of the failure
of respondent to adduce evidence and/or deny such assertion, the inescapable
conclusion </span>is <span style="">that petitioner truly
rendered overtime services on the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> period
of time."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing finding of facts of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
is conclusive upon this Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While <span class="GramE">We</span> have ruled in this decision
that the action of respondent De Jesus for reinstatement has been barred, his
action for the payment of overtime compensation is not barred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that said respondent's right
of action for payment of overtime pay accrued in October, 1960, and he filed
his complaint on March <span style="">21, </span>1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An action to enforce a right under the
