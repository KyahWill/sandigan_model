of the Court of First Instance of Manila dismissing its complaint against Lope
M. <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> for the collection of a sum of money.</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is
not disputed that on various dates in the year 1943, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
obtained several cash loans from the Bank of Taiwan, Ltd. at its office in </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bacolod</span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 12pt;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, in the total amount of P8<span class="GramE">,626.15</span>, evidenced by ten separate promissory notes (Annexes
A to J attached to and made part of the complaint) executed in favor of said
Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The loans were to earn interest at
the rate of 6% per annum, computed quarterly, and all of them, except the note
(Annex I) executed on </span><st1:date month="11" day="23" year="1943"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">November 23, 1943</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, bore dates of maturity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Pursuant
to the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended, and Executive Order No. 9095 of
the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 12pt;">United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, these credits were vested

credits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As
notwithstanding written demands made upon him <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
failed to settle his obligation, on </span><st1:date month="3" day="3" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">March 3,
 1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;">
appellant filed the complaint mentioned hereto­fore in the Court of First
Instance of Manila to recover the total value of the promissory notes, with
accumulated interests and attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Appellee's</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> answer admitted all the material aver­ments of the complaint except
those made in the paragraphs pertaining to the Vesting Order, Transfer
Agreement, Executive Order No. 372, and Republic Act No. 477 of the Republic of
the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, and interposed the
affirmative defenses of prescription and force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">After
the admission of appellant's evidence, <span class="SpellE">appel­lee</span>
waived his right to present his own and filed a motion to dismiss the complaint
upon the ground that the sum of money sought to be recovered upon the
promissory notes was not within the jurisdiction of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its order of </span><st1:date month="8" day="1" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">August
 1, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, the lower court sustained the motion and dismissed the
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence the present appeal
based upon the ground that the trial court com­mitted the following errors:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE AMOUNT OF DEFENDANT'S OBLIGATION INCURRED IN JAPANESE
MILITARY NOTES SHOULD BE DETER­MINED AT THE EXCHANGE VALUE OF THE JAPANESE WAR
NOTES ON THE DATES OF MATURITY OF THE PROMISSORY NOTES AND NOT TO BE COMPUTED
AS OF THE DATES WHEN SAID NOTES WERE EXECUTED.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE AMOUNT DUE FROM THE DEFENDANT WAS NOT WITHIN ITS ORIGINAL
JURISDICTION.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">III<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
ERRED IN DISMISSING THE COMPLAINT."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The
total of the monetary loans evidenced by the promissory notes sued upon is P8<span class="GramE">,626.15</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other
hand, the complaint filed in the lower court prayed for judgment as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“(1) Ordering the
defendant to pay the plaintiff the amount of P8,100.71, representing the
principal and interest there­on as of December 31, 1959, with interest thereon
at the rate of 67 per annum, compounded quarterly, from the date of the filing
of the complaint until the whole obligation is fully paid and satisfied;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2) Ordering the
defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,810.07</span>,
equivalent to 107 of the total indebtedness, as attorney's fees; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“(3)
Ordering the defendant to pay the costs of this suit."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is
settled law that in actions for the recovery of a sum of money, the amount
claimed in the complaint is the basis for the determination of whether the
action is within or outside the jurisdiction of the court where the action was
filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Generally, the defendant can not
take the case outside the jurisdiction of said court by alleg­ing or proving
that the plaintiff is entitled only to an amount less than the jurisdictional
amount for said court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the
case at bar the amount <u>claimed</u> by appellant is clearly within the
original exclusive jurisdiction of Courts of First Instance and well above the
jurisdictional amount for municipal courts and justice of the peace courts at
the time of the filing of the action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There being no claim or pretense that the amount thus claimed was
exaggerated purposely to make the case fall within the jurisdiction of the
Court of First Instance of Manila, it is our view that the lower court
committed an error in dismissing the case upon the particular ground stated in
the order appealed from.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Without
deciding other issues raised in this appeal, <span class="GramE">We</span>,
therefore, set aside the order of dismissal appealed from and remand the case
to the court a quo for the ren­dition of judgment on the merits in accordance
with the facts and the law of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
