				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Alfredo V. de Ocampo filed on June 29, 1960 an application for the
registration of two parcels of land known respectively as lot No. 817
of the Cadastral Survey of Sagay and Lot No. 2500 of the Cadastral
Survey of Escalante, both of Negros Occidental, stating in said
application that the Bureau of Public Schools, thru the Division
Superintendent of Public Schools, Bacolod City, is claiming said
parcels of land.
<p> On December  28, 1960, the court<i> a quo</i> issued an order
      
of general default against  the whole world with the excep
      
tion  of the  Bureau of  Public  Schools and one Eugenio
      
Cordero,  a mortgagee of the lands, setting the hearing of
      
the petition on January 10, 1961, which was postponed to
      
May 15,  1961.</p>
<p>On May 13, 1961, the court  <i>a quo</i> issued an order declaring the Bureau of Public  Schools  as having  waived
        
its claim to the  property for its failure to  file an  answer
        
in  the  absence of  any reasonable excuse, at the same time
        
transfering the  hearing to July 6, 1961,  The court again
        
<i>motu proprio</i> postponed the hearing to August  8, 1961.</p>
<p> On July 27, 1961, the applicant filed a motion to declare
          
the Bureau of Public Schools  as having  completely abandoned its right  to file an opposition  and to allow him to
          
present  his  evidence, but on  August 5, 1961, the court
          
  <i>a quo</i> issued an order stating in substance as follows:  it
          
appearing that  the Bureau of Public Schools represented
          
by the Solicitor General has not yet filed its opposition to
          
the petition  despite the fact that the hearing was set for
          
August 8, 1961, and the provincial fiscal was required to
          
communicate with the above official to inquire if he is still
          
interested in pressing the claim of the Bureau of Public
          
Schools,  postponing again for  this purpose the hearing to
          
September 16, 1961, the court  warned that  if on that date
          
the Solicitor General has not yet filed  his  opposition, the
          
claim of the Bureau of Public  Schools shall be deemed definitely  abandoned  and the court shall  proceed with the
          
hearing  of the evidence of the applicant.</p>
<p> On September 7, 1961, the Solicitor General filed the
            
requisite  opposition wherein he stated that  the lands in
            
question belonged to the Republic of the  Philippines by
            
virtue of a  legacy made by the late Esteban  Jalandoni
            
in favor of the Bureau of  Education  as evidenced  by
            
Transfer Certificate  of Title  No. 6010.   On September
            
22, 1961, the applicant filed a motion to dismiss" the opposition, but it  was denied in an order issued on  December
            
18, 1961.  This  order reads:  "Finding the opposition  by
            
the Office of the Solicitor General to be meritorious, the
            
order of this Court dated May 13, 1961 is hereby ordered
            
set  aside, <i>motu proprio,</i>  and the hearing of this case is
            
hereby set on January 30, 1962, at 8:30  in the  morning."</p>
<p>His motion for reconsideration having been denied, the
              
applicant took  steps  to  appeal from  said  order.  The
              
Solicitor General tried to oppose the appeal thru the Office
              
of the Provincial Fiscal alleging that the order in question
              
was merely interlocutory  and is not appealable, but, thru
              
             
              

              
an oversight, the provincial fiscal failed to ask for postponement of the hearing for which  reason the opposition
              
of the  Solicitor General came late.   And so on February
              
3,  1962, the court<i> a quo</i> approved  the  record on appeal,
              
and subsequently denied the motion to dismiss the appeal
              
on the  ground  that it has already  lost  jurisdiction  over
              
the case.</p>
<p>And  on April 13, 1962, the Solicitor General  reiterated
                
before  this Court his  motion to dismiss the appeal on the
                
same ground that the  order appealed from is merely interlocutory and not appealable, but this Court deferred action
                
thereon until the case is decided on the merits.</p>
<p>The order subject of the present appeal  is quoted hereunder for ready reference:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Finding the opposition filed by the  Office of the Solicitor General
                      
to be  meritorious, the order of this  Court dated May  13, 1961  is
                      
hereby ordered set aside,  <i>motu  propio</i>, and the hearing  of this case
                      
is hereby set for January 30, 1962, at 8:30 in the morning.'   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The order mentioned therein dated May 13, 1961, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"It  appearing from  the records that on  December 28,  1960, which
                              
was the initial hearing of this case, the Bureau of Public Schools,
                              
represented by the Provincial Fiscal, has not filed an answer to the
                              
claim of the petitioner.  Following the ruling of the Supreme Court
                              
in the case of Omandan <i>vs.</i> Director  of Lands, 50  Off. Gaz., page
                              
4220,  September,  1954, it is to be considered that the Bureau  of
                              
Public Schools has waived whatever  claim over  the property and
                              
is hereby barred  from filing an answer <em>in the  absence  of any reasonable excuse</em>.  (Italic supplied)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As may be seen, both orders  are merely interlocutory
                        
because they were  issued as an incident of the main case. The order of May 13, 1961  was entered into because of
                          
the failure  of  the Bureau of Public  Schools to file its
                          
answer despite the  fact that the case has long been set for
                          
hearing for which reason  the court barred said  Bureau
                          
from filing  any answer  unless a "reasonable excuse"  is
                          
shown, and  acting  on the  suggestion made  by  the court<i> a  quo</i> that the Solicitor General be inquired   as to
                          
why he has  failed to file his answer in behalf of the government,  the Solicitor General lost no time in registering
                          
the opposition of the government on  September 7,  1961.
                          
And on December 18, 1961, the court<i> a quo</i> readily reconsidered its former stand, and admitted the answer of the
                          
government.   This is the order from which the applicant
                          
is now appealing.  Verify, this order is  merely  interlocutory for the same point  can still be raised after the case
                          
has been decided on the merits.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"An  order is deemed final  when it finally disposes of the pending
                                
action  so that nothing more  can be done with it in the lower court
                                
(Mejia  <i>vs.</i> Alimorong, 4 Phil. 572;  Insular Government <i>vs.</i>  Roman
                                
Catholic Bishop of  Nueva Segovia, 17 Phil. 487; People <i>vs.</i> Macaraig, 54 Phil. 904). In other words, a  final  order  is  that which
                                
gives an end to the litigation (Olsen &amp; Co.  <i>vs.</i>  Olson, 48 Phil. 238).
                                
The test to ascertain whether an order is interlocutory or final  is:
                                
does it leave something to be done in the trial court with  respect
                                
to the  merits  of the case.  If it does, it is  interlocutory; if it does
                                
not, it is final  (Moran, Comments on the  Rules of  Court,  Vol. 1,
                                
3rd ed. pp. 806-807).  A final order  is that which disposes of the
                                
whole  subject-matter or terminates the  particular proceedings or
                                
action,  leaving nothing to be done but to enforce by execution what
                                
has been determined (2  Am.  Jur., section  22, pp. 861-862)." (Reyes
                                
<i>vs.</i> De  Leon, G.  R. No.  L-3720,  June  24,  1952)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We find, therefore, no merit in the present appeal.
                            
   Wherefore,  the order appealed from  is  affirmed.  Cost
                            
against appellant.</p>
