<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Upon arraignment, Usab Mohamad
pleaded guilty and was sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua,
whereas Gonzalin and Ubay entered a plea of not guilty upon which they were
jointly tried. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The evidence for the prosecution
shows that in a small island off the mainland of </span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Mindanao</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the ten accused met and planned
to rob the payroll money of the American Rubber Plantation scheduled to arrive
by plane from Zamboanga at the Calabasa airfield, Latuan, Isabela, </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Basilan</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, on </span><st1:date year="1957" day="26" month="1"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January
 26, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.
Armed with rifles and bladed weapons they set sail on two vintas and after
landing on a beach near said airfield at about </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="3"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">3:00 a.m.</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, of that date they proceeded
thereto and deployed themselves near its gate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">At about 7:00 a.m. of the day
aforesaid, Wilfredo de Leon, paymaster of the American Rubber Plantation in
Latuan, Isabela, Basilan City, arrived at the airport in a pick-up truck driven
by Florentine Morales, to meet the plane carrying the company payroll money,
Parking the vehicle on one side of the runway Morales seated himself on top
thereof, while De Leon was seated towards its rear end. A few minutes later, a
plane belonging to Johnston &amp; Co. flew in and landed on the airstrip to
pick up a passenger bound for </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. While waiting for the latter, the
pilot, Inocencio Rivero, alighted from the plane loitered with De </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Leon</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and Morales by the truck, but
after thirty minutes, the passenger having failed to arrive, his plane took
off. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the belief that the payroll
money had been delivered to De </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Leon</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the ambushers started moving in.
Hearing some noise coming from the nearby bushes, De </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Leon</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> reached for his revolver from his
side trouser's pocket at the same time that Gonzalin aimed his gun at him. At
that juncture, Morales stood up to jump from the pick-up and saw Gonzalin
aiming his gun at De Leon, and Ubay, a short distance away among the bushes.
While running away from the attackers, Morales was fired at several times but
escaped unhurt. De </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Leon</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, however, was shot and fell to the
ground near the rear end of the truck. The rest of the group then came out of
their hiding places and hacked De </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Leon</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> to death with their bladed
weapons, relieving him of his wrist watch, his 38 </span><st1:state><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Cal.</span></st1:place></st1:state><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> revolver and cash, all totaling P1<span class="GramE">,069.25</span>. Thereafter they left the airport and dispersed.
About a kilometer away, Gonzalin, Ubay, Usab and another member of the band
passed by the place where Iluminada Saburo and her son, Pedro, were fishing.
Mother and son had earlier heard shots coming from, the direction of the airport,
and when Gonzalin and his companions passed by, they (Iluminada and her son)
noticed that they were armed and that one of them was wounded. They also
recognized Gonzalin and Ubay. Later in the day, Usab was arrested by the police
authorities of Basilan as he Jay seated under a mango tree suffering from a
gunshot wound. In an on-the-spot investigation, he implicated Gonzalin and
Ubay, among others, in the commission of the offense. Upon his subsequent
arrest in </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Basilan</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, a package of "Bankers"
cigarettes and a "Sefiorita" notebook were found in the possession of
Gonzalin, both articles stained with human blood. De </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Leon</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">'s widow identified the notebook as
the one she had given her late husband. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In two separate extrajudicial
statements (Exhibits U and V)<span class="GramE">,</span> Usab pointed to
Gonzalin and Ubay as members of the group that ambushed and killed De </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Leon</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">A post-mortem examination of the
body of the victim showed that death was caused by "acute anemia,
secondary hemorrhage, due to multiple gunshots and incised wounds". <span class="GramE">(Exhibit J).</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In their brief, defendants"
assail the credibility and the sufficiency of the testimonies of principal
witnesses Florentino Morales, Iluminada Salburo and her son, identifying them
as members of the group that killed and robbed De Leon, and further claim that
the trial court erred in giving more weight to the extra-judicial statements of
co-accused Usab (Exhibits U and V) than to his testimony in open court
favorable to them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">With respect to Morales, defendants
claim that he could not have really seen them well, because his line of vision
was covered by the deceased De </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Leon</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> moments before the latter was
shot. True, the witness admitted that his line of vision was covered by De </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Leon</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, but this was when the ambushers,
closing in upon them from the bushes, made some noise which attracted De </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Leon</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">'s attention. Thereafter and after
De Leon had shouted "hop", he (Morales) stood up from the top of the
truck where he had been seated and peeped through the sides of De Leon, thereby
seeing defendants and their companions coming, with Gonzalin aiming a carbine
at De Leon, and Ubay standing among the bushes. Morales also testified that he
personally knew both Gonzalin and Ubay because they often went to Latuan where
the American Rubber Plantation was located and of which he had been for
sometime an employee; that he knew Ubay since he (Morales) was a little boy
(pp. 47 to 50, transcript of September 1, 1958). Bearing in mind that the crime
was committed in the morning - after </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="8"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">eight o'clock</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> - Morales could not have possibly
been mistaken. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Defendants further claim that
Iluminada Salburo and her son could not have identified them because said
witnesses had been fishing and did not sleep the previous night. The assumption
that said witnesses spent a sleepless night is wrong, because the truth of the
matter is - according to their testimony - that they slept part of that night
in the mangrove at Calabasa and fished during the rest. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Moreover, according to Iluminada,
she was only about six meters away when defendants and their companions walked
by that morning; that walking slowly behind Gonzalin, Ubay and another
unidentified member of their group, was a wounded man armed with a bolo; that
he knew Gonzalin as a former P.C. agent; and that although she did not know the
name of the other defendants (Ubay), she also recognized him, adding that said
accused also know her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Iluminada's seventeen year old son,
Pedro, testified to the same effect, adding that he was familiar with the Jaces
of Gonzalin and Ubay because they worked together in the American Rubber
Plantation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Another circumstance pointing
strongly to defendants' guilt is the recovery from the possession of Gonzalin
of a package of "Bankers" cigarettes (Exhibit A) stained with human
blood, and a "Señorita" notebook, similarly stained. The widow of the
deceased De </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Leon</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> took the witness stand and
identified this notebook as the one she had given to her husband. When Gonzalin
was asked where he had gotten the cigarettes and the notebook, he grew pale and
could give no explanation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Upon the other hand, the fact of
conspiracy among Gonzalin, Ubay, Usab and their companions was satisfactorily
proven by the latter himself when lie took the stand as a witness for the
defense. In the course of his testimony, he admitted that the raiding party was
composed of nine members who had previously met in an island near a place
called Tumahubong where they planned the commission of the crime; that the nine
members, armed with carbines, garands and other deadly weapons rode on two
vintas and landed near the Calabasa airfield at about three o'clock in the
morning of January 26, 1957; that upon landing, they concealed themselves among
the bushes near the gate of the airport and waited for the <span class="GramE">arrival</span>
of the plane that usually carried the payroll money of the American Rubber
Company. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is true that Usab attempted to
exculpate Gonzalin and Ubay saying that they did not form part of the group of
raiders and that he did not even know them until they found themselves together
in jail, but that particular portion of his testimony can not be believed. It
runs counter to the contents of his two affidavits (Exhibits U and V) which
were admitted as rebuttal evidence without objection on the part of the
defense. Besides, even a cursory examination of that portion of his testimony
will readily show that it is evasive. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Moreover, the record shows that
Major Santiago of the constabulary conducted a re-enactment of the crime in the
very place of its commission, Usab having been featured prominently in said
re-enactment. Voluntarily he showed to the investigators the manner in which
the crime was committed, and several pictures of the re-enactment were taken,
one of them showing Usab portraying the position of Gonzalin as the latter was
aiming his gun at the deceased De Leon (Exhibit E), and another the position of
Ubay likewise aiming a gun (Exhibit F), his own position when he was bringing a
basket of ammunition on orders of Gonzalin (Exhibit G) and his position when
overtaken by the police under a mango tree suffering from a gunshot wound
(Exhibit I). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Upon all the foregoing, we are
constrained to hold - as did the lower court - that the guilt of defendants
Gonzalin and Ubay has been established beyond reasonable doubt. In the view we
take of the case, we find it unnecessary to consider the other points raised by
defendants in relation to the admissibility of Usab's affidavits (Exhibits U
and V). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>Wherefore, the decision of the
trial court being in accordance with law and the evidence, the same is hereby
affirmed, with costs.</p>
