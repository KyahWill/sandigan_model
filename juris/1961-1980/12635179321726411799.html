				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal on purely questions of law taken by the State from the decision
of the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered on October <span style="">8, </span>1962 in Civil Case No. 32137,
ordering the Philippine Bank of Commerce - a domestic banking corporation,
hereinafter referred to as the Bank - to pay the State the sum of P5,814.70 <span style="">as </span>5% <span style="">surcharge on the amount of P116,394.00, <span style="">and the further sum of P6,977.64 representing
1% monthly interest thereon </span>for a period of <span style="">six </span>months, or a total of P12,792.34, <span style="">with costs.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appears that the Bank
filed on </span><st1:date year="1951" day="27" month="2"><span style="">February 27, </span>1951</st1:date> <span style="">its income tax return </span>for the taxable
year 1950 showing on its face no taxable income.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, following verification thereof, on <st1:date year="1956" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1956</st1:date> the State, thru the
Collector of Internal Revenue, issued and served Income Tax Assessment Notice
No. ACR-120114- 55/50 on the Bank requiring it to pay on February 29, 1956 the
sum of P116,294.00 as income <span style="">tax on its
income </span>of P726,840.17 for the taxable year ending December 31,
1950.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Bank refused to pay the
assessment the State instituted the present action in the lower court on March
21, 1957 to recover from it the aforesaid sum of P116<span class="GramE">,294.00</span>
as tax due on the Bank's income for the taxable year ending December 31, 1950,
and in addition 5% surcharge, 1% monthly interest and penalty from March 1,
1956 to the date of payment, and the costs of suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Bank contested the assessment, but before filing its answer,
it paid on <st1:date year="1957" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1957</st1:date> the
income tax assessed (P116<span class="GramE">,294.00</span>) but not the
surcharge and interests demanded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its
answer filed on May 9, 1957 alleged payment of the sum of P116,294.00 and
denied its liability for the 5% surcharge and the 1% monthly interest, on the
ground that its war losses in the amount of P1,770,160.36 had already been
allowed as lawful deduction from its income tax return for 1950 by the Collector
of Internal Revenue pursuant to the ruling of the Secretary of Finance dated
September 11, 1951, albeit this was subsequently reversed by the same office on
account of another ruling of the Secretary of Finance of September 3, 1952.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Bank pleaded further that the mistake or
error of the government - left uncorrected for a number of years - in allow­ing
war losses as lawful deduction on income tax until such policy was reversed,
should not prejudice taxpayers by requiring them to pay interest and other
surcharges.</p>

P6,977.64 (idem for a period of 6 months) under Section 51(e) of the National

the lower court </span><span style="">on </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">above issue </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The joint stipulation of facts shows that from the time the
assessment notice was received by the defendant on <st1:date year="1956" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1956</st1:date>, requiring it to pay the amount
of P116<span class="GramE">,294.00</span> <span style="">the
</span>defendant contested the assessment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In an exchange of communications between the parties (pars. 4, 5, 6, 7, <span style="">8, </span>9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17 and
18, complaint) the arguments were so <span style="">spirited
</span>and enthusiastic <span style="">that </span>even
after the P116,­294.00 was already paid they continued de­bating up to October
6, 1960 (pars. 15 and 18, stipulation).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The arguments centered on BIR General Circular No. V-123 dated September
18, 1951 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 4) which permitted property owners to
include war losses suffered by them as deduction in income tax returns for the
year 1950, and BIR General Circular No. 139 dated August 30, 1952, which
revoked it (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 5; pars. 19, 28, stipulation).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the defendant claimed that it should
not be taxed for its war losses in the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,770,160.38</span>
by virtue of BIR General Circular No. V-123, the plaintiff insisted that the
defendant was liable because that circular was revoked by BIR General Circular
No. 139 and the defendant did not claim the war losses as deduction from its
income tax in the 1950 income tax return, and deductions not made on the date
when they should be de­ducted could not be deducted in another year.</blockquote>

required to make payment on February 29, 1956, of the deficiency income tax in
the sum of P116<span class="GramE">,294.00</span>, it should not be charged

liable for 5% surcharge in the amount of P5,814.70.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The total of these two amounts is P12<span class="GramE">,792.34</span> which the defendant should pay to the plaintiff, instead

<p class="BODY">The State's position is that since General Circular V-123 dated
September 18, 1951 which permitted property owners to include war losses
suffered by them as deduction in their income tax returns for the year 1950 was
revoked by BIR General Circular No. 139 dated August 30, 1952, and since the
Bank had failed to claim its war losses as deductions from its income tax in
the year of actual loss or destruction, the same could not be deducted in
another year or during the <span style="">taxable </span>years
