				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Upon rendition on December 11, 1946 by the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,
presided by his Honor, then Judge <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos, of its judgment imposing upon the accused
Rafael <span class="SpellE">Banguey</span> and <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Signaoa</span> the supreme penalty of death for Robbery with
homicide and physical injuries, said accused presented their appeal on the
ground that the judgment was contrary to the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records of the case were received by the
Clerk on <st1:date year="1947" day="3" month="2">February 3, 1947</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1947" day="19" month="2"><span style="">F</span>ebruary
 19, 1947</st1:date>, the Clerk was informed that said accused had escaped on <st1:date year="1947" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1947</st1:date> from the provincial
jail of <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, through negligence of the guards.</p>

<p class="BODY">Their counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>, <span class="SpellE">Alejandrino</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>, failed to
file a brief for appellants, since he had been relieved as counsel by the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> families and he had been appointed in the meantime
as justice of the peace for <span style="">Cervantes, </span><span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, per his manifestation
of <st1:date year="1947" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1947</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court appointed Atty. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Menan</span>dro</span> <span class="SpellE">Quiogue</span>
as the counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>, but on <st1:date year="1947" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1947</st1:date>, granted his petition
for suspension of the proceedings pending apprehension of the
accused-appellants, in deference to his wish to confer with them in connection
with the proposed brief on their behalf.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">From the periodic inquiries since then made by the Clerk to the
Chief, Philippine Constabulary, the Constabulary Provin­cial Commander and the
Provincial Warden at <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span>, the last of which was on <st1:date year="1968" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1968</st1:date>, it is now evident
that the efforts of the Constabulary to determine the whereabouts and effect
the apprehension of the accused-appellants have met with negative results.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether the accused have continued with a
life of crime or have somehow been meted out the fate decreed by the lower
court is for the law enforcement authorities to eventually deter­mine.</p>

<p class="BODY">The escape of the accused does not relieve the Court of the
burden of automatically reviewing the case, in the same man­ner that a
withdrawal of appeal by a death convict would not remove the case from the
jurisdiction of the Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, the Court will no longer permit the case to remain further in its docket
and will proceed to discharge its task of passing upon the cause <u>en</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>consulta</u></span> and reviewing the facts and the law as
applied thereto by the trial court, and determining the propriety of its
imposition of the death penalty.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The case as to the first four named accused, namely, Fernando
Cornelio, Mauricio Cornelia <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> Rivera and
Mariano Vicente was provisionally dismissed on August 30, 1946 on petition of
the fiscal, since they were at large.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Trial pro­ceeded expeditiously as to the two remaining herein accused,
who were under detention, with two consecutive days of hearing on September 23
and 24, 1946, during which five witnesses, includ­ing two victims-eyewitnesses,
Paula Galicia and <span class="SpellE">Tranquilina</span> Galicia, testified for
the prosecution and six witnesses, includ­ing the two accused, testified for
the defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court thereafter rendered its decision of <span style="">Decem­</span>ber 11, 1946, finding the
following facts to have been proven from the evidence of record:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"that about midnight of January 12, 1946,
while <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Galicia, his brothers and other
relatives, who were then living with him in the Barrio of <span class="SpellE">Tablac</span>,
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Candon</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, were sleeping, they
were awakened by the shouts of 'MP's, MP's, MP's'; and presently six <span style="">persons, </span>who were identified by the
aid of moonlight and a lamp that was burning then, rushed into the house at the
command of Rafael <span class="SpellE">Banguey</span> who ordered his companions
to 'go ahead'; that except Mariano Vicente, whose arm was not identified, the
other men were all armed as follows:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rafael <span class="SpellE">Banguey</span>, who appeared to be the leader,
had a bolo; Fernando Cornelio, another bolo; Mauri­cio Cornelio, a rifle; <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> Rivera, a 'short firearm', pre­sumably a pistol or
revolver; and <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Signaoa</span>,
a bolo; that once inside the house, Fernando Cornelio tied <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>
Galicia and with the help of Mariano Vicente took him away, while Rafael <span class="SpellE">Banguey</span> entered the room and with the aid of a flashlight
opened the trunk of <span class="SpellE">Tranquilina</span> Galicia, sister of <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Galicia, tak­ing away clothes valued at P60.00,
jewels at P120.00 and P180.00 in money; that <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Signaoa</span> opened the trunk of <span class="SpellE">Nar­ciso</span>
Galicia and took away clothes and money; and Mauricio Cornelio opened the trunk
of Paula Galicia, a niece of <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Galicia, and
took away clothes valued at P30.00, jewels at P70.00 and P90.00 in money; that
Mauricio Cornelia after hav­ing asked <span class="SpellE">Tranquilina</span>
Galicia for more money and on being ans­wered that she did not have anymore,
maltreated her; and <span class="SpellE">Valen­tin</span> Rivera, after having
been told by Paula that she did not have any other valuables except those that
were contained in her trunk, shot her on the right knee with a .45 caliber
firearm causing a wound which took thirty days to heal with incapacity to labor
for the same period of time; that a short while after the robbers had left the
premises, gun shots were heard and later, about three hours after the robbery,
the body of <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Galicia, already dead, was found
in the rice field about 200 meters from the said house and on the cadaver the
following wounds were found, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
the left ear was cut at the root; (2) one gun-shot wound on the right breast 3
inches above the right mamma perfo­rating the <span class="SpellE">pectoralis</span>
muscle and making its exit at the center of the armpit burning the posterior
wall of the armpit and also the skin of the inner side of the upper 3rd of the
arm; and, (3) a gun shot wound entering the left lumber region between the
first left floating rib and the 9th left rib and 5 inches from the spinal col­umn,
penetrating the abdominal cavity and perforating the stom­ach and transverse
colon and making its exit at 2 inches above the umbilicus, a little to the
right; that near the corpse were clothes newly ironed and folded, belonging to
said deceased; that at the premises around the house of <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>
Galicia there were several kinds of footprints which, upon further
investigation, were identified on the road passing near the place where his
corpse was found and leading to a '<span class="SpellE">bulala</span>' tree in
the interior of Barrio <span class="SpellE">Pila</span>, <span class="SpellE">Banayoyo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, from which the
house of Raf­ael <span class="SpellE">Banguey</span> is only about 15 meters
distant and that of <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Signaoa</span>,
a little more than 20 meters; that the accused, at the time of the commission
of the crime, were living at the said bar­rio about a kilometer from the house
of the <span class="SpellE">Galicias</span>; that before leaving the house, they
(malefactors) told the inmates not to di­vulge about the incident, otherwise
they would all be killed; that the two women (Paula and <span class="SpellE">Tranquilina</span>)
must have been virtually knocked out of their senses due to what had taken
place the night before and from fear of the threat of the accused, who were
agents of the guerrillas and were practically terrorizing the vic­inity during
the Japanese occupation, that when the agents of the law came early on the
morning of the following day they found Paula and <span class="SpellE">Tranquilina</span>
still trembling crossing their arms and did not want to declare as to what had
happened."</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court rejected the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
defense of alibi thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Rafael <span class="SpellE">Banguey</span> tried to prove through his testimony and that of
his wife and a niece-in-law that in the night of January 12, 1946 he was in his
house, he having gone to sleep as early as eight o'clock, and that at midnight
of the same date he was found to be still sleeping by his wife <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> Rivera and Elena Corazon (his wife's niece) who went
to sleep late that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering
that his witnesses are his wife and a near relative, both having a natural
desire to testify in his favor, and the fact that they had no means of
determining accurately the time, little weight, if any at all, could be given
to their testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His defense of alibi
is not sufficient to overthrow the evidence of the prosecu­tion; for,
considering the short distance between the house of the said accused and that where
the robbery was committed, he could have easily gone out and returned after the
two women went to sleep without having been noticed by them (People v. <span class="SpellE">Resabal</span>, 50 Phil. 780).</p>

<p class="BODY">"As to the defense of alibi put up by the accused <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Signaoa</span>, the same cannot
hold water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony and that of
his wife is not corroborated by a disinterested person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would have been easy for him to have one,
if there were any at all, who then saw him in the Army Camp at <span class="SpellE">Libtong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tagudin</span>, to corrobo­rate
his testimony that during the night in question he was there with his brother
and never left the place during the said period of time (People v. <span class="SpellE">Pili</span>, 51 Phil. 965).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And even if he had been to his brother's camp, as he averred, he could
have come back anytime and without being noticed to his house in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Pila</span> to join the gang as the distance is not very far and
there were then available transportation facilities anytime of the day between
the said camp and the '<span class="SpellE">poblacion</span>' of <span class="SpellE">Candon</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, finding that there was no evidence that the band
of robbers was formed "for the purpose of committing robbery in the
highway, or kidnapping persons for the purpose of extortion or to obtain
ransom, or for any other purpose to be attained by force and violence" as
defined by Article 306 of the Revised Penal Code, found that the crime
committed by the accused was not brigandage with murder, "but that of the
complex crime of robbery with homicide and physical injuries, as defined and
pen­alized under Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code." It found the
crime to have been committed with five aggravating circumstances and no
mitigating circumstances, as follows:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"for having been committed 'by a band', there being, at least, five
armed men who acted together in the commission of the crime; night time, as the
accused, living at only a kilometer from the house of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Galicia, took advantage of the same to commit the
crime with greater facility or impunity to themselves; dwelling of the offended
party, robbery having been committed in the abode of the victims, treachery, <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Gali­cia having been tied and later killed by a gun
shot fired at his back (U. S. vs. Santos, 1 Phil. 222); and, uninhabited place,
said <span class="SpellE">Nar­ciso</span> Galicia having been taken away to a
field, about 200 meters from the nearest inhabited place, his own house, where
he had no chance of being helped or seen by another person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty prescribed for this complex crime
by Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code is from Reclusion <span class="SpellE">Perpetua</span>
to Death; and, as there are no mitigating circumstances to counteract all the
aggravating circumstances found to exist in the commission thereof, the maximum
penalty should be imposed"; and consequently handed down the following
verdict:</p>

<blockquote>'WHEREFORE, the Court imposes upon the accused, RAFAEL BANGUEY and
MATIAS SIGNAOA, the penalty of DEATH, plus the accessories of the law; to
indemnify, jointly and severally, the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>
Galicia the sum of <span style="">P2,</span>000.00; to
indemnify, jointly and severally, Paula Galicia and <span class="SpellE">Tranquilina</span>
Galicia the amounts of P190.00, and P360.00, respectively, these last two
amounts being the sum total of the money and value of their belongings taken
away by the accused; and, each of them, to pay one-sixth (1/6) of the
costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the absence of a brief for the accused with assignment of
errors or of a similar brief by the Solicitor-General, the Court has taken it
upon itself, as in <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Molijon</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
to carefully examine the testimonial and documentary evidence in an analytical
light and determine whether the trial court committed any error in the
appreciation thereof to the prejudice of the accused and in the application of
the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has thus satisfied itself of the correctness of the
conclusions and judgment of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the trial, defense counsel concentrated his efforts in his
cross-examination of the two victims - eye witnesses - Paula Galicia, 21-year
old niece of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Galicia, and <span class="SpellE">Tranquilina</span> Galicia, 45-year old sister of the said
deceased - on seeking to discredit their positive identification of the accused
by bringing out the fact that these victims did not immediately divulge the
names of the accused and their companions to the police authorities and did so
only in their sworn statements of February 6, 1946 and February 7, 1946 which
were submitted by the chief of police of <span class="SpellE">Candon</span> with
his criminal complaint for murder filed on February 12, 1946 with the justice
of the peace court.</p>

<p class="BODY">These victims, however, readily explained that they were in fear
for their lives, as the malefactors had threatened to kill them if they were to
report the crime to the authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused and their companions had treated the two women roughly and brutally,
boxing twice <span class="SpellE">Tranquilina's</span> face when they could not
get any more money from her and abruptly shooting Paula through the right knee
upon her telling them also that she had no more money.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
They had taken away <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>, tied his hands behind
and then mercilessly shot him at his back.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The women knew the malefactors well, as they used to go to their barrio,
and were known to be "SS" or the ones who ruled over the barrio
people as agents of the guerrillas in the mountains.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
As <span class="SpellE">Tranquilina</span> put it, "I did not reveal the
identity of the accused because I was thinking of what the accused told us that
they would kill all of us including the children"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>,
and it was later on February 6, 1946, after the MP's had assured them of
protection "that I was able to make up my mind to have the authorities protect
us and bring the matter to the authorities."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: white;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That the two women were cringing in mortal fear and could not
even talk right after the crime was testified to as part of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span>
furthermore by the chief of police, <span class="SpellE">Romualdo</span> de
Castro, who recounted that when he went early in the morning of January 13,
1946, to the house of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>,
"Paula Galicia could not talk because she was groaning" and "<span class="SpellE">Tranquilina</span> Galicia was trembling like a mad woman and I
could not talk to her."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The initial fears of the two victims-witnesses in divulging the
identities of the accused until they were able to overcome them and gather
