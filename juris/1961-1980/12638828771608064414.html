<p class="BODY">In retrospect, it appears that on <st1:date year="1956" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1956</st1:date>, defendants sold to plaintiffs, under a <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u>de</u> <u>retro</u> sale, a parcel of land

agreement to spell out the manner in which they will share in the harvest of
standing <span class="SpellE">palay</span> crop, the pertinent portions of which
read as follow:</p>

<blockquote>“1<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That</span> on May 4, 1956, the Party of the

<span class="SpellE">Minalabac</span>, containing an area of 31.3019, the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There was an initial harvest
of 127.95 cavanes of palay from the land in question pertaining to the owner's
share, </span>up <span style="">to </span><st1:date year="1957" day="30" month="9"><span style="">September
 30, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were divided equally between plaintiffs
and defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, a second
harvest of 105 <span class="SpellE">cavanes</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>,
as the owner's share, was realized, which defendants appropriated for
themselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plaintiffs, claiming
entitlement to the one-half share </span>of the harvest from the Land in
question made after September 30, 1957--which defendants, as vendors <u>a</u> <u>retro</u>,
refused to deliver to <span style="">them--as vendees <u>a</u>
<u>retro</u>- filed, on December </span>27, 1957 <span style="">a Complaint for Specific Performance with the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, praying
that defendants be ordered to deliver their one-half share from the harvest or
its equivalent value.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants, on the other hand, insist that their obli­gation to
share with plaintiffs the harvest from the land in question was with respect
only to the harvest made in September, 1957, and that with regard to the
harvest made thereafter, they were no longer obliged to share the same with
plaintiffs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 29, 1964, the lower Court rendered judgment ordering
defendants to deliver to plaintiffs one-half of the 105 <span class="SpellE">cavanes</span>
of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> harvested after September, 1957, or the
equivalent value thereof at the rate of P11.50 per <span class="SpellE">cavan</span>,
or the amount of Six Hundred Three Pesos and Seventy-five Centavos (P603.75).</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this appeal by defendants to the Court of Appeals on
February 1, 1965, on the following Assignment of Errors:</p>

<blockquote>“I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE <span style="">LOWER
COURT </span>ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE PLAINTIFFS' RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE
HARVEST IN QUESTION IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE PALAY WAS PLANTED BY THEM IN
JUNE <span style="">1957 </span>AND <span style="">THEREFORE </span>THEY HAVE A <span style="">RIGHT TO PAR­TICIPATE IN </span>THE HARVEST
THEREOF WHETHER THEY ARE GATHERED IN SEPTEMBER <span style="">1957 </span>OR THEREAFTER; <span style="">and<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“II.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE
</span>LOWER COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE DEFENDANTS-APPELLANTS HAVE <span style="">STILL OBLIGATION TO DELIVER </span>TO THE
PLAINTIFFS THE REMAINING ONE-HALF <span style="">OF 105
</span>CAVANES OF PALAY <span style="">AS </span>OWNER'S SHARE HARVESTED FROM THE REPURCHASE(D) PROPERTY AFTER
SEPTEMBER 1957."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing take issue with the following findings of the lower
Court:</p>

<blockquote>"The court therefore is of the opinion and so holds that the
real basis of the plain­tiffs' right to participate in the harvest is the fact
that the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> was planted by them in June, 1957,
therefore, they have the right to participate in the harvest thereof whether
they were gathered in September or thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is clear that the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> was planted on the
land in June 1957 when the plaintiffs were still the owner of the same and
which was only repurchased by the defendants on August 2, 1957 while the fruits
of the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> were not yet <span style="">ripe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Hence, <span style="">whether </span>the <span class="SpellE">palay</span>
was harvested in <span style="">Sep­</span>tember 1957
or thereafter, the plaintiffs have the right to participate in the owner's
share thereof because the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> <span class="GramE">plants
from where it was harvested in September was</span> planted during the month of
June when the plaintiffs were still the owner of the same."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Defendants contend that
Article 1617 of the Civil Code applies to the sharing arrangement between them
and the plain­tiffs with respect to the fruits existing on the land in question
at the time of repurchase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 1617
reads thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"ART. 1617.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If at the time
of the exe­cution of the sale there should be on the land, visible or growing
fruits, there shall be no reimbursement for or<span style=""> </span>prorating of those exist­ing at the time of redemption if no
indemnity was paid by the purchaser when the sale was executed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Should there have been no fruits at the time of the sale, and
same exist at the time of redemption, they shall be prorated between the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span> and the vendee, giving the latter the <span style="">part </span>corresponding to the time he
possessed the land the last year, counted from the anniversary date of the
sale."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The same is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Article 1617 of the Civil Code is not applicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same applies only when the parties have
not provided for their sharing arrangement with respect to the fruits existing
at the time of redemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case
at bar, the Agreement dated August 2, 1957, specifically provided that the
parties would share equally the net harvest of the <span class="SpellE">palay</span>
planted on the land in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
said Agreement is not contrary to law, morals or public policy, the same is,
there­fore, binding on the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the learned trial judge that plaintiffs have the
right to participate in the harvest made even after the month of September,
1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> was planted on the land in question in June when
plaintiffs--vendees <u>a</u> <u><span style="">retro</span></u><span style="">-- </span>were still the <span style="">owners, since </span>the
same was repurchased by defendants-vendors <u>a</u> <u><span style="">retro</span></u><span style=""> </span>on
August 2, 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>September mentioned in
the Agreement of August 2, 1957 was the month which the parties reckoned the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> planted in June would be harvested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Thus, the phrase
"sometime in September 1957".</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was not, therefore, meant to limit the right of the plaintiffs to
participate in the harvest of the crop planted in June.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision appealed from is hereby affirmed <u>in</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against defendants-appellants.</span></p>
