				<BR><BR><div align=""><div class="Section1"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On November 14, 1960, the 
petitioner herein, <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> Packing Corporation and the 
respondent Reparations Commission, entered into a 'Contract of Conditional 
Purchase and Sale" of Capital Goods, the pertinent portions of which are as 
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Date of Complete Delivery— April 
5, 1960<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Total F. O. B. Cost—P1<span class="GramE">,357,194.67</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Amount of First Installment (10% 
F. O. B. cost)—P135<span class="GramE">,712.47</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Due date of 1st Installment— 
<i>April 5, 1962</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Ten (10) equal 
yearly installments."</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Under these terms, were listed 
the dates when the remaining ten (10) yearly installments were due, the 1st 
installment on said ten (10) yearly installments being <i>April 5, 1963, in the 
amount</i> of P143<span class="GramE">,186.78</span>, until April 5, with 3% 
interest on the balance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The contract, specially that 
which requires the payment of the first installment (apparently a <i>down 
payment</i>) equivalent to 10% of the total purchase price, to be made on April 
5, 1962, is in accordance with the provisions of Section 14, B-3 of the Rules 
and Regulations of the <span class="GramE">respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span></span> Reparations Commission, promulgated pursuant 
to Republic Act No. 1780, which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Capital Goods 
and Services—Sales on Installment Basis.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"* * *. Sales on credit shall be 
payable in installments, the first installment shall be paid within 24 months 
after complete delivery of the capital goods and the balance to be paid in equal 
3'eajly installments within a period not exceeding 10 years * * 
*.”<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The parties have expressly bound 
themselves to make the above provision of the Rules and Regulations, applicable 
to the contract.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Before the date of the 1st 
payment, the amount of which was P135<span class="GramE">,712.47</span> (10% of 
the total cost), respondent wrote petitioner a reminder, dated March 8, 1962, 
although the due date was mistakenly stated as March 21, 1962. On March 20, 
1962, petitioner filed an action for declaratory relief, before the CFI of 
Manila, asking for an interpretation of the contract, specially that portion as 
to when should it pay the 1st payment and/or installment In the complaint, it 
was alleged that petitioner did not know <i>when</i> exactly to make payment and 
<i>how</i> much, since the contract itself contains two (2) dates of payment of 
1st installment and two (2) different amounts to be paid. A writ of preliminary 
injunction was also prayed for, <span class="SpellE">allegjng</span> that a 
misconstruction of the contract will cause "Separable damage to the 
petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Respondent, after admitting and 
denying the allegations in the complaint, interposed various defenses, all of 
which tended to show that no other interpretation could be given to the terms of 
the contract; that the contract itself is clear that the 1st payment should be 
made on April 5, 1962, in the amount of P135,712.47, which was the 10% on the 
total contract price; that petitioner had not shown a clear right to the 
issuance of the writ of injunction; and that it has not exhausted all the 
administrative remedies provided for by law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On October 8, 1962, the date of 
the hearing, respondent verbally moved for the dismissal of the action. On 
October 9, 19G2, the CFI of Manila handed down an Order, the pertinent portions 
of which read:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"At the hearing, counsel for the 
respondent verbally moved for the dismissal of the petition on the ground that 
there is now pending in this Court, but assigned to another branch, a civil 
action which the Reparations Commission filed against the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> Packing Corporation and the <span class="SpellE">Fieldmen's</span> Insurance Co., Inc. (Civil Cafe No. 51713, filed 
on Sept. 27, 1962) for the recovery of the sum of P135,712.47, representing the 
first payment, without interest, on the purchase price of the reparations goods 
acquired by the first therein named defendant (herein petitioner), which was 
equivalent to 10% of the F.O.B. cost and due as of April 5, 1962. To said motion 
counsel for the petitioner interposed an objection and contended that the 
instant petition for declaratory relief is a prejudicial question to the said 
civil action and for this reason this case should not be 
dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The construction of the contract 
entered into between the herein parties, in the opinion of the Court, <i>is no 
longer necessary. This is so because the subject matter of the present petition 
would necessarily be threshed out in Civil Case No. 51713 of this Court, wherein 
the question at issue is whether or not the sum P135,712.47, which the plaintiff 
therein (respondent in this ease) seeks to recover, was tine and demandable as 
of April 5, 1962</i> * * *.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Moreover, the <span class="SpellE">Fieldmen's</span> Insurance Co., Inc., which executed a performance 
bond, guaranteeing the faithful observance and compliance by the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> Packing Corporation of the terms and conditions of 
the contract of "Conditional Purchase and Sale of Reparations Goods," was not 
joined as a party to the present action, although it has an interest in the 
subject matter thereof and would necessarily be affected by any declaration that 
may rendered therein. The non-<span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of said bonding 
company would deprive the declaratory judgment of the final and pacifying 
function it was calculated to <span class="SpellE">subserve</span> (* * 
*).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In the light of the foregoing 
circumstances, the Court, in the exercise of the discretion vested in it by the 
Rules of Court, deems it unnecessary and improper to construe the contract in 
question (Sec. 6, Rule 66 of the Rules of Court).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">“Wherefore, the petition for 
declaratory relief is hereby dismissed, without any pronouncement as to 
costs.”<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> Packing Corporation brought the matter directly to 
this Court, on a lone assignment of error—the propriety of the dismissal of its 
complaint for a declaratory relief on the contract.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The lower court was correct in 
dismissing the petition. Under the circumstances obtaining then, such as the 
institution of the case for the recovery and/or collection of the <i>1st 
payment</i> of April 5, 1962, for the sum of P135,712.47, the declaration sought 
to be made in the case, would be a mere <span class="SpellE">surplusage</span>. 
The collection case instituted by respondent Reparations Commission would 
necessarily go into the merits and or interpretation of the whole contract. In 
addition, <span class="GramE">We</span> are also of the opinion that there was 
nothing to interpret in the contract. The terms thereof, are clear. In fact, the 
trial court in Civil Case No. 51713, in its decision dated March 27, 1963 
said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The main issue in this case is 
the interpretation of the schedule of payments* * *. The plaintiff contends, * * 
* the first payment for the reparation goods obtained by defendant <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> backing Corporation is P135<span class="GramE">,712.47</span>, which became due on April 5, 1962. On the other 
hand, the defendants contend that the first installment is P143<span class="GramE">,186.78</span> and will became due on April 5, 1963. The Court is 
inclined to interpret the schedule of payments * * * in consonance with the 
contention of plaintiff for the reason that, under Sec. 12 of Rip. Act 1789, 
reparation goods are to be paid in eleven (11) payments, the first one within 
twenty-four (24) months after complete delivery and the balance in ten years or 
in ten (10) installments and Exhibit A-l provides for eleven payments, whereas. 
<span class="GramE">under</span> the interpretation of the defendants there would 
be only ten payments in all, contrary to Sec. 12 of Rep. Act No. 1789, which 
provides in effect for eleven payments.<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">* * * * * * * 
*<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The above is a clear and explicit 
connotation of the terms of the contract sought to be interpreted, and this 
Court agrees with such observations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: Verdana;">In 
view of the foregoing</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the order appealed from should 
be, as it is hereby affirmed in all respects, with costs against petitioner 
<span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> Packing Corporation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Bengzon</span></i></span><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, C. J., Bautista Angelo, Reyes,
