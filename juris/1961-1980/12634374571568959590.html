				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This petition for <i><i>certiorari</i></i> and prohibition with urgent prayer for preliminary injunction questions the alleged grave abuse of dis­cretion committed by the then Presiding Judge of the Court of Indus­trial Relations (Judge Arsenio I. Martinez), contained in the Order dated April 11, 1967 in Certification Election Case No. 91-MC-ILO,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> ordering the canvassing of the election results to be deferred and not acting on the same upon the submission of the election returns, contrary to the resolution of the CIR <i>en banc</i> dated March 14, 1967, with dispositive portion, to wit:<br><blockquote>"IN VIEW THEREOF, it is the sense of this Court that this certification election shall continue until terminated with the actual canvassing to be de­ferred, however, and the minutes of the balloting and the ballot boxes themselves to remain under seal until further order from this Court and more particularly up to the time the Supreme Court shall have decided on the petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br>"So Ordered."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>Pertinent undisputed facts are as follows:<br><br>Claiming a majority representation among the workers in the Central Azucarera De La Carlota, respondent Associated Labor Union (ALU) filed on July 20, 1966, a petition for certification elections with the then Court of Industrial Relations (CIR Case No. 91-MC-Iloilo).&nbsp; Petitioner National Sugar Workers Union (NASWU­-PAFLU) answered the petition on August 6, 1966.&nbsp; At the hearing of the case, both parties agreed on the composition of the bargaining unit and the list of eligible voters.&nbsp; Presiding Judge Arsenio I. Martinez issued the order dated January 28, 1967, granting the petition and requesting the Department of Labor to conduct the certification election with the contending unions NASWU-PAFLU and ALU.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Not satisfied with the foregoing order, respondent ALU filed a motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The ALU also filed a motion to suspend the certification elections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The Court of Industrial Relations <i><i>en banc</i></i> issued a resolution dated February 18, 1967, sus­pending the scheduled certification elections until the resolution of the pending motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On March 14, 1967, the CIR <i>en banc</i> issued its resolution denying respondent ALU's motion for reconsideration and lifting the suspension of the certification elections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The Department of Labor, through the Bureau of Labor Relations, scheduled the certification elections for April 3, 1967, subsequently reset for April 11, 1967 upon motion of respondent ALU.<br><br>On April 9, 1967, respondent ALU sought an injunction from the CIR <i>en banc</i> to suspend the certification elections scheduled for April 11, 1967, on the ground that respondent ALU brought by way of <i>certiorari</i> to this Court an appeal to the resolution of the CIR denying its motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Although the respondent ALU's motion to suspend the certification elections was addressed to the CIR <i>en banc</i>, respondent Pre­siding Judge Arsenio I.&nbsp; Martinez issued the controverted order of April 11, 1967, allowing the elections but stopping the canvassing of the results thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The Department of Labor election supervisors suspended the canvassing of the election results as a result of that order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The only issue in this case, whether or not respondent Presiding Judge committed grave abuse of discretion when he issued the controverted order dated April 11, 1967, has become moot and academic, when this Court in its resolution of May 19, 1967, in G.R. No. L-27382, acting upon the urgent motion filed by the Central Azucarera De la Carlota, respondent in that case and in this case, ordered the respondent Court of Industrial Relations to allow the counting of the ballots cast in that certification elections and to immediately report the results to the Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> This Court dismissed the petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition in G.R. No. L-27382, for being moot and academic, considering the lapse of time, that the management of the Central Azucarera De La Carlota and the employees had not taken any further action and further, that even the Court of Industrial Relations had been abolished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, for the same reasons, this petition is likewise dismissed for being moot and academic.&nbsp; Without costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Barredo, (Chairman), Abad Santos</i>, and <i>De Castro, JJ.</i>, concur. <br><i>Aquino, J.</i>, see concurrence.<br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> pp. 35-36, <i>rollo</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Annex "J" to Petition; p. 36, <i>rollo</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> pp. 16-19, <i>rollo</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> pp. 20-24, <i>Id</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> pp. 25-26, <i>Id</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> p. 27, <i>Id</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> pp. 29-30, <i>Id</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> G.R.
