				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of
Manila, dissolving the "U.P. Construction Company" and ordering the
defendant Bartolome Puzon to pay the plaintiff the amounts of: (1) P115,102.13,
with legal interest there­on from the date of the filing of the complaint until
fully paid; (2) P200,000.00, as plaintiff's share in the unrealized profits of
the "U.P. Construction Company" and (3) P5,000.00, as and for
attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is of record that the defendant Bartolome Puzon had a contract
with the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>

Bartolome Puzon sought the financial assistance of the plaintiff, William
Uy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As an inducement, Puzon proposed the
creation of a part­nership between them which would be the sub-contractor of
the projects and the profits to be divided equally between them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>William Uy inspected the projects in question
and, expecting to derive considerable profits therefrom, agreed to the
proposition, thus resulting in the formation of the "U. P. Construction
Company"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> which was subsequently engaged as

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The partners agreed that
the capital of the partnership would be P100,000.00 of which each partner shall
contribute t</span>he amount of P50,000.00 in cash.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
But, as heretofore stated, Puzon was short of cash and he promised to con­tribute
his share in the partnership capital as soon as his application for a loan with
the Philippine National Bank in the amount <span style="">of </span><span style="">P150,000.00 </span><span style="">shall </span>have
been approved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How­ever, before his loan
application could be acted upon, he had to clear his collaterals of its
encumbrances first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this purpose, on
October <span style="">24, 1956, </span>William Uy
gave Bar­tolome Puzon the amount of P10,000.00 as advance contri<span style="">bution of his share in the partnership to be
organized be­</span>tween them under the firm name U.P. CONSTRUCTION COMPANY
which amount mentioned above will be used by Puzon to pay his obligations with
the Philippine National Bank to effect the release of his mortgages with the
said Bank.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1956" day="29" month="10">October <span style="">29, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>William

Puzon promised William Uy that the <span style="">amount

contribution of William Uy which the said Uy had advanced to clear the title of
Puzon's property; P50,000.00, as Puzon's contribution to the partnership; and
the balance of P60,000.00 as Puzon's personal loan to the partnership.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

the parties on <st1:date year="1957" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1957</st1:date>,
work on the projects was started by the partnership on <st1:date year="1956" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1956</st1:date> in view of the insistence of the

<p class="BODY">The loan of Puzon was approved by the Philippine National Bank in
November, 1956 and he gave to William Uy the amount of P60,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of this amount, P40,000.00 was for the
reimbursement of Uy's contribution to the part­nership which was used to clear
the title to Puzon's pro­perty, and the P20,000.00 as Puzon's contribution to
the<span style=""> partnership capital.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To guarantee the repayment of the above-mentioned loan, Bartolome
Puzon, without the knowledge and consent of William Uy,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
assigned to the Philippine National Bank all the payments to be received on
account of the contracts with the Bureau of Public Highways for the
construction of the aforementioned projects.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
By virtue <span style="">of </span>said assignment,
the Bureau of Public Highways paid the money due on the partial accomplishments
on the government projects in question to the Philippine National Bank which,
in turn, applied portions of it in payment of Puzon's loan. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Of the amount of P1,047,181.07, released by
the Bureau of Public Highways in payment of the partial work completed by the
partnership on the projects, the amount of P332,539.60 <span style="">was applied in payment of Puzon's loan and only the amount of
P27,820.80 was deposited in the partnership funds,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>which, for all practical purposes,
was also under Puzon's account since Puzon was the custodian of the common
funds.</p>

<p class="BODY">As time passed and the financial demands of the pro­jects
increased, William Uy, who supervised the said pro­jects, found difficulty in
obtaining the necessary funds with which to pursue the construction
projects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>William Uy cor­respondingly
called on Bartolome Puzon to comply with his obligations under the terms of
their partnership agreement and to place, at least, his capital contribution at
the dis­posal of the partnership.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Despite several promises, Puzon, however, failed to do so.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Realizing that his verbal demands were to no avail, William Uy consequently
wrote<span style=""> Bartolome Puzon formal letters of
demand,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> to which </span>Puzon replied that he is
unable to put in additional capital<span style=""> to
continue with the projects.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Failing to reach an agreement with William Uy, Bar­tolome Puzon,
as prime contractor of the construction projects, wrote the sub-contractor,
U.P. Construction Company, on November 20, 1957, advising the partnership, of <span style="">which he is also a partner, that unless they
presented an immediate solution and capacity to prosecute the work effec­tively,
he would be constrained to consider the sub-contract terminated and,
thereafter, to assume all responsibilities in the construction of the projects
in accordance with his original contract with the Bureau of Public High ways.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> On </span><st1:date year="1957" day="27" month="11"><span style="">November 27, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="">, Bartolome Puzon again wrote the U.P.
Construction Company finally terminating their sub-contract agreement as of </span><st1:date year="1957" day="1" month="12"><span style="">December
 1, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, William Uy was not allowed to hold office in the U.P.
Construction Company and his authority to deal with the Bureau of Public
Highways in behalf of the partnership was revoked by Bartolome Puzon who
constinued with the construction projects alone.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1958" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1958</st1:date>,
William Uy, claiming that Barto­lome Puzon had violated the terms of their
partnership agreement, instituted an action in court, seeking, <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u>,
the dissolution of the partnership and payment of damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Answering, Bartolome Puzon denied that he violated the terms of
their agreement claiming that it was the plain­tiff, William Uy, who violated
the terms thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, like­wise, prayed
for the dissolution of the partnership and for the payment by the plaintiff of
his share in the losses suf­fered by the partnership.</p>

<p class="BODY">After appropriate proceedings, the trial court found that the
defendant, contrary to the terms of their partner­ship agreement, failed to
contribute his share in the capital of the partnership; applied partnership
funds to his personal use; ousted the plaintiff from the management of the firm
and caused the failure of the partnership to realize the expected profits of at
least P400,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, the
trial court dismissed the defendant's counterclaim and ordered the dissolution
of the partnership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court
further ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum of P320,103.13.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant appeal by the defendant Bartolome Puzon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the pendency of the appeal before this
Court, the said Bartolome Puzon died, and was substituted by Franco Puzon.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant makes in
his brief nineteen (19) assign­ments of errors, involving questions of fact,
which relates to the following points:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">(1) That the appellant is not guilty of breach of con­tract; and</p>

<p class="NUM">(2) That the amounts of money the appellant has been ordered to
pay the appellee is not supported by the evidence and the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">After going over the record, we find no reason for re­jecting the
findings of fact below, justifying the reversal of the decision appealed from.</p>

<p class="BODY">The findings of the trial court that the appellant failed to
contribute his share in the capital of the partnership is clearly
incontrovertible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that
after the appellant's loan in the amount of P150,000.00 was approved by the
Philippines National Bank in November, 1955, he gave the amount of P60,000.00
to the appellee who was then managing the construction projects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of this amount, P40,000.00 was to be applied
as reimbursement of the ap­pellee's contribution to the partnership which was
used to clear the title to the appellant's property, and the balance<span style=""> of P20,000.00, as Puzon's contribution to
the partnership.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Thereafter, the appellant failed to make any
further contributions to the partnership funds as shown in his letters to the
appellee wherein he confessed his inability to put in additional capital to
continue with the projects.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, the claim of the appellant that the ap­pellee is
equally guilty of not contributing his share in the partnership capital
inasmuch as the amount of P40,000.00, allegedly given to him in October, 1956
as partial contribu­tion of the appellee is merely a personal loan of the appel­lant
which he had paid to the appellee, is plainly untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The terms of the receipts signed by the
appellant are clear and unequivocal that the sums of money given by the appel­lee
are appellee's partial contributions to the partnership capital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the receipt for P10,000.00 dated <st1:date year="1956" day="24" month="10">October<span style="">
 24, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the appellant stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

said William Uy to the U.P. CONSTRUCTION COMPANY</u> for which the un­dersigned
will use the said amount in pay­ment of his obligation to the Rehabilitation
Finance Corporation." (Underscoring ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The findings of the trial court that the appellant misapplied
partnership funds is, likewise, sustained by com<span style="">petent evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is of record
that the appellant assigned </span>to the Philippine National Bank all the
payments to be re<span style="">ceived on account of
the contracts with the Bureau of Pub­lic Highways for the construction of the
aforementioned pro­jects to guarantee the repayment of the appellant's personal
</span>loan with the said bank.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
By virtue of the said assign­ment, the Bureau of Public Highways paid the money
due on the partial accomplishments on the construction projects in question to
the Philippine National Bank who, in turn,<span style="">
applied portions of it in payment of the appellant's </span><span style="">loan.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant claims, however, that the said assign­ment was made
with the consent of the appellee and that the assignment did not prejudice the
partnership as it was reimbursed by the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">But, the appellee categorically stated that the assignment to the
Philippine National Bank was made without his prior knowledge and consent and
that when he learned of said as­signment, he called the attention of the
appellant who assured him that the assignment was only temporary as he would
transfer the loan to the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation <span style="">within three (3) months time.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The question of whom to believe being a matter largely dependent
on the trier's discretion, the findings of the trial court, who had the better
opportunity to examine and appraise the factual issue, certainly deserve
respect.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the assignment to the Philippine National Bank is
prejudicial to the partnership cannot be denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that during the period from
March, 1957 to September, 1959, the appellant Bartolome Puzon received from the
Bureau of Public Highways, in payment of the work accomplished on the
construction projects, the amount of P1,047,181.01, which amount rightfully and
legally belongs to the partnership by virtue of the subcontract agreements
between the appellant and the U.P. Construction Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the assign­ment made by Puzon to
the Philippine National Bank, the latter withheld and applied the amount of
P332,539.60 in payment of the appellant's personal loan with the said
bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The balance was deposited in
Puzon's current account and only the amount of P27,820.80 was deposited in the
current account of the partnership.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
For sure, if the appellant gave to the partnership all that were earned and due
it under the sub-contract agreements, the money would have been used as a safe
reserve for the discharge of all obli­gations of the firm and the partnership
would have been able to successfully and profitably prosecute the projects it
sub­contracted.</p>

<p class="BODY">When did the appellant make the reimbursement claimed by him?</p>

<p class="BODY">For the same period, the appellant actually disbursed for the
partnership, in connection with the construction projects, the amount of
P952,839.77.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
Since the appellant <span style="">received from the
Bureau of Public Highways the sum of P1,047,181.01, the appellant has a deficit
balance of P94,342.24.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant,
therefore, did not make com­plete restitution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The findings of the trial court that the appellee has been ousted
from the management of the partnership is also based upon persuasive
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellee testified that
after he had demanded from the appellant payment of the latter's contribution
to the partnership capital, the said appellant did not allow him to hold office
in the U.P. Construction Company and his authority to deal with the Bureau of
Public Highways was revoked by the appellant.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As the record stands, We cannot say, therefore, that the decision
of the trial court is not sustained by the evi­dence of record as to warrant
its reversal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the defendant-appellant was at fault, the trial court
properly ordered him to reimburse the plaintiff-appel­lee whatever amount the
latter had invested in or spent for the partnership on account of the
construction projects.</p>

<p class="BODY">How much did the appellee spend in the construction projects in
question?</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that although the partnership agreement stated that
the capital of the partnership is P100,000.00 of which each partner shall
contribute to the partnership <span style="">the
amount of P50,000.00 in cash,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the partners of the U.P. Construction

<blockquote>"To enhance defendant's theory that he should be credited with
P24,239.48, he pre­sented checks allegedly given to plaintiff and the latter's
brother, Uy Han, marked as Ex<span style="">hibits 2

said checks were not entered nor recorded in their books of account, as
expenses for and in behalf of the partnership or its affairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, Uy Han testified that some
of the checks he received were exchanged for cash, while others were used in
the purchase of spare parts requisitioned by defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This testimony was not refuted to the satis­faction
of the Court, considering that Han's explanation thereof is the more plausible,
because if they were employed in the prose­cution of the partnership projects,
the cor­responding disbursements would have certain­ly been recorded in its
books, which is not the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Taking
into account that defendant is the custodian of the books of account, his
failure to so enter therein the alleged dis­bursements, accentuates the falsity
of his claim on this point."</span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> <a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></a></span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Besides, as further noted by the trial court, the report of
Commissioner Ablaza is unreliable in view of his proclivity to favor the
appellant and because of the inac<span style="">curate

partnership, unlike Mr. Tayag's report which inspires faith and credence.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

expenses paid by the appellee out of his personal funds which had not been

<p class="BODY">At the trial, the appellee presented a claim for the amounts of
P3,917.39 and P4,665.00 which he also advanced for the construction projects
but which were not included in the Commissioner's Report.<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the award of P200,000.00 as his share in the unrealized
profits of the partnership, the appellant con­tends that the findings of the
trial court that the amount of P400,000.00 as reasonable profits of the
partnership ven­ture is without any basis and is not supported by the evi­dence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant maintains that the lower court,
in making its determination, did not take into consideration the great risks
involved in business operations involving as it does the completion of the
projects within a definite <span style="">period of
time, in the face of adverse and often unpredict­able circumstances, as well </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">the fact that the appellee, who was in charge of the projects in the
field, contributed in a large measure to the failure of the partnership to
realize such profits by his field management.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This argument must be overruled in the light of the law and
evidence on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Article
2200 of the Civil Code, indemnification for damages shall compre­hend not only
the value of the loss suffered, but also that of the profits which the obligee
failed to obtain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other<span style=""> words </span><u>lucrum</u> <u>cessans</u><span style=""> is also a basis for indemnification.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Has the appellee failed
to make profits because of appellant's breach of contract?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no doubt that the contracting business is a profitable
one and that the U.P. Construction Company derived some profits from its
sub-contracts in the con­struction of the road and bridges projects despite its
de­ficient working capital and the juggling of its funds by the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to the appellant's claim, the partnership showed some
profits daring the period from July 2, 1956 to December 31, 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the Profit and Loss Statement<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a>
showed a net loss of P134,019.43, this was primarily due to the confusing
accounting method employed by the auditor who intermixed the cash and accrual
method of accounting and the erroneous inclusion of certain items, like
personal expenses of the appellant and alleged extraordinary losses due to an
accidental plane crash, in the operating expenses of the partnership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Corrected, the Profit and Loss State­ment
would indicate a net profit of P41,611.28.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the period from January 1, 1958 to September 30, 1959, the
partnership admittedly made a net profit of P52,943.89.<a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, as We have heretofore pointed out, the appel­lant
received from the Bureau of Public Highways, in pay­ment of the construction
projects in question, the amount of <span style="">P1,047,181.01</span><a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and disbursed the amount of P952,839.77,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> leaving an unaccounted balance of
P94,342.24.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, this amount is
also part of the profits of the partnership.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">During the trial of this case, it was discovered that the
appellant had money and credits receivable from the projects in question, in
the custody of the Bureau of Pub­lic Highways, in the amount of P128,669.75, representing
<span style="">the 10% retention of said projects.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> After the trial of this case, it was shown
that the total retentions deducted from the appellant amounted to P145,358.00.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Surely, these retained amounts also form
part of the profits of the partnership.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Had </span>the appellant
not been remiss in his obligations as partner and as prime contractor of the
construction projects in question as he was bound to perform pursuant to the
partnership and sub-contract agreements, and con­sidering the fact that the
total contract amount of these two projects is P2,327,335.76, it is reasonable
to expect that the partnership would have earned much more than the P334,255.61
We have hereinabove indicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
award, therefore, made by the trial court of the amount of P200,000.00, as
compensatory damages, is not speculative, <span style="">but
</span>based on reasonable estimate.</p>

Mr. Tayag's testimony on this point reads:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 27pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">"Q<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We notice Mr. Tayag under the capital account
in your report, Commissioner's Report, you made adjustments in the form of
payrolls paid in 1956 to 1957 in the amount of P128,103.77, would you please
explain why you made such adjustment?</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 27pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">"A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I believe, I have already explained in my
comment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was examining the books
of the U.P. Construction Com­pany, I found out that the amount charge to
salaries and wages were remittances by telegraphic transfers to the Zamboanga
Office. In proper accounting, remittances should not have been entered as
salaries immediately because you don't know what disposition would be made
finally of the amount remitted, until the amounts are actually paid and covered
by payrolls in Zamboanga Office, nothing should be re­corded <span style="">as </span>salaries
and wage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, the remittances
should have been charged to the incharge or manager of the project or payroll
clerk as account receivable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the
particular payrolls are reported back to Manila, that is the time you enter the
actual amount paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because while the
remittances in round figures say P10,000.00, the actual payroll would not be
exactly that amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time of the
receipt of the payrolls, that is the only time the adjust­ment of salaries and
wages should be made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I asked the
personnel of the U.P. Con­struction Company whether there were pay­rolls in the
files.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was told that there were
payrolls but they would not release to me without permission from Mr. Puzon or
his attorney. So, I contacted Mr. Uy by telephone whether there were payrolls
or papers in the project site.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told
me that there were and that they were sent to Manila. As a proof, he brought to
me a list in detail containing the names of the employees by the month and the
amount received by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I returned
back to the office of Mr. Puzon, I inquired again whether the payrolls will be
lent to me. There was much delay and later on I under­stood that Mrs. Barrera
telephoned the attorney of Mr. Puzon, who agreed to re­lease the payrolls to
me. I checked over the list of Mr. Uy with the payrolls. I found out that the
amount corresponding to each employee in his list tally with those in the
payrolls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the payrolls most of them
were not in total.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So there was no way
of knowing the total amount in the pay­rolls.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I believe there is reasonable proof that those were the payrolls that
were paid by Mr. Uy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the reason
why I in­cluded in my Exhibit A the amount of P128,103.77.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 27pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">"Q<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do you have the list of the persons to whom

you found that they tally?</p>
