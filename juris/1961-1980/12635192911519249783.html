				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Petition for review of the decision of the
Court of Appeals, in its Case CA-G.</span> R. No. 29461-R, recognizing the <span class="SpellE">registerable</span> title of respondent Mariano <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> over certain parcels of land in <span class="SpellE">Mabitac</span>, Laguna, on the basis of an unsigned copy of a deed
of sale, the original of which was said to have been lost.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that on 16 June 1950, Mariano B. <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> filed in the Court of First Instance of Laguna an
application<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
for registration of his imperfect or incomplete title over five parcels of land
(Lots Nos. 461, 462, 463, 480 and 483, <span class="SpellE">Mabitac</span>
Cadastre) situated in <span class="SpellE">Mabitac</span>, Laguna, allegedly
acquired by actual, open, adverse and continuous occupation of the properties,
by himself and by his predecessors-in-interest since time immemorial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The application for registration was opposed by several parties,
specifically, (a) by the Director of lands, on the ground of applicant's lack
of <span class="SpellE">registerable</span> title; and (b) by Adriano <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span>, Martin Aguilar and Pedro Aguilar, as regard the
northern portion of Lot No. 463, for the reason that they were the actual
possessors thereof and had filed homestead applications <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
since 1935.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, the registration court rendered judgment declaring
applicant <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> to have established proprietary
rights over Lots Nos. 461, 462, 480, 483 and the southern portion of Lot No.
463; and ruling <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span>
and Aguilar brothers to have likewise proved their title as regard the northern
portion of Lot No. 463, with an area of 72 hectares.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> and the Director of Lands
appealed to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its
decision of <st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="7">11 July 1968</st1:date>,
the appellate court modified the judgment of the trial court, by recognizing <span class="SpellE">Raymundo's</span> <span class="SpellE">registerable</span> title,
not only over Lots Nos. 461, 462, 480, 483 and the southern portion of Lot No.
463 but even over the northern part of Lot No. 463 adjudicated to <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span> and Aguilar
brothers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Raymundo's</span>
claim over the whole Lot No. 463 was declared proved by a Deed of Absolute Sale
(Exhibit "E-1") dated August, 1936, covering 10 hectares, executed in
his favor by Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Olarte</span>, and by a deed of sale
(Exhibit "O") involving around 80 hectares, allegedly executed by
Mariano Castro on 18 September 1929.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Overruling the objection of the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> to
the admissibility of Exhibit "O", <span class="GramE">which is merely
an unsigned copy of the supposed deed, the Court of Appeals said:</span></p>

<blockquote>"………. However, applicant <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>
satisfactorily explained the presentation of said copy in lieu of the original
by proving that the original document together with other pertinent papers were
entrusted by him to his lawyer, Judge Mariano C. <span class="SpellE">Melendres</span>,
sometime before the war in connection with registration proceedings over the
said parcels of land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
these documents were burned during the last World War and no official copy
could be obtained from the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Mabitac</span>,
Laguna.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Exhibit K,
certification of Municipal Treasurer).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> was corroborated by
Judge <span class="SpellE">Melendres</span> on the witness stand when he declared
that he was indeed entrusted with the custody of these papers and that upon his
appointment to the Judiciary he turned over all these papers to a certain Atty.
<span class="SpellE">Facundo</span> San Agustin who was killed by the Japanese
during the war and no trace of the aforesaid documents has been found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>
submitted a receipt, duly signed by Mariano Castro attesting to the fact that
the latter received the amount of P100.00 as down payment on the purchase price
of the property sold by him to <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> on <st1:date year="1929" day="27" month="8">27 August 1929</st1:date> (Exhibit O-1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This receipt, taken in conjunction with the
copy of the deed of sale and the testimony of Judge <span class="SpellE">Melendres</span>,
clearly indicates that applicant <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> did in fact
buy some 80 hectares of land from Castro of Lot No. 463."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Director of Lands and <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
Adriano <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span>, Martin Aguilar and Pedro Aguilar then
came to this court, questioning the correctness and legality of the above
ruling of the Court of Appeals, affecting solely the northern portion of Lot
No. 463, that was allegedly made in contravention of the express provisions of
the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 51 of the old Rule 123, Rules of Court, referred to by
herein <span class="GramE">petitioners, reads as follows</span>:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 51.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Secondary evidence when original is lost
or destroyed</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- When the original
writing has been lost or destroyed, upon proof of its execution and loss or
destruction, its contents may be proved by a copy, or by a recital of its contents
in some authentic document, or by the recollection of witnesses."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is merit in the petitioners' contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the enactment of Act No. 190 to the
present Rules of Court, the rule governing the sale of real property has
remained unchanged:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it can be proved
only by the very instrument reciting the transaction, duly subscribed by the
proper party or his authorized agent, or else by secondary evidence of the
contents of such document.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
However, before the terms of a transaction in realty may be established by
secondary evidence, it is necessary that the due execution and subsequent loss
of the original instrument evidencing the transaction be proved.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="GramE">For it is the due execution, and loss thereafter, of the document
that would warrant or constitute basis for the introduction of secondary
evidence to prove the contents of such document.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
And the due execution of the document should be proved through the testimony of
(1) the person or persons who executed it; (2) the person before whom its
execution was acknowledged; or (3) any person who was present and saw it
executed and delivered, or who, after its execution and delivery, saw it and
recognized the signatures, or by a person to whom the parties to the
instruments had previously confessed the execution thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, in one case,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
the admission of the certified copy of the record of a deed in a public registry
as secondary evidence of the terms of the deed of sale, was declared improper
and invalid, the Court pointing to the party's failure to present the notary
and those persons who must have seen the signing of the document as witnesses
to testify on its due execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, the declaration of applicant <span class="SpellE">Raymundo's</span> former counsel, Mariano C. <span class="SpellE">Melendres</span>,
does not satisfy the requirements of the Rules.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As mentioned in the decision of the Court of Appeals, this witness
testified that the alleged original deed of sale, together with other pertinent
papers, were entrusted to him by applicant sometime before the war that upon
his appointment to the bench all those papers were turned over to one Attorney <span class="SpellE">Facundo</span> San Agustin; that Attorney San Agustin, however,
was killed by the Japanese and no trace of the documents could be found
thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be noted from the
foregoing finding of the Court of Appeals that Judge <span class="SpellE">Melendres</span>
did not state that he was present when the deed of sale was supposedly executed
by Mariano Castro, or that the fact of its execution was acknowledged or
admitted to him by the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
appears simply that the deed, perhaps then already accomplished, was delivered
to him by applicant, together with other papers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming, therefore, that this witness
could have read the contents of the document, yet if it is considered that
there is no showing that the witness knew and recognized the signatures affixed
thereon, such knowledge of the terms would not qualify him to testify on the <u>due
execution</u> of the document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same
thing may be said of the receipt signed by Mariano Castro, acknowledging
payment by <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> of the sum of P100.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has nothing to do at all with the
execution of the supposed deed of sale.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the Court of Appeals clearly committed reversible error in
declaring <span class="SpellE">Raymundo's</span> title over the northern portion
of Lot No. 463 to have been proved, on the basis of the foregoing evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The applicant, having failed to establish his right or title over
the northern portion of Lot No. 463 involved in the present controversy, and
there being no showing that the same has been acquired by any private person
from the Government, either by purchase or by grant, the property is and
remains part of the public domain.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals under
review is reversed, only insofar as it decreed to applicant Mariano <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> title to and ownership of the northern portion of
Lot No. 463, <span class="SpellE">Mabitac</span> Cadastre, subject of this
proceeding, which is hereby declared part of the public domain, subject to the <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> rights of <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
