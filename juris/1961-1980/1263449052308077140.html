with <span style="">a </span>prayer for the issuance
of a writ of preliminary injunction, for the review and nullification of the
Order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City
in Civil Case No.</span> <span style="">Q-6042 </span>dated
<st1:date year="1962" day="12" month="11">November <span style="">12, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">; </span>for
the per­manent non-enforcement of the said order; and, for the issuance of an
order directing the herein respondent judge to issue <span style="">a </span>writ of execution in the above-numbered civil case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1961</st1:date>,
Miguel <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, the herein peti­tioner, filed with the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City <span style="">a </span>complaint for damages against the
herein respond­ent, Dr. Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed as Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">Q-6042 of the said court.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To this complaint, respondent <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span>, as
defendant, filed a seasonable answer <span style="">with
counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A timely answer </span>to
this counterclaim was likewise filed by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due time, the trial court scheduled Civil Case No. Q-6042 for
hearing on the merits on <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="2">February 19,
 1962</st1:date> and furnished the parties thereto with the corresponding
notices of the same. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The counsel for
respondent <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span>, Atty. Cornelio S. <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span>, received a copy of the said notice on <st1:date year="1961" day="9" month="12">December 9, 1961</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the case was called for trial on <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1962</st1:date>, however, neither respondent <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span> nor his counsel, Atty. Cornelio S. <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span>, appeared.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Conse­quently, the trial court, on motion of the herein petitioner,
allowed the latter, as the party <span style="">plaintiff,
to </span>present his evidence <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">parte</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>before the Clerk of Court who was then
designated as commissioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 19, 1962, the trial court, herein respond­ent judge
presiding, rendered judgment in favor of the petitioner and against respondent <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span>, ordering the latter to pay the former the sum
of P9,200.00 as "re­imbursement and damages," P1,000.00 for
attorney's fees, plus costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A copy of
this decision <span style="">was received </span>by
res­pondent <span class="SpellE">Venturanza's</span> counsel on <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 30, 1962, or four days after the period for filing a
motion for reconsideration against the above de­cision of March 19, 1962 had
expired, the counsel for res­pondent <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span> filed
a <span style="">motion for reconsideration </span>of
the same and for relief from the said judgment on the ground of excusable
negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the ground invoked was
specified by the said counsel, the notice of hearing was received by his filing
clerk who, however, was taken ill unexpectedly and, consequently, forgot all
about the said notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Herein petitioner
opposed the said motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1962</st1:date>,
the petitioner filed with the <span style="">trial </span>court
a motion for the execution of its decision of <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1962</st1:date> on the ground that the same had since
become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="7">July
 10, 1962</st1:date>, the said court issued an order (1) denying for lack of
merit respondent <span class="SpellE">Venturanza’s</span> motion for <span style="">reconsideration and relief from judgment, and
(2) granting the petitioner's motion for execution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1962</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span> filed with the lower court the
following pleadings:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) notice of
withdrawal of Atty. Cornelio S. <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> as counsel
for respondent; (b) an urgent motion to dissolve and set aside the order of <st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1962</st1:date> insofar as it granted
the petitioner's motion for execution; and (c) <span style="">a </span>notice of appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 1, 1962, the date set for the hearing of respondent <span class="SpellE">Venturanza's</span> motion to dissolve and set aside the order of
July 10, 1962, and of the opposition thereto interposed by the herein
petitioner, the respondent judge, <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>propio</u></span>, ordered orally in open session the setting
aside of, not his order of execution of <span style="">July
</span>10, 1962, but of the decision of March 19, 1962 and, in the premises,
reset the hearing on the merits of Civil Case No. Q-6042 for <st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This order was subsequently handed down in
writing under the order of <st1:date year="1962" day="12" month="11">November
 12, 1962</st1:date> subject of the present petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1963</st1:date>,
this Court issued a writ of pre­liminary injunction enjoining the respondent
judge herein from further proceeding with Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">Q-6042
until further orders.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue appreciable from the petition on hand relates to
the power or jurisdiction of the herein respond­ent judge to set aside his
decision of <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1962</st1:date>
in Civil Case No. Q-6042 and having the said case reopened for another trial on
the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More specifically, is his
order of <st1:date year="1962" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1962</st1:date>
to the above effect sus­tainable in law and jurisprudence?</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue should be resolved in the negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We </span>find
for the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be recalled that a copy of the decision of <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1962</st1:date> was received by Atty.
Cornelio S. <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span>, respondent <span class="SpellE">Venturanza's</span>
counsel of record, on <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter, therefore, had only up to <st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1962</st1:date> to move for its
reconsideration or to perfect an appeal from the said decision (Section 3, Rule
41, <span class="GramE">Rules</span> of Court).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When, beyond this date, no motion for reconsideration <span style="">was </span>filed nor any appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> perfected, the finality of the said decision set
in as <span style="">a matter </span>of course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having thus become final, it was removed from
the power or juris­diction of the <span style="">said </span>court
to further alter or <span class="GramE">amend,</span> much less revoke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Arnedo</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Llorente</span> and <span class="SpellE">Liongson</span>, 18 Phil.
257; <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Viquiera</span></span><span style=""> v. <span class="SpellE">Baraña</span>, </span>78
Phil. 486) The only power retained by the trial court, after <span style="">a </span>judgment has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, is to order its execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Bili</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Chunaco</span>, G. R. <span style="">No.</span></span><span style=""> </span>L-6630,
<st1:date year="1956" day="29" month="2">February 29, 1956</st1:date>)</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true, of course, that the lower court is conferred the
power to extend <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> from judgment under Section 2
of Rule 38 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as
the said rule <span class="GramE">itself</span> recites, and <span style="">as </span>this Court has repeatedly held,
such <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> should be awarded only "when a judg­ment
or order is entered, or any other proceeding is taken, through fraud, accident,
mistake or excusable negligence." Neither the records of this case nor the
respondents' ar­guments, however, establish the incident under consider­ation
to be within the rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary,
no evidence of inexcusable negligence on the part of respondent <span class="SpellE">Venturanza’s</span> counsel is more forceful and convincing than
the ground invoked by the latter for setting <span style="">aside </span>the decision of <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="3">March
 19, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The explanation
that the said counsel failed to appear at the scheduled trial because the
receiving clerk who received the notice for the same was taken ill unexpectedly
and thus forgot <span style="">all </span>about it has
already been <span style="">assessed </span>by this
Court in the <span style="">case of </span>Philippine
Air Lines v. Hon. Francisco <span class="SpellE">Arca</span>, et <span style="">al., G. </span>R. No. L-22729, <st1:date year="1967" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1967</st1:date> ?</p>

hackneyed and habitual subterfuge employed by litigants who fail to observe the

Supreme Court's repeated rul­ings that they are neither credible nor con­stitutive

abuse of discretion."</blockquote>
