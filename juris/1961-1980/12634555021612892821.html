<p class="BODY">The lower court's conclusion absolving the Manila Port Service
from liability for the claim of P6,027.66 one case power pump parts marked
PH-206-A admittedly lost in the custody of defendant, must be reversed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the records the complaint
alleges the loss of this particular case containing power pump parts as valued
at P6,027.66.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This particular averment
was denied the answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on this
particular point the supplemental stipulation of facts shows that said case
delivered and turned over to defendants by the carrier on <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1963</st1:date> but wan not delivered to the
consignee." (Section 1) And in its Section 3 thereof, it was stipulated
that "defendant's maximum liability under the management contract shall
not exceed P500.00 in accordance with Section 15 thereof." Taken as a
whole, from the averment in the complaint, the denial in the answer, the
calculation of fact, there is an express admission by defendant that the case
was received and that it failed to deliver it to the consignee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The foregoing, therefore, admits
responsibility, but limits the same to an amount not exceeding P500.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For defendant Manila Port Service's
stipulation to the effect that its responsibility should be limited to P500.00
clearly implies, after what it has admitted in paragraph 1 of the stipulation
of fact, that it is liable but not more than P500.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, in Section 1 it admits
responsibility and in Section 3 limits the same to only P500.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For such reason We believe that the defendant
is liable for said case containing power pump parts marked PH-206-A to the sum
of P500.00.</p>
