				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">An appeal from a decision, dated April 2, 1964, of the Court of
First Instance of Manila in Civil Case No. 52089, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Mambulao</span> Lumber Company, plaintiff, versus Philippine
National Bank and <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Heraldo</span>,
defendants", dismissing the complaint against both defendants and
sentencing the plaintiff to pay to defendant Philippine National Bank (PNB for
short) the sum of P3,582.52 with interest thereon at the rate of 6% per annum
from December 22, 1961 until fully paid, and the costs of suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In seeking the reversal of the decision, the plaintiff advances
several propositions in its brief which may be restated as follows:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That its total
indebtedness to the PNB <span style="">as </span>of November 21, 1961, was only P56,485.87 and not P58,213.51
as concluded by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>; hence, the proceeds of the
foreclosure sale of its real pro­perty alone in the amount of P56,908.00 on
that date, added to the sum of P738.59 it remitted to the PNB thereafter was
more than sufficient to liquidate its obligation, thereby rendering the
subsequent fore­closure sale of its chattels unlawful;</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That it is not liable to
pay PNB the amount of P5,821.35 for attorney's fees and the additional sum of
P298.54 as expenses of the foreclosure sale;</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the subsequent
foreclosure sale of its chattels is null and void, not only because it had
already settled its indebtedness to the PNB at the time the sale was effected,
but also for the reason that the said sale was not conducted in accordance with
the provisions of the Chattel Mortgage Law and the venue agreed upon by the
parties in the mortgage contract;</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the PNB, having
illegally sold the chattels, <span style="">is liable </span>to the plaintiff for its value; and</p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That for the acts of the PNB in proceeding </span>with
the sale of the chattels, in utter disregard of plaintiff's vigorous opposition
thereto, and in taking possession thereof after the sale thru force,
intimidation, coercion, and by detaining its "man-­in-charge" of said
properties, the PNB is liable to plaintiff for damages and attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts of the case, as found <span style="">by <span style="">the
trial </span></span>court, are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1956" day="5" month="5">May <span style="">5, </span>1956</st1:date>, the plaintiff
applied for an industrial loan of P155,000 with the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>
Branch of defendant PNB and the former offered real estate, machinery, logging
and transportation equipments as collaterals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The application, however, was approved for a loan of P100,000 only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To secure the payment of the loan, the plain­tiff
mortgaged to defendant PNB <span style="">a parcel </span><span style="">of land, </span>together
with the buildings and improvements existing thereon, situated in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of Jose <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>
(formerly <span class="SpellE">Mambulao</span>), province of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
Norte, and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title <span style="">No. </span>381 of the land records of said
province, as well as various sawmill equipment, rolling unit and other fixed
assets of the plaintiff, all situated in its compound in the aforementioned
municipality.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On August 2, 1956, the PNB released from the approved loan
the sum of P27,500, for which the plaintiff signed a promissory note wherein it
promised to pay to the PNB the said sum in five equal yearly installments at
the rate of P6,528.40 beginning July 31, 1957, and every year thereafter, the
last of which would be on July 31, 1961.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On October 19, 1956, the PNB made another release of P15,500
as part of the approved loan granted to the plaintiff and so on the said date,
the latter executed a­nother promissory note wherein it agreed to pay to the
former the said sum in five equal yearly in­stallments at the rate of P3,679.64
beginning July 31, 1957, and ending on July 31, 1961.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The plaintiff failed to pay the amortizations on the amounts
released to and received by it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Repeated
demands were made upon the plaintiff to pay its obligation but it failed or
otherwise refused to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon inspection
and verification made by em<span style="">ployees of the PNB, it was found that the plaintiff had already stopped
operation about the end of 1957 or early part of 1958.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"On
September </span>27, 1961, the PNB sent a letter to the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte requesting him to take possession of the
parcel of land, together with the improvements existing thereon, covered by
Transfer Cer­tificate of Title No. 381 of the land records of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte, and to sell it at public auction in
accordance with the provisions of Act No. 3135, as amended, for the
satisfaction of the unpaid obligation of the plaintiff, which as of September
22, 1961, <span style="">amounted
to P</span>57,646.59, excluding attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In compliance with the request, on <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="10">October 16, 1961</st1:date>, the Provincial
Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte issued the corresponding
no­tice of extra-judicial foreclosure sale and sent a copy thereof to the
plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the notice, the
mortgaged property would be sold at public auction at <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 a.m.</st1:time> on <st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="11">November
 21, 1961</st1:date>, at the ground floor of the Court <span style="">House in <span class="SpellE">Daet</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
Norte.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On November 6, 1961, the PNB sent a letter to the Provincial
Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte request­ing him to take
possession of the chattels mortgaged to it by the plaintiff and sell them <span style="">as </span><span style="">public auction also on November 21, 1961, for
the satisfaction of </span>the sum of P57,646.59, plus 6% annual interest
thereon from September 23, 1961, attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the
amount due and the costs and expenses of the sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, the PNB sent <span style="">notice to the
plaintiff that the former was foreclosing <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span>
the chattels mortgaged by the latter and that the auction sale thereof would be
held on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="11"><span style="">November 21, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, between </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="9"><span style="">9:00</span></st1:time><span style=""> and </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="0"><span style="">12:00 a.m.</span></st1:time><span style="">, in <span class="SpellE">Mambulao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte, where
the mortgaged chattels were situa­ted.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1961" day="8" month="11">November <span style="">8, </span>1961</st1:date>, Deputy Provincial
Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Heraldo</span>
took possession of the chattels mortgaged by the plaintiff and made an
inventory thereof in the pre<span style="">sence of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">PC Sergeant and a police­man of the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">municipality</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> of </span><st1:placename><span style="">Jose <span class="SpellE">Pa­nganiban</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1961" day="9" month="11"><span style="">November
 9, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, the said Deputy Sheriff issued the cor­responding notice of public
auction sale of the mortgaged chattels to </span>be held on <st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1961</st1:date>, at <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 a.m.</st1:time>, at the plaintiff's com<span style="">pound situated in

<blockquote>"On November 19, 1961, the plaintiff sent separate letters,
posted as registered air mail matter, one to the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Naga</span></span><span style=""> </span>Branch of
the PNB <span style="">and
another to the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte,
protesting against </span>the foreclosure of the real estate and chattel
mortgages on the grounds that they could not be effected unless a<span style=""> </span>Court's
order was issued against it (plaintiff) for said purpose and that the
foreclosure proceedings, accord­ing to the terms of the mortgage con­tracts,
should be made in Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said letter
to the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> Branch of the PNB, it <span style="">was intimated </span>that
if the public auction sale would be suspended and the plaintiff would be given
an extension of ninety (90) days, its <span style="">obligation
would be settled satis­factorily because </span><span style="">an </span><span style="">important </span><span style="">ne­gotiation was </span><span style="">then going on for the </span><span style="">sale </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">its "whole
interest" for an amount more </span><span style="">than
sufficient to liquidate said obligation.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The letter of the plaintiff to the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>
Branch of the PNB was construed by the latter as a re<span style="">quest </span><span style="">for extension of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">fore</span><span style="">­</span><span style="">closure sale of the mortgaged chat­tels and so it advised the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte </span><span style="">to defer it to </span><st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="12"><span style="">December </span><span style="">21, </span><span style="">1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, at </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">same time and
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">A </span><span style="">copy of said advice </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">sent
to the plaintiff for its information and guidance.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The foreclosure <span style="">sale </span>of the parcel of land, together with the
<span style="">buildings and improvements thereon,
covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 381, was, however, held on
November 21, 1961, and the said property was sold to the PNB for the sum of
P56,908.00, subject to the right of the plaintiff to redeem the same within a
period of one year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date,
Deputy Provincial Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Heraldo</span> executed a
certificate of </span><span style="">sale </span><span style="">in favor of the PNB
and a copy thereof was sent to the plaintiff.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In a letter dated December 14, 1961 (but apparently posted
several days later), the plaintiff sent a bank draft for P738.59 to the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Naga</span></span><span style=""> </span>Branch of
the PNB, allegedly in full <span style="">settlement
of the balance of the ob­ligation of the plaintiff after the application
thereto of the sum of P56,908.00 representing the proceeds of the foreclosure </span><span style="">sale </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">parcel </span><span style="">of land described in Transfer Certifi­cate of Title No. 381.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">In the said letter, </span><span style="">the plaintiff reiterated its request that the foreclosure </span><span style="">sale </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the mortgaged chattels be discon­tinued on
the grounds that the mortgaged indebtedness had been fully paid and that it
could not be legally effected at a place other than the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In a letter dated <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="12">December
 16, 1961</st1:date>, the plaintiff advised the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte that it had fully paid its obligation to
the PNB, and enclosed therewith a copy of its letter to the latter dated <st1:date year="1961" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1961</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On December 18, 1961, the Attor­ney of the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> Branch of the PNB, wrote to the plaintiff
acknowledging the remittance of P738.59 with the advice, however, that as of
that date the balance of the account of the plaintiff was P9,161.76, to which
should be added the expenses of guard­ing the mortgaged chattels at the rate of
P4.00 a day beginning December 19, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was further explained in <span style="">said
letter that the sum of P57,646.59, which was stated in the request for the
foreclosure of the real estate mortgage, did not include the 10% attorney's
fees and expenses of the sale.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, the plaintiff was advised that the foreclosure sale
scheduled on the 21st of said month would be stopped if a remittance of
P9,161.76, plus interest thereon and guarding fees, would be made.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"On </span><st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="12"><span style="">December
 21, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, the fore</span>closure
sale of the mortgaged chattels was held at <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00
 a.m.</st1:time> and they were awarded to the PNB for the sum of P4,200 and the
corresponding bill of sale was issued in its favor by De­puty Provincial
Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Heraldo</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In a letter dated <st1:date year="1961" day="26" month="12">December
 26, 1961</st1:date>, the Manager of the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> Branch
of the PNB advised the plaintiff giv­ing it priority to repurchase the <span style="">chattels acquired
by the former at public auction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
offer was reiterated in a letter dated </span><st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="1"><span style="">January
 3, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, of the Attorney of the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> Branch of the PNB
to the plain­tiff, with the suggestion that it exercise its right of redemption
and that it apply for the <span class="SpellE">condona­tion</span> of the
attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff did not
follow the advice but on the contrary it made known of its intention to file
appropriate action or actions for the protection of its interests.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1962</st1:date>,
several employ<span style="">ees
</span>of the PNB arrived in the compound of the plaintiff in Jose <span class="SpellE">Panga­niban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte, and
they informed Luis Salgado, Chief Security Guard of the premises, that the
properties therein had been auctioned and bought by the PNB, which in turn sold
them to Mariano <span class="SpellE">Bundok</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon being advised that the purchaser would
take delivery of the things he bought, Salgado was at first reluctant to allow
any piece of property to be taken out of the compound of the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The employees of the PNB explained that
should Salgado refuse, he would be exposing himself to a litigation wherein he
could be held liable to pay big sum of money by way of damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apprehensive of the risk that he would take,
Salgado immediately sent a wire to the President of the plaintiff in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
asking advice as to what he should do.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the meantime, Mariano <span class="SpellE">Bundok</span> was able to
take out from the plaintiff's compound two truck loads of equipment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the afternoon of the same day, Salgado received a telegram
from plaintiff's President directing him not to deliver the 'chattels' without
court order, with the information that the com<span style="">pany was then filing an action for damages
against the PNB.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the following day, </span><st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="5"><span style="">May 25, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, two trucks and
men of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Bundok</span> arrived but Salgado did not
permit them to take out any equipment from inside the compound of the
plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thru the intervention,
however, of the local police and PC soldiers, the trucks of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Bundok</span> were able finally to haul the properties originally
mortgaged by the plaintiff to the PNB, which were bought </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">it at the foreclosure sale and subsequently
sold to Mariano <span class="SpellE">Bundok</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon
the foregoing facts, the trial court rendered the decision appealed from which,
</span><span style="">as </span><span style="">stated in the first
paragraph of this opinion, sentenced the <span class="SpellE">Mambulao</span>
Lumber Company to pay to the defendant </span><span style="">PNB </span><span style="">the sum of P3,582.52 with interest thereon at
the </span><span style="">rate
</span><span style="">of </span><span style="">6% </span><span style="">per annum from
December 22, 1961 (day following the date of the questioned foreclosure of
plaintiff's chattels) until fully paid, and the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mambulao</span> Lumber
Company interposed the instant appeal.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
shall discuss the various points raised in appellant's brief in <u>seriatim</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
first question <span class="SpellE">Mambulao</span> Lumber Company poses is that
which relates to the amount of its in­debtedness to the PNB arising out of the
principal loans and the accrued interest thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is contend­ed that its obligation under
the terms of the two </span><span style="">pro­</span><span style="">missory notes it had executed in favor of the PNB amounts only to
P56,485.87 as of </span><st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="11"><span style="">November 21, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, when the sale of
real property was effected, and </span><span style="">not P</span><span style="">58,213.51 as found by the trial court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There
is merit to this claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Examining the
terms of the promissory note executed by the appellant in favor of the PNB, we
find that the agreed interest on the loan of P43,000.00 - P27,500.00 released
on August 2, 1956, as per promissory note of even date (Exhibit C-3), and
P15,500.00 released on October 19, 1956, as per </span><span style="">promissory note </span><span style="">of the same date </span><span style="">(Exhibit </span><span style="">C-4) - was six per
cent </span><span style="">(6%)
</span><span style="">per
annum from the respective date of said notes "until paid".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the statement of account of the appellant </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">of September 22,
1961, submitted by the PNB, it appears that in arriving at the total
indebtedness P57,646.59 as of </span><span style="">that </span>date, the PNB had compounded the
principal of the loan and the accrued 6% interest thereon each time the yearly
amortizations became due, and on the basis of these compounded amounts charged
additional delinquency interest on them up <span style="">to </span>September 22, 1961; and to this
erroneously computed total of P57,646.59, the trial court added 6% interest per
annum from September 23, 1961 to November 21 of the same year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect, the PNB has claimed, and the trial
court has adjudicated <span style="">to </span>it, <u><span style="">interest on </span>accrued interests</u> from
the time the various amortizations of the loan became due until the real estate
mortgage executed to secure the loan was extra-judicially foreclosed on <st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is an error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 5 of Act No. 2655 expressly provides
that in computing the interest on any obligation, <span style="">promissory note or other instrument or
contract, com</span>pound interest shall not be reckoned, except by agree­ment,
or in default thereof, whenever the debt is judicially claimed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is also the clear mandate of <span style="">Article 2212 of the
new Civil Code which provides that </span>interest due shall earn legal
interest only from the time it <span style="">is </span>judicially demanded, and of Article 1959
of the same code which ordains that interest due and unpaid shall not earn
interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, the parties may, by
stipulation, capitalize the interest due and unpaid, which <span style="">as </span>added principal shall earn new in­terest;
but such stipulation is nowhere to be found in the terms of the p<span style="">r</span>omissory
notes involved in this <span style="">case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly therefore, the trial
court fell into error when it awarded interest on accrued interests, without
any agreement to that effect and before they </span>had been judicially
demanded.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant next assails the award of attorney's fees and the
expenses of the foreclosure sale in favor of the PNB.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the amount of P298.54 allowed
<span style="">a </span>expenses of the
extra-judicial sale of the real property, appellant maintains that the same has
<span style="">no </span>basis,
factual or legal, and should not have been awarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It likewise decries the award </span>of attorney's
fees which, according to the appellant, should not be deducted from the
proceeds of the sale of the real property, not only because there <span style="">is </span>no express agree­ment in the real
estate mortgage contract to pay attorney's fees in case the same <span style="">is </span>extra-judicially foreclosed, but
also for the reason that the PNB nei­ther spent nor incurred any obligation to
pay attor­ney's fees in connection with the said extra-judicial foreclosure
under consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Th<span style="">e</span>re is reason for
the appellant to assail the <span style="">award of P298.54 </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">expenses of the sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this </span><span style="">respect, the </span><span style="">trial </span><span style="">court said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The parcel of land, together with the buildings and
improvements existing thereon covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 381,
was sold for P56,908.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was, however,
no evidence how much <span style="">was the expenses
of the foreclosure </span>sale although from the pertinent<span style=""> provisions of the Rules of </span><span style="">Court, the </span><span style="">Sheriff'</span><span style="">s</span><span style=""> fees would be P1 for advertising the sale (par. k, Sec. 7, Rule 130 of
the Old Rules) and P297.54 </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">his

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">There
is really no evidence of </span><span style="">record to </span><span style="">support the c</span><span style="">onclusion </span><span style="">that the PNB is

sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court below committed error in
applying the provisions of the Rules of Court for purposes of arriving at the
amount awarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be borne in </span><span style="">mind that </span><span style="">the fees enumerated under paragraphs k and </span><span style="">n, </span><span style="">Section 7, of Rule 130 (now Rule 141) are

foreclosure of mortgages under Act 3135.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The law applicable is Section 4 of Act 3135 which pro­vides that the

of actual work performed in addition to his expenses in connection with the

would be the amount of P10.00 as a reasonable allowance for two day's work - one
for the preparation of the necessary notices of sale, and the other for
conducting the auction sale and issuance of the corresponding certificate of
sale in favor of the buyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously,
therefore, the award of P298.54 as expenses of the sale should be set aside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But
the claim of the appellant that the real estate mortgage does not provide for
attorney's fees in case the same is extra-judicially foreclosed, cannot be
favorably considered, as would readily be re­vealed by an examination of the
pertinent provision of the mortgage contract.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The parties to the mortgage appear to have stipulated under paragraph
(c) thereof, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> For
the purpose of extra-judicial foreclosure, the Mort­gagor hereby appoints the
Mortgagee his attorney-in-fact to sell the property mortgaged under Act 3135,
as amended, to sign all documents <span style="">and to perform all acts requisite and necessary to
accomplish said purpose and to appoint its substitute as such attorney-in-fact
with the same powers </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">above specified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of
judicial foreclosure, the Mortgagor hereby consents to the appointment of the
Mortgagee or any of its employees as receiver, without any bond, to take charge
of the mortgaged property at once, and to hold possession of the </span><span style="">same </span><span style="">and the rents,
benefits and profits derived from the mortgaged property before the sale, less
the costs and expen­ses of the receivership; the Mortga­gor hereby agrees
further that in all cases, attorney's fees hereby fixed at Ten Per Cent (10%)
of the total indebtedness then unpaid, which is no case shall be less than
P100.00 exclusive of all fees allowed by law, and the expenses of collection
shall be the obligation of the Mortgagor and shall with priority, be paid to
the Mortgagee out of any sums realized as rents and pro derived from the
mortgaged property or from the proceeds realized from the sale of the said
property and this mortgage shall likewise stand as security <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">We
find the above stipulation to pay attorney's fees clear enough to cover both
cases of foreclosure sale mentioned <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>, <span class="SpellE">i</span>. e., judicially or extra-judicially.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the phrase "in all cases"
appears to be part of the second sentence, a reading of the whole context of
the stipulation would readily show that it logically refers to extra-judicial
foreclosure found in the first sentence and to judicial foreclosure mentioned
in the next sentence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the ambiguity
in the stipulation suggested and pointed out by the appeal by reason of the
faulty sentence construction should not be made to defeat the otherwise clear
intention of the parties in the agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It
is suggested by the appellant, however, that even if the above stipulation to
pay attorney's fees were applicable to the extra-judicial foreclosure sale of
its real properties, still, the award of P5,821.35 for attorney's fees has no
legal justification, consi­dering the circumstance that the PNB did not
actually spend anything by way of attorney's fees in connection with the
sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of this proposition,
appel</span><span style="">lant cites authorities to
the effect:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that when the mortgagee
has neither paid nor incurred any obliga­tion to pay an attorney in connection
with the foreclosure sale, the claim for such fees should be de­nied;</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and (2) that attorney's fees will not be
allowed when the attorney conducting the foreclosure pro­ceedings is an officer
of the corporation (mortgagee) who receives a salary for all the legal services
performed by him for the corporation.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> These authorities are indeed enlightening;
but they should not be applied in this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The very same authority first cited suggests that said principle is not
absolute, for there is authority to the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the fact that the foreclosure
proceedings were handled by an attorney of the legal staff of the PNB, we are
re­luctant to exonerate herein appellant from the payment of the stipulated
attorney's fees on this ground a­lone, considering the express agreement
between the </span><span style="">parties in the mortgage contract under which appel­lant became liable to
pay the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, we find merit
in the contention of the appellant that the award of P5,821.35 in favor of the
PNB as attorney's fees is unconscionable and unreasonable, considering that all
that the branch attorney of the said bank did in connection with the
foreclosure sale of the real property was to file a petition with the
provincial sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte re­questing the
latter to sell the some in accordance with the provisions of Act 3135.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
principle that courts should reduce sti­pulated attorney's fees whenever it is
found under the circumstances of the case that the same is un­reasonable, is
now deeply rooted in this jurisdic­tion to entertain any serious objection to
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, this Court has explained:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"But the principle that it may be lawfully stipulated that the
legal expenses involved in the collection of a debt shall be defrayed <span style="">by </span>the debtor does not imply that such
stipulations must be enforced in accordance with the terms, no matter how
injurious or oppressive they may be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
lawful purpose to be accomplished by such a stipulation is to permit the
creditor to receive the amount due him under his contract without a deduction
of the expenses caused by the delinquency of the debtor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should not be permitted for him to convert
such a stipulation into a source of speculative profit at the expense of the
debtor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Contracts for attorney's services in this jurisdiction stands
upon an entirely different footing from contracts for the payment of
compensation for any<span style=""> other services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By express
provision of section 29 of the Code of Civil Procedure, an attorney is not
entitled in absence of express contract to recover more than a reasonable
compensation for his services; and even when an express contract is made the
court can ignore it and limit the recovery to reasonable compen­sation if the
amount of the stipulated fee is found by the court to be unreasonable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a very different rule from that
announced in section 1091 of the Civil Code with reference to the obligation of
contracts in general, where it is said that such obligation has the force of
law between the contracting parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had
the plaintiff herein made an express contract to pay his attorney an <span class="SpellE">uncontingent</span> fee of P2,115.25 for the services to be
rendered in reducing the note here in suit to judgment, it would not have bees
enforced against him had he seen fit to oppose it, as such a fee is ob­viously
far greater than is necessary to remunerate the attorney for the work involved
and is therefore unreasonable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order
to enable the court to ig­nore an express contract for an attorney's fees, it
is not necessary to show, as in other contracts, that it is contrary to</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">morality or public
policy (Art. 1255, Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
enough that it is unreasonable or unconscionable."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Since then this Court has invariably fixed counsel
fees on </span><span style="">a <u>quantum</u> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">meruit</span></u></span><span style=""> basis whenever the
fees stipulated appear excessive, unconscionable, or un­reasonable, because a
lawyer is primarily a court officer charged with the duty of assisting the
court in administering impartial justice between the parties, and hence, the
fees should be subject to judi</span>cial control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor should it be ignored that sound public
policy demands that courts disregard stipu­lations for counsel fees, whenever
they appear to be a source of speculative profit at the expense of the debtor
or mortgagor.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
And it is not material that the present action is between the debtor and the
creditor, and not between attorney and client.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As court have power to fix the fee as between attor­ney and client, it
must necessarily have the right to say whether a stipulation like this,
inserted in a mortgage contract, <span style="">is </span>valid.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In determining the compensation of an attorney, the following
circumstances should be considered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the
amount and character of the services rendered; the responsibility imposed; the
amount of mo­ney or <span style="">the value </span>of the property affected by the controversy, or involved
in the employment; the skill and experience called for in the performance of
the service; the professional standing of the attorney; the results secured;
and whether or not the fee is contingent or absolute, it being a recognized rule
that an attorney may properly charge a much larger fee when it <span style="">is </span>to be
contingent than when it is not.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
From the stipulation in the mortgage contract earlier quoted, it appears that
the agreed fee is 10% of the total indebtedness, irrespective of the manner the
foreclosure of the mortgage is to be effected.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The agreement <span style="">is </span>perhaps fair enough in case the <span style="">foreclosure </span><span style="">proceedings is prosecuted </span>judicially
but, surely, it is unreasonable when, as in this case, the mortgage was
foreclosed extra-judicially, and all that the attorney did was to file <span style="">a </span>petition for foreclosure with the
sheriff concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be assumed
though, that the said branch attorney of the PNB made a study of the case
before deciding to file the petition for foreclosure; but even with this in
mind, we believe the amount of P5,821.35 is far too excessive <span style="">a fee for such services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Considering the above <span style="">circumstances men­</span><span style="">tioned, it is our
considered opinion that the amount </span>of P1,000.00 would be more than
sufficient to compensate the work aforementioned.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The next issue raised deals with the claim that the proceeds of
the sale of the <span style="">real properties alone
together </span>with the <span style="">amount </span>it
remitted to the PNB<span style=""> </span>later was
more than sufficient to liquidate its total obligation to herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> bank.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, we find merit in this claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">From </span>the foregoing
discussion of the first two errors assigned, and for purposes of determining
the total obligation of herein appellant to the PNB as of <st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1961</st1:date> when the real estate mortgage
was foreclosed, <span style="">we </span>have the following illustration in support of this
conclusion:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From
the foregoing illustration or computation, it is clear that there was no
further necessity to foreclose the mortgage of herein appellant's chattels on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="12"><span style="">December 21, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">; and on this
ground alone, we may declare the sale of appellant's chattels on the said date,
illegal and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we take into
considera­tion the fact that the PNB must have been led to be­lieve that the
stipulated 10% of the unpaid loan four attorney's fees in the real estate
mortgage was legally maintainable, and in accordance with such belief, herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> bank insisted that the proceeds of the sale of
appellant's real property was deficient to liquidate the latter's total
indebtedness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may,
however, we still find the subsequent sale of herein appellant's chattels
illegal and objection­able on other grounds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That
appellant vigorously objected to the foreclosure of its chattel mortgage after
the foreclosure of its real estate mortgage on November 21, 1961, cannot be
doubted, as shown not only by its letter to the PNB on November 19, 1961, but
also in its letter to the provincial sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
Norte on the same date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These letters
were followed by another letter to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> bank
on December 14, 1961, wherein herein appellant, in no uncertain terms,
reiterated its objection to the scheduled sale of its chattels on December 21,
1961 at Jose <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
Norte for the reasons therein stated that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) it had settled in full its total obligation to the PNB by the sale
of the real estate and its subsequent remit­tance of the amount of P738.59; and
(2) that the con­templated sale at Jose <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>
would violate their agreement embodied under paragraph (<span class="SpellE">i</span>)
in the Chattel Mortgage which provides </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of both
judicial and extra-judicial foreclosure under Act 1508, <span style="">as </span>amended, the parties hereto agree that the corres<span style="">ponding complaint for foreclosure of <u>the
petition for <span style="">sale </span>should be
filed with the courts or the sheriff </u></span><u><span style="">of the City of Manila,</span></u><span style=""> as the case may
be; and that the Mortgagor shall pay attorney's fees hereby fixed at ten per
cent (10%) of the total indebtedness then unpaid but in no case shall it be
less than P100.00, exclusive of all costs and fees al­lowed by law and of other
expenses </span><span style="">incurred in connection
with </span><span style="">the
said foreclosure." [Underscoring supplied]</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Notwithstanding
the above-quoted agreement in the chattel mortgage contract, and in utter disre­gard
of the objection of herein appellant to the sale of its chattels at Jose <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte and
not in the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> as agreed upon,
the PNB proceeded with the foreclosure sale of said chattels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court, however, justified said
action of the PNB in the decision appealed from in the following rationale:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"While it is true that it was stipulated in the chattel
mortgage contract that a petition for the extra-judicial foreclosure thereof
should be filed with the Sheriff of the City of Manila, neverthe­less, the
effect thereof was merely to provide another place where the mortgage chattel
could be sold, <span style="">in addition to those
specified in </span><span style="">the Chattel Mortgage Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
a stipulation in a contract cannot abrogate much less impliedly re</span><span style="">peal a specific provision of the </span><span style="">statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that Section 14 of Act No. 1508
vests in the <span class="SpellE">morgagee</span> the choice where the fore­closure
sale should be held, </span><span style="">hence, </span><span style="">in the case under consideration, the PNB has three places from which to
select, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the place of
residence of the mortgagor; (2) the </span><span style="">place of the mortgaged chattels were situated; and (3) the place
stipulated in the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span><span style="">PNB selected the
second and, accord­ingly, the foreclosure sale held in Jose <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> </span><span style="">Norte, was legal and valid."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To
the foregoing conclusion, We disagree.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the law grants power and authority to the mortgagee to sell the
mortgaged property at a public place in the municipality where the mortgagor
resides, or where the property is situated,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> this Court has
said that the sale of a mortgaged chattel may be made in</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">a place other than
that where it is found, provided that the owner thereof consents thereto; or
that there is an agreement to this effect between the mortgagor and the
mortgagee.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> But when, as in
this case, the parties agreed to have the sale of the mortgaged chattels in the
City of Manila, which, any way, is the residence of the mortgagor, it cannot be
rightly said that the mortgagee still retained the power and authority to
select from among the places provided for in the law and the place designated
in their agreement, over the objection of the mortgagor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In providing that the mortgaged chattel may
be sold at the place of residences of the mortgagor or the place where it is
situated, at the option of the mortgagee, the law clearly contem­plated
benefits not only to</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the
mortgagor but to the mortgagee as well.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their rights arising <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>, however, are
personal to them; they do not affect either public policy or the rights of
third persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They may validly be
waived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, when herein mortga­gor and
mortgagee agreed in the mortgage contract that <u>in cases of both judicial</u></span><u><span style=""> </span><span style="">and extra-judicial </span></u><u><span style="">foreclosure under
Act 1508, as amended, the corresponding complaint for foreclosure or the petition
for sale should be filed with the courts or the Sheriff of </span></u><st1:city><st1:place><u><span style="">Manila</span></u></st1:place></st1:city><u><span style="">, as the case may
be</span></u><span style="">,
they waived their corresponding rights under the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The correlative obli­gation arising from that
agreement have the force of law between them and should be complied with in
good faith.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover,
Section 14 of Act </span><span style="">1508, </span><span style="">as amended,
provides that the officer making the sale should make a return of his doings
which shall particularly describe the articles sold and </span><span style="">the amount </span><span style="">received from each article.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this, it is clear that the law requires
that sale be made article by article, otherwise, it would be impossible for him
to state the mount received for each item.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This require­ment was totally disregarded by the Deputy Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte when he sold the chattels in question in
bulk, notwithstanding the fact that the said chat­tels consisted of no less
than twenty different items as shown in the bill of sale.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> This makes the

</span>And in the absence of any evidence to show that the mort­gagor had

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It
is said that the mortgagee is guilty of con­version when he sells under the
mortgage but not in accordance with its terms, or where the proceedings as to
the sale of foreclosure do not comply with the statute.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> This rule applies
squarely to the facts of this case where, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">earlier shown, herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
b</span><span style="">ank insisted, and the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> deputy sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
Norte proceeded with the sale of the mortgaged chattels at Jose <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte, <span style="">in </span>utter disregard of the valid objection
of the mortgagor thereto for the reason that it is not the place of sale agreed
upon in the mortgage contract; and the said de­puty sheriff sold all the
chattels (among which were a <span class="SpellE">skagit</span> with caterpillar
engine, three GMC 6 x 6 trucks, a Herring Hall Safe, and Sawmill equipments
consisting of a 150 HP Murphy Engine, plainer, large circular saws, etc.) <span style="">as a </span>single lot in violation of the
requirement of the law to sell the same article by article.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The PNB has resold the chattels to another
buyer with whom it appears to have actively cooperated in subsequently taking
possession and removing the chattels from appellant's compound by force, as
shown by the circum­stance that they had to take along PC soldiers and
municipal policemen of Jose <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> who placed the
chief security officer of the premises in jail to deprive herein appellant of
its possession thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To exone­rate
itself of any liability for the breach of peace thus committed, the PNB would
want us to believe that it was the subsequent buyer alone, who is not a party
to this </span><span style="">case, </span><span style="">that was responsible for the forcible taking of the property; but
assuming this to be so, still the PNB can­not escape liability for the
conversion of the mortgaged chattels by parting with its interest in the
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither would its claim that
it afterwards gave a chance to herein appellant to repurchase or redeem the
chattels, improve its position, for the mortgagor is not under ob­ligation to
take affirmative steps to repossess the chat­tels that were converted by the
mortgagee.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> As a con­sequence of the said wrongful acts

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This brings us to the
problem of determining the value of the mortgaged chattels at the time of their

make any finding on the value of the chattels in the decision appealed from and
denied altogether the right of the appellant to recover the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find enough evi­dence of record, however,
which may be used as a guide to ascertain their value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that at the time herein
appellant applied for its loan with the PNB in 1956, for which the chattels in
question were mortgaged as part of the security <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
herein appellant submitted a list of the chattels to­gether with its
application for the loan with a stated value of P107,115.85.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An official of the PNB made an inspection of
the chattels in the same year giving it an appraised value of P42,850.00 and a
market value of P85,700.00.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The same chattels with some addition­al
equipment acquired by herein appellant with part of the proceeds of the loan
were reappraised in </span><span style="">a </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">reinspection</span></span><span style=""> conducted by the same official in 1958, in
the report </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">which he gave all the chattels an appraised value of P26,850.00 and a
market value of P48,200.00.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Another <span class="SpellE">reinspection</span>
report in 1959 gave the appraised value of P19,400.00 and the market value of
P25,600.00.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The said official of the PNB who made the
foregoing reports of inspection and <span class="SpellE">reinspections</span>
testified in court that in giving the values appearing in the reports, he used
a conservative method of appraisal which, of course, is to be expect­ed of an
official of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it appears that the values were
considerably reduced in all the <span class="SpellE">reinspection</span> reports
for the reason that when he went to herein appellant's premises at the time, he
found the chattels no longer in use with some of the heavier equipments
dismantled with parts thereof kept in the bodega; and finding it difficult to
ascertain the value of the dismantled chattels in such condi­tion, he did not
give them anymore any value in his reports.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Noteworthy is the fact, however, that in the last <span class="SpellE">reinspection</span>
report he made of the chattels in 1961, just a few months before the
foreclosure sale, the same inspector of the PNB reported that the heavy
equipments of herein appellant were "lying idle and rusty", but were
"with a shed, free from rains",</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> showing that although they were no longer in
use at the time, they were kept in a proper place and not exposed to the
elements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President of the appellant
company, on the other hand, testified that its caterpillar (tractor) alone is
worth P35,000.00 in the market, and that the value of its two trucks acquired
by it with part of the proceeds of the loan and included as additional items in
the mortgaged chattels were worth no less than P14,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise appraised the worth of its Murphy
engine at P16,000.00 which, according to him, when taken toge­ther with the
heavy equipments he mentioned, the sawmill itself and all other equipments
forming part of the chattels under consideration, and bearing in mind the
current cost of equipments these days which he alleged to have increased by
about five (5) times, could safely be estimated at P120,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This testi­mony, except for the appraised and
market values ap­pearing in the inspection and <span class="SpellE">reinspection</span>
reports of the PNB official earlier mentioned, stand <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>
in the record; but We are not inclined to ac­cept such testimony at its par
value, knowing that the equipments of herein appellant had been idle and unused
since it stopped operating its sawmill in 1958 up to the time of the sale of
the chattels in 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have no doubt
that the value of the chat­tels was depreciated after all those years of <span class="SpellE">inope­ration</span>, although from the evidence aforementioned, We
may also safely conclude that the amount of P4,200.00 for which the </span>chattels
<span style="">were sold in the foreclosure <span style="">sale </span>in question was grossly unfair
to the mortgagor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering, however,
the facts that the appraised value of P42,850.00 and the market value of P85,700.00
originally given by the PNB official were admittedly conservative; that two 6 x
6 trucks subsequently bought by the appellant company had thereafter been added
to the chattels; and that the real value thereof, although depreciated after <span style="">seve­</span>ral years of <span class="SpellE">inoperation</span>,
was in a way maintained be­cause the depreciation is off-set by the marked increase
in the cost of heavy equipment in the market, it <span style="">is </span>our opinion that the market value of the chat­tels at the
time of the sale should be fixed at the original appraised value of P42,850.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Herein appellant's claim
for moral damages, however, <span style="">seems </span>to
have no legal or factual basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ob­viously,

moral shock or social humiliation which are the basis of moral damages.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> A corporation may have a good reputation

already ceased in </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">business opera­tion at the time of the foreclosure sale of the chat­tels,
