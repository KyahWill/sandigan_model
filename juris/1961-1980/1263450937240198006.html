<p class="BODY"><span style="">Alleging that the
aforementioned search warrants are null and void, as contravening the
Constitution and the Rules of Court - because, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>:
<span style="">&nbsp;</span>(1) they do not describe with
particularity the documents, books and things to be seized; (2) cash money, not
mentioned in the warrants, were actually seized; (3) the warrants were issued
to fish evidence against the aforementioned petitioners in deportation cases
filed against them; (4) the searches and seizures were made in an illegal
manner; and (5) the documents, papers and cash money seized were not delivered
to the courts that issued the war­rants, to be disposed of in accordance with
law - on March 20, 1962, said petitioners filed with the Supreme Court this
original action for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus and injunction, and
prayed that, pending final disposition of the present case, a writ of
preliminary injunction be issued re­straining Respondent-Prosecutors, their
agents and/or repre­sentatives from using the effects seized as aforementioned,
or any copies thereof, in the deportation cases already ad­verted to, and that,
in due course, thereafter, decision be rendered quashing the contested search
warrants and declaring the same null and void, and commanding the respondents,
their agents or representatives to return to petitioners herein, in accordance
with Section 3, Rule 67, of the Rules of Court, the documents, papers, things
and cash moneys seized or confiscated under the search warrants in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In their answer,
respondents-prosecutors alleged</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> (1) that the contested search warrants are
valid and have been issued in accordance with law; (2) that the defects of said
warrants, if any, were cured by petitioners' consent; and (3) that, in any
event, the effects seized are admissible in evidence against herein
petitioners, regardless of the alleged illegality of the aforementioned
searches and seizures.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On March 22, 1962, this
Court issued the writ of prelimi­nary injunction prayed for in the
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, by re­solution dated
June 29, 1962, the writ was partially lifted or dissolved, insofar as the
papers, documents and things seized from the offices of the corporations above
mentioned are con­cerned; but, the injunction was maintained as regards the
papers, </span><span style="">documents and things
found and seized in the residences of petitioners herein.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the documents, papers, and things seized under the alleged
authority of the warrants in question may be split into two (2) major groups,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) those found and seized in
the of­fices <span style="">of the aforementioned
corporations, and </span>(b) those found and seized in the residences of
petitioners herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the first group, we hold that petitioners herein have <u>no</u>
cause of action to assail the legality of the contested warrants and of the
seizures made in pursuance thereof, for the simple reason that said
corporations have their respective per­sonalities, separate and distinct from
the personality of herein petitioners, regardless of the amount of shares of
stock or of the interest of each of them in said corporations, and whatever the
offices they hold therein may be.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a> Indeed, it is well set­tled that
the legality of a seizure can be contested only by the party whose rights have
been impaired thereby,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a> and that the objection to an
unlawful search and seizure is <u>purely</u> <u>personal</u> and cannot be
availed of by third parties.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">10</span></span></a> Consequently, petitioners herein
may not validly object to the use in evidence against them of the documents,
papers and things seized from the offices and premises of the corporations
adverted to above, since the right to object to the admission of said papers in
evidence belongs <u>exclusively</u> to the corporations, to whom the seized
effects belong, and may not be invoked by the corporate officers in proceedings
against them in their individual capacity.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">11</span></span></a> In­deed, it has been held:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> that the Government's action in gain­</span>ing
possession of papers <span style="">belonging to the <u>corporation</u>
did not relate to nor did it affect the <u>personal</u> defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If these papers were unlawfully seized and
thereby the constitutional rights of or any one</span> were invaded, they were
the rights of the <u>corporation </u>and <u>not</u> the rights of the <u>other
defendants</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Next, <span style="">it is </span>clear that a question of the law­fulness
of a seizure can be raised <u>only</u> by one <u>whose rights have been invaded</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, such a <span style="">seiz­</span>ure, if unlawful, could <u>not</u> affect the constitu­tional
rights of defendants <u>whose property had not been seized or the privacy of
whose homes had not been <span style="">disturbed</span></u><span style="">; </span>nor could they claim for themselves
the benefits of the Fourth Amendment, when its violation, if any, was with
reference to the rights of <u>another</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Remus</span> <span style="">vs.
United </span>States (C.C.A.) 291 F501, 511.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It follows, therefore, that the question of the <span style="">admissibility </span>of the evidence based on an alleged unlawful search
and seizure does <u>not</u> <span style="">ex­</span>tend
to the personal defendants but embraces <u>only the corporation</u> whose
property was taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." </span>(A. <span class="SpellE">Guckenheimer</span> &amp;
Bros. Co. vs. United States, [1925] 3 F. 2d, 786, 789, underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With respect to the
documents, papers and things seized in the residences of petitioners herein,
the aforementioned resolution of June 29, 1962, <span style="">denied the </span>lifting of the writ of preliminary injunction
previously issued by this Court,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span></a><span style=""> thereby, in effect, restraining herein Respondent-Prosecutors from
using them in evidence against petitioners herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In connection with said
documents, papers and things, </span>two (2) important questions need be
settled, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) whe­ther the search
warrants in question, and the searches and seizures made under the authority
thereof, are valid or not; and (2) if the answer to the preceding question is
in the negative, whether said documents, papers and things may be used in
evidence against petitioners <span style="">herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners
</span><span style="">maintain that the aforementioned
search war­rants are in the nature of general warrants and that, accord­ingly,
the <span style="">seizures </span>effected upon the
authority thereof are null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
this connection, the Constitution</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">13</span></span></a> <span style="">provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The right of the people to be secure in their persons,
houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and <span style="">seizures </span>shall not be violated, and no
warrants shall <span style="">issue </span>but upon
probable cause, to be determined <span style="">by </span>the
judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the com­plainant and the
witnesses he may produce, and par­<span style="">ticularly
</span>describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be
seized."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Two points must be
stressed in connection with this con­<span style="">stitutional
mandate, </span>namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that no
warrant shall issue </span>but <u><span style="">upon probable </span></u><u><span style="">cause</span></u><span style="">, </span>to be
determined by the judge in the <span style="">manner
set forth in said provision; and (2) that the warrant shall </span><u><span style="">particularly</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">describe
the things to be <span style="">seized.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">None of these
requirements has been complied with in the contested warrants.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the same were issued upon appli­cations
stating that the natural and juridical persons therein </span><span style="">named had committed a "violation of
Central Bank Laws, Tariff and Customs Laws, Internal Revenue (Code) and Revised
Penal Code." In other words, no <u>specific</u> offense had been alleged
in said applications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The averments
thereof with respect to the offense committed were <u>abstract</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, it was <u>impossible</u>
for the judges who issued the warrants to have found the existence of probable
cause, for the same presup­poses the introduction of competent proof that the
party against whom it is sought has performed <u>particular</u> acts, or
committed <u>specific</u> omissions, violating a given provision of our
criminal laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, the
applications in­volved in this case do not allege any specific acts performed
by herein petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be a
legal heresy, of the highest order, to convict anybody of a "violation of Central
Bank Laws, Tariff and Customs Laws, Internal Revenue (Code) and Revised Penal
Code," - as alleged in the aforementioned applications - without reference
to any determinate provision of said laws or codes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To uphold the validity of
the warrants in question would be to wipe out completely one of the most
fundamental rights guaranteed in our Constitution, for it would place the
sanctity of the domicile and the privacy of communication and correspond­ence
at the mercy of the whims, caprice or passion of peace of­ficers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is precisely the evil sought to be
remedied by the constitutional provision above quoted - to outlaw the so-called
general warrants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not difficult to
imagine what would happen, in times of keen political strife, when the party in
power feels that the minority is likely to wrest it, even though by legal
means.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Such is the seriousness
of the irregularities committed in connection with the disputed search
warrants, that this Court deemed it fit to amend Section 3 of Rule 122 of the
former Rules of Court</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span></a><span style=""> by providing in its counterpart under the
Revised Rules of Court</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">15</span></span></a><span style=""> that "a search warrant shall not is</span><span style="">sue but upon probable cause <u>in connection
with one specific of­fense</u>."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not satisfied with this qualification, the Court added thereto a
paragraph, directing that "no search warrant shall <span style="">is­</span>sue for more than <u>one</u> specific offense."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The grave violation of the Constitution made in the appli­cation
for the contested search warrants was compounded by the description therein
made of the effects to be searched for and seized, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"Books of accounts, financial records, vouchers, journals,
correspondence, receipts, ledgers, portfolios, credit journals, type­writers,
and other documents and/or papers showing all business transactions including
disbursement receipts, balance sheets and re­lated profit and loss
statements."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the warrants authorized the search for and seizure of
records pertaining to <u>all business transactions</u> of peti­tioners herein,
regardless of whether the transactions were <u>legal</u> or <u>illegal</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The warrants sanctioned the <span style="">seizure </span>of all records of the
petitioners and the aforementioned corporations, whatever their nature, thus
openly contravening the explicit command of our Bill of Rights - that the
things to be seized be <u>particularly </u>described - as well as tending to
defeat its major objective: the elimination of <u>general </u>warrants.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Relying upon <span class="SpellE">Moncado</span> vs. People's Court (80 Phil. 1),
Respondent-Prosecutors maintain that, <span style="">even
</span>if the searches and seizures under consideration were <span style="">unconstitutional, the </span>documents,
papers and things thus seized are admissible in evidence against petitioners
herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon mature <span style="">delibera­</span>tion, however, we are
unanimously of the opinion that the position taken in the <span class="SpellE">Moncado</span>
case must be abandoned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said position
was in line with the American common law rule, that the criminal should not be
allowed to go free merely "because the constable has blundered,"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">16</span></span></a><span style=""> upon the theory that the constitutional
prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures is protected by means
other than the exclusion of </span><span style="">evidence
unlawfully obtained,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">17</span></span></a><span style=""> such as the common-law action for damages
against the searching officer, against the party who procured the issuance of
the search warrant and against those assisting in the execution of an illegal
search, their criminal punishment, resistance, without liability to an unlawful
seizure, and such other legal re­medies as may be provided by other laws.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, most common law
jurisdictions have already given up this approach and eventually adopted the
exclusionary rule, realizing that this is <u>the only practical means of
enforcing the constitutional injunction</u> against </span><span style="">unreasonable </span><span style="">searches and seizures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the language of Judge Learned Hand:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"As we understand it, the reason for the ex­clusion of
evidence competent as such, which has been unlawfully acquired, is that
exclusion is the only practical way of enforcing the constitu­tional
privilege.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In earlier times the action
of trespass against the offending official may have been protection enough; but
that is true no longer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only in case the
prosecution which itself controls the seizing officials, knows that <u>it
cannot profit by their wrong, will that wrong be repressed</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">18</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In fact, over thirty (30)
years before, the Federal Su­preme Court had already declared:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"If letters and private documents can thus be seized and held
and used in evidence against a citizen accused of an offense, the protection of
the 4th Amendment, declaring his rights to be secure against such searches and
seizures, is of <u>no value</u>, and, so far as those thus placed are
concerned, might as well be stricken from the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The efforts of the courts and their
officials to bring the guilty to punish­ment</u>, <u>praiseworthy <span style="">as </span>they are, are not to be aided by
the sacrifice of those great princi­ples established by years of endeavor and
suf­fering which have resulted in their embodiment<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in the fundamental law of the land</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">19</span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This view was, not only
reiterated, but, also broadened </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">subsequent decisions of the same Federal
Court.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">20</span></span></a><span style=""> After reviewing previous decisions thereon, said Court held, in <span class="SpellE">Mapp</span> vs. </span><st1:state><st1:place><span style="">Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:state><span style=""> (<u>supra</u>.):<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Today we
once again examine the Wolf's constitutional documentation of the right of
privacy free from unreasonable state intrusion, and, after its dozen years on
our books, are led by it to close the only courtroom door remaining open to
evidence secured by official lawlessness in flagrant abuse of that basic right,
reserved to all persons as a speci­fic guarantee against that very same
unlawful conduct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We held that all
evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is,
by that same authority, inadmissible in a State court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Since the Fourth Amendment's right of privacy has been declared
enforceable against the States through the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth, it is enforceable against them by the same sanction of exclusion as
it used against the Federal Govern­ment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Were it otherwise, then just as without the Weeks rule the assurance
against unreasonable federal searches and seizures would be 'a form of words',
valueless and <span class="SpellE">underserving</span> of mention in a perpetual
charter of inestimable human liberties, so too, <u>with­out that rule the
freedom from state invasions of privacy would be so ephemeral and so neatly
severed from its conceptual nexus with the freedom from all brutish means of
coercing evidence as not to permit this Court's high regard as a freedom
'implicit in the concept of ordered liberty</u>.' At the time that the Court
held in Wolf that the Amendment was applicable to the States through the Due
Process Clause, the cases of this Court as we have seen, had steadfastly held
that as to federal officers the Fourth Amendment included the exclusion of the
evidence seized in viola­tion of its provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even wolf 'stoutly ad­hered' to that
proposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right to privacy, when
conceded operatively enforceable against the States, was not susceptible of des­truction
by avulsion of the sanction upon which its protection and enjoyment had always
been deemed dependent under the Boyd, Weeks and Silverthorne Cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, in extending the substantive
protections of due process to all constitutionally un­reasonable searches -
state or federal - it was logi­cally and constitutionally necessary that the
exclu­sion doctrine - an essential part of the right to privacy - be also
insisted upon as an essential ingredient of the right newly recognized by the
Wolf Case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, <u>the admission of
the new constitu­tional right by Wolf could not consistently toler­ate denial
of its most important constitutional privilege</u>, <u>namely</u>, <u>the
exclusion of the evidence which an accused had been forced to give by rea­son
of the unlawful seizure</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>To hold
otherwise is to grant the right but in reality to withhold its privilege and
enjoyment</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only last year the Court
itself recognized that <u>the purpose of the exclusionary rule 'is to deter -
to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively
available way - by removing the incentive to disregard it</u>.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The ignoble shortcut to conviction left open to the State
tends to destroy the entire system of constitutional restraints on which the
liberties of the people rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having
once recognized that the right to privacy embodied in the Fourth Amendment is
enforceable against the States, and that the right to be secure against rude
invasions of privacy by state officers is, therefore constitu­tional in origin,
<u>we can no longer permit that right to remain an empty promise</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because it is enforceable in the same manner
and to like effect as other basic rights secured by the Due Process Clause, <u>we
can no <span class="SpellE">longer_permit</span> it to be revocable at the whim
of any police officer who, in the name of law enforcement itself, chooses to
suspend its enjoyment</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Our
decision, founded on reason and truth, gives to the individual no more than
that which the Constitution guarantees him, to the police officer no less than
that to which honest law enforce­ment is entitled, and, to the courts, that
judicial integrity so necessary in the true administration of justice</u>."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Underscoring ours.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Indeed, the non-exclusionary rule
is contrary, not only to the letter, but, also, to spirit of the constitutional
injunction against unreasonable searches and seizures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, if the applicant for a search
warrant has competent evi­dence to establish probable cause of the commission
of a given crime by the party against whom the warrant is intended, then there
is no reason why the applicant should not comply with the requirements of the
fundamental law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, if
he has no such competent evidence, then it is <u>not</u> <u>possible</u> for
the Judge to find that there is probable cause, and, hence, no justification
for the issuance of the warrant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
only possible explanation (not justification) for its issuance is the necessity
of <u>fishing</u> evidence of the commission of a crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, then, this fishing expedition is
indicative of the absence of evidence to establish a probable cause.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Moreover, the theory that the
criminal prosecution of those who secure an illegal search warrant and/or make
un­reasonable searches or seizures would suffice to protect the constitutional
guarantee under consideration, overlooks the fact that violations thereof are,
in general, committed by agents of the party in power, for, certainly, those
belonging to the minority could not possibly abuse a power they do not
have.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regardless of the handicap under
which the minority usually - but, understandably - finds itself in prosecuting
agents of the majority, one must not lose sight of the fact that the
psychological and moral effect of the possibility</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">21</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> of securing their conviction, is watered down by the
pardoning power of the party for whose benefit the illegality had been
committed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In their Motion for
Reconsideration and Amendment of the Resolution of this Court dated June 29,
1962, petition­ers allege that Rooms Nos. 81 and 91 of Carmen Apartments, House
No. 2008, Dewey Boulevard, House No. 1436, Colorado Street, and Room No. 304 of
the Army-Navy Club, should be included among the premises considered in said
Resolution as residences of herein petitioners, Harry S. <span class="SpellE">Stonehill</span>,
Robert P. Brook, John J. Brooks and Karl Beck, respectively, and that,
furthermore, the records, papers and other ef­fects seized in the offices of
the corporations above referred to include personal belongings of said
petitioners and other effects under their exclusive possession and con­trol,
for the exclusion of which they have a standing under the latest rulings of the
federal courts of the United States.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">22</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">We note, however, that
petitioners' theory, regarding their alleged possession of and control over the
aforemen­tioned records, papers and effects, and the alleged
"personal" nature thereof, has been advanced, <u>not</u> in their petition
or amended petition herein, but in the Motion for Recon­sideration and
Amendment of the Resolution of </span><st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="6"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">June 29, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 11pt;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, said theory would appear to be a readjustment of that followed in said
petitions, to suit the approach in­timated in the Resolution sought to be
reconsidered and amend­ed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, too,
some of the affidavits or copies of alleged affidavits attached to said motion
for reconsideration, or submitted in support thereof, contain either
inconsistent allegations, or allegations inconsistent with the theory now
advanced by petitioners herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Upon the other hand, we are not
satisfied that the alle­gations of said petitions and motion for
reconsideration, and the contents of the aforementioned affidavits and other
papers submitted in support of said motion, have sufficiently esta­blished the
facts or conditions contemplated in the cases relied upon by the petitioners,
to warrant application of the views therein expressed, should we agree
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, we do not deem it
necessary to express our opinion thereon, it being best to leave the matter
open for determi­nation in appropriate cases in the future.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">We hold, therefore, that the
doctrine adopted in the <span class="SpellE">Mon­cado</span> case must be, as it
is hereby, abandoned; that the war­rants for the search of three (3) residences
of herein petitioners, as specified in the Resolution of June 29, 1962, are
null and void; that the searches and seizures therein made are illegal; that
the writ of preliminary injunction hereto­fore issued, in connection with the
documents, papers and other effects thus seized in said residences of herein
peti­tioners is hereby made permanent; that the writs prayed for are granted,
insofar as the documents, papers and other ef­fects so seized in the
aforementioned residences are concern­ed; that the aforementioned motion for
Reconsideration and Amendment should be, as it is hereby, denied; and that the
petition herein is dismissed and the writs prayed for denied, as regards the
documents, papers and other effects seized in the twenty-nine (29) places,
offices and other premises enumerated in the same Resolution, without special
pronouncement as to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">CASTRO, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">From my analysis of the opinion written by Chief Justice Roberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> and from the import of the de­liberations of the
Court on this case, I gather the following distinct conclusions:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR"><u>All</u> the search warrants
served by the National Bureau </span><span style="">of
Investigation in </span>this case are general warrants and are therefore
proscribed by, and in violation of paragraph <span style="">3 </span>of section 1 of Article III (Bill of Rights) of the
Constitution;</p>

<span style="">null </span>and void; the searches and
seizures <span style="">therein </span>made are <u><span style="">expressly</span></u><span style=""> </span>declared illegal; and the writ of preliminary injunction
heretofore issued against the use of the documents, papers and effects seized
in the said residences is made <span style="">permanent;

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Reasoning that the petitioners
have not in their pleadings satisfactorily demonstrated that they have legal
standing to move for the suppression of the documents, pa­pers and effects
seized in the places other than to three residences adverted to above, the
opinion written by the Chief Justice <u>refrains</u> from </span><u><span style="">expressly</span></u><span style=""> </span>declaring as null and void the search warrants served at such
other places and as illegal the searches and seizures made therein, and leaves
"the matter open for determination in appropriate cases in the
future".</p>

<p class="BODY">It is precisely the position taken by the Chief Justice
summarized in the immediately preceding paragraph (numbered 5) with which I am
not in accord.</p>

<p class="BODY">I do not share his reluctance or unwillingness to expressly
declare, at this time, the nullity of the search warrants served at places
other than the three residences, and the illegality of the searches and
seizures conducted under the authority thereof. In my view even the exacer<span style="">bating passions and prejudices inordinately
generated by the environmental political and moral developments of this case
should not deter this Court from forthrightly laying down the law -- not only
for this case but as well for future cases and future generations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>All</u> the search warrants, without
exception, in this case are admittedly general, blanket and roving warrants and
are therefore admittedly and indisputably outlawed by the Constitution; and the
searches and seizures made were therefore unlawful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the peti­tioners, let us assume <u>in</u>
</span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">gratia</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>argumenti</u></span>, </span><span style="">have no legal standing to ask for the
suppression of the papers, things and effects seized from places other than
their residences, to my mind, cannot in any manner effect, alter or otherwise
modify the </span><span style="">intrinsic </span><span style="">nullity of the search warrants and the
intrinsic illegality of the searches and seizures made there ­under.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the petitioners possess legal
standing, the said warrants are void and remain void, and the searches and
seizures were illegal and remain illegal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No inference can be drawn from the words of the Constitution that
"legal standing" or the lack of it is a determinant of the nullity or
validity of a search warrant or of the lawfulness or ille­gality of a search or
seizure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><span style="">the question of legal standing, I am of the
conviction that, upon the pleadings submitted to this Court, the petitioners
have the requisite legal standing to move for the suppression and return of the
documents, papers and effects that were seized from places other than their family
residences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Our constitutional provision on searches and seizures was derived
almost <u><span style="">verbatim</span></u><span style=""> </span>from the Fourth Amendment to the
United States Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the many
years of judicial construction and interpretation of the said constitutional
provision, our courts have invariably regarded as doctrinal the pronouncements
made on the Fourth Amendment by federal courts, especially the Federal Supreme
Court and the Federal Circuit Courts of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">&nbsp; </span>doctrines and pertinent cases on standing to
move for the suppression or return of documents, papers and effects which are
the fruits of an unlawful search and sei­zure, may be summarized as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) ownership of docu­ments,
papers and effects gives "standing"; (b) ownership and/or control or
possession - actual or constructive - of premises searched gives
"standing"; and (c) the "aggrieved person" doctrine where
the search warrant and the sworn ap­plication for search warrant are
"primarily" directed solely and exclusively against the
"aggrieved person", gives "stand<span style="">ing".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">An examination of the
search warrants in this case will readily show that, excepting three, all were
directed against the petitioners personally.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In some of them, the petitioners were named personally, followed by the
designation, "the President and/or General Manager" of the par­ticular
corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three warrants excepted
named three corporate defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
the "office/house/warehouse/premises" mentioned in the said three
warrants were also the same "office/house/warehouse/premises"
declared to be owned by or under the control of the petitioners in all the
other search warrants directed against the petitioners and/or "the
President and/or General Manager" of the particular corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(see pages 5-24 of Petitioners' Reply of </span><st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="4"><span style="">April 2,

and were actually made, in the "office/house/warehouse/premises"
owned by or under the control of the petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="">Ownership of matters
seized gives "standing</span></u><span style="">".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Ownership of the properties seized alone entitles the petitioners

<p class="BODY">In a very recent case (decided by the U.S. Supreme Court on
December 12, 1966), it was held that under the constitu­tional provision
against unlawful searches and seizures, a person places himself or his property
within a constitutional­ly protected area, be it his home or his office, his
hotel room or his automobile:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">"Where the argument
falls is in its misap­prehension of the fundamental nature and scope of Fourth
Amendment protection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the Fourth
Amendment protects is the security a man relies upon when he <u>places himself
or his property within a constitutionally protected area, be it his home, </u></span><u><span style="">or his office, his hotel room or his
automobile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></u><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There he is protected
from unwarranted governmental intrusion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And when he puts something in his filing cabinet, in his desk drawer, or
in his pocket, he has the right to know it will be secure from an unreasonable
search or an un­reasonable seizure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
it was that the Fourth Amendment could not tolerate the <span class="SpellE">warrantless</span>
search of the hotel room in <u>Jeffers</u>, the pur­loining of the petitioner's
private papers in <span class="SpellE"><u>Gouled</u></span>, or the surreptitious
electronic sur­veillance in <u>Silverman</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Countless other cases which have come to this Court over the years have

the present petitioners; as in <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Birrell</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>many

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Prescinding</span> from the foregoing, this
Court, at all events, should order the return to the petitioners all <u><span style="">personal</span></u><span style=""> and </span><u>private</u> papers and effects seized, no matter where

other place or places.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE"><u>uncontradicted</u></span> sworn statements of the petitioners

amongst the things seized from the corporate offices and other places were <u><span style="">personal</span></u><span style="">, </span>and <u><span style="">private</span></u><span style=""> </span>papers and effects belonging to the
petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="">If</span></u><span style=""> </span>there should be any categorization of

unlawfully seized, be it their family residences, offices, warehouses and/or

by them as shown in all the search warrants and in the sworn applications filed
in securing the void search warrants, and (b) purely <u><span style="">corporate</span></u><span style=""> </span>papers
be­longing to corporations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under such
categorization or grouping, the determination of which unlawfully seized
papers, documents and things are <u><span style="">personal/private</span></u><span style=""> </span>of the petitioners or <u><span style="">purely </span>corporate papers</u> will have
to be left to the lower courts which <span style="">issued
the void search warrants in ultimately effecting the suppression and/or return
of the said documents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">And as unequivocally indicated by the authorities above cited,
the petitioners likewise have clear legal standing to move for the suppression
of <u>purely corporate </u>papers <span style="">as </span>"President

search warrants.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, I must articulate my persuasion that <span style="">although </span>the cases cited in my <span style="">disquisition were criminal prosecutions, </span>the
great clauses of the constitutional proscription on illegal searches and
seizures do not withhold the mantle of their protection from cases not criminal
