<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">During the period of May 11 to 
15, 1960, a shipment of 69 cases containing radio parts was discharged from the 
vessel S.S. <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Compañia</span> <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> and placed in 
the Special Cargo Coral of the Manila Port Service which was then operating the 
<span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service at the Port of Manila, said shipment 
being consigned to the order of the <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span> Iron 
Mines, Inc. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After paying the sum of P42.14 
representing the arrastre charges, the shipment was delivered to the consignee 
thru a delivery permit on the back of which was stamped a notice limiting the 
liability of the Manila Port Service. In addition to such delivery permit, there 
was also delivered to the consignee pertinent gate passes on which was printed 
an annotation containing a similar notice relative to the limitation of the 
liability of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator, and after 
examining the shipment as delivered in the manner above-mentioned, the consignee 
discovered that of the 69 cases of radio parts which were discharged from the 
carrying vessel into the custody of the Manila Port Service, only 65 cases were 
available, because 4 cases were found missing. The total invoice value of the 
radio parts contained in the missing cases is $1,683.59 which, converted to our 
currency, amounts to P3,402.50. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The shipment having been assigned 
to one <span class="SpellE">Chiok</span> Ho, the latter on May 9, 1961 made a 
formal demand upon the Manila Port Service for the payment of said sum of 
P3.402.50, and upon its refusal to do so, <span class="SpellE">Chiok</span> Ho 
commenced the present action before the Court of Fir3' Instance of Manila to 
recover not only the amount of P3<span class="GramE">,402.50</span>, but also 
Pl.500.00 as attorney's fees, and P500.00 as expenses of litigation. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Manila Port 
Service and the Manila Railroad Company, which became the real defendants in the 
case.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="GramE">denied</span> in their answer the material allegations of the 
complaint and, as special defense, set up the management contract entered into 
between the Bureau of Customs and the Manila Port Service the contents of which 
were known to, and are binding on the plaintiff. And after the parties had 
submitted a partial stipulation of facts, but without submitting any additional 
evidence as was reserved in said stipulation, the court a quo rendered decision 
ordering defendants to "pay, jointly and severally, to plaintiff the amount of 
P3<span class="GramE">,402.60</span>, with interest thereon at the legal rate from 
the date of the filing of the complaint, plus the sum of P1,000.00 as attorney's 
fees and the costs of action. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Defendants interposed the present 
appeal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the delivery permit and the 
pertinent gate passes which were used by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> 
to withdraw the shipment in question from the customs house where the same was 
deposited, there was stamped thereon a notice containing section 15 of the 
management contract entered into between the Bureau of Customs and the Manila 
Port Service relative to the liability of the Manila Port Service regarding said 
shipment wherein it was expressly provided that when the claim for indemnity for 
a particular loss is rejected such claim shall be filed with said Manila Port 
Service "within 15 days from the date of discharge °f the last package from the 
carrying vessel." Since the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> did not file his 
claim with the Manila Port Service within the aforesaid period from 
</span><st1:date year="1960" day="15" month="5"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 15, 
1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the 
date of discharge of the last package of the shipment the carrying vessel, 
defendants contend that his claim is already barred and, consequently, his 
action should be dismissed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, however, contends that it was impossible him to 
comply with the above requirement because the shipment was only delivered to him 
after the expiration of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> 15-day period 
for which reason he only filed the claim required in the agreement much 
thereafter or on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="13" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 13, 
1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
relative to cases covered by Bill of Lading No. <span class="GramE">Y-MA-10, and 
on </span></span><st1:date year="1960" day="16" month="6"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 16, 
1960</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> relative to cases covered by 
Bill of Lading No.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="GramE">Y-MA-11.</span> He cannot, therefore, he considered as having 
infringed the above requirement and, consequently, his complaint has a good 
cause of action. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The stipulation of facts 
submitted in this case between the parties, however, is totally bereft of the 
needed data for an intelligent determination of this case for there is nothing 
said therein as to when the shipment was actually delivered to the consignee. 
Said stipulation merely shows that from May 11 to 15, 1960 the shipment of 69 
cases of radio parts was discharged from the carrying vessel and placed in the 
Special Cargo Coral of the Manila Port Service where it stayed indefinitely, 
while the next important item mentioned therein is that the consignee made a 
provisional claim for certain alleged loss on two occasions, one on June 13, 
1960 relative to the cargo covered by Bill of Lading No. <span class="GramE">Y-MA-10 and another on </span></span><st1:date year="1960" day="16" month="6"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 16, 
1960</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> relative to the cargo covered by 
Bill of Lading No.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="GramE">Y-MA-11.</span> But the stipulation is completely silent as to when 
the shipment was delivered to the consignee. It is not enough that the consignee 
be notified of the discharge of the shipment from the carrying vessel in order 
that section 15 of the management agreement may be applicable. It is equally 
important to indicate the date when the shipment was actually delivered to the 
consignee in order that he may be the chance to discover if there is something, 
missing lost in the shipment. Only in this way can he be apprised of the loss 
and file the necessary <span class="SpellE">claim,—not</span> otherwise since this 
is a matter of defense on the part of the defendants, in the absence of proof to 
the contrary, it should be presumed that the claim was filed within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, as properly found by the lower court. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Secondly, the provision of 
Section 15 of the Management tract is a matter of defense, in fact <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> in defendants’ Answer as an affirmative and 
special defense. The burden <span class="GramE">was,</span> therefore, upon the 
defendants to prove that all conditions necessary to its applicability to the 
case at bar exist. Among the conditions imposed by said section are (a) that the 
cargo handled by the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator is delivered to 
the importer or consignee within 15 days from the date of discharge from the 
carrying vessel without being stored in the meantime in the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator's Special Cargo Corral for a length of 
time reading beyond the 15-day period, (b) that the loss of cargo occurred 
during the 15-day period, and (c) that the importer or consignee knew of such 
loss. Not one of these conditions was proved by the defendants. Therefore, as 
the situation contemplated by Section 15 of the Management Contract has not been 
shown by the defendants, the Court is constrained to rule that the 15-day period 
for the filing of a provisional claim cannot be applied in the instant 
case."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision appealed from is 
affirmed. No costs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
