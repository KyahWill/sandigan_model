				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Appeal on a question of law from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Palawan in Civil Case No. 416, entitled "<i>Delfin Lim and Jikil Taha vs. Francisco Ponce de Leon and Orlando Maddela</i>", dismissing the complaint of the plaintiffs and ordering them to pay each of the defendants jointly and severally the sum of P500.00 by way of actual damages; P500.00 by way of attorney's fees; and P1,000.00 by way of exemplary damages.<br><br>On April 29, 1961, plaintiff-appellant Jikil Taha sold to a certain Alberto Timbangcaya of Brooke's Point, Palawan a motor launch named M/L "SAN RAFAEL".&nbsp; A year later or on April 9, 1962 Alberto Timbangcaya filed a complaint with the Office of the Provincial Fiscal of Palawan alleging that after the sale Jikil Taha forcibly took away the motor launch from him.<br><br>On May 14, 1962, after conducting a preliminary investigation, Fiscal Francisco Ponce de Leon, in his capacity as Acting Provincial Fiscal of Palawan, filed with the Court of First Instance of Palawan the corresponding information for Robbery with Force and Intimidation upon Persons against Jikil Taha.&nbsp; The case was docketed as Criminal Case No. 2719.<br><br>On June 15, 1962, Fiscal Francisco Ponce de Leon, upon being informed that the motor launch was in Balabac, Palawan, wrote the Provincial Commander of Palawan requesting him to direct the detachment commander in Balabac to impound and take custody of the motor launch.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>On June 26, 1962, Fiscal Ponce de Leon reiterated his request to the Provincial Commander to impound the motor launch, explaining that its subsequent sale to a third party, plaintiff-appellant Delfin Lim, cannot prevent the court from taking custody of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> So, on July 6, 1962 upon order of the Provincial Commander, defendant-appellee Orlando Maddela, Detachment Commander of Balabac, Palawan, seized the motor launch "SAN RAFAEL" from plaintiff-appellant Delfin Lim and impounded it.<br><br>On July 15, 1962 plaintiff-appellant Delfin Lim pleaded with Orlando Maddela to return the motor launch but the latter refused.&nbsp; Likewise, on September 20, 1962, kill Taha through his counsel made representations with Fiscal Ponce de Leon to return the seized property to plaintiff-appellant Delfin Lim but Fiscal Ponce de Leon refused, on the ground that the same was the subject of a criminal offense.<br><br>All efforts to recover the motor launch going to naught, plaintiffs-appellants Delfin Lim and Jikil Taha, on November 19, 1962, filed with the Court of First Instance of Palawan a complaint for damages against defendants-appellees Fiscal Francisco Ponce de Leon and Orlando Maddela, alleging that on July 6, 1962 Orlando Maddela entered the premises of Delfin Lim without a search warrant and then and there took away the hull of the motor launch without his consent; that he effected the seizure upon order of Fiscal Ponce de Leon who knew fully well that his office was not vested with authority to order the seizure of a private property; that said motor launch was purchased by Delfin Lim from Jikil Taha in consideration of Three Thousand Pesos (P3,000.00), Two Thousand Pesos (P2,000.00) of which has been given to Jikil Taha as advance payment; that as a consequence of the unlawful seizure of the motor launch, its sale did not materialize; and that since July 6, 1962, the said motor launch had been moored at the Balabac Bay, Palawan and because of exposure to the elements it had become worthless and beyond repair.&nbsp; For the alleged violation of their constitutional rights, plaintiffs-appellants prayed that defendants-appellees be ordered to pay jointly and severally each of them the sum of P5,750.00 representing actual, moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees.<br><br>In their answer, defendants-appellees denied the material allegations of the complaint and as affirmative defenses alleged that the motor launch in question which was sold by Jikil Taha to Alberto Timbangcaya on April 29, 1961 was sometime in April 1962, forcibly taken with violence upon persons and with intent to gain by Jikil Taha from Alfredo Timbangcaya without the latter's knowledge and consent, thus giving rise to the filing of a criminal charge of robbery against Jikil Taha; that Fiscal Ponce de Leon, in his capacity as Acting Provincial Fiscal of Palawan ordered Orlando Maddela to seize and impound the motor launch "SAN RAFAEL", for being the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the robbery; and that Orlando Maddela merely obeyed the orders of his superior officer to impound said launch.&nbsp; By way of counterclaim, defendants-appellees alleged that because of the malicious and groundless filing of the complaint by plaintiffs-appellants, they were constrained to engage the services of lawyers, each of them paying P500.00 as attorney's fees; and that they suffered moral damages in the amount of P5,000.00 each and actual damages in the amount of P500.00 each.&nbsp; They also prayed that each of them be awarded exemplary damages in the amount of P1,000.00.<br><br>On September 13, 1965, the trial court rendered its decision, upholding the validity of the seizure of the motor launch on the ground that "the authority to impound evidences or exhibits or <i>corpus delicti</i> in a case pending investigation is inherent in the Provincial Fiscal who controls the prosecution and who introduces those exhibits in the court." Accordingly, the trial court dismissed the complaint of plaintiffs-appellants and ordered them to pay jointly and severally each of the defendants-appellees the amount of P500.00 by way of actual damages, another amount of P500.00 for attorney's fees and P1,000.00 as exemplary damages.<br><br>Hence, this appeal.<br><br>Two vital issues call for resolution by this Court.&nbsp; First, whether or not defendant-appellee Fiscal Ponce de Leon had the power to order the seizure of the motor launch in question without a warrant of search and seizure even if the same was admittedly the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime.&nbsp; Second, whether or not defendants-appellees are civilly liable to plaintiffs-appellants for damages allegedly suffered by them granting that the seizure of the motor launch was unlawful.<br><br>The gravamen of plaintiffs-appellants' argument is that the taking of the motor launch on July 6, 1962 by Orlando Maddela upon the order of Fiscal Ponce de Leon was in violation of the constitutional guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures since it was done without a search warrant.<br><br>The pertinent provision of the Constitution then in force reads:<br><br><blockquote>"(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, to be determined by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br>A cursory reading of the above provision easily brings into focus the unreasonableness of the seizure of the aforementioned motor launch.&nbsp; A search and seizure to be reasonable, must be effected by means of a valid search warrant.&nbsp; And for a search warrant to be valid:&nbsp; (1) it must be issued upon probable cause; (2) the probable cause must be determined by the judge himself and not by the applicant or any other person; (3) in the determination of probable cause, the judge must examine, under oath or affirmation, the complainant and such witnesses as the latter may produce; and (4) the warrant issued must particularly describe the place to be searched and persons or things to be seized.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Thus in a long line of decisions, this Court has declared invalid search warrants which were issued in utter disregard of the constitutional injunction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Defendants-appellees admitted that when Orlando Maddela entered the premises of Delfin Lim and impounded the motor launch he was not armed with a search warrant; that he effected the seizure of the motor launch in the absence of and without the consent of Delfin Lim.&nbsp; There can be no question that without the proper search warrant, no public official has the right to enter the premises of another without his consent for the purpose of search and seizure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> And since in the present case defendants-appellees seized the motor launch without a warrant, they have violated the constitutional right of plaintiffs-appellants against unreasonable search and seizure.<br><br>Defendants-appellees however would want to justify the seizure of the motor launch even without a warrant because of Fiscal Ponce de Leon's alleged inherent power to order the seizure of a personal property which is the <i>corpus delicti</i> of a crime, he being a <i>quasi</i> judicial officer who has the control of the prosecution and the presentation of the evidence in the criminal case.&nbsp; They argue that inasmuch as the motor launch in question was allegedly stolen by Jikil Taha from Timbangcaya, Fiscal Ponce de Leon could order its seizure even without a search warrant.&nbsp; We cannot agree.&nbsp; Under the old Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> the power to issue a search warrant is vested in a judge or magistrate and in no other officer and no search and seizure can be made without a proper warrant.&nbsp; At the time the act complained of was committed, there was no law or rule that recognized the authority of Provincial Fiscals to issue a search warrant.&nbsp; In his vain attempt to justify the seizure of the motor launch in question without a warrant Fiscal Ponce de Leon invoked the provisions of Republic Act No. 732, which amended Sections 1674 and 1687 of the Revised Administrative Code.&nbsp; But there is nothing in said law which confers upon the provincial fiscals the authority to issue warrants, much less to order without warrant the seizure of a personal property even if it is the <i>corpus delicti</i> of a crime.&nbsp; True, Republic Act No. 732 has broadened the power of provincial fiscals to conduct preliminary investigations, but said law did not divest the judge or magistrate of its power to determine, before issuing the corresponding warrant, whether or not probable cause exists therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Moreover, under Sections 2 and 3 of Rule 122 of the Rules of Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> which complement the constitutional provision earlier cited, two principles are made clear, namely:&nbsp; (1) that in the seizure of a stolen property search warrant is still necessary; and (2) that in issuing a search warrant the judge alone determines whether or not there is a probable cause.&nbsp; The fact that a thing is a <i>corpus delicti</i> of a crime does not justify its seizure without a warrant.&nbsp; As held in <i>U.S. vs. de los Reyes and Esguerra</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> citing McClurg vs. Brenton:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"The mere fact that a man is an officer, whether of high or low degree, gives him no more right than is possessed by the ordinary private citizen to break in upon the privacy of a home and subject its occupant to the indignity of a search for the evidence of crime, without a legal warrant procured for that purpose.&nbsp; <i>No amount of incriminating evidence, whatever its source, will supply the place of such warrant.</i>&nbsp; At the closed door of the home be it palace or hovel, even bloodhounds must wait till the law, by authoritative process, bids it open." (Italics supplied.)</blockquote><br>Defendant-appellee Fiscal Ponce de Leon would also invoke lack of time to procure a search warrant as an excuse for the seizure of the motor launch without one.&nbsp; He claimed that the motor launch had to be seized immediately in order to preserve it and to prevent its removal out of the locality, since Balabac, Palawan, where the motor launch was at the time, could only be reached after three to four days' travel by boat.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The claim cannot be sustained.&nbsp; The records show that on June 15, 1962<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Fiscal Ponce de Leon made the first request to the Provincial Commander for the impounding of the motor launch; and on June 26, 1962<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> another request was made.&nbsp; The seizure was not effected until July 6, 1962.&nbsp; In short, Fiscal Ponce de Leon had all the time to procure a search warrant had he wanted to and which he could have taken in less than a day, but he did not.&nbsp; Besides, there is no basis for the apprehension that the motor launch might be moved out of Balabac because even prior to its seizure the motor launch was already without its engine.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> In sum, the fact that there was no time to secure a search warrant would not legally justify a search without one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>As to whether or not they are entitled to damages, plaintiffs-appellants anchor their claim for damages on Articles 32 and 2219 of the New Civil Code which provide in part as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"ART. 32.&nbsp; Any public officer or employee, or any private individual, who directly or indirectly obstructs, defeats, violates or in any manner impedes or impairs any of the following rights and liberties of another person shall be liable to the latter for damages.<br><br><center>“xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;xxx</center><br><br>"(9) The rights to be secure in one's person, house, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures.<br><br><center>“xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;xxx</center><br><br>"The indemnity shall include moral damages.&nbsp; Exemplary damages may also be adjudicated."<br><br>"ART. 2219.&nbsp; Moral damages may be recovered in the following and analogous cases:<br><br><center>“xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;xxx</center><br><br>"(6) Illegal search;<br><br><center>“xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;xxx</center><br><br>"(1) Acts and actions referred to in Articles 21, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 34 and 35."</blockquote><br>Pursuant to the foregoing provisions, a person whose constitutional rights have been violated or impaired is entitled to actual and moral damages from the public officer or employee responsible therefor.&nbsp; In addition, exemplary damages may also be awarded.&nbsp; In the instant case, plaintiff-appellant Delfin Lim claimed&nbsp; that he purchased the motor launch from Jikil Taha in consideration of P3,000.00, having given P2,000.00 as advanced payment; that since its seizure on July 6, 1962 the motor launch had been moored at Balabac Bay and because of exposure to the elements it has become worthless at the time of the filing of the present action; that because of the illegality of the seizure of the motor launch, he suffered moral damages in the sum of P1,000.00; and that because of the violation of their constitutional rights they were constrained to engage the services of a lawyer whom they have paid P1,500.00 for attorney's fees.&nbsp; We find these claims of Delfin Lim amply supported by the evidence and therefore should be awarded the sum of P3,000.00 as actual damages; P1,000.00 as moral damages and P750.00 for attorney's fees.&nbsp; However, with respect to plaintiff Jikil Taha, he is not entitled to recover any damage which he alleged he had suffered from the unlawful seizure of the motor launch inasmuch as he had already transferred the ownership and possession of the motor launch to Delfin Lim at the time it was seized and therefore, he has no legal standing to question the validity of the seizure.&nbsp; Well settled is the rule that the legality of a seizure can be contested only by the party whose rights have been impaired thereby, and that the objection to an unlawful search and seizure is purely personal and cannot be availed of by third parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Consequently, one who is not the owner, lessee, or lawful occupant of the premises searched cannot raise the question of validity of the search and seizure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Jikil Taha is not without recourse though.&nbsp; He can still collect from his co-plaintiff, Delfin Lim the unpaid balance of P1,000.00.<br><br>Defendant-appellee Fiscal Ponce de Leon wanted to wash his hands of the incident by claiming that "he was in good faith, without malice and without the slightest intention of inflicting injury to plaintiff-appellant, Jikil Taha"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> when he ordered the seizure of the motor launch.&nbsp; We are not prepared to sustain his defense of good faith.&nbsp; To be liable under Article 32 of the New Civil Code it is enough that there was a violation of the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs and it is not required that defendants should have acted with malice or bad faith.&nbsp; Dr. Jorge Bocobo, Chairman of the Code Commission, gave the following reasons during the public hearings of the Joint Senate and House Committees, why good faith on the part of the public officer or employee is immaterial.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote>"DEAN BOCOBO.&nbsp; Article 32, regarding individual rights:&nbsp; Attorney Cirilo Paredes proposes that Article 32 be so amended as to make a public official liable for violation of another person's constitutional rights only if the public official acted maliciously or in bad faith.&nbsp; The Code Commission opposes this suggestion for these reasons:<br><br>"The very nature of Article 32 is that the wrong may be civil or criminal.&nbsp; It is not necessary therefore that there should be malice or bad faith.&nbsp; To make such a requisite would defeat the main purpose of Article 32 which is the effective protection of individual rights.&nbsp; Public officials in the past have abused their powers on the pretext of justifiable motives or good faith in the performance of their duties.&nbsp; Precisely, the object of the Article is to put an end to official abuse by the plea of good faith.&nbsp; In the United States this remedy is in the nature of a tort.<br><br>"Mr. Chairman, this article is firmly one of the fundamental articles introduced in the New Civil Code to implement democracy.&nbsp; There is no real democracy if a public official is abusing, and we made the article so strong and so comprehensive that it concludes an abuse of individual rights even if done in good faith, that official is liable.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, we know that there are very few public officials who openly and definitely abuse the individual rights of the citizens.&nbsp; In most cases, the abuse is justified on a plea of desire to enforce the law to comply with one's duty.&nbsp; And so, if we should limit the scope of this article, that would practically nullify the object of the article.&nbsp; Precisely, the opening object of the article is to put an end to abuses which are justified by a plea of good faith, which is in most cases the plea of officials abusing individual rights."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote><br>But defendant-appellee Orlando Maddela cannot be held accountable because he impounded the motor launch upon the order of his superior officer.&nbsp; While a subordinate officer may be held liable for executing unlawful orders of his superior officer, there are certain circumstances which would warrant Maddela's exculpation from liability.&nbsp; The records show that after Fiscal Ponce de Leon made his first request to the Provincial Commander on June 15, 1962 Maddela was reluctant to impound the motor launch despite repeated orders from his superior officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> It was only after he was furnished a copy of the reply of Fiscal Ponce de Leon, dated June 26, 1962, to the letter of the Provincial Commander, justifying the necessity of the seizure of the motor launch on the ground that the subsequent sale of the launch to Delfin Lim could not prevent the court from taking custody of the same,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> that he impounded the motor launch on July 6, 1962.&nbsp; With said letter coming from the legal officer of the province, Maddela was led to believe that there was a legal basis and authority to impound the launch.&nbsp; Then came the order of his superior officer to explain for the delay in the seizure of the motor launch.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Faced with a possible disciplinary action from his commander, Maddela was left with no alternative but to seize the vessel.&nbsp; In the light of the above circumstances, We are not disposed to hold Maddela answerable for damages.<br><br><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed and another one entered declaring the seizure illegal and ordering defendant-appellee Fiscal Francisco Ponce de Leon to pay to plaintiff-appellant Delfin Lim the sum of P3,000.00 as actual damages, plus P1,000.00 moral damages, and, in addition, P750.00 for attorney's fees.&nbsp;
