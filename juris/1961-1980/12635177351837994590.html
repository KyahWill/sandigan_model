				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The question the herein petition for <i>certiorari</i> presents
is whether or not, upon the facts hereinafter recited, respondent judge
committed a grave, abuse of discretion in issuing his order of September 13,
1965 declaring petitioner (an assistant provincial fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>) in contempt of court and committing <span style="">him </span>to prison "for 24 hours until
such further order or notice <span class="GramE">from</span> this Court ordering
his release."</p>

<p class="BODY">The setting is the courtroom of Branch II of the Court of First

as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"CROSS EXAMINATION BY ATTY. CENIZA:</blockquote>

<span class="SpellE">Patigue</span> and <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
Suarez frequented your house, is that correct?</blockquote>

very well?</blockquote>

them with or without masks?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And in fact during that evening when they
were there and they greeted you and that they wanted to buy cigarettes from you
they even told you their names when they were still outside your house, is that
correct ?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They were not the ones who voluntarily gave
their names but I called their names and they said 'NANG'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do you mean to say that you called the names
of the two (2) accused?</blockquote>

<blockquote>There is a need for the correction of the interpretation because while the
Interpreter said as a supposed translation that - 'I called their names' but
she only said - 'ANGEL?' she called the name 'ANGEL?<span class="GramE">' ....</span>

<blockquote>You bring him out, to jail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(At
this stage the Bailiff brings out Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Delgra</span> from

<p class="BODY">Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Delgra</span>, however, was not brought
directly to jail by the bailiff as ordered by the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the request of the Fiscal, they first
went to the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, the bailiff was prevailed upon by Fiscal
<span class="SpellE">Delgra</span> and other fiscals not to execute the order of
the judge pending a request which they would make to the judge to reconsider
his stand.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, September 13, 1965, when the judge learned of
the bailiff's failure to carry out his instructions, he immediately wrote out
an order finding Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Delgra</span> guilty of direct
contempt, directing "the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
City or any of his policemen to arrest the said Fiscal Martin <span class="SpellE">Delgra</span> and <span style="">to
commit him to the Municipal Jail for 24 hours <u>until</u> <u>such</u> <u>further</u>
<u>order</u> <u>or</u> <u>notice</u> <u>from</u> <u>this</u> <u>Court</u> <u>ordering</u>
<u>his</u> <u>release</u>",</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and commanding the "bailiff assigned to
the <span class="SpellE">Sala</span> </span>II <span style="">to serve a copy of this order to the Chief of Police immediately upon
receipt of the same."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner seasonably came to this Court on <i>certiorari</i>
with preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We issued a
cease-and-desist order on September 20, 1965 upon a P1<span class="GramE">,000</span>-bond.</p>

1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is unfortunate
that the transcript does not fully reflect all the utterances made by both
fiscal and judge during the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
task is not made any easier by the battle <span style="">of
affidavits </span>presenting hopelessly conflicting versions.<br>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We thus prefer to view
this case in the light of the trans­cript of stenographic notes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be incomplete.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But its </span>integrity <span style="">is not assailed by the parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The root of the controversy between fiscal and judge sprang from
an alleged misinterpretation into English from the <span class="SpellE">Cebuano</span>
dialect of the witness' statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
official translation was "I called their names".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Delgra's</span>
objection to the translation and his having called the attention of the court
to the fact that the witness said "I called Angel<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and they answered 'NANG'<span class="GramE">",</span> should have deserved
the court's attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The unfor­tunate
incident could have been obviated had respondent judge listened with care to
the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> observation following defense counsel's
next question premised on the allegedly wrong translation of the witness'
answer, thus: "Do you mean to say that you called the names of the two (2)
accused?" Which drew from the fiscal the statement that "[t]here is a
need for the correction of the interpretation because while the Interpreter
said as a sup­posed translation that - called their names' but she only said
-'ANGEL?' she called the :name 'ANGEL?' .... (<span class="GramE">discussion</span>
and <span style="">arguments ....)."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The remarks of the prosecuting attorney should not have escaped
notice of the judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was the second
time that this alleged mistake in translation was drawn to his attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge could have ruled on the objection
to that translation instead of directing the witness to answer the succeeding
question propounded by the defense counsel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It bears repeating to say that had the judge ruled on that objection
immediately, had he not been too quick in cutting the fiscal short, the incident
now in question would not have transpired.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We are informed that the
judge comes from <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assertion is made and it is not disputed that
the judge then did not have a working knowledge of the <span class="SpellE">Cebuano</span>
dialect, in which the witness was testifying.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Prudence suggested that he first inquire from his own interpreter about
the correctness of the translation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
he was still not satisfied, he could have sought the aid of other people
present who spoke the <span class="SpellE">Cebuano</span> dialect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it was, the judge thought that allowing
the witness to answer the succeeding question would clarify the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But what escaped him was that, with the
question so suggestively framed: "Do you mean to say that you called the
names of the two (2) accused?<span class="GramE">",</span> the witness could
alter her answer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Be that as it may, the fiscal pressed his bid for the correction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fiscal while bowing to the court's
authority to rule on the problem of whether the particular question should be
answered, sought permission to speak in this wise: "may we <span style="">say something, your Honor".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This drew the court's warning that:
"There is already a ruling of the Court." The picture that we have
from here on is quite hazy. The words spoken by both fiscal and judge have not
been completely transcribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is
indubitably clear, however, is that the judge refused to allow the fiscal to
speak fully.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as the fiscal tried to
explain starting with "Yes, your Honor, but can we ...." the judge
exhibited undisguised impatience with the ominous statement: "Get ready,
Bailiff, I have to do something .... <span class="GramE">there</span> is already
a decision objection overruled, witness may answer." At one point, the
fiscal merely sought clarification of the interpretation, followed by a desire
to reason out, but the judge stopped him with "Enough, the witness may
answer the question." Then the fiscal moved for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the judge summarily disallowed him to
state his grounds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is thus reason for belief that the
fiscal could have felt that his right to state his position was being throttled
by the judge's seemingly arbitrary attitude.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As to whether the fiscal defied the court in a threatening
attitude, credible evidence - the language in the transcript of the proceedings
- points to the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is truly
significant is that the situation would not have reached grave proportions if
the judge only listened carefully to the pleas of the fiscal and patiently
allowed the fiscal to make his manifestation - to set the record aright -
which, unfortunately, the judge did not.</p>

2. The controlling provision here is Section 1, Rule 71 of the
Rules of Court, which punishes direct contempt, thus: "A person guilty of
misbehavior in the presence of or so near a court or judge as to obstruct or
interrupt the proceedings before the same, including disrespect toward the
court or judge, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> may
be summarily adjudged in contempt by such court or judge and punished by fine
not exceeding two hundred pesos or imprisonment not exceeding <span style="">ten (10) days, or both, if it be a superior
court, or a judge thereof, or by fine not exceeding ten pesos or imprisonment</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span><span style="">not
exceeding one (1) day, or both, if it be an inferior court."</span><br>

<p class="BODY">It has been said that "[c]<span class="SpellE">ontempt</span>
of court presupposes a contumacious attitude, a flouting or arrogant
belligerence, <span class="GramE">a</span> defiance of the court."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
From the transcript, we read no statement of the fiscal that rises to the level
of contumacy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing he said
constitutes an affront to the dignity of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, the transcript has not preserved
the exact words uttered during the incident, but the judge has not pointed out
to <span style="">us any word or phrase uttered by the
fiscal which may </span><span style="">amount to </span>contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge <span style="">could do no better than say in his </span>order here <span style="">under review that the fiscal acted with
"provoking </span>gesture(s)" and exhibited a <span style="">"threatening attitude".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Before us, the judge submits that the fiscal was defiant with his
"offensive expres­sions" and "aggressive gestures".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But these are at best </span>general­ities <span style="">and conclusions of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, the proceedings bogged </span>down <span style="">in the sense that the judge wanted the
witness to continue testifying but the witness could not because the fiscal
insisted in </span>that a <span style="">ruling on the
translation of the testimony <span class="GramE">be</span> made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this </span>was the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span>
<span style="">right.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such was not an undue imposition upon the </span>court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">inaccuracy
he tried to point out to the judge appears to be material and substantial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fiscal underscored the need for immediate
correction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He strongly felt that if
uncorrected, the next question would be on a false premise; worse, it could be
misleading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We perceive it to have been
a better attitude had the judge squarely met and decided favorably or adversely
the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> objection to the translation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Defiance</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> by the fiscal </span>of the judge's
authority would seem unlikely, if <span style="">viewed
from the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> personal record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Prior to his appointment as assistant
fiscal, he had been in active law practice for eight <span style="">years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had already served as
such fiscal </span>in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of <span style="">Judge Vicente <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span>
for seven years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Standing <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span> on record is the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span>
claim that during </span>such <span style="">periods
of time, he had never been called down for conduct unbecoming a lawyer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Holding fast to the principles that contempt proceedings are
criminal in nature;<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>

Court. <i>Certiorari</i> lies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>3. This is an appropriate occasion as any to define once again the
role of a judge in relation to those who appear before him. Canon 1 of the
Canons of Judicial Ethics informs us that "[t]he assumption of the office
of judge casts upon the incumbent duties in respect to his personal conduct
which concern his relation to", amongst others, "the practitioners of
law in his court".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judges should be
temperate and patient,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>

Well it is to recall that: "Patience and gravity of hearing is an
essential part of justice; and an over-speaking judge is no well-tuned
cymbal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is no grace to a judge x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> to show quickness of conceit
