the orders dated April 29, 1963, June <span style="">8,
</span>1963, June 29, 1963 and July 27, 1963 of the Court of First Instance of
Manila (Branch XVII) in its Civil Case No. 52674, entitled Board of
Liquidators, etc. et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Ricma</span> Trading
Corporation, et al.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 15, 1962, plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Board of Liquidators, as trustee of the defunct Land Settle­ment &amp;
Development Corporation (LASEDECO), filed a complaint in the Municipal Court of
Manila, to reco­ver from the defendants <span class="SpellE">Ricma</span> Trading
Corporation and its President and General Manager, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Maipid</span>,
the sum of P2, 800.00 as unpaid balance of the purchase price of certain
personal properties consisting of equipment, tools, engine blocks, spare parts,
supplies, junks and others located in its Bodega No. 2, at <span style="">Sta. </span>Mesa Boulevard, Manila, which are
described in the said complaint as "Lots Nos. 1 and 2, Bodega 2, Sta. Mesa
Compound", with interest thereon at the legal rate from the date of the
filing thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1962</st1:date>,
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on two grounds, namely: (1) that <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> cause of action is barred by the statute of
limitations; and (2) that the complaint states no cause of action in so far as
defendant Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Maipid</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With regard to the first
ground, the contention was that inasmuch as there was no written contract
evidencing the sale between the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and the
defendants nor any written promise or commitment on the part of the latter to
pay the alleged unpaid balance of P2<span class="GramE">,800.00</span>, the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> cause of action was merely based on an oral con­tract,
which, pursuant to Art. 1139 of the Civil Code, should have been filed within
six (6) years from the ac <span class="SpellE">crual</span> of the cause of
action, i.e., from <st1:date year="1955" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1955</st1:date>,
the date when the last partial payment was made, to the same day in 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, according to the motion, prescription had
already set in on <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1962</st1:date>,
the date when the complaint of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had registered its
opposition to the motion to dismiss and the defendants had filed a rejoinder
thereto, on <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="10">October 19, 1962</st1:date>,
the Municipal Court promulgated an order dismissing the action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After receiving copy of this order on
November 7, 1962, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed a motion for the
reconsideration thereof on November 12, 1962 (five days after such receipt) and
prayed for the admission of an amended complaint thereto attached, both of
which, defendants opposed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Resolving, the motion for reconsideration and the opposition
thereto, the Municipal Court issued an order on <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1962</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which erroneously stated that the "motion to dismiss",
instead of the "motion for reconsideration" was the one being
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order reads thus:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the motion to dismiss as well as
the motion for the admission of the amended com­plaint, are hereby denied for
lack of merit."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> received a copy of this order
on <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, upon motion "ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>" of the defendants, under date of <st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1962</st1:date>, the Municipal Court
rendered an amended decision, disposing thus:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, <u><span style="">motion for reconsideration</span></u><span style=""> </span>as well as motion for the admission of the amended com­plaint,
are hereby denied for lack of merit."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Copy of this amended decision was received by <span class="SpellE">appel­lee</span>
on <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Six days thereafter, or, on <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1962</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> made an appeal to the Court of First Instance of
Manila - hereinafter referred to merely as CFI - which was docketed in said
court as Civil Case No. 52674. In the CFI, the first step taken by the
defendants was to move to dismiss the appeal on <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1963</st1:date>, on the ground that the order of the
Municipal Court dismissing the action had already become final and was,
therefore, <span class="SpellE">unappealable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to be expected, <span class="SpellE">appel­lee</span>
immediately opposed said motion and defendants filed a rejoinder to such
opposition</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1963</st1:date>,
the CFI issued an order denying defendant's motion to dismiss appeal this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"It appearing that the notice of appeal interposed on December
27, 1962, by the plaintiff in the Municipal Court is from its amended decision
dated De­cember 4, 1962, a copy of which was re­ceived by said plaintiff on
December 21, 1962, which appeal is clearly with­in the period provided by the
Rules, <span style="">the motion of the defendants to
dismiss said appeal is hereby de­nied for lack of merit and the defendants are
directed to answer the complaint within the period provided by the Rules."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A motion for the reconsideration of the above order was denied on
<st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="6">June <span style="">8, </span>1963</st1:date>, in a minute order, for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having failed in their move to dismiss the appeal, defendants
filed another, motion, this time one to dis­miss the case, predicated on the
same two grounds they had previously alleged in their motion to dismiss in the
Municipal Court, to wit, prescription and failure of the complaint to state a
cause of action against defendant Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Maipid</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had
filed its opposition and the defendants, their rejoinder, the CFI issued on <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1963</st1:date>, the following order:</p>

<blockquote>"It appearing that the motion to dismiss filed by the
defendants raises questions of facts which cannot be de­cided without trial on
the merits, <span style="">the same is hereby denied
and said de­fendants are directed to answer the complaint within the period
provided by the Rules."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the defendants filed a petition for cer­tiorari,
prohibition and mandamus with preliminary in­junction with the Court of Appeals
(CA-G. R. No. 32448-R, <span class="SpellE">Ricma</span> Trading Corp. and
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Maipid</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Hon.Arsenio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Solidum</span>, Judge, CFI-Manila, and Board of Liquidators,
as Trustee of the LASEDECO) praying the appellate court: <span style="">(1) to restrain the respondent Judge from
further proceed­ing with the case (CIVIL CASE No. 52674); (2) to declare the
above-mentioned orders of herein respondent Judge dated April 29, 1963, June </span><span style="">8, </span><span style="">1963 and June 29, 1963, null and void; and (3) in lieu of the order of
April 29, 1963, for the court to render a decision dismissing the appeal of
herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, or, in the alternative, for the
court to order the respondent Judge to remand the case to the Municipal Court
for trial on the merits as al­legedly directed by Sec. 10, Rule 40 of the Rules
of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals dismissed
the petition for being premature, in </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">resolution dated </span><st1:date year="1963" day="19" month="7"><span style="">July 19,
 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, holding that
"it cannot be said at this stage that respondent Judge has had all the
opportunity to correct his alleged errors or that he has clearly acted without
jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Unable thus to obtain relief from the Court of Appeals,
defendants changed tactics in the CFI.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On July 26, 1963, they filed a motion to remand the case to the
Municipal Court for trial on the merits, contending that under Sec­tion 10 of
Rule 40 of the Rules of Court, the jurisdiction <span style="">of </span>the CFI in an appeal of the kind taken by the plaintiff
(herein <span class="SpellE">appllee</span>) is limited exclusively to the
determina­tion of whether or not the inferior court has properly dis­missed the
case and not to try the case on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The following day, <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="7">July 27,
 1963</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> joined them in their move
and filed a manifestation to that effect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Entertain­ing a different view, however, the CFI, on the same day, <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1963</st1:date>, issued the following
order:</p>

<blockquote>"Upon consideration of the motion filed by counsel for the
defendants praying that this case be remanded to the Municipal Court and the
manifesta­tion of the plaintiff, the Court finds that said motion is without
merit and is hereby denied."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Faced with this order, on <st1:date year="1963" day="6" month="8">August
 6, 1963</st1:date>, defendants filed their answer to the complaint, making
therein de­nials and admissions, to which reference will be made later in this
decision, and alleging <span style="">as </span>affirmative
and special defenses: (1) lack of jurisdiction of the CFI; (2) full pay­ment;
(3) prescription; and (4) lack of cause of action against defendant Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Maipid</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">On </span><st1:date year="1964" day="29" month="10"><span class="GramE">October 29, 1964</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, during the trial, both parties, assisted by their respective
counsel, entered into a stip­ulation of facts which they submitted to the court
with a manifestation that they were submitting the case on the questions of law
raised in their pleadings.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
stipula­tion of facts is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the Board of
Liquidators which is the agency designated under Republic Act No. 1160, to
liquidate the assets of the Land Settlement &amp; Development Corporation, and
is acting as trustee of said LASEDECO, has of­fered for bidding certain
personal pro­perties consisting of equipment, tools, engine blocks, spare
parts, supplies and other junks at its bodega No. 2 at Sta. Mesa, Manila, which
are designated as Lots Nos. 1 and 2 and defendant cor­poration through its
President, defend­ant Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Maipid</span> submitted its
bid thereon on September 7, 1955, but which is not acceptable to plaintiff;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That</span>
subsequently the defendant corporation through defendant <span class="SpellE">Maipid</span>
negotiated with the plaintiff for the purchase of the afore-mentioned person­al
properties, and which was awarded to said corporation in the amount of P10,
800.00 as per Resolution No. 7173, dated October 14, 1955, as evidenced by a
certified true copy of the extract of the minutes of the meeting of the Board
of Liquidators, which is attached here­to and marked <span style="">as </span>Exhibit 'A';</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in pursuance to
said Resolu­tion No. 7173, defendant corporation through defendant <span class="SpellE">Maipid</span> received on October 15, 1955, the above mentioned
properties as evidenced by Memorandum Receipts which are attached hereto and
marked as Exhibits 'B' and ‘B-1’;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That defendant
corporation paid the plaintiff the sums of P5, 000.00 and P3, 000.00 only on
October 15, and 24, 1955, respectively, as evidenced by Of­ficial Receipts Nos.
0266790 and A-263397, respectively, and which are attached hereto and marked as
Exhibits 'C' and 'C-1’;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That actual delivery and
receipt of Lot No. 2 in Bodega 2 was effected on October 24, 1955, as evidenced
by an Invoice Receipt No. 61 which is attached hereto and marked as Exhibit
'D';</blockquote>

<blockquote>“6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That there is still an
unpaid balance of P2, 800.00 due the plaintiff from the defendant corporation,
and to secure payment thereof the latter post­ed a surety bond executed with
the Ma­nila Underwriters Insurance Co., Inc., on December 28, 1956, copy of
which bond is hereto attached and marked as Exhibit <span style="">'E';<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That upon demands made by
plain­tiff, defendant corporation through de­fendant <span class="SpellE">Maipid</span>
renewed said bond extend­ing the same for another year expiring on December 28,
1957, copies of the let­ter of said defendant and the renewal slip are attached
hereto and marked as Exhibits 'F' and 'F-1';</blockquote>

<blockquote>“8<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That</span>
another renewal of said bond (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'E') was made on
November 20, 1957, copies of which renewal and letter of transmittal are
attached hereto and mark­ed as Exhibits 'G' and 'G-1';</blockquote>

<blockquote>“9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That as said balance of
P2, 800.00 is still outstanding, plaintiff sent a letter demanding payment
thereof to de­fendant corporation on May 25, 1962, and which was duly received
by the latter, a copy of which letter is attached hereto and marked as Exhibit
'H'."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1964" day="23" month="12"><span style="">December
 23, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, the CFI
rendered its decision subject of the present appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the light of the plead­ings and the
stipulation of facts, the trial court held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The <span class="GramE">question of law submitted by the
parties <span style="">in </span>their
pleadings to the Court for its consideration are</span>: (1) whether the cause
of action is barred by the sta­tute of limitations, and (2) whether the
complaint states a cause of action against the defendant, Ricardo R. <span class="SpellE">Maipid</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"From the pleadings and stipulations of facts, it appears that
the defendant, <span class="SpellE">Ricma</span> Trading Corporation, thru its
Pre­sident, defendant Ricardo R. <span class="SpellE">Maipid</span>, <span style="">bought from the Land Settlement &amp; Develop­ment
Corporation, as the highest bidder, certain personal properties consisting of </span>equipment,
tools, engine blocks, spare parts, supplies, and other junks for the sum of P10,800.00
on October 15, 1955, for which the de­fendant paid P5,000.00 and P3,000.00 on
October 15 and 24, 1955, re­spectively, thereby leaving a ba­lance of
P2,800.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To secure the payment of said
balance the defend­ant corporation <span style="">p</span>osted
a surety bond executed by <span style="">the </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Underwriters <span style="">Insurance </span><span style="">Co., Inc, on </span></span></span><st1:date year="1956" day="28" month="12"><span class="GramE">December 28, 1956</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> (Exhibit <span style="">'</span>E9'.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said bond was renewed and extended to <st1:date year="1957" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1957</st1:date></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">and</span>
again renewed for another year expiring on <st1:date year="1958" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1958</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is admitted that the trans­action is not evidenced by any
writ­ten contract of purchase <span class="GramE">and</span> sale, and therefore,
it is verbal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the contention of
the defendants that inasmuch as the cause of action of the plaintiff is based
upon an oral con­tract, the corresponding complaint should have been filed
within six (6) years from <st1:date year="1955" day="24" month="10">October 24
 1955</st1:date> when the defendant, <span class="SpellE">Ricma</span> Trading
Corporation, made the last partial payment of P3, 000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since no further payment has been made by the
defendant after said date and neither was any demand made by the plaintiff for
the payment of said amount, and it appearing that the present case was
instituted in the Municipal Court on January <span style="">8, </span>1963, it is obvious, according to the defendants, that the
cause of action of the plain­tiff has already expired in accordance with the
provision of Article 1145 of the new Civil Code to the effect that <span style="">any </span>action based upon an oral contract
must be commenced within six (6) years.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But it is argued by the plaintiff that the last renewal of
the bond (Ex­hibit 'E<span style="">'</span>) executed
by the Manila Underwriters Insurance Co., Inc., on <st1:date year="1955" day="28" month="12">Decem­ber 28, 1955</st1:date>, to secure the payment of
said balance of P<span style="">2, </span>800.00, has
inter­rupted the running of said period of limitation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence shows that on January 2, 1957,
the defendant <span class="SpellE">Ricma</span> Trading Corporation, thru its
President and General Manager, R. M. <span class="SpellE">Maipid</span>, wrote a
letter (Exhibit 'G-1') to Mr. <span class="SpellE">Filomeno</span> <span class="SpellE">Kintanar</span>, Manager, Board of Liquidators, Manila, as
follows: 'In connection with our Bond #D-050 issued by the Manila Underwriters
Co. which <span style="">ex­</span>pires
on December 28, 1956, and in com­pliance with your request for renewal, we beg
to <span class="SpellE">inclose</span> herewith the renewal policy for another
year.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the opinion of the Court, this letter is a manifest
acknowledgment on the part of the defendant corporation to pay said balance of
P2, 800.00 for it is certainly difficult to understand why the defendants
should renew the bond pre­cisely to secure the payment of said ba­lance of P2,
800.00 if it was not willing any more to recognize it as its legiti­mate obligation
and to pay the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that the
execution of said bond was for the purpose of securing the ver­bal obligation
of the defendant with the Land Settlement &amp; Development Corporation but
when it renewed said bond, especially upon the request of the plaintiff, Board
of Liquidators, as trustee of the Land Settlement &amp; Development
Corporation, the defendant expressly acknowledged that it was still indebted to
the plaintiff in the sum of P2, 800.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to Art­icle 1155 of the New Civil Code: '<span class="GramE">The</span>
prescription of action is interrupted x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> when there is any written acknow­ledgment of the debt by
the debtor.' Consequently, the contention of the de­fendants that plaintiff's
cause of act­ion has already expired is devoid of any legal merit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"However, as to second legal question as to whether defendant
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Maipid</span> should be held liable for the payment
of said indebtedness, the Court finds that inasmuch as it is evident that in
purchas­ing said equipment and tools from the Land Settlement &amp; Development
Corporation, he acted for and on behalf of the <span class="SpellE">Ricma</span>
Trad­ing Corporation of which he was then the President and General Manager and
not in his personal capacity, it is said corporation which is primarily liable
for the payment of said balance of P2,800.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, plain­tiff has no cause of action against him."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">and</span>,
accordingly, rendered judgment thus:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered
order­ing the defendant, <span class="SpellE">Ricma</span> Trading Corporation,
to pay to the plain­tiff, Board of Liquidators, as trustee of the Land
Settlement &amp; Development Corporation, the sum of P2, 800.00, with legal
interest from the date of the filing of the com­plaint, until fully paid, and
the costs of the suit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Complaint with respect to the other defendant, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Maipid</span>, is hereby dismissed without costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with this decision, defendant <span class="SpellE">Ricma</span>
Trading Corporation has interposed the present appeal posing for our
consideration three issues, to wit: (1) whether or not the appeal taken by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> from the orders of the Municipal Court (now City
Court) had been perfected within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period provided for by the Rules of Court; (2) whether or not <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> action had already prescribed under the statute
of limita­tions; and (3) whether or not, under Section 10 of Rule 40, the court
<u>a</u> <u>quo</u> had jurisdiction to try and decide the case on the merits
despite the fact that the action had been brought to it on appeal from the
inferior court which, according to appellant, had disposed of the case only
upon a question of law without any valid trial on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first issue is discussed under appellant's first assignment
of error which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT DISMISS­ING THE APPEAL TAKEN BY
PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE FROM THE ORDER OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT OF MANILA (NOW CITY
COURT) DISMISSING ITS COMPLAINT FOR ITS FAILURE TO PERFECT SAID <span style="">I </span>APPEAL WITHIN THE REGLEMENTARY
PERIOD PROVIDED <span style="">BY </span>LAW."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The discussion centers on two points, namely: (1) that <span style="">His </span>Honor allegedly erred in holding,
in his order of April 29, 1963, that the appeal of herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
now (appellant in the court below) was from the amended decision of December 4,
1962 and not from the order of dismissal of October 19, 1962 and the
erroneously Worded order of November 23, 1962, and (2) that the said amended
decision of December 4, 1962 "did not change or alter (its) the previous
order dated November 23, 1962, and is not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
in nature." Accordingly, appellant contends, <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
period to appeal to the CFI should have been considered <span style="">as </span>resumed, after its suspension by, the filing Of the motion
for reconsidera­tion of November 12, 1962, from December 4, 1962, when <span class="SpellE">ap­pellee</span> received the said erroneously worded order of
Novem­ber 23, 1962, and not from December 21, 1962 when it re­ceived the
amended decision of December 4, 1962.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is clearly without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As regards the first point, whatever reason
might have been actually, given by <span style="">His </span>Honor
in giving due course to <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> appeal is
secondary, what is decisive is that in fact and in law, said appeal was filed
on time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be no denying the
fact that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was appealing only from the orders
of <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="10">October 19, 1962</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1962</st1:date>; it could not have
meant to appeal from the order of <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="11">November
 23, 1962</st1:date> for the simple reason that <span style="">its </span><span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part, which suf­fered
from no ambiguity or equivocation whatsoever, was favorable to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, it appears that on the same date that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was notified of the erroneously worded order of <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1962</st1:date>, the Municipal
Court issued the amended decision in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, on the very date <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
period to appeal was to be resumed, the Munici­pal Court amended its order <span style="">of </span><st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the said order was issued within the period for appeal and appears on
its face to have been intended to correct the original order, it must be
considered as having taken the place of such original order, hence it could not
bind the parties, particularly, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> until it
was notified thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily, <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> period to appeal was re­sumed only from the date
of this notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Fabie</span>
vs. Gutierrez David, 75 Phil. 526) In <span class="SpellE">Cuento</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, 40 Phil. 346, this Court held that where a
judgment is amended, the date of the amendment should be considered as the date
of the decision for the computation of the period for perfecting the appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was
reiterated in Capistrano v. <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>, 93 <span style="">Phil. </span>710.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant raises, however, the point that the amended decision
"did not change or alter (its) the previous order dated <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1962</st1:date>." Such
argument is neither factually nor legally correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an incontrovertible fact that the order
of <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="11">November <span style="">23, </span>1962</st1:date> clearly and definitely stated that what was
being denied was <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of the said order made no reference at all to the motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Legally speaking, the
fact that the motion before the court was <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
motion for reconsideration, and not the defendant's motion to dismiss, and the
further fact that what was discussed in the body of the order was said motion
for reconsideration and not the motion to dismiss, are of no moment, since the
rule is that when the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of a final
order or decision is definite, clear and unequivocal and can be wholly given
effect without the need of interpretation or construction, the same is
considered as the judgment of the court, to the exclusion of anything said in
the body thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Contreras vs. Felix,
78 Phil. 570; Edwards vs. <span class="SpellE">Arce</span>, 98 Phil. 688) This is
particularly true in this case, where the order or decision in question is that
of a court not of record which is not constitution­ally required to state the
facts and the law on which its judgment is based.</p>

<p class="BODY">A more or less similar situation confronted this Court and was
resolved in the case of <span class="SpellE">Semira</span> vs. Enriquez, 88 Phil.
228, decided on <st1:date year="1951" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1951</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated in the decision, the facts were as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In civil case No. 43 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> between Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Semira</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span> G. Mercado, as plaintiffs, and <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> Azores, <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span>
Azores, Manuel Azores, Juana Azores, Jose R. Azores, <span class="SpellE">Sinforosa</span>
Azores, Antonio Azores and <span class="SpellE">Norberta</span> Azores, as
defendants, judgment was rendered in favor of the latter on July 7, 1944,
notice of which was received by counsel for plaintiffs on August 7, 1944.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1944" day="30" month="8">August
 30, 1944</st1:date>, counsel for plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsidera­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1948" day="26" month="5">May
 26, 1948</st1:date>, after the record had been reconstituted, the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> denied the motion for
reconsidera­tion, notice of which was received by counsel for plaintiffs on <st1:date year="1948" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1948</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1948" day="5" month="6">June
 5, 1948</st1:date>, that is, before receipt of the notice of denial, counsel
for plaintiffs filed a motion for an extension of fifteen days within which to
perfect an appeal in case the motion for re­consideration should be
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the resol­ution of <st1:date year="1948" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1948</st1:date>, the court made it
appear that the defendants filed the motion for recon<span style="">sideration and the plaintiffs filed an oppo­sition thereto, when the
fact was that the plaintiffs filed the motion and the defendants filed the
opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of this mis­take,
the plaintiffs filed, on the same day he received the order of denial, a motion
for correction which was set for hearing on </span><st1:date year="1948" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1948</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Failing to receive notice of any action
either on the motion for extension or on the motion for correction, counsel for
plaintiffs sent a letter of inquiry to the clerk of court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus prompted, the court issued an order
dated September </span>25, 1948, -<span style="">received
by plaintiffs on October 2, 1948, holding that the judgment of July </span>7,
1944, <span style="">had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> for plaintiffs' failure to perfect their appeal
on time even if the motion for an extension of fifteen days was granted, the
motion for correction filed by plaintiffs on June 21, </span>1948, <span style="">not having suspended the time for
appeal." (Pp. 229-230)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon these facts and over
the opinion of the lone dis­senter, which was along the same line as the
contention of the appellant's herein, that the error in the order in question
consisted merely in the "transposition of the par­ties, mistakenly
attributing to the defendants the motion for reconsideration, and imputing to
the plaintiffs the opposition thereto, when it should be the other way, is a
mere oversight, a clerical error, unsubstantial, imma­terial and harmless,
which can neither prejudice nor mis­lead anyone", meaning impliedly that
the parties should </span><span style="">have acted in
</span><span style="">relation to said order
regardless of the error and as if it did not exist, this Court held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The inherent power of the court 'to amend and control its
process and orders so as to make them conformable to law and justice,' (Sec. 5,
Rule 124), carries the concomitant duty to correct its orders on its own initia­tive
or upon motion of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This duty
is not affected by the nature of the error sought to be corrected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the petitioners timely
called the attention of the respondent judge to the mis­statement contained in
his order of May 26, 1948, and, more timely still, filed the motion for an
extension of fifteen days to perfect an appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The respondent judge, in his order of September 25, 1948, admitted that,
for un­known reasons, he was not able to dispose of the two motions sooner, but
ruled in the same breath that the judgment of July 7, 1944, had become final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> because the error was merely clerical
and the period to appeal had expired even if the petitioners were granted the
15-day extension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The unfairness and in­justice
of this ruling are obvious from the fact that, while the respondent judge in
effect admitted the necessity of swift action on peti­tioner's motions, the
petitioners are made to suffer the consequences of his inaction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The petitioners might have resorted to too technical a move, but
this circumstance did not dispense with the duty of the respond­ent judge to
straighten out the record of the case for all purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners are expected to file a record
on appeal containing pertinent pleadings, motions and orders which are correct;
and it cannot rightly be contended that they are ready to do so before the
order of the respondent judge of <st1:date year="1948" day="26" month="5">May
 26, 1948</st1:date>, is changed in the sense indicated in petitioners' motion
for correction.” <span class="GramE">(Pp. 231-232, ibid.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, this is the better rule.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It does not accord with the dignity and solemnity of judicial
proceedings that parties should be made to act on the basis of court orders
that do not state exactly and correctly what is meant by the court, whether
what is intended is legally tenable or not.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Much less should the parties concerned be made res­ponsible for any of
the legal consequences of an erroneous­ly worded order or judgment of the
court, particularly, when they opportunely call the attention of the court, as
in this case, to its <span class="GramE">mistake.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties have a right to a correct and
clear expression of a court's orders and judgments, regardless of its nature
and legal propriety, and the responsibility of the judges cannot be any less,
correspondingly, to exercise proper circumspection in the preparation of their
orders and judgments so as to avoid any misunderstanding and confusion in their
implementation and compliance, and also to be reasonably tolerant whenever
their errors are brought to their attention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With an eye solely to the attainment of substantial justice, they should
disregard <span class="SpellE"><u>amor</u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>propio</u></span> </span>and trivial
technicalities and act in such a way as to minimize, if not completely avoid
unnecessary inconvenience, effort and expense to all con­cerned and the
consequent untold prejudice to the <span style="">public
</span>interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court, therefore, holds that the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span>did not commit any error in holding that <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
appeal 'to it made on <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="12">December 27,
 1962</st1:date> from the Municipal Court's order of <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="10">October 19, 1962</st1:date> and its amended decision of <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="12">Dec­ember 4, 1962</st1:date> was made on time.</p>

<p class="BODY">With this point regarding the non-finality of the Municipal
Court's decision out of the way, the next ques­tions to resolve are those
raised in appellant's third and fourth assignments of error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(For a more logical order of discussion,
appellant's second assignment of error <span class="GramE">Will</span> be taken
up last.) These assignments are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"III</blockquote>

<blockquote>"THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
ERRED IN NOT FINDING THAT IT HAS NO APPELLATE JURISDICTION TO TRY AND DECIDE
THE CASE ON THE MERITS."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"IV</blockquote>

<blockquote>THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
ERRED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">IN REFUSING TO
REMAND THE CASE TO THE </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="GramE">INFERIOR
  COURT</span></st1:address></st1:street><span class="GramE"> FOR FURTHER
PROCEEDINGS INSTEAD OF RENDERING JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE AND
AGAINST DEFENDANT-APPELLANT FOR THE SUM OF P2, 800.00 WITH LEGAL INTEREST FROM
THE DATE OF THE FILING OF THE COMPLAINT, PLUS COSTS OF THE SUIT."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Otherwise stated, the position of appellant is that the trial
court should have remanded the case to the Muni­cipal Court immediately after it
issued the order of <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1963</st1:date>
denying the defendant&amp; motion to dismiss because by then it had lost
jurisdiction to proceed further with the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to appellant, inasmuch as the Municipal Court had not decided
the case on the merits but upon ques­tions of law, the only power the trial
court had under the circumstances was to decide whether or not the ruling of
the Municipal Court in its order denying defendants, motion to dismiss was
correct or not, and if it was not correct, to reverse the same and remand the
case to said court in order that it may try the case on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">This posture of the appellant overlooks the important fact that
as matters stood, after the issuance of the order of <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1963</st1:date>, properly speaking, <span class="GramE">the</span> trial court had not yet passed upon the correctness or
incorrectness of the order of dismissal of the Municipal Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted first of all that said order
was a resolution of defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Actually, what appellant should have filed is
a motion inviting the attention of the CFI to the effect that the order of the
Municipal Court they had appealed from was not a decision after a trial on the
merits but merely an order of dismissal founded on points of law, namely,
prescription and failure to state a cause of action as against defendant
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Maipid</span>, and asking that the CFI review and
reverse said ruling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">This
defen­dants</span> did not do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead,
they filed a motion to dismiss based on said two grounds, which motion, of
course, is not exactly what the Rules contemplate, since the filing of such a
motion could even be misinterpreted as a submission of the case by the
defendants to the original jurisdiction of the CFI.</p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming, however, that defendants' motion to dismiss could be
properly considered as the correct procedural step envisaged by the Rules or
that their motion to dismiss may be construed as a motion to resolve the
questions of law passed upon in the Municipal Court's order of dismissal, what
now appears to this Court as quite obvious is that the order of June 29, 1963
did not definitely rule that the order of the Municipal Court dismissing the
case was erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, the said
order of <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1963</st1:date>
merely deferred the consideration of the said motion to dismiss until after the
trial on the merits because His Honor felt that reception of evidence was
needed.</p>

<p class="BODY">True, what His Honor actually stated was that the mo­tion
"raises questions of fact which cannot be decided without <u>trial on the
merits</u>" and it may be contended that under Section 10 of Rule 40, the
CFI had no jurisdiction to hold such a <u>trial on the merits</u>, a
proposition, which although apparently supported by existing jurisprudence, we
do not consider it necessary to discuss and pass upon anew for the present,
even if there could be reason to hold that the provision of the Rules referred
to does not really set down a rule of jurisdiction, which is within the pro­vince
of the legislature, but only one of procedure, the Court believes that whatever
flaw there might have been in the procedure adopted by the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>,
the same is in­substantial and harmless.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After all, what His Honor act­ually tried and resolved were none other
than exactly the same two legal points involved in the dismissal order of the
municipal court, namely, the alleged prescription of the plaintiff's action
against the defendant Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Maipid</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And having sustained the Municipal Court on
both scores there was no reason for the trial court to remand the case
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the third and fourth assignments
of error <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> are overruled.</p>

<p class="BODY">The remaining assignment of error is <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>"II</blockquote>

<blockquote>THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
ERRED IN NOT DISMISSING THE CASE AS AGAINST DEFENDANT-APPELLANT, RICMA TRADING
CORPORATION, ON THE GROUND THAT PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE'S CAUSE OF ACTION HAS
ALREADY PRESCRIBED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Again, this assignment of error is without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main thesis of appellant in regard to this alleged error is
that the transaction upon which <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> action is
based was not evidenced by any written agreement and, being verbal, said action
prescribes in six years, and, therefore, <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
complaint should have been dismissed, considering that it was filed only on
August 15, 1962 whereas the said transaction took place in October, 1953.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Overruling this </span>contention, the court <u>a</u>
<u><span style="">quo</span></u> sustained the claim of
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> that even if the said transaction was verbal
"the renewal of the bond executed by the Manila, Underwriters Insurance
Co., Inc., on <st1:date year="1955" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1955</st1:date>,
to secure the payment of said balance of P2, 800.00, has interrupted the
running of said period of limitation." It held thus:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The
evidence show that on Jan­uary 2, 1957, the defendant, <span class="SpellE">Ricma</span>
Trading Corporation, thru its President and General Manager, R. M. <span class="SpellE">Maipid</span>, wrote a letter (<span class="SpellE">Exh­hibit</span>
'G-1') to Mr. <span class="SpellE">Filomeno</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Kintanar</span>,
Manager, Board of Liquidators, Manila, as follows: 'In connection with our Bond
#D­050 issued by the Manila Underwriters Co. which expires on December 28,
1956, and in compliance with your request for renewal, we beg to enclose
herewith the renewal po­licy for another year.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span style="">In </span>the opinion of the Court, this letter is a manifest
acknowledgment on the part of the defendant corporation to pay said balance of
P2, 800.00 for it is certainly difficult to understand why the defendant should
renew the bond precisely to secure the payment of said bal­ance of P2, 800.00
if it was not willing any more to recognize it as its legitimate ob­ligation
and to pay the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that the
execution of said bond was for the purpose of securing the verbal obligation of
the defendant with the Land Settlement and Development Corporation but when it
renewed said bond, especially upon the re­quest of the plaintiff, Board of
Liquidators, as trustee of the Land Settlement and Devel­opment Corporation,
the defendant expressly acknowledged that it was still indebted to the
plaintiff in the sum of P2, 800.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acc­ording
to Article 1155 of the New Civil Code, '<span class="GramE">The</span>
prescription of actions is interrupted x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>when there is any written acknowledg­ment
of the debt by the debtor.' Consequently, the contention of the defendants that
plain­tiff's cause of action has already expired is devoid of any legal
merit." (Pp. 151-152, Record on Appeal)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This ruling is on the whole correct, but the truth of the matter
is that although, according to His Honor, <span style="">"it is </span>admitted that the transaction is not evidenced by any
writ­ten contract of purchase and sale and, therefore, it is verbal", it
is clear from the record that by this statement, His Honor must have meant only
that there was no formal contract executed in due form by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For in the stipulation of facts submitted by
the parties, which this court may not disregard, it is clearly stated that:</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the Board of
Liquidators which is the agency designated under Republic Act No. 1160 to
liquidate the assets of the Land Settlement and Development Corporation, and is

proper­ties consisting of equipment, tools, engine blocks, spare parts, supplies,
and other junks at its bodega No. 2 at Sta. Mesa, which are designated as Lots
Nos. 1 and 2, and defen­dant corporation through its President, de­fendant

000.00 as per Resolution No. 7173, dated October 14, 1955, as evidenced by a
cer­tified true copy of the extract of the minutes of the meeting of the Board

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">not to speak of the official receipts
issued for the payment of the articles in question, constitute written evidence
of the agreement: because these documents, although actually se­parate ones, if
taken together, embody not only all the ele­ments of a contract but even all
the terms and conditions of the agreement of purchase and sale between the
appellant and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, judicial notice may be taken of the
fact that contractual transactions with government or any of its
instrumentalities are invariably in writing.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of Peralta de Guerrero vs. Madrigal Ship­ping Co.,
Inc., 106 Phil. 485, the trial court sustained a motion to dismiss an action
for the recovery of damages resulting from the death of a passenger of
defendant's ship when it capsized on the ground that the same was not based on
a written contract, there being none alleged in the complaint. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>This Court rejected this contention thus:</p>

<blockquote>"We are inclined to uphold the conten­tion of appellants, for
a cursory reading of the complaint would show that their cause of action is
predicated upon the fail­ure of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to comply
with its contract of carrying the deceased from <span class="SpellE">Malangas</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> to the City of Manila safely, in that the
vessel on which he was riding be­longing to defendant capsized because of the
reckless and imprudent manner it was managed and steered by <span style="">its </span>crew.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that the complaint does not in so
many words state that the transportation was undertaken by <span style="">virtue </span>of a written contract of
carriage, but this can be implied from the complaint <span style="">because it is </span>a matter of common knowledge that whenever a
passenger boards a ship for transportation from one place to another he is
issued a ticket by the shipper wherein the terms of the contract are
specified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to appellants,
'This ticket is in itself a complete written contract by and between the ship­per
and the passenger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has all the
elements of a complete contract, namely: (1) the consent of the contracting
part­ies manifested by the fact that the pas­senger boards the ship and the
shipper consents or accepts him in the ship for transportation; (2) cause or
considera­tion which is the fare paid by the pas­senger as stated <span style="">in </span>the
ticket; and (3) object, which is the transportation of the passenger from the
place of depart­ure to the place of destination which are stated in the
ticket.'" (p. <span style="">487)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With much more reason can <span class="GramE">We</span> hold in the
case at bar that <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> action is based on a
written contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reference to an
action "upon a written contract" in Article 1144 of the Civil Code
does not preclude instances when the agreement may not be found in one single document
but in two or more separate writings related to each other, which when taken
together contain all the elements of a contract.</p>
