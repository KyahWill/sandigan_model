				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by Isidro (Boy) Buscato and Nestor Dalud from the decision, dated August 22, 1974, of the Court of First Instance of Cotabato, convicting the said appellants of the crime of Robbery with Homi­cide and imposing upon them the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of said decision reads as follows:&nbsp; <blockquote><p> "WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the Court is convinced beyond the shadow of rea­sonable doubt that all the accused - jabib Tan, Nestor Dalud, and Isidro Buscato - are guilty of the offense of robbery with homicide, defined in Article 294, paragraph 1, of the Revised Penal Code, and hereby sentences each of the accused to suffer a penalty of <em>RECLUSION</em><em>PERPETUA</em> and to pay, jointly and severally, the heirs of Rodolfo Lim the sum of P1,400.00, the value of the articles stolen; to indemnify also the heirs of Rodolfo Lim the sum of P12,000.00; all without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, as ruled in the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Doria, interpreting Repub­lic.</span>&nbsp; Act No. 5465, and to pay the costs."&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p> The foregoing is based on the following facts: </p><p> At about 8:30 o'clock in the evening of January 12, 1973, appellants Isidro (Boy) Buscato and Nestor Dalud, together with one Ricardo Rome, were drinking "tuba" at the residence of Nestor Dalud located at the Philippine Trade Center, Sultan Kudarat, Cota­bato (now Maguindanao).&nbsp; After a while, Ricardo Romo excused himself from them, saying that he has to go home to take his supper.&nbsp; They told him to come back so that they could continue their drinking spree.&nbsp; Thereafter, Ricardo Romo, after eating his supper, proceeded to the house of Nestor Dalud.&nbsp; On the way, he met Manuel Largo whom he invited to join them in their drinking spree.&nbsp; Before reaching the house of Dalud, the two met a group composed of appellants Isidro Buscato and Nestor Dalud, together with Jabib Tan and Rodolfo Lim.&nbsp; All of them proceeded afterwards to the Samarano's Store where they had a drinking spree.&nbsp; After they consumed about one (1) gallon of "tuba" they decided to leave.&nbsp; Ricardo Romo and Manuel Largo went to the store of Bangoy opposite the Samarano's Store.&nbsp; Appellants Isidro Buscato and Nestor Dalud, upon the other hand, walked with Jabib Tan and Rodolfo Lim towards the direction of the Philippine Trade Center.&nbsp; </p><p> At around 7:00 o'clock the following morning (January 13, 1973), the cadaver of Rodolfo Lim was found at the river hank by Enrique Tagle, navigator of a tugboat, "Atlas".&nbsp; The tugboat was then moored at the wharf of the Philippine Trade Center.&nbsp; </p><p> Dr. Eduardo L. Mariano, Assistant Provincial Health Officer of Cotabato, conducted a post-mortem examination of the body of the decease.&nbsp; His post­mortem findings revealed a stab wound in the body of Rodolfo Lim, 6" long, left lower abdomen, eviscerating, and a contusion at the left side of the back of the neck.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; </p><p> On January 16, 1973, the Philippine Constabu­lary authorities in Cotabato City investigated the persons who were reportedly with the deceased Rod­olfo Lim the previous night, namely Isidro Buscato, Nestor Dalud and Jabib Tan.&nbsp; According to T/Sgt. Francisco Soriano, he investigated appellant Isidro Buscato who allegedly readily admitted his partici­pation in the crime as the one who inflicted the stab wound on Rodolfo Lim.&nbsp; However, when his in­vestigation was reduced into writing, Buscato re­fused to sign the same.&nbsp; In view of Buscato's refu­sal, he requested S/Sgt. Jorge Vargas to conduct a separate investigation of Jabib Tan and Nestor Dalud.&nbsp; </p><p> On the other hand, S/Sgt. Jorge Vargas dec­lared that he conducted the investigation of Jabib Tan and Nestor Dalud with the aid of Pat. Julhussein G. Tagadaya, a policeman of Sultan Kudarat, who act­ed as interpreter.&nbsp; Both Jabib Tan and Nestor Dalud allegedly voluntarily confessed their participation in the slaying of Rodolfo Lim.&nbsp; Jabib Tan allegedly confessed to him that he participated in the plan­ning of the killing and robbing of the victim.&nbsp; Nes­tor Dalud, on the other hand, admitted having struck the victim with a piece of bamboo, while Boy Buscato stabbed the victim with a Batangas knife and after­wards got the wallet and other valuables of the victim.&nbsp; They then placed the victim inside a sack.&nbsp; These confessions were reduced to writing and sub­sequently sworn to by Jabib Tan and Nestor Dalud before the Clerk of Court, Branch I, Court of First Instance of Cotabato.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Nestor Dalud also purpor­tedly tape-recorded his confession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; </p><p> On January 18, 1973, Isidro Buscato, Nestor Dalud and Jabib Tan were brought by the investiga­tors under the Quirino Bridge in Sultan Kudarat.&nbsp; At that place they were made to re-enact the slay­ing of Rodolfo Lim.&nbsp; </p><p> Francisco Lim, brother of the deceased, rela­ted that in the afternoon of January 12, 1973, his brother was intending to collect the account of MINRAPCO due to the Lim Auto Supply in the amount of P1,400.00.&nbsp; However, when he examined the remains of his brother the next day (January 13, 1973), he noticed that his brother's Rolex watch worth P500.00, a ring worth P35.00, a gold necklace worth P70.00, as well as the money which he was supposed to have collected, were missing.&nbsp; </p><p> All of the accused interposed the defense of alibi.&nbsp; During the hearing, both Nestor Dalud and Jabib Tan testified that after Rodolfo Lim paid the bill in the Samarano's Store, they separated ways, Nestor and Boy Buscato proceeding directly to the house of Nestor, where they slept, leaving Lim with Jabib Tan.&nbsp; They also repudiated their extrajudicial confessions alleging that they were compelled to sign the same by force, violence and intimidation.&nbsp; Isidro Buscato recounted his maltreatment by the PC soldiers from January 15 to 18, 1973.&nbsp; </p><p align="center"><em> THE TRIAL COURT'S EVALUATION</em>&nbsp; </p><p> The trial court, however, was persuaded that the extra-judicial confessions of Nestor Dalud and Jabib Tan were voluntarily and freely given by them to the investigators.&nbsp; Thus, according to the trial court:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "Atty. Muñasque, the Clerk of Court before (whom) the said confessions were subscribed and sworn to testified that the said statements were freely and voluntarily given by the affiants.&nbsp; Likewise the investigators testified that the same were freely and voluntarily given by the af­fiants and they took the stand in rebuttal just to deny the allegation of force and maltreatment.&nbsp; </p><p> "Records will show that the affiants who alleged that they were maltreated have not pres­ented any medical certificate to show the alleged injuries they suffered.&nbsp; </p><p> "They have not charged any one of those who allegedly maltreated them in court or before any authority.&nbsp; </p><p> "To show that they were maltreated, the on­ly evidence they have presented are their own testimonies and the testimonies of their rela­tives, in-laws and friends.&nbsp; </p><p> "The defense of the three accused is one merely of denial and alibi.&nbsp; Records will show that the house of the victim and the place where the victim's body was found to the place where the accused were on the night of January 12, 1973 is just very near.&nbsp; </p><p align="center"> * * *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *&nbsp; </p><p> "The confessions of accused Nestor Dalud and Jabib Tan reveal spontaneity of the declara­tions by the affiants and are replete with facts which could only be possibly supplied by the ac­cused.&nbsp; </p><p align="center"> * * *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *&nbsp; </p><p> "In the case at bar, the defense could not attribute any reason why the Clerk of Court before whom the confession was sworn to would testify the way he did in court and likewise no motive could be attributed to Sgts. Soriano and Vargas in preparing or typing a false confession if such was the case.&nbsp; </p><p align="center"> * * *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *&nbsp; </p><p> "In the case at bar the Court is convinced that all the three accused are guilty of the of­fense as charged not only by virtue of the con­fessions of the two which are interlocking and implicating accused Boy Buscato who also made an oral confession but also they all participated in the re-enactment of the crime and accused Nestor Dalud also has a tape recorded statement admitting his participation in the offense and the added fact, that when this case was submitted for deci­sion accused Jabib Tan escaped from the Provincial Jail, which convinces the Court that he is really guilty otherwise why will he escape if he is innocent.&nbsp; </p><p> "The Court is convinced that there was also robbery in the case at bar as there is sufficient evidence on record that on the very afternoon pre­vious to the incident, the deceased went to MIN­RAPCO to collect some amount and the following morning when Francisco Lim, brother of the vic­tim, saw the dead body of his brother, he saw the watch, necklace and money worth around P1,400.00 were gone, even his shoes were gone.&nbsp; There is no question that the prosecution has proved the crime of robbery with homicide."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; <em>APPELLANTS' ASSIGNMENT OF ERRORS </em></div>&nbsp; <br>In their briefs, counsels for appellants con­tend that the lower court erred:&nbsp; <blockquote><p> (1) &nbsp;&nbsp; In convicting the afore-mentioned appel­lants on the basis solely of the repudiated "extra­judicial confessions" of Nestor Dalud and Jabib Tan; and&nbsp; </p><p> (2) &nbsp;&nbsp; In taking into account the alleged escape of one accused, Jabib Tan, long after the case was submitted for decision, as a circumstance in con­victing the appellants.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p> The basic issue determinative of the merits of the challenged judgment is the admissibility of the confessions and their sufficiency to sustain the conviction.&nbsp; </p><p align="center"><em> THE MANIFESTATION OF THE SOLICITOR GENERAL</em>&nbsp; </p><p> The Solicitor General agreed with the appel­lants and submitted, in lieu of brief for the appel­lee, a manifestation recommending acquittal of ap­pellants Nestor Dalud and Isidro Buscato.&nbsp; The thrust of the Solicitor General's contention is that the evidence of the prosecution does not fulfill the test of moral certainty and is not sufficient to support their conviction.&nbsp; </p><p> Thus, in support of the foregoing, Acting Sol­icitor General Hugo E. Gutierrez, Jr.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> made the following manifestation:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p align="center"> “* * *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p><em> Nestor Dalud's </em><em>extra-judicial </em><em>confession, </em><em>Exhibit ‘D’</em>&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "The issue to be resolved at this instance revolves on the evaluation of the extra-judicial confession of appellant Nestor Dalud and his re­pudiation of the same at the trial.&nbsp; Will a denial by appellant of his participation in the commis­sion of the crime of which he is charged be given more weight than his confession?&nbsp; Will Nestor Da­lud's defense of <em>alibi</em> be given weight despite his extra-judicial confession?&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p align="center"> * * *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "After a careful and dispassionate analysis of the testimonies of the witnesses for the pro­secution and for the defense, we have come to the conclusion that Nestor Dalud's attack on the vol­untary character of the confession finds support in the evidence on record.&nbsp; </p><p> "1. Nestor Dalud's recital of the means and methods employed by the investigators in extract­ing his confession cited specific overt acts as would preclude any notion that the same are mere­ly products of his imagination.&nbsp; Moreover, he enumerated the names of those who had exerted overbearing pressure on him.&nbsp; </p><p> "He testified that on January 13, 1973, he and his co-accused were arrested and confined in the PC stockade in Cotabato City (tsn, pp. 79-80, Jan. 14, 1974); that for two days, they were not allowed to go out of the stockade (tsn, p. 81, <em>ibid</em>); that while they were at the stockade, the guard on duty would sometime call them one-by-one, and as soon as they reach the iron grills, the guard would pull their hands and then box them (tsn, p. 83, <em>ibid</em>); that on the morning of January 15, 1973, he and his co-accused were brought to the Office of the 454th PC Company (tsn, pp. 90­-92, <em>ibid</em>); that he was investigated in the pre­sence of his two co-accused (tsn, p. 93, <em>ibid</em>); that Sgt. Soriano was writing the answers given by him (tsn, p. 94, <em>ibid</em>); that at that time, Sgt. Soriano was drunk and in fact made Dalud drink the <em>Tanduay</em> liquor he had with him (tsn, pp. 95­-96, <em>ibid</em>); that everytime he would refuse to ans­wer, Sgt. Soriano would box him (<em>ibid</em>); that some­times, Sgt. Soriano would slap him, (tsn, p. 97, <em>ibid</em>); that Sgt. Soriano was forcing him to admit that he and his companions were the ones who killed Rodolfo Lim and when he refused, he was boxed and pushed by Sgt. Soriano causing him to fall face flat on the cement floor (tsn, pp. 3-4, Jan. 14, 1974, afternoon session); that he became unconscious as a result thereof.&nbsp; </p><p> "The maltreatment which Nestor Dalud had to undergo on January 15, 1973 was merely a prelude to more cruel and barbaric torture.&nbsp; Thus, he testified, to wit:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> 'Q -&nbsp; In what manner or in what way you were again maltreated the following morning of January 16, 1973, up in that guardhouse?&nbsp; </p><p> A -&nbsp;&nbsp; They made me lie down in the spring bed and tied my both hands and feet to it.&nbsp; Then, they got a block of ice, the size of the ice is like this (witness demonstrated) and placed it on top of my face.&nbsp; And after that they undressed me and they even inserted a piece of broom­-stick into the uterus of my pen­is.&nbsp; </p><p> Q -&nbsp;&nbsp; How did they insert a piece of broomstick into your uretral part of your organ?&nbsp; </p><p> A -&nbsp;&nbsp; When my pants was taken off, and I could still remember the man <em>who</em><em> took</em><em> off </em><em>my </em><em>pants</em>, <em>Juansing</em>&nbsp; Legaspi.&nbsp; And after my penis was exposed, one of the soldiers ar­rived by the name of Cristy.&nbsp; And then he looked for a broomstick and he said, 'It is better that we play with him'.&nbsp; Then he han­dled my penis and after that he inserted that broomstick and when the broomstick was already in­serted into my penis, he twisted the broomstick inside.&nbsp; </p><p> Q -&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, was Sgt. Soriano also present?&nbsp; </p><p> A -&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir, he stepped on my chest so that I could not move. </p><p align="center"> * * *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *&nbsp; </p><p> Q -&nbsp; And how long were you on that condition of unbearable pain and sufferings in the hands of your investigators who were PC sold­iers and are supposed to give you the law and justice they being officer of the law?&nbsp; </p><p> A -&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite a long time, sir, because they started from 9:00 o'clock up to the time the siren sounded for 12:00 o'clock because I could still hear the siren sounded.&nbsp; </p><p> Q -&nbsp; And that ice which was being wrapped and placed on top of your head was made to melt all the way long?&nbsp; </p><p> A -&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir, until the block of ice became small and when this be­came small already, Sgt. Soriano lifted it above my face and let it drip into my forehead.' (tsn, pp. 19-21, 22-24, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p> "Nestor Dalud, at this juncture, got a tem­porary reprieve when a soldier named Hicotani, who happens to be his friend and who chanced to witness the maltreatment, remarked:&nbsp; 'Why are you doing this to this person when this person is a good man?' (tsn, p. 26, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; Sgt. Soriano had an altercation with Hicotani but after they talked in Ilocano, they seemed to have patched up their misunderstanding and the latter embraced Dalud and asked him if he had already eaten (tsn, pp. 25, 26, 27, 28, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; Thereafter, Hicotani brought Dalud to the canteen and was given food (tsn, pp. 29-30, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; </p><p> "At around 10:00 o'clock in the evening of January 16, 1973, a drunk constable by the name of Maniano arrived and ordered everybody at the stockade to rise (tsn, p. 33, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; The inmates, including Nestor Dalud, were ordered to make fif­ty push-ups with admonition from Maniano that any­one who cannot make the required number of push­ups will be made to urinate and drink his own urine (tsn, p. 33, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; A Muslim who was not able to comply with Maniano's order was correspondingly meted the penalty (tsn, p. 36, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; </p><p> "On January 17, 1973, Nestor Dalud was taken out of the detention cell by Sgt. Vargas and brought to the office of the 454th PC Company (tsn, p. 43, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; Before he was interrogated, Dalud was brought to a room by Sgt. Vargas and the latter was forcing the former to admit his participation in the slaying of Rodolfo Lim and when he refused, Dalud was made to stand behind a wall and was made a 'punching bag' (tsn, p. 44, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; At one instance, while Dalud was covering his stomach with his hands, Sgt. Vargas suddenly hit him in his ears with open palms causing him temporary deafness (tsn, pp. 47-48, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; There­after, Nestor Dalud was made to sit near a table and Sgt. Vargas started his interrogation in English (tsn, pp. 49-50, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; Sgt. Vargas then started typing the alleged confession, Exhibit 'D', in the presence of Juan C. Nas, Sgt. Anito and Sgt. Soriano (tsn. pp. 50, 51, 53, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; Sgt. Vargas was at the same time trying to convince Nestor Dalud to become a state witness in order that the latter can be exculpated of the charges (tsn, p. 4, Jan. 15, 1974).&nbsp; After Sgt. Vargas had typed the question and the corresponding ans­wer, he would read the same to Nestor Dalud and if the latter would not conform to the answer gi­ven, the former would again maltreat him (tsn, p. 6, January 15, 1974).&nbsp; After Sgt. Vargas had fin­ished preparing Nestor Dalud's confession, he or­dered the latter to sign it but having refused to do so, Sgt. Vargas pulled out his pistol, pulled out the magazine and took out the bullets and in­serted the same between Dalud's fingers (tsn, pp. 37-38, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; Sgt. Vargas then got two handkerchiefs and tied it around Dalud's fingers (tsn, p. 39, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; Sensing the determination of his interrogators to have him admit his participation and accepting the futility of his resistance, Nestor Dalud capitulated and said, 'It is up to you, sir' (tsn, p. 40, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; </p><p> "Nestor Dalud was then brought to the Office of the Clerk of Court by Sgt. Vargas and another PC soldier by the name of Legaspi (tsn, pp. 40-41, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; On their way, Sgt. Vargas and Dalud had the following conversation:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> 'Q -&nbsp; Now, before you were brought to the Office of the Clerk of Court, by Sgt. Vargas and a PC soldier by the name of Legaspi, what did Sgt. Vargas tell you, if he told you anything?&nbsp; </p><p> A -&nbsp;&nbsp; While we were still walking on the road towards the Court, Sgt. Vargas told me '<em>You just signed this because this is good for you.&nbsp; This is the only way you can be released or safe</em>.' But I told him, 'Why should I sign that when all that was written there is not true’.&nbsp; And Sgt. Vargas told me, '<em>It is up to you</em>.'&nbsp; </p><p> Q -&nbsp;&nbsp; When Sgt. Vargas told you it is up to you, what did you under­stand of that statement?&nbsp; </p><p> A -&nbsp;&nbsp; When he said it is up to you, I understood that as soon as we returned to the PC stockade, he would again subject me to punish­ment.&nbsp; So that is why I was af­raid.' (tsn, pp. 42-44, <em>ibid</em>; Italics supplied.)&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p> "Thus, forewarned, Nestor Dalud meekly sign­ed his confession before the Clerk of Court.&nbsp; He knew his fate depended upon how much he cooperated with the authorities.&nbsp; </p><p> "Two days after he signed his confession, Nestor Dalud was made to tape-record his confes­sion by Sgt. Vargas (tsn, pp. 44-46, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; Nes­tor Dalud was' reading his answers from a script given to him by Sgt. Vargas (tsn, pp. 46-47, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; Although Sgt. Vargas denied that Nestor Dalud was merely reading his answers from a copy of the written investigation, the court <em>aquo</em> made the observation 'that the confession and the tape record dovetail with each other' (p. 147, July 26, 1973, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; </p><p> "On the other hand, examination of the tes­timony of Sgt. Jorge Vargas seems to convey that Nestor Dalud had no qualms in admitting his part­icipation in the commission of the crime (tsn, pp. 10-11, July 25, 1973).&nbsp; Yet, it must be noted that Nestor Dalud was initially investigated on <em>January</em><em>15</em>, <em>1973</em> and it was only on <em>January</em><em>17</em>, <em>1973</em>&nbsp; that he signed his confession.&nbsp; What turned Nestor Dalud into a dove when for two days that he was in custodial interrogation, he refused to admit participation in the crime?&nbsp; Was it not due to an overpowering pressure which finally subdued his will?&nbsp; </p><p> "Lourdes Dalud, sister of Nestor Dalud, tes­tified that on January 13, 1973, she went to PC Headquarters in Cotabato City to visit her brother but Sgts. Soriano and Vargas refused to allow her to talk to her brother (tsn, pp. 27-29, Oct. 18, 1973).&nbsp; The following day, she again visited her brother and this time she was able to talk to him (tsn, pp. 33-34, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; She noticed that Nestor Dalud had swellings on the lower portion of his left eye and on his lower lip (tsn, p. 35, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; Nestor Dalud also confided to her that his chest was painful and he had difficulty in breathing and exhibited the swellings on his left breast (tsn, pp. 36-38, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; He also told her that everytime he was made to confess, bullets were inserted bet­ween his fingers (tsn, p. 38, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; </p><p> "Ricardo Ocampo, who accompanied Lourdes Dalud to the PC Headquarters in Cotabato City, corroborated her testimony, <em>viz</em><em>a</em><em>viz</em>, the external manifestations of violence inflicted on Nes­tor Dalud.&nbsp; </p><p> "Dick Dalud, father of Nestor Dalud, also testified that on January 18, 1973, he was arres­ted by PC authorities and placed in the stockade at the PC Headquarters in Cotabato City (tsn, pp. 41-42, Oct. 30, 1973).&nbsp; He saw his son sporting a swollen face and everytime Nestor Dalud would cough, he (Nestor) would vomit blood (tsn, p. 47, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; </p><p> "It is true that the said witnesses are re­lated to Nestor Dalud (Ricardo Ocampo is Nestor Dalud's brother-in-law) but mere relationship to the accused does not destroy a witness' credibi­lity.&nbsp; Their narration of fact bears no positive indication of exaggeration or falsity.&nbsp; We find in the records no fact nor circumstance that im­pels us to doubt or reject their testimonies.&nbsp; Moreover, the lower courd did not make any con­clusion concerning their credibility, hence, there is no reason not to accept their testimonies at face value.&nbsp; </p><p> "The above circumstances notwithstanding, the lower court still looked upon the confession as free of infirmity.&nbsp; Clearly, that was error.&nbsp; The constant course of decisions of this Honor­able Court forbids the admission of any confes­sion obtained under such circumstances.&nbsp; A con­viction resting on such proof, and such proof <em>alone</em>, certainly cannot be allowed to stand.&nbsp; </p><p> “2.&nbsp; The failure of Nestor Dalud to complain to Clerk of Court Benjamin Muñasque of the torture he had undergone is not a guarantee of the volun­tary character of his confession.&nbsp; He was appraised beforehand by Sgt. Jorge Vargas of the consequence of his failure to sign the confession before the Clerk of Court. * * *&nbsp; </p><p align="center"> * * *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *&nbsp; </p><p> “3.&nbsp; The extra-judicial confession suffers from an additional infirmity in that Nestor Dalud signed the same upon the representation of Sgt.

Francisco Soriano and Jorge Vargas testified, on rebuttal, that they never laid their hands on any one of the accused, much less, tor­ture them.&nbsp; However, it is significant to note that Emilio Buscato, father of Isidro Buscato, denounced T/Sgt. Francisco Soriano's maltreatment of his son in a letter-complaint sent to no less than the President of the Philippines himself (tsn, p. 35, August 30, 1973; Exhibit '2', p. 186, Rec.).&nbsp; Sgt. Soriano admitted that the letter complaint was endorsed to the 454th PC Company to which he belongs (tsn, pp. 44-45, March 5, 1974).&nbsp; Surprisingly, the investigation was conducted by the unit of which Sgt. Soriano was the head, with Sgt. Cang, a member of his team, conducting the investigation (tsn, pp. 45-48, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; Here is, therefore, a situation where a subordinate was investigating his superior.&nbsp; Surely, Emilio Bus­cato cannot expect an impartial investigation of his complaint.&nbsp; Thus it is that the investigation ended with Emilio Buscato executing an affidavit of desistance (tsn, p. 25, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p><em> Death Certificate </em><em>of Rodolf Lim</em>&nbsp; </p><blockquote>"Both the prosecution and the defense agree in one thing on this case; that Rodolfo Lim is dead.&nbsp; Yet, a discussion of this case would not seem complete without mentioning the death certi­ficate of Rodolfo Lim which was accomplished by Dr. Eduardo Mariano. &nbsp; <p> "Dr. Mariano testified that he conducted a post-mortem examination of Rodolfo Lim's body near the river where the same was found (tsn, pp. 6-7, May 29, 1973).&nbsp; The result of his findings were handwritten by him and, subsequently, copied by typewriter when he went back to his office (tsn, pp. 12-13, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; However, it is signifi­cant to note the entries on the handwritten and typewritten death certificates (Exhibits 'A' and 'B', '1-Buscato', pp. 3, 185, Rec.) do not coin­cide and in fact, the trustworthiness thereof is suspect, if we consider the following circumstan­ces: </p><p> "1.&nbsp; The Certificate of Death, accomplished in Dr. Mariano's own handwriting, stated that the cause of death is, to wit:&nbsp; wound, stab, 6", left lower abdomen eviscerating, abrasions and contu­sions, arm and forearm bilateral, contusion, back of the neck (Exhibit 'B', '1-Buscato', p. 185, Rec.).&nbsp; All the entries therein are handwritten except the 'contusion at the back of the neck <em>which was typewritten</em>.&nbsp; On the other hand, the typewritten Certificate of Death did not include 'abrasions and contusions, arm and forearm bila­teral' (Exhibit 'A');&nbsp; </p><p> “2.&nbsp; All the entries in the typewritten Cer­tificate of Death (Exhibit 'A') were made on the same typewriter except the entry referring to 'contusion, back of the neck', <em>which obviously, was entered through another typewriter;</em>&nbsp; </p><p> “3.&nbsp; The typewritten words 'contusion, back of neck', as appearing both in Exhibits 'A' and 'B' appears to have been <em>made through the same typewriter</em>.&nbsp; </p><p> "The explanation of Dr. Mariano on the dis­crepancies afore-mentioned does not inspire be­lief.&nbsp; Thus, he testified on cross-examination, as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> 'Q - Do you have that original certi­ficate of death with you now?&nbsp; </p><p> A -&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I have it here.&nbsp; </p><p> Q -&nbsp; In your findings here, there are two entries, one is stab wound, 6" or 6 inches and the other is contusion, is that correct?&nbsp; </p><p> A -&nbsp;&nbsp; Correct.&nbsp; </p><p> Q -&nbsp; When you made the entry, did you make it one at the same time?&nbsp; </p><p> A -&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.&nbsp; </p><p> Q -&nbsp; It appears that the entry 'Wound stab, 6" long, left lower abdo­men eviscerating' and the other entry 'contusion, left neck' are not the same in type, what can you say about this?&nbsp; </p><p> A -&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Probably when I found out that the typewriter ribbon was not functioning well, I think I trans­ferred to another typewriter, I do not exactly remember now</em>.&nbsp; </p><p> Q -&nbsp; And after transferring to the other typewriter just to type down the following words 'contusion, left neck', you went back to the former typewriter to type down the subsequent entries such as date 'Jan. 12, 1973' and others as it appears to be the same from the above entries up to 'EDUARDO L.

Francisco Soriano testified that on the afternoon of January 16, 1973, he investigated Isidro Buscato and that the latter admitted to him that he had stabbed Rodolfo Lim (tsn, p. 15, July 17, 1973).&nbsp; After he had reduced Buscato's confes­sion in writing.&nbsp; Soriano asked the latter to sign the same but Buscato requested to have time to think it over (tsn, p. 16, <em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; On the next day, when Buscato was again asked to sign his confess­ion, he refused to do so (<em>ibid</em>).&nbsp; Except for Sor­iano, no other witness was presented to testify on the substance of Buscato's alleged confession.&nbsp; </p><p> "Admittedly, an accused who had confessed voluntarily would have no objection to reducing the confession to writing, to be signed by him, which, in this case, Isidro Buscato refused to do.&nbsp; What could have spurred Buscato's decision not to sign his ‘confession'? Or better still, did Isidro Buscato really make a 'confession'?&nbsp; </p><p> "Isidro Buscato denied that he ever made a confession.&nbsp; In fact, all throughout the investi­gation and despite the maltreatment he underwent, he stoutly maintained his innocence.&nbsp; Like Nestor Dalud, he named names and recited specific overt acts in his painful recollection of the methods employed to extract his confession.&nbsp; Isidro Busca­to's testimony, taken in relation to that of Nes­tor Dalud, show that the PC investigators have an impressive array of third-degree methods in ex­tracting confessions.&nbsp; Without necessarily imply­ing that Isidro Buscato was subjected to a lesser degree of torture than Nestor Dalud, we beg to quote the more significant portions of his testi­mony, <em>viz</em><em>a</em><em>viz</em>, the inhuman and barbaric methods employed by the investigators, to wit:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> 'Q -&nbsp; What did they do to you that morn­ing?&nbsp; </p><p> A -&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>They made me punching bag</em>.&nbsp; </p><p> Q -&nbsp;&nbsp; Who were they?&nbsp; </p><p> A -&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Sgt.

Bagasala</em>, <em>supra</em>:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "It is likewise timely to impress anew on police officials that the imperative requirements of truth and humanity condemn the utilization of force and violence to extract confessions from unwilling victims.&nbsp; Crimes must be punished and the guilty must not be allowed to escape.&nbsp; A desi­rable end cannot, however, be attained by uncons­titutional means.&nbsp; There should be less than full respect for the law if in the process of enforcing it lawless methods are employed. * * *"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (at p. 244.)&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p> This right against self-incrimination guaranteed in the fundamental charter cannot be abridged.&nbsp; "If the government becomes a lawbreaker", once observed Justice Brandeis, "it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.&nbsp; To declare that in the administra­tion of the criminal law the end justifies the means * * * would bring terrible retribution."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; </p><p> There is no question that cruel or degrading treatment to secure confessions from one suspected of a crime seriously violates his fundamental human rights, the protection of which is basic in a regime of law and justice.&nbsp; </p><p> We thus conclude that without such extrajudi­cial confessions the evidence of the prosecution has failed to overcome the constitutional presump­tion of innocence in favor of the appellants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; </p><p><strong> ACCORDINGLY</strong> , the appealed decision is reversed and appellants Isidro (Boy) Buscato and Nestor Dalud are ACQUITTED.&nbsp; No costs.&nbsp; </p><p> Let a copy of this decision be furnished the Hon­orable, the Secretary of Justice, for the institution of appropriate action against the persons responsible for the maltreatment of appellants.&nbsp; </p><p><em> Fernando, (Chairman), Barredo, Aquino, </em> and<em> Concepcion, Jr., JJ., </em>concur.&nbsp; </p><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Exhibit "A", p. 3, Original Record. &nbsp; <p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Exhibits "C" &amp; "C-1", statement of Jabib Tan dated January 16, 1973, pp. 7-8, Ibid.; Exhibits "D" &amp; "D-1", state­ment of Nestor Dalud dated January 17, 1973, <span style="font-style: italic;">Ibid</span>., pp. 12-13.&nbsp; </p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Exhibit "H".&nbsp; Transcript of the same was made by Stenog­rapher Mateo Bacatan and attached to the folder of transcript of the stenographic notes.&nbsp; </p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Original record, pp. 294-297.&nbsp; </p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> He was assisted by Assistant Solicitor General Nathaniel P. de Pano, Jr. and Trial Attorney Luisito P.
