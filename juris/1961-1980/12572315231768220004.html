				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a disbarment proceeding against Isaias A. Celestino for malpractice 
and misconduct as a lawyer and notary public.
<p>The complainants Mercedes Agdomay Eugenia Agdoma and Pedro Agdoma are aunts 
and uncle of respondent Isaias A. Celestino, his deceased mother Eulogia Agdoma 
being the sister of the former. Both the complainants and the respondent, in 
representation of his late mother Eulogia, are the heirs of the late Julian 
Agdoma, the complainants' father and the respondent's grandfather. Julian Agdoma 
left a parcel of land situated in barrio San Juan, Alcala, Pangasinan registered 
in his name under original certificate of title No. 62507. On 23 July 1945 
Julian Agdoma died, in Lambayong, Cotabato (Exhibits B, B-1 and B-2), On 9 March 
1956 Anastacia Cabatic, Julian's wife, died in Alcala, Pangasinan (Exhibit 
C).</p>
<p>On or after 16 August 1955 Isaias A. Celestino filed in the Court of First 
Instance of Pangasinan an <i>ex-parte</i> petition in behalf of the late Julian 
Agdoma. In said petition he represented that his late grandfather was alive and 
that the latter's copy of original certificate of title No. 62507 bad been 
burned by fire that razed to the ground his (Julian's) house in San Vicente, 
Alcala, Pangasinan; and prayed that the Registrar of Deeds in and for the 
province of Pangasinan be directed to issue another duplicate copy thereof 
(Exhibit E-1). The respondent supported the petition by an affidavit purportedly 
subscribed and sworn to be the deceased Julian Agdoma on 16 August 1955, before 
him (the respondent) Judge Jesus P. Morfe of the Court of First Instance of 
Pangasinan entered an order granting the petition and directing the Registrar of 
Deeds in and for the province of Pangasinan to issue another owner's duplicate 
of certificate of title No. 62507 (Exhibit F).</p>
<p>Two days before the respondent filed the <i>ex-parte</i> petition asking for 
a new copy of original certificate of title No. 62507, it was made to appear 
that for and in consideration of P1,000 Julian Agdoma had sold the lot described 
in the original certificate of title No. 62507 to the respondent in a deed of 
absolute sale (Exhibit C) purportedly acknowledged before notary public Julio B. 
Pequet who, however, turned out to be a fictitious or non-existent notary public 
in and for the province of Pangasinan (Exhibits I and J). By virtue of said 
sale, on 17 August 1955 the Registrar of Deeds in and for the province of 
Pangasinan cancelled original certificate of title No. 62507 in the name of 
Julian Agdoma and in lieu thereof issued transfer certificate of title No. 18925 
in the name of respondent Isaias A. Celestino (Exhibit H). Afterwards, the 
respondent mortgaged the parcel of land for P425 to the Dagupan City branch of 
the Philippine National Bank. Until now the loan still is unpaid.</p>
<p>On 14 February 1957 the complainants filed in this Court a complaint praying 
for the disbarment of Isaias A. Celestino. On 19 February 1957 this Court 
ordered the respondent to answer the complaint within ten days from notice. On 
15 March, the respondent in his behalf filed an answer denying all the material 
averments of the complaint. On 18 March, this Court passed a resolution 
referring the case to the Solicitor General for investigation, report and 
recommendation. On 30 April, the Solicitor General forwarded the case to the 
Provincial Fiscal of Pangasinan for investigation, report and 
recommendation.</p>
<p>The Provincial Fiscal of Pangasinan set the hearing of the case for 26 April 
1957, which was postponed to 9 May 1957. At the hearing held on 9 May, the 
respondent did not appear. The officer serving summons and notices certified 
that the respondent refused to sign the notice. The fiscal considered such 
refusal as a waiver by the respondent of his right to be present at the 
investigation. When the fiscal was preparing a report on the case based on the 
evidence presented by the complainants, attorney Cipriano V. Abenojar of 
Urdaneta, Pangasinan, on 10 June 1957 formally entered his appearance for the 
respondent and requested that the case be immediately set for bearing. The 
respondent expressed in writing his consent to the appearance of and motion by 
attorney Abenojar to set the case for hearing. The fiscal granted the request 
and set the hearing for 26 July 1957 with a warning that no further postponement 
would be granted. At the hearing held on 26 July, neither the respondent nor his 
counsel appeared. Instead, the latter filed a motion for postponement, alleging 
that the respondent and the complainants, being blood relatives, might settle 
amicably. This last motion was granted and the fiscal set the investigation for 
20 August 1957 with a warning of no further postponement. Again, the respondent 
or his lawyer did not appear at the hearing on 20 August. Forthwith, the fiscal 
rendered a report finding the respondent Isaias A. Celestino guilty of 
malpractice and recommending to the Solicitor General that the correspond-in 
charges for disbarment be filed against him (respondent Celestino).</p>
<p>On 22 June 1959 the Solicitor General filed in this Court a formal complaint 
against Isaias A. Celestino for malpractice and breach of professional ethics. 
Letters and communications sent by this Court to the respondent directing him to 
answer the complaint filed by the Solicitor General were all returned 
undelivered or unserved, because the respondent could not be located at his 
given address at San Vicente, Alcala, Pangasinan. His attorney of record in the 
Provincial Fiscal of Pangasinan was also required to answer, but instead of 
answering, he requested that he be relieved as counsel for the respondent. At 
the oral argument of the case before this Court on 14 December, attorney 
Cipriano V. Abenojar appeared for the respondent. The Court ordered the 
respondent himself to submit a memorandum in lieu of oral argument.</p>
<p>The oral and documentary evidence points unerringly to the guilt of 
respondent Isaias A. Celestino as charged. The <i>ex-parte</i> petition wherein 
he sought another owner's duplicate of original certificate of title No. 62507 
and presented himself as counsel for Julian Agdoma, his grandfather, who he knew 
had been dead since 23 July 1945, and the affidavit which he (the respondent) 
represented to have been subscribed and sworn to by Julian Agdoma before him 
(the respondent) as notary public, thus making it appear that his late 
grandfather was alive, and which he used to support the <i>ex-parte</i> 
petition, are clear evidence that the respondent Isaias A. Celestino had 
committed a wanton falsehood in court. And this wanton disregard for truth and 
honesty is aggravated by his forging or simulating a deed of sale of the parcel 
of land described in original certificate of title No. 62507 executed in his 
favor by his deceased grandfather Julian Agdoma when he (the respondent) know 
that his grandfather had been dead ten years before and therefore could not have 
executed the deed of sale. To lend to this concoction a semblance of legality, 
the respondent made it appear that Julian Agdoma appeared and acknowledged the 
sale before one Julio B. Pequet, supposedly a notary public. But it clearly has 
been shown that Bald Julio B. Pequet was a non-existent or fictitious notary 
public The residence certificate No. A-3609899 issued at Alcala, Pangasinan, on 
14 February 1955, which the respondent attributed to pertain to and to have been 
exhibited by the late Julian Agdoma in swearing before him (the respondent) the 
supporting affidavit to the <i>ex-parte</i> petition seeking an owner's 
duplicate of the original certificate of title No. 62507 and in acknowledging 
the deed of sale before the fictitious notary public Julio B. Pequet, is another 
evidence showing the respondent's propensity to commit falsehood, because the 
said residence certificate does not belong to Julian Agdoma but to one Mrs. 
Angela Eslava of Alcala, Pangasinan (Exhibit A). The clinching evidence of the 
respondent's guilt is the fact that after the ownership to the parcel of land 
had been transferred to him, he mortgaged it for P425 to the Philippine National 
Bank, Dagupan City branch.</p>
<p>The respondent avoided attending the hearings conducted by the Provincial 
Fiscal of Pangasinan. Even in this Court, his whereabouts are totally unknown. 
His knowledge that a disbarment proceeding had been filed or pending against him 
imposes upon him the duty to make himself or his presence available to this 
Court for a fair trial. That he could not be located at his known address 
without making his whereabouts known implies that he had chosen to waive every 
right and opportunity to put up his defense.</p>
<p>Therefore, the respondent Isaias A. Celestino is disbarred from the practice 
of the legal profession.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion. Reyes, J. B. L.,
