				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by certiorari from a resolution of the Court <span style="">of </span>Appeals dismissing the petition for
certiorari filed with said court by appellant seeking to set aside a formal
ruling issued by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span> during the course of the trial of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case below sustaining the adverse party's
objection to evidence <span class="SpellE">proferred</span> by appellant as
defendant therein and indicating the nature of evidence that would be deemed
admissible and competent against the adverse party's <span class="SpellE">torrens</span>
title.</p>

<p class="BODY">As narrated in the petition itself, a complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> and damages was filed on September 12, 1963 by
respondent <span class="SpellE">Cosme</span> O. <span class="SpellE">Follosco</span>
as plaintiff against petitioner <span class="SpellE">Toribia</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamagan</span> and her husband <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> (now deceased) as defendants in the lower court presided
by respondent judge.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Follosco</span> prayed of the lower <span style="">c</span>ourt that it order defendants to vacate the 48-hectare portion
of his land "illegally occupied" by them and to restore possession
thereof to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The disputed portion of
land is part of several lots totaling over 500 hectares, of which <span class="SpellE">Follosco</span> is the registered owner by virtue of original
certificate of title No. 178 issued by the <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> register of deeds in April, 1950.</p>

<p class="BODY">In answer to <span class="SpellE">Follosco's</span> complaint,
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Lamagan</span> and her late husband as defendants
claimed that they and their predecessors-in-interest were in open and adverse
possession of the property since 1890; that <span class="SpellE">Follosco's</span>
title was acquired through fraud and deceit, and that the land should be deemed
held in trust by <span class="SpellE">Follosco</span> for them; and that the suit
was brought by <span class="SpellE">Follosco</span> "only after many years
since he obtained his title thereto to hide from defendants' knowledge that the
latter's land was in fact covered by (<span class="SpellE">Follosco's</span>)
title".<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
As counterclaim, defendants prayed for the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
of the disputed land to them on the theory that the same should be deemed as
held in trust by <span class="SpellE">Follosco</span> for them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues having been joined, <span class="SpellE">Follosco</span>
as plaintiff presented through counsel his evidence, oral and documentary, and
closed his case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants then
presented as their first witness petitioner's late husband in support of their
defense and counterclaim for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of his direct examination by
petitioner's counsel, <span class="SpellE">Follosco's</span> counsel objected to
a question dealing with the ownership of the land and manifested a continuing
objection to all similar questions which would elicit evidence of alleged
ownership of defendants, on the ground that <span class="SpellE">Follosco's</span>
title was already indefeasible and beyond judicial review.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question was apparently extensively argued and respondent
court adjourned the trial at noon and issued his three-page written resolution
of August 15, 1966, ruling that any claims of defendants based on an alleged
pre-existing right prior to the alleged fraudulent issuance of the title in
favor of <span class="SpellE">Follosco</span> was already barred under section 38
of Act 496 and that since no petition to reopen and review the decree of
registration on the ground of fraud had been filed within one year from issuance
of the decree, <span class="SpellE">Follosco's</span> title had become
indefeasible and could no longer be attacked collaterally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent court therefore ruled that
"the court so resolves that all questions tending to elicit proof of <u>ownership
other than those which will prove a better and earlier issued Torrens Title
duly registered in favor of the defendants or any of the defendants </u>shall
be barred and be not heard" and sustained <span class="SpellE">Follosco's</span>
objection to defendants' line of questioning, holding that "(T)his court,
without attempting to decide the case at its present stage, will, therefore, <u>entertain
from the defendants proofs and evidence which will indomitably</u><i> </i>(sic)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>show a better and earlier Torrens Title
issued to the defendants, if there is any</u>."<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner-defendant claims that the effect of respondent court's
questioned resolution was to totally prevent her from adducing at the trial any
further evidence in support of her defense to the action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> and of her counterclaim for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
of the disputed land, such as her documentary evidence, allegedly consisting, <u>inter
<span class="SpellE">alia</span></u>, of a <span class="SpellE">possessory</span>
information title in the name of one Mariano <span class="SpellE">Lamagan</span>
dated November 21, 1891, deed of sale by Mariano <span class="SpellE">Lamagan</span>
in favor of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Cambiado</span> dated April 13, 1909,
deed of sale by Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Cambiado</span> in favor of <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamagan</span> (petitioner's
father) dated August 7, 1913, tax declarations, etc. Her motion for
reconsideration having been denied by the trial court's order of September 29,
1966, she asked respondent court to suspend further proceedings in the case
below pending her elevation of the disputed ruling for review by the appellate
courts, and respondent court acceded accordingly.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner accordingly filed her petition for certiorari with the
Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
which handed down its minute resolution of June 21, 1967, dismissing the same
for failure to state a sufficient cause of action for the following principal
reasons: "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> (b) in
the [respondent court's] resolution of August 15, 1966, the petitioner is
permitted to present evidence which will indubitably show a better right; and
(c) the issue does not appear to be within the ambit of a writ of
certiorari." The appellate court in its <st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1967</st1:date> resolution, denying petitioner's motion for
reconsideration of its dismissal order, further noted that "the
counterclaim for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> has already prescribed
(J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co. Inc. vs. Adolfo <span class="SpellE">Magangal</span>, G. R. No. L-15539, <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1962</st1:date>)."</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this appeal to which the Court gave due course on the
strength of petitioner's urgent plea for relief from the "virtual refusal
of the trial court to hear defendants in their defense, <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of due process."</p>

<p class="BODY">The crux of the issues presented by petitioner-appellant in this
appeal is basically procedural, with particular reference to the rules
governing the admission or exclusion of evidence: did the appellate court
commit any grave error, correctible by certiorari, in refusing to review on
certiorari the trial court's disputed ruling in the case below rejecting
petitioner's contested evidence and dismissing the petition filed for the
purpose, on the principal ground that such ruling is an interlocutory matter
and any question as to the correctness thereof does not fall "within the
ambit of a writ of certiorari" and may only be reviewed on appeal taken
from a decision rendered on the merits of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellate court's dismissal of the petition was in full accord
with the rules and applicable jurisprudence of the Court and must be affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As petitioner-appellant
concedes in her petition and brief, it is beyond question that rulings of the
trial court on procedural questions and on admissibility of evidence during the
course of the trial are interlocutory in nature and may not be the subject of
separate appeal or review on certiorari, but are to be assigned as errors and
reviewed in the appeal properly taken from the decision rendered by the trial
court on the merits of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
rule were otherwise, there simply would be no end to the trial of cases, for
any litigant, not satisfied with the trial court's ruling admitting or
excluding any <span class="SpellE">proferred</span> oral or documentary evidence,
would then indefinitely tie up the trial while elevating the ruling for review
by the appellate court.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither has petitioner
made out a case for her claim that she should be permitted the special recourse
of seeking a review of the trial court's ruling by certiorari, since it
virtually ruled out all her evidence in support of her defense to the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> and of her counterclaim for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>,
and hence, appeal in due course was not an adequate re­medy.</p>

<p class="BODY">The true and special function of writ of certiorari was defined
by the Court in <u>Fernando vs. Vasquez</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
thus: "A line must be drawn between errors of judgment and errors of
jurisdiction. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>An error of judgment is
one which the court may commit in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An error of jurisdiction renders an order or
judgment void or <span class="SpellE">voidable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Errors of jurisdiction are <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> on certiorari; errors of judgment, only by
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let us not lose sight of the
true function of the writ of certiorari - 'to keep an inferior court within the
bounds of its jurisdiction or to prevent it from committing such a grave abuse
of discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction</u>.' And, abuse of discretion
must be so grave and patent to justify the issuance of the writ."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court likewise cited therein the exceptional case where
certiorari had been entertained despite the existence of the remedy of an
appeal: "But in those cases, either public welfare and the advancement of
public policy so dictate, or the broader interests of justice so require, or
the order complained of were found to be completely null and void, or appeal
was not considered the appropriate remedy, such as in appeals from orders of
preliminary attachment or appointment of receiver"<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, in <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Abalos</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court granted as an exception a writ of certiorari against the trial
court's ruling rejecting rebuttal evidence for the prosecution, pointing out
that "once the accused has been acquitted, there is no means to secure a
review by appeal, no matter how erroneous the action of the lower court may
have been." No equally compelling reason has been advanced by petitioner
as would place her case within the exceptions.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner may have
reason in law to complain against the trial court's ruling that it would admit
from her only evidence of "a better and earlier issued <span class="SpellE">torrens</span>
title duly registered in favor of the defendants or any of (them)", since
it merely held petitioner's one-year period to reopen the decree in favor of
respondent <span class="SpellE">Follosco</span> on the ground of fraud to have
already lapsed, but did not take into account petitioner's action in equity (by
way of her counterclaim) for the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of the
land on the principle of constructive trust.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such an action precisely concedes that the adverse party wrongfully
succeeded in obtaining a <span class="SpellE">torrens</span> title but prays that
such title should be ordered cancelled and <span class="SpellE">reconveyed</span>
in favor of the claimant as the true beneficiary rightfully entitled thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming that the trial court erred in rejecting petitioner's <span class="SpellE">proferred</span> evidence, petitioner's recourse is clear under
the long established rules, to wit, to make a formal offer of the evidence
under Rule 132, section 35, stating on the record what a party or witness would
have testified to were his testimony not excluded, as well as attaching to the
record any rejected exhibits. The Court has long noted that "it is the
better practice to untie with the record exhibits ... which have been
rejected"<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
and that such rejected or excluded exhibits "should have been permitted by
the judge <u>a quo</u> to be attached to the record even if not admitted in evidence,
<u>so that in case of an appeal .... the court ad <span class="SpellE">quem</span>
may thus be</u> <u>able</u> t<u>o examine said exhibits and to judge whether or
not their rejection was erroneous</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">4. The validity of the cited rule, i.e. to bring up to the
appellate court the rejected exhibits upon a proper appeal from a decision on
the merits of the case, enabling the appellate court to examine all the exhibits
and evidence of record and judge accordingly whether the trial court erred in
rejecting the excluded exhibits was evident in the very case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, petitioner sought to attach to the
records here the exhibits which she intended to present to the trial court but
were ruled out by it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since there has
been no decision rendered as yet by the trial court and respondent has
denounced the <span class="SpellE">proferred</span> documents as "gross and
careless forgery"<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
which should be passed upon by the trial court in the first instance, the Court
had to order said documents expunged from the records of the case at bar.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Again, respondent has cited the 1953 case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Follosco</u></span><u>
vs. Director of Lands</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein the appeal of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Lamagan</span> and her
other co-appellants (as homestead claimants) from the lower court's order
denying their petition to set aside its judgment of <st1:date year="1948" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1948</st1:date> declaring respondent <span class="SpellE">Follosco</span> the owner of the land subject of the registration
proceeding was turned down by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This fact places in grave doubt the veracity of petitioner's allegation
that <span class="SpellE">Follosco</span> had sought to hide from her the fact of
his having secured title to the land in question, and appears to provide ample
justification for the appellate court's pronouncement in its August 2, 1967
resolution as to her counterclaim for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
having "already prescribed."</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, all these questions will have first to be
necessarily passed upon and resolved by the trial court in the decision that it
has yet to render - which serves but to demonstrate the impropriety and <span class="SpellE">prematurity</span> of petitioner's present action.</p>

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, it seems in
order, nevertheless, to reiterate the Court's admonitions to trial courts, as
in <span class="SpellE"><u>Abalos</u></span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
citing the 1929 case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Prats</u></span><u> &amp; Co. vs.
Phoenix Insurance Co.,</u><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
that "(I)n the course of long experience we have observed that justice is
most effectively and expeditiously administered in the courts where trivial
objections to the admission of proof are received with least favor. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The practice of excluding evidence on doubtful
objections to its materiality or technical objections to the form of the
questions should be avoided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a case
of any intricacy it is impossible for a judge of first instance, in the early
stages of the development of the proof, to know with certainty whether
testimony is relevant or not; and where there is no indication of bad faith on
the part of the attorney offering the evidence, the court may as a rule safely
accept the testimony upon the statement of the attorney that the proof offered
will be connected later."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, where there is no indication of bad faith on the part of the party
offering the evidence or of a design to unduly prolong the trial, the Court has
<span class="SpellE">counselled</span> trial courts to be liberal in accepting <span class="SpellE">proferred</span> evidence, since even if they were to refuse to
accept the evidence, the affected party should nevertheless be allowed to
spread the excluded evidence on the record, for review on appeal, as indicated
in paragraph 3 <u>supra.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">As pointed out in <span class="SpellE"><u>Prats</u></span>, <u>supra</u>,
"the admission of proof in a court of first instance, even if the question
as to its form, materiality, or relevancy is doubtful, can never result in much
harm to either litigant, because the trial judge is supposed to know the law;
and it is its duty, upon final consideration of the case, to distinguish the
relevant and material from the irrelevant and immaterial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this course is followed and the cause is
prosecuted to the Supreme Court upon appeal, this court then has all the
material before it necessary to make a correct judgment."</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, should the trial court exclude evidence that it
deems clearly irrelevant and inadmissible, it should not - in the absence of an
injunction order from the appellate courts or of strong compelling reasons
above indicated - order the suspension of the trial pending the outcome of any
recourse sought by the affected party from the higher courts but should
continue with the trial and render in due course its judgment, which may then
be properly appealed from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless
delay in the trial and determination of the case would thus be avoided, unlike
in the case at bar where the trial court erroneously acceded to suspending the
trial below pending the outcome of this proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be sufficient in such cases that
the trial court afford the affected party a reasonable period and opportunity
to secure from the higher courts a preliminary injunction order against the
continuation of the trial, and thereafter proceed with the trial and judgment
of the case upon the party's failure to secure such injunctive order.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the resolution appealed from is hereby
affirmed and the petition is dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp;
