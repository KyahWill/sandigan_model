				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for <i>certiorari</i> to review the resolution of the
Court of <span style="">A</span>ppeals of <st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1966</st1:date> in its case
GR-37231-R.</p>

<p class="BODY">The basic facts are undisputed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 4, 1963 <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> <span class="SpellE">Azarias</span>, Jr. (hereinafter referred to as the private
respondent) filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, docketed therein as special pro­ceeding 4004 and
assigned to the branch presided by Judge <span class="SpellE">Manolo</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Maddela</span> (hereinafter referred to as the respondent Judge),
in which he prayed for appointment as administrator of the estate, and for
recognition as an acknowledged natural child, of the de­ceased <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> <span class="SpellE">Azarias</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> B. <span class="SpellE">vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Azarias</span> (hereinafter
referred to as the petitioner) filed on <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="3">March
 25, 1963</st1:date> her opposition thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due hearing, the respondent Judge, on January 22, 1965,
rendered a decision appointing the petitioner <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
of the intestate estate of her deceased husband, <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Azarias</span>, and declaring the private respondent as the
natural child and an heir of the deceased and entitled to all the rights and
privileges as such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copy of this
decision was received by the petitioner's counsel on <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1965</st1:date>
the petitioner filed a motion for re­consideration and/or correction of the
said decision, which she "respectfully submitted" for the
consideration of the respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She did not however include therein a notice fixing the time and place
for its hearing, although she sent copies of the motion by registered mail to
the respondent Judge and to the counsel of the private respondent on February
22, 1965, who received them on February 25 and February 23, 1965, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1965</st1:date>
the private respondent moved for execu­tion of the decision; the petitioner
filed her opposition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 28, 1965 the respondent Judge issued three orders
simultaneously, (a) denying the motion for reconsideration and/or correction on
the ground that it lacked the formalities required by the revised Rules of
Court with respect to notice; (b) granting the private respondent's motion for
execution of the decision; and (c) denying the petitioner's opposition to the
motion for execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 17, 1965 the petitioner filed with the respon­dent
Judge a cash appeal bond, a notice of appeal and a record on appeal, which were
disapproved per order of the respondent Judge dated February 14, 1966, on the
ground that the decision in the said special proceeding had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> on <span style="">M</span>arch
18, 1965.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1966</st1:date>
the petitioner lodged with the Court of Appeals an original petition for <i>mandamus</i>
to compel the respon­dent Judge to immediately approve the petitioner's notice
of ap­peal, appeal bond and record on appeal in special proceeding 4004 of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This petition was dis­missed by the Court of
Appeals per resolution dated <st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="3">March 14,
 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner's
motion for reconsideration of the said resolution was denied by the Court of
Appeals on <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this appeal by way of <i>certiorari</i>, which poses three
assignments of error, all three reducible to one single issue:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did the lower court act legally and correctly
in dismissing the petitioner's motion for reconsideration because it lacked a
formal notice of hearing although all parties were properly served with copies
thereof?</p>

<p class="BODY">This issue, which is neither new nor novel, has been re­solved by
this Court in cases impressive as to number and <span style="">unanimity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>We have
uniformly held that a motion which does not meet <span style="">the requirements of sections 4 and 5 of Rule 15 of the revised Rules of
Court is a worthless piece of paper which the clerk has no right to receive and
the respondent court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> no authority to act upon.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In <u>Manila Surety and
Fidelity Co., Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Batu</span> Cons­truction and Co.</u>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> this Court declared:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The written notice referred to evidently is that prescribed
for motions in general by Rule 15, Sections 4 and 5 (formerly Rule 26), which
provide <span style="">that such notice shall state
the time and place of hearing and shall be served upon all the parties con­cerned
at least three days in advance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
accord­ing to Section 6 of the same Rule no motion shall be acted upon by the
court without proof of such notice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed it has been held that in such a case the mo­tion is nothing but a
useless piece of paper (Philip­pine National Bank v. <span class="SpellE">Donasco</span>,
L-18638, February 28, 1963, citing <span class="SpellE">Manakil</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span>, 42 Phil. 81; Roman Catholic Bishop of <span class="SpellE">Lipa</span> v. Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Unisan</span>,
44 Phil. 866; and Director of Lands v. <span class="SpellE">Sanz</span>, 45 Phil.
117).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason is obvious; unless the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> sets the time and place of hearing the court would
have no way to determine whether that party agrees or objects to the motion,
and if he ob­jects, to hear him on his objection, since the Rules themselves do
not fix any period within which he may file his reply or opposition. " (at
pp. 437-438)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We recently reaffirmed the said doctrine in <span class="SpellE"><u>In</u></span><u>
Re <span class="SpellE">Almacen</span>,</u><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Recalling Atty. <span class="SpellE">Almacen's</span> petition
for re­view, we found upon a thoroughgoing examination of the pleadings and
records, that the Court of Appeals had fully and correctly considered <span style="">the dismissal </span>of his appeal in the
light of the law and applicable deci­sions of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Far from straying away from <span style="">the 'accepted and usual course of judicial
proceedings,' it traced the procedural lines etched by this Court in a number
of decisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was, there­fore, no
need for this Court to exercise its supervisory power.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"As
</span>a law practitioner who was admitted to the Bar as far back as 1941,
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Almacen</span> knew - or ought to have known - that
for a motion for re­consideration to stay the running of the period of appeal,
the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> must not only serve a copy of the motion
upon the adverse party (which he did), but also notify the adverse party of the
time and place of hearing (which admittedly he did not).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>xxx" (at pp. 575-576)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Bautista Angelo v. Alfaro</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
where the appellant filed a motion for reconsideration without serving a copy
thereof on the opposing parties and without giving a notice of hearing until
after one-and-a-half months later, this Court held that what the appellant
filed was not a motion at all but a mere scrap of paper which the Court had no
right to consider nor the clerk of Court to receive (<u>citing</u> <span class="SpellE">Manakil</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span>, <u>supra)</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner, however, argues that she precisely omitted notice
of hearing in the motion for reconsideration in order not to expose the alleged
errors of the respondent Judge to the attention of the public and thus save him
from embarrassment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This reason­ing
strikes us as an afterthought to conceal the forgetfulness if not the
negligence of the petitioner's counsel; it is not a sufficient warrant to
disobey the clear and unequivocal mandate of the Rules of Court regarding the
inclusion of a notice of hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner argues that a motion for reconsideration even
without a notice of hearing is valid, citing <span class="SpellE"><u>Inesin</u></span><u>
v. <span class="SpellE">Canonoy</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
But there were in the said case special circumstances which formed the basis of
the ruling therein, which are not present in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court of first instance held its sessions
in <span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, only once a year on the dates fixed by the district
judge, pursuant to sec. 161, Rev. Adm. Code, as superseded by sec. 54 Of Rep.
Act 296.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because the sessions in <span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span> were not continuous throughout the year, and since
it was not shown that, at the time the respondent therein presented the motion
for reconsideration of the order of dismissal, the judge had already set a date
for the next term, the attorney for the <span class="SpellE">mo­vant</span>
(respondent therein) could not set the motion for hearing, not knowing on what
date or in what month the next yearly session in <span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span>
was to be had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The omission of a notice
of hearing was therefore justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here
the factual situation is entirely different.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although the petitioner alleges that the respondent Judge had a <span style="">roving assignment (no doubt in an effort to
bring this case square­ly within the ambit of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Inesin</u></span>
ruling), holding sessions at Paler, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, and at <span class="SpellE">Polillo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, and in other
places of the pro­vince, there is no dispute that at the time material to this
case, the respondent court was holding sessions at <span class="SpellE">Polillo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><u>Manansala</u></span><u> v. <span class="SpellE">Heras</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
cited by the petitioner in support of her argument that motions for
reconsideration need not actually be heard, involved pleading and practice
before the Public Service Commission, and is not therefore authority for this
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, this Court did not rule
therein that a notice of hearing may be dis­pensed with in a motion for
reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner also contends that since the private respondent
was furnished a copy of the motion, there was substantial compliance with the
requirements of section 6, Rule 15 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, she asserts, even if the questioned
motion for reconsideration is defective for want of a notice of hearing, that
the defect was cured because the opposing party was served with a copy thereof
and was thereby properly notified of the exist<span style="">ence of the pleading, citing <u>Sun Un <span class="SpellE">Giok</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Matusa</span>.</u></span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> This latter case is likewise not in
point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>Sun Un <span class="SpellE">Giok</span></u>,
there was a notice </span>of hearing incorporated in the motion to dismiss,
which notice, although not addressed to the opposing party but to the clerk of
court, nevertheless enabled the latter to actually set the motion <span style="">for hearing and notify the former
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, there is no
notice of hearing at all in the motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parenthetically, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Almacen</u></span>,
this Court did not accord any impor­tance to the <span class="SpellE">undenied</span>
fact that a copy of the motion for reconside</span>ration therein was furnished
the opposing party.</p>

<p class="BODY">The assertion of the petitioner that there is no specific
provision of the Rules of Court making it a pre-requisite that mo­tions for
reconsideration be heard or be set for hearing and the adverse party be
notified of the place, date and time for hearing, deserves scant
attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A similar argument was
rejected by <span style="">this Court in <u>Manila
Surety</u>, <span class="SpellE"><u>Almacen</u></span> and <span class="SpellE"><u>Magno</u></span><u>
v. Ortiz</u>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> all of </span>which involved motions for
reconsideration without notice of <span style="">hearing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Magno</u></span>, although the
motion for reconsideration did not contain a notice of hearing, the trial court
<span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>
set the case for hearing, but finally denied the motion for lack of <span style="">the required notice of hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">W</span><span style="">e there held that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"As regards the notice of hearing caused to be issued by
respondent Judge, it is contended that it cured the defect of lack of
notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the facts of this case,
the contention is incorrect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
first place, the duty to give such notice de­volves upon the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>, not upon the court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Considering
that a defective motion for reconside­ration does not toll the running of the
period for appeal, the decision in Civil Case No. 410 had al­ready become final
when the notice of hearing was issued by the respondent Judge." (at pp.
696-697)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the petitioner advances the proposition that be­cause
the petitioner's motion for reconsideration specified the findings in the
decision which are allegedly not in accordance with the facts and the evidence
in the case, and argued that there was incorrect application of the law to the
facts, the petition is not <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if we were to consider the petitioner's
pleading as a motion for new trial under Rule 37, sec. 1, paragraph (c) of the
Revised Rules of Court, because the reasons relied upon are equi­valent to an
assertion that the decision is contrary to law and the evidence, the applicable
rule on the matter would be section 2, Rule 37, construed in relation to
sections 4, 5 and 6 of Rule 15.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
result is the same:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a written notice of
a motion for new trial must be served by the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
on the adverse party, stating the time and place of the hearing thereof;
without proof of service of such notice the motion can not be acted upon by the
court.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the resolution of the Court of Appeals dated <st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1966</st1:date> is affirmed, at
