				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">For the death on December 29, 1964 of Odarlico Sotero, 28 years old, married, jobless, of Mayantoc, Tarlac, Domingo Pascual and Sergio Nicolas, barrio lads, then eighteen and nineteen years old respectively, and farm hands in Bo. Pitombayog, also of Mayantoc, were charged with the crime of murder before Branch I, Court of First Instance of Tarlac, the Hon. Jose T. Lantin presiding. Both accused pleaded not guilty; but after trial, they were convicted and sentenced as follows:<br><blockquote>"(T)o suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> with the accessory penalties prescribed by law, to indemnify jointly and severally the heirs of the deceased Odarlico Sotero in the sum of £6,000.00, to indemnify jointly and severally the widow of said deceased in the amount of £792.00 as actual expenses incurred by her as a consequence of the death of her husband, both without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote>A notice of appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> having been filed for both accused by their counsel, the records were erroneously transmitted to the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> which forwarded the same to this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On March 18, 1969, before the brief for the appellants was filed, Sergio Nicolas withdrew his appeal for the reason that he wanted "to enjoy the privileges of a sentence (d) prisoner and to be entitled to any form of executive clemency."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The withdrawal was granted in a Resolution dated March 27, 1969.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Thus, this review pertains to the appeal of the accused-appellant Domingo Pascual only.<br><br>The evidence adduced at the trial show that in the morning of December 29, 1964, Odarlico Sotero requested the two accused, Domingo Pascual and Sergio Nicolas, to accompany him to Bo. Namagbagan to buy a goat, which he intended to slaughter on New Year's eve. The two acceded to the request; and they actually proceeded to the said barrio. But instead of accomplishing their purpose, they ended up spending the day taking drinks in stores along their way.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>When they finally decided to go home in the afternoon, they met an Igorot selling medicinal herbs. Odarlico asked the Igorot if the latter had medicine for nervousness. The Igorot did not understand Odarlico so he, the Igorot, asked Odarlico, what he meant. Odarlico got irritated. He held the Igorot by the collar and slapped his face. He then searched the pocket of the Igorot and got the latter's money. When the Igorot meekly asked Odarlico why he took his money, Odarlico denied having taken the same and started boxing the Igorot. Several persons arrived and tried to stop Odarlico but their efforts were in vain. An old man, finally, sent a boy to call for the barrio captain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, Alfredo Sotero and the other barrio councilmen were about to hold a council meeting at the house of the barrio captain. When the boy arrived at the house and informed the councilmen of the incident between Odarlico and the Igorot, Alfredo and his co-councilmen repaired to the place. They saw the Igorot crying while Odarlico and his two companions, Domingo and Sergio, were sitting by the side of the road. Alfredo asked the Igorot why he was crying. The Igorot replied that Odarlico boxed him and took his money. Alfredo then confronted Odarlico; but the latter denied having taken the money. The Igorot then informed Alfredo that the money was in the pocket of Odarlico. When Alfredo was about to search the pocket of Odarlico, the latter grudgingly drew the money from his pocket and threw it to Alfredo. Alfredo asked Odarlico if he was angry. Odarlico angrily replied: "You son of. . . , you are minding things you do not even see!" and, instantaneously, slapped the face of Alfredo. This angered Alfredo; and the two took a fighting stance. At this juncture, two sons of Alfredo, with bamboo poles in hand, came to the aid of their father. They were however, pacified by the people around them. Alfredo then told the companions of Odarlico, Domingo and Sergio, to go home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The following morning news spread that Odarlico Sotero was dead. His body was found lying on the ground, face down, lifeless in an isolated spot not far from the house of Alfredo Sotero.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> At about 10:00 o'clock that same morning, Municipal Health officer, Dr. Benjamin K. Calderon, accompanied by Sanitary Inspector Tomas Molina and Patrolmen Francisco Mariano and Andres Naval, repaired to Bo. Pitombayog where they found the dead body of Odarlico.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Dr. Calderon, examined the body and made an autopsy report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> to wit:<br><br><center>xxx xxx xxx</center><br>FINDINGS:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> Old Scar, Dorsal surface of the hand, left.<br><br></li><li>Puncture Wound, skin deep, middle finger, left hand.<br><br></li><li>Violet colored patches of the neck, breast, abdomen and lateral surface of arm and forearm.<br><br></li><li>Lacerated wound, elbow joint, volar surface, skin deep and about 1/2 inch in length, left.<br><br></li><li>Lacerated wound, back of ear skin deep, right.<br><br></li><li>Lacerated wound, parietal region left side, about 1 1/2 inches in length and about 1 centimeter deep.<br><br></li><li>Lacerated wound of the occipital region, left side about 1 1/2 inches in length with compound fractures of the occipital bone.<br><br></li><li>Lacerated wound, of the occipital region below lession no. 7, left side, about 1 1/2 inches in length with fracture of the occipital bone.<br><br></li><li>Lacerated wound of the mastoid region about 3 inches in length with fracture of the mastoid bone, left side.<br><br></li><li>Lineal scratch of the thigh medial side, left.</li></ol></blockquote><br>DIAGNOSIS:<br><br>Shock, cerebral hemorrhage secondary, due to compound fractures of the skull with brain involvement.<br><br><center>xxx xxx xxx</center><br>BENJAMIN K. CALDERON<br>Rural Health Physician<br>Mayantoc, Tarlac<br><br>According to Dr. Calderon's testimony, the approximate time of Odarlico's death was seventeen (17) hours prior to his examination. He attributed the death to injuries caused by a blunt instrument.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Because Domingo and Sergio were the last persons seen with Odarlico the day previous, Patrolmen Mariano and Naval apprehended the two and brought them to the municipal building that very same morning. In the course of the investigation by the police authorities, the two accused executed sworn statements admitting the commission of the crime.

To this submission, the Solicitor General,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> representing the People concurs and concludes "that the guilt of the appellant of the crime of murder of which he has been charged had not been proven beyond reasonable doubt."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The People's counsel argues that — (1) there is no direct evidence whatsoever linking the appellant to the death of Odarlico Sotero outside of his own admission; (2) that there exists no evidence with respect to the ill motive of both appellant and Sergio Nicolas against the deceased; (3) that it would appear on the other hand that there are other persons who might have the motive to kill Odarlico; and, finally (4) that in the case at bar, there is no clear cut showing that appellant is guilty of the charge for which he has been convicted, considering the following:<br><br>"(1) It is undisputed that there was no previous misunderstanding between the accused and the deceased. In fact the three were together during the whole day upon invitation of the deceased to buy a goat.<br><br>"(2) It is hard to believe that simply because the two accused demurred to the suggestion of the deceased to burn the piles of palay of one Asiong Labonete would be enough to arouse the feeling of the deceased to the extent of threatening them with death.<br><br>"(3) And there is no reason why the accused (Domingo Pascual and Sergio Nicolas) would be afraid of the supposed threat of the deceased Odarlico Sotero when there is no indication that the latter was armed for certainly he was of no match to the two accused.<br><br>"(4) The accused could have easily avoided the alleged threat of the deceased by the simple expedience of waiting for the deceased to go over the barbwire fence and running away on the opposite direction.<br><br>"(5) According to the affidavit of accused Sergio Nicolas, they followed the order of Ordarlico Sotero but in the affidavit of appellant, they did not follow the suggestion of Odarlico.<br><br>"(6) The finding of the bamboo pole in the place allegedly indicated by the accused is not significant, as erroneously found by the trial court, for the same could be secured by anyone who is interested in pinning authorship of the crime to the accused.<br><br>"(7) Alfredo Sotero or anyone did not in anyway whatsoever refute the testimony of the appellant and Sergio that there was an altercation between the deceased and Alfredo Sotero, and that the latter and his two sons were the last persons with the deceased before he was killed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>A careful consideration of the trial court's rationale for its finding of guilt of the herein accused, viz a viz, the submissions of the <i>counsel de oficio</i> and the Solicitor General, who recommends appellant's acquittal, the questions raised in this appeal may be synthesized for logical treatment as follow:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> Was the extrajudicial statement of the accused, which, along with the proof of <u>corpus delicti,</u> is the sole basis for his conviction, executed voluntarily as the trial court held; or not, as the appellant thru <i>counsel de oficio</i> and the appellee, thru the Solicitor General, claim?<br><br></li><li> Assuming that the said extrajudicial statement was executed voluntarily, is the same, coupled with the proof of <i>corpus delicti,</i> sufficient to establish appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt? and,<br><br></li><li> What is the significance of the existence of probable motives on the part of other persons — i.e., the Igorot and Alfredo Sotero, barrio councilman — to kill Odarlico, on the guilt of innocence of the accused appellant?</li></ol></blockquote>Now to resolve the foregoing questions —<br><br>1. On whether the accused-appellant's extrajudicial confession is voluntary or not. The trial court concluded that the same was executed voluntarily because — (1) the affidavits contain details which could not have been supplied or invented by the police and which could have been given only by the accused themselves; (2) the same were taken by the Chief of Police of Mayantoc and subscribed and sworn to before the Municipal Judge, both public officials in whose favor the presumption of regularity in the performance of their official duties may be indulged; (3) when the written statements of the two accused were taken in the Office of the Chief of Police at the ground floor of the municipal building of Mayantoc, the windows were open and there were several persons inside and outside the same; (4) if the two accused were maltreated by the policemen in the manner and during the length of time alleged by them, they must have suffered serious injuries and must have been totally disabled, which were not the case when they were brought before the municipal judge to subscribe and swear to their affidavits; (5) the alleged maltreatment was denied by Patrolman Naygan and Cpl. Maximino Jara of the Police Force of Mayantoc; and finally, (6) the finding of the police of the bamboo pole, Exhibit "D", mentioned in the affidavits of both accused as having been used, to kill the victim at the precise place pointed to by one of them, clearly shows that the statements were made by them and were not invented by the police.<br><br>Appellant, thru counsel de oficio, in his Brief, on the other hand, argues — (1) that the two-page statement consisting of 25 short questions and answers took three hours to complete, suggesting that there has been unrecorded questions and answers and harassment of the appellant in the hands of his investigators; (2) that the detail mentioned in the confession, namely, the bamboo pole allegedly used to kill the victim, is not of sufficient importance to render as corroborated an otherwise uncorroborated confession, for bamboo poles are very common in rural areas; (3) that the only other detail in the confession which could have come from the appellant is the existence of rice stalks belonging to Asiong Labonete, but no independent evidence was introduced to establish the existence of such rice stalks; (4) the two confessions contradict each other, because while the appellant stated that they did not burn the rice stalks (Exh. "B", Answer No. 15), Sergio Nicolas said that they burned the same (Exh. "A", Answer No. 13); (5) that the trial court found that the appellant accompanied Patrolman Victor Lardizabal to retrieve the bamboo pole allegedly used to kill the victim, but this finding of fact is belied completely by the prosecution's own evidence since Lardizabal testified that it was Sergio Nicolas whom he accompanied to the river bank to retrieve the bamboo pole; and (6) that the trial court erred in giving weight to the testimonies of prosecution witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The Solicitor General in turn observes — (1) that the trial court capitalized on the supposed extrajudicial confession, which was vehemently denounced by the appellant and his co-accused as procured through force, violence and intimidation; (2) that accused's denial was timely since they did not have the opportunity to denounce their torturers while confined in the municipal jail; and, (3) that it was only after appellant was transferred to the provincial jail, after three weeks<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> of confinement in the municipal jail, that he had the opportunity to confide the matter to his brothers and sisters who then advised him to disclose the truth of his maltreatment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Since the conviction of the herein accused, is premised solely on his extrajudicial confession coupled with proof of <i>corpus delicti,</i> the voluntary character of said confession must be established by evidence beyond cavil of doubt. For if the voluntariness of the confession were in any manner to be subject to doubt, the confession cannot support the conviction in this case.<br><br>The rule is well settled that "the trial court's findings will be sustained unless there appears in the record some fact or circumstance of weight and influence which has been overlooked or the significance of which has been misinterpreted."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In the case of <i>People v. Villaroya,</i> We held that the trial court's findings must not be disturbed unless (a) the record shows that some facts or circumstances of weight or influence have been overlooked, or (b) the significance of which has been misinterpreted, or (c) some conclusion established from the facts is inconsistent with these findings, or (d) there is some inherent weakness in the evidence upon which the conclusion is based.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The records reveal, however, that there are facts and circumstances which the trial court overlooked or the significance of which it failed to appreciate, which place in doubt its reliance on the sworn statement as voluntary and as sole basis for its finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt of a very serious offense — murder.<br><br>a. The trial court concluded that the extrajudicial statement of the appellant was voluntarily executed for the reason, among others, that the statement contained details which could not have been supplied or invented by the police and which could have been given by the accused only.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> However, a thorough scrutiny of appellant's statement would show that the details concerning the place where and the time when the crime was committed, the manner of its commission, and the incidents attendant thereto, have been known, or could have easily been known, to the policemen who conducted the investigation. For it is a matter of record that the police authorities were well aware, before the statements were taken, where the body of the deceased was found, the manner of his death, and the approximate time when he was killed, because an investigation was conducted by them at the scene where the body of the victim was found, and the autopsy was performed in their presence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>b. The trial court failed to note and/or did not attach significance to the fact that the two accused made diametrically conflicting assertions with respect to whether the hay stack of Labonete was indeed burned by them. Accused-appellant in his statement said that <i>they did not burn</i> the <i>mandala;</i> whereas, Sergio Nicolas, who withdrew his appeal, maintained that they did.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>c. Again the lower court failed to note that the statements in the affidavits of the two accused, with respect to the manner in which they hit Odarlico with the bamboo pole, are inconsistent with the findings of the Medical Officer as to the wounds and bruises sustained by him. While the affidavits state that each of the accused beat Odarlico two times at the head,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Dr. Calderon, in his Necropsy Report and in his testimony, states that the deceased suffered wounds and bruises in other parts of his body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>d. Finally, the trial court found —<br><blockquote>"Because Sergio Nicolas mentioned in his affidavit that the bamboo pole used in killing Odarlico was thrown by Domingo Pascual at the side of a river, Chief of Police Cruz ordered policemen Victor Lardizabal to accompany <i>Domingo Pascual</i> in going to Sitio Cabaruan in order to retrieve the said bamboo pole. That was on the morning of December 31, 1964. The duo rode in a pick-up vehicle and upon reaching Sitio Cabaruan, they proceeded to a place beside a river where, according to Pascual, he threw the bamboo pole. After searching the place, Lardizabal found that object, picked it up and then asked Pascual: 'is this the bamboo?,' and Pascual answered: 'Yes, sir.' x x x"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>This material corroborative detail must have induced the trial court's finding of appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt, since it would appear that appellant's extrajudicial confession was indeed corroborated by a very significant fact, namely, the <i>finding of the bamboo pole, allegedly utilized in killing the victim, at the precise place allegedly pointed to by accused-appellant himself.</i></blockquote>The truth of the matter, however, is that it was not appellant Domingo Pascual who was accompanied by Patrolman Lardizabal to the place where the bamboo pole was found, nor was Pascual the one who retrieved the bamboo pole. By testimony of Patrolman Lardizabal himself, it was Sergio Nicolas whom he accompanied to the place to retrive the bamboo pole, thus —<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="center">xxx xxx xxx</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">&nbsp;</td><td width="95%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"Q. </td><td>Upon reaching that place beside the river, what did you do?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A. </td><td>We searched for the piece of bamboo, sir, which he used in hitting the victim.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q. </td><td>When you said "we, " are you referring to the accused Sergio Nicolas'?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A. </td><td>Yes, sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q. </td><td>Were you able to find the bamboo?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A. </td><td>Yes, sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q. </td><td>How did you happen to find the bamboo pole?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A. </td><td>We were able to locate the bamboo because he told me where he threw the bamboo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The foregoing facts and circumstances — i.e., (1) that the details were or could easily have been known to the police investigators; (2) the contradicting testimonies over a very significant matter, whether the mandala was burned or not; and (3) the presence of wounds and bruises in other parts of Odarlico's body — which were overlooked, or the significance of which the trial court failed to appreciate, place in serious doubt its finding that the statement is voluntary. And the trial court's mistake in its finding that it was appellant who was accompanied by Pat. Lardizabal to the place where the bamboo pole was thrown, belies an important corroborative detail, thus leaving the statement as the only basis, with proof of corpus delicti of course, for appellant's conviction for a very serious offense involving a sentence of life imprisonment.<br><br>2. Now on the sufficiency of the extrajudicial statement. On this question, the Solicitor General maintains that the extrajudicial confession on its face does not inspire belief. He contends — (1) that there was no previous misunderstanding between the accused and the deceased; in fact, the three were together the whole day upon the invitation of Odarlico to buy a goat; (2) that it is hard to believe that simply because the accused demurred to Odarlico's suggestion to burn Labonete's <i>mandala,</i> the same will be enough to arouse the feeling of Odarlico to the extent of threatening them with death; (3) that there is no reason why appellant and Sergio Nicolas would be afraid of Odarlico who was unarmed and was no match to the two; and (4) that the accused could have easily avoided the alleged threat of the deceased by running away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>These observations are well-taken. The confession to serve as a basis for conviction must inspire credibility. It must not be improbable or excite disbelief. It must be one which the normal experience of mankind can accept as within the realm of probability. The statement — which ascribes to two youthful rural folk, a serious criminal design to kill someone against whom they entertain no ill will over a flimsy cause — refusal to burn a mandala, when they could have easily escaped or ran away — simply flies in the face of truth.<br><br>3. On the existence of probable motives on the part of other persons to kill Odarlico. The statements of both accused adverted to the quarrel between Odarlico and the Igorot and immediately thereafter between Alfredo and Odarlico. the accused both testified in great detail about these incidents<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> leading Us to believe, as contended by the Solicitor General, that these persons could have probable motives to kill Odarlico. On the other hand, it is admitted that the accused were investigated solely on account of their having been seen with Odarlico on the afternoon of the day he was killed. The records do not show that any investigation was conducted to verify whether other persons could have been responsible for the death of Odarlico, for example, the Igorot and Alfredo. And Alfredo did not rebut the testimonies of the two accused as to the incident which involved his allegedly being slapped by Odarlico and that his two sons had to come to his aid with bamboo poles.<br><br>These circumstances show how superficial indeed were the efforts on the part of the police force to ferret out the true culprit; how, as is the wont of police investigators, the death of Odarlico was investigated in perfunctory and cavalier fashion, and, as claimed by the accused, without regard to their rights against self-incrimination. That these could regrettably be case is borne by Our experience in many instances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Rec examples are the celebrated cases of the Imperios, father ; son, who were investigated, then tortured, and made to conf their guilt by members of the police force simply because tl were "<i>the last persons seen with the victim</i>";'<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> and that Isidro Buscato, Nestor Dalud and Jabib Tan who w investigated, then tortured and also made to confess then g because they ". . . were reportedly with the deceased Rode Lim the previous night . . ,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The presence of other persons who could have proba motive to kill Odarlico but who were not investigated n serious doubts on the findings of the police investigators t appellant was one of the perpetrators of the killing. Thi especially so where there is no shred of evidence offered the prosecution to support appellant's guilt, except his h statement, the due and voluntary execution of which he veheme denied.<br><br>In resume, (1) the uncertainty as to the voluntariness of confession; (2) the improbability of the version as containe the extrajudicial confession; (3) the failure of the police authori to conduct a thorough and careful investigation of circumstances leading to the death of Odarlico, and the existe of motive on the part of others to kill Odarlico; and, finally, the erroneous finding of the trial court that appellant was one who showed and retrieved the bamboo pole — are facts and circumstances of weight and influence which all toget serious doubt on the guilt of herein accused-appellant of crime charged. He is. therefore, entitled to acquittal.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the judgment of conviction is hereby VERSED and the appellant.
