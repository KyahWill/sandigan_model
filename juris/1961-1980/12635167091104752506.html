one for murder (Criminal Case No. 2511) and the other for illegal posses­<span style="">sion </span>of firearm (Criminal Case No.

Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Simultaneously filed before the same court
were two other separate but closely related charges, against <span class="SpellE">Indelecia</span> <span class="SpellE">Saguid-Irorita</span> for
parricide (Criminal Case No. 2510) and for illegal possession of firearm
(Criminal Case <span style="">No. </span><span style="">2513).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>As these four (4) cases had to do with the death of <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Irorita</span>, accused <span class="SpellE">Indelecia’s</span> husband, a joint trial was allowed for the
reception of the evidence <span style="">for the </span>prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, appellant’s motion for a separate <span style="">trial was granted insofar </span>as the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From the testimony of the
nine (9) witnesses for the prosecution, the following facts have been
substantially established: that <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Irorita</span> and <span class="SpellE">Indelecia</span> <span class="SpellE">Saguid­Irorita</span> were husband and wife; that <span class="SpellE">Indelecia</span> had been sus­taining illicit relations with
appellant; that <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> died in the early afternoon
of September 6, 1965 in barrio Ester, Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Vintar</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, and when <span class="SpellE">Indelecia</span>,
the deceased's widow, and <span class="SpellE">Segundina</span>, the latter's
mother, were questioned about the cause of <span class="SpellE">Dominador's</span>
death, both replied that the deceased had died of tuberculosis; that be­cause
of a persistent rumor, which spread in the barrio after the deceased's
internment, that he died not of tuberculosis but from gunshot wounds he had
received, then barrio lieu­tenant Miguel <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span>
conducted further inquiries, which event</span>ually led to <span class="SpellE">Indelecia's</span>
admission that the rumor was true; that she even directed him (barrio
lieutenant Miguel <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span>) to a big pile of cogon grass
about 150 meters east of her house, where the fatal gun was recovered; that
Victor Flores substantially corroborated the testimony of Miguel <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span> on this point, the former being the latter's
companion at the time; that in order to determine positively the cause of <span class="SpellE">Dominador's</span> death, his body was exhumed on September 13,
1956 and a <u>post</u> <u>mortem</u> examination was made by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Caridad</span> Cid, municipal health officer of <span class="SpellE">Vintar</span>, who confirmed that <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
had died indeed from gunshot wounds; and that a sergeant <span class="SpellE">Gamayo</span>
of the local P.C. command then personally conducted the investigation of the <span style="">case, </span>which culminated in the
execution of separate written sworn statements by <span class="SpellE">In­delecia</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Segundina</span> and herein appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In her statement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> "C"), <span class="SpellE">Indelecia</span>
fingered appellant as the gun-wielder, and admitted at the same time that she
was really appellant's mistress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Segundina</span></span><span class="GramE">, in <span style="">a </span>separate statement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> "E"), merely stated that she saw
appellant leaving the vicinity of the victim's house after the fatal
shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When confronted with the two
statements later, appellant executed a statement of his own (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "A"), wherein he admitted that he was the
one who fired the fatal shots, using an unlicensed .45 caliber sub-machinegun
for the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Juan Jacinto, Justice
of the peace of <span class="SpellE">Vintar</span> before whom the aforesaid
statements were sworn to duly apprised the affiants of their constitutional
rights before he affixed his signatures to the respective <span class="SpellE">jurats</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A </span>portion
of the bamboo flooring in the victim's house, which had been shattered by the
bullets fired at the victim, was found to have been sub­sequently repaired.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing, in synthesis, is the evidence given by the
prosecution witnesses against appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In ad­judging him guilty of the offenses charged, the trial court did
not confine itself to the facts and circumstances established by the said
evidence but considered also the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Indelecia</span>
given in the course of her own trial and in her own defense, to the effect that
it was appellant who shot and killed her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is now assigned as error, and we find
the assignment well taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Indelecia</span> was not a witness for the prosecution, and <span style="">her </span>testimony in her own defense
cannot be considered against appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not only was the trial separate insofar as their res­pective defenses
were concerned, but appellant was not present when <span class="SpellE">Indelecia's</span>
testimony was given.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the rights
of every person charged in a criminal case <span style="">is to be confronted by and to cross-examine the witness against him.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> This right is violated if the evidence taken
in another case, or in the separate trial of another accused, is considered to
his detriment.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The case for the
prosecution must find its basis somewhere else.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The most relevant piece of evidence is appellant's confession (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "A"), wherein he admitted that in the
afternoon of September 6, 1956 he entered <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Irorita's</span> house and posted himself directly below the place
on the bamboo floor where <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> was sleeping side
by side with his wife <span class="SpellE">Indelecia</span>; that with a .45
caliber sub-machine-gun, which he likewise admitted belonged to him, he pumped
three bullets into the victim; that after the shooting, appellant gave the gun
to <span class="SpellE">Indelecia</span>, with whom appellant had been
maintaining illicit relations for a long time and who was herself aware of the
plan to kill her husband.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant, however,
declared on the witness stand that his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> on
the said confession was procured through force, violence and intimidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, he said that the PC soldiers
under Sergeant <span class="SpellE">Gamayo</span> maltreated him by boxing him
and hitting him in various parts of his body with the steel butts of their
guns; and that he was repeatedly placed, face downward, inside a <span class="SpellE">drumfull</span> of water until he became unconscious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This brutal treatment, he declared, continued
throughout the night and until the morning of </span><st1:date year="1956" day="14" month="9"><span style="">September 14, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
proof of his maltreatment appel­lant presented a medical certificate (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "4") signed by Dr. Roman de la <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span>, chief of the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ilocos</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placename><span style="">Norte</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placename><span style="">Provincial</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Hospital</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">, which certificate lists the following
injuries found in his person:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Abrasion</span>, multiple scaring, costal arch, right <span class="SpellE">chondro-sternal</span> articulation, level of third rib, left;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Two abrasions at supra-scapular region left; and one abrasion, shoulder,
<span class="SpellE">ter</span> or aspect, right;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>3. Healed, deep abrasion, between 3rd and 4th fingers, <span class="SpellE">doesum</span> hand, left."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That the said injuries
were due to maltreatment by the PC soldiers who obtained appellant's confession
is rather doubtful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Dr. de
la <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span>, injury No. 3 </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the certificate was probably the earliest to be inflicted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon cross-examination he gave the opinion
that the same could not have been sustained earlier than seven (7) days prior
to the physical examination of appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since the physical examination was made on </span><st1:date year="1956" day="24" month="9"><span style="">September 24, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="">, the </span><span style="">said </span><span style="">injury dated back no
earlier than September 17, that </span><span style="">is,
</span><span style="">four days after the alleged
maltreatment on the night of September 13.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, if it was true that appellant had been repeatedly <span class="SpellE">pummelled</span> with steel gun butts in different parts of his
body the injuries would have been much more serious than just abrasions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not at all improbable that those
abrasions were self-inflicted after the con­fession had been given.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Another significant
circumstance is that when appellant was brought before Judge Juan Jacinto on </span><st1:date year="1956" day="15" month="9"><span style="">September
 15, 1956</span></st1:date><span style=""> to ratify
the statement he had given earlier to the investiga­tors, he voluntarily
reaffirmed the truth of its contents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Judge Jacinto, commendably enough, did not confine himself to the simple
formality of having the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span> swear to the
written statement, but examined him closely and had the pro­ceedings before him
separately recorded in writing, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Clearly
then, except that part in which he admitted ownership of the fatal gun,
appellant voluntarily affirmed the veracity of his extrajudicial confession.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
affirm­ation is in effect a second confession, the voluntary charac­ter of
which is beyond dispute, considering the circumstances under which it was

it belonged to the deceased himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the face of his categorical and repeated admission of the truth of his previous
statements, with the only exception just referred to, his half-hearted attempt

find no reason to disturb the trial court's appreciation of lack of instruction

death (Art. 248, RPC).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because </span>the
generic aggravating circumstance of dwelling is offset by the mitigating circumstance
of lack of instruction, the penalty prescribed by law in its medium period,
that <span style="">is, </span><u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><u>perpetua</u></span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> </span>was correctly imposed by the trial court <span style="">in </span>the

appellant guilty thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering
that it was he who fired the fatal shots, his possession of the unlicensed
death weapon cannot be denied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering further that he actually made </span><span style="">use </span>thereof for an illegal purpose, the imposition of the penalty
prescribed by law in its maximum period, namely, imprisonment to 10 years, is

both cases were forwarded here because "the evidence in both cases, both

impossible to forward the murder case to the Honorable Supreme Court and the
illegal possession of firearm to the Honorable Court of Appeals." This
decision therefore deals also with Criminal Case No. 2512 (for <span style="">illegal possession </span>of firearm).</p>
