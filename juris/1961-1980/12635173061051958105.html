wherein petition was filed for the correction of election returns and/or
judicial recount of votes, with mandamus and prohibition.</p>

<p class="BODY">We gave due course to the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We did not order issuance of the writ of
preliminary injunction prayed for.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two of the candidates for the eight council seats in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ibajay</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>, in the 1967 elections <span class="GramE">were</span>
herein petitioner Esperanza <span class="SpellE">Solidum</span> and <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sulam</span>, private
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1967</st1:date>, while the municipal board of
canvassers was engaged in its task of canvassing, it was discovered that the
return from Precinct 25 did not contain the name of <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sulam</span> and the votes obtained by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that meeting, seven canvassers were
present (<span class="SpellE">Eulado</span> <span class="SpellE">Masangcay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gualberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Lalisan</span>, Julian <span class="SpellE">Sijera</span>, Susana <span class="SpellE">Sulam</span>, <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Solidum</span>, Jose <span class="SpellE">Conanan</span> and Emilio <span class="SpellE">Cabales</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There­upon, three of the members, said to be
Liberal Party men who consti­tuted the minority, sued for suspension of the
canvassing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A vote was taken and they
were overruled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They walked out of the
canvassing hall to ask for the opinion of the Commission on Elections'
registrar of <span class="SpellE">lbajay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In their absence, the four remaining <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
mem­bers (<span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Solidum</span>,
Jose <span class="SpellE">Conanan</span>, Emilio <span class="SpellE">Cabales</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Eulado</span> <span class="SpellE">Masangcay</span>)
continued with the canvass and proclaimed Esperanza <span class="SpellE">Solidum</span>
the eighth councilor-elect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is of
interest to note that the total number of votes - according to the returns -
garnered by Espe­ranza <span class="SpellE">Solidum</span> in all the 37
precincts of <span class="SpellE">lbajay</span> was 2,486.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With no vote for Precinct 25 counted in favor
of <span class="SpellE">Sulam</span> in that canvass, his total was only 2,459
votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sulam</span>
would lose by 27 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, if as
contended by <span class="SpellE">Sulam</span> he actually received 34 votes in
Precinct 25, he would have been proclaimed eighth councilor-elect with a seven
(7) vote margin in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
difference between the two methods of computation affects the result of the
election - between the two.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 22, 1967, three members of the board of election
inspectors (Carlos <span class="SpellE">Daguno</span>, chairman, Josefina <span class="SpellE">Misajon</span>, poll clerk, and <span class="SpellE">Adelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Sudlon</span>, party inspector) executed a joint affidavit before <span class="SpellE">Ibajay</span> Municipal Judge Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>
stating that in Precinct 25 of <span class="SpellE">Ibajay</span>, respondent
Catalina <span class="SpellE">Sulam</span> obtained 34 votes, which was reflected
in the tally board of said precinct duly signed by the board of inspectors
thereof; that through inadvertence, the name of can­didate <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sulam</span> and his votes were omitted in the election
return; and that said affidavit was being executed for the purpose of
correcting the erroneous election return submitted by the board of inspectors.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, November 22, petitioner Esperanza <span class="SpellE">Solidum</span> took her oath of office.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also on that day, November 22, the municipal secretary of <span class="SpellE">lbajay</span> wired the Commission on Elections for instructions
as to what to do in view of the patent mistake that attended the canvass and
the proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 28, the
Commission wired back advising the filing of the petition for the correction of
the returns and suspension of the proclamation of petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus it <span class="GramE">is,</span> that on <st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1967</st1:date>, respondent <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sulam</span> lodged with the lower court the petition
adverted to earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was there prayed
that the board of election inspectors of Precinct 25 be directed to correct the
election return <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, to show that <span class="SpellE">Sulam</span> received 34 votes in said precinct; or, in the
alternative, to order a judicial recount of the votes cast in that precinct, to
direct the municipal board of canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Ibajay</span> to
reassemble and <span class="SpellE">recanvass</span> the return from the precinct
aforesaid, and after such correction or after a judicial recount, to add said
votes to <span class="SpellE">Sulam</span> and thereafter proclaim him winner by
a seven (7) vote plurality over petitioner Esperanza <span class="SpellE">Solidum</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a P500-bond, respondent judge, on December 4, 1967, ordered
the issuance ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> of a writ of preliminary
injunction "enjoining, restraining and prohibiting" Esperanza <span class="SpellE">Solidum</span> "from taking her oath of office as
councilor-elect of <span class="SpellE">Ibajay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>,
and from assuming the powers and entering upon the exercise of the duties appertaining
to said office, until further orders from this Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 5, 1967, respondent judge directed the municipal
treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Ibajay</span> to produce before him the
precinct book of voters, the ballot boxes, the election statements, and all
other documents used in the election to the office of Municipal Councilor in
Precinct 25, and the Provincial Fiscal, the Provincial Commander and the Provin­cial
Treasurer to produce the keys for said ballot boxes.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="9" month="12">December 9, 1967</st1:date>,
petitioner herein filed in the court below her answer, a motion to dismiss for
lack of jurisdiction, and a motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent judge, however, without resolving
the motion to dismiss and the motion to dissolve the writ of preliminary
injunction, instead, on January 20, 1968, issued an order stating that without
prejudice to the resolution of the pending questions in the decision if need
there be of treating them, set the hearing of the election case for February
20, 1968 at 8:00 o'clock a.m. for the reception of the evidence of respondents
therein, it appearing that petitioner therein (herein respondent <span class="SpellE">Sulam</span>) had already presented his evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also on <st1:date year="1967" day="9" month="12">December 9, 1967</st1:date>,
respondents Carlos <span class="SpellE">Daguno</span> Josefina <span class="SpellE">Misajon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Adelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Sudlon</span> and Virginia Garcia, chairman, poll clerk and
inspectors, respectively, of Precinct 25 filed their answer to the petition
below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They there averred that after the
canvass and having been informed thereof, they discovered that the name of <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sulam</span> together with the
number of votes he received as candidate for councilor in Precinct 25 <span class="GramE">have</span> been omitted; that such omission was due to "an
honest mistake, inadvertence due to fatigue, and lack of sleep." This
averment in their answer is supported by an affidavit unanimously executed by
all the four of them on <st1:date year="1967" day="8" month="12">Decem­ber 8,
 1967</st1:date> before the Municipal Judge of <span class="SpellE">Ibajay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that affidavit, they further stated that
for purposes of correction they "hereby jointly declare and make it known
that in the above-mentioned precinct, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sulam</span> obtained thirty-four (34) votes and this fact was
duly and properly entered in the Tally Board and Tally Sheet prepared by the
board."</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing of <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="12">December
 14, 1967</st1:date>, respondent judge, over the objection of petitioner
Esperanza <span class="SpellE">Solidum</span>, ordered the opening of the ballot
box for Precinct 25, allowed the removal for marking of the corresponding tally
sheet which was later returned inside the ballot box.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was said that respondent judge then found
that the name of <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sulam</span>
and the 34 votes he obtained in Precinct 25 appeared on the tally sheet
deposited and sealed in the ballot box.</p>

<p class="BODY">To give time for petitioner to come to this Court, the hearing
set for <st1:date year="1968" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1968</st1:date>
was transferred to a later date.</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">It may be well at the outset to stress
the importance of a proclamation in our election law-scheme.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A pronouncement, not so long ago made but
consistently adhered to since then, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Lagumbay</u></span>
<u>vs.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Climaco</u></span> (1966), 16 SCRA 175, 179,
is that: "The well-known delay in the adjudication of election protests
often gave the successful contestant a mere pyrrhic victory, i.e., a
vindication when the term of office is about to expire, or has expired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so the notion has spread among candidates
for public office that the 'important thing' is the proclamation; and to win
it, they or their partisans have tolerated or abetted the tampering or the
'manufacture' of election returns just to get the proclamation, and then let
the victimized candidate to file the protest, and spend his money to work for
an empty triumph."</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The teaching of past experience is that every effort should be
strained, every means should be explored, <span class="GramE">to</span> ascertain
the true returns with the end in view that upon the basis thereof, procla­mation
untainted by force, fraud, forgery, mistake and the like, may be made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true indeed that after proclamation,
the losing candidate may yet have the remedy of an election protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But that may not prove effective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Election protests quite often take a long
time to terminate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A number of factors,
such as the almost illimitable resources of lawyers and the delays that may be
occasioned, may well frustrate the ends of the protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Victory then may just be in sound, not in
substance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Ong</u></span>
<u>vs.</u> <u>Commission</u> <u>on</u> <u>Elections</u>, 22 SCRA 241, 254-255,
we observed that: "The overriding considera­tion, of course, is that,
above and beyond the narrow personal stakes of the opposing candidates, the
rights of the electorate, not to say the people, are involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To these rights we pay full respect."
And in <u>De</u> <u>Mesa</u> <u>vs.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Mencias</u></span>,
18 SCRA 533, 538, Mr. Justice Castro aptly reminded:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> It
is axiomatic that an election contest, involving as it does not only the
adjudication and settlement of the private interests of the rival candidates
but also the paramount need of dispelling once and for all the uncertainty that
beclouds the real choice of the electorate with respect to who shall discharge
the prerogatives of the offices within their gift, is a proceeding imbued with
public interest which raises it onto a plane over and above ordinary civil
actions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, broad
perspectives of public policy impose upon courts the imperative duty to
ascertain by all means within their command who is the real can­didate elected
in as expeditious a manner as possible, without being fettered by
technicalities and procedural barriers to the end that the will of the people
may not be frustrated (<span class="SpellE">lbasco</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">llao</span>,
et al., G.R. L-17512, December 29, 1960; <span class="SpellE">Reforma</span> vs.
De Luna, G.R. L-13242, July 31, 1958).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So inextricably intertwined are the interests of the contestants and
those of the public that there can be no gainsaying the logic of the
proposition that even the voluntary cessation in office of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> not only does not <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u> divest
him of the character of an adversary in the contest inasmuch as he retains a
party interest to keep his political opponent out of the office and maintain
therein his successor, but also does not in any manner impair or detract from
the jurisdiction of the court to pursue the proceeding to its final conclusion
(De Los Angeles vs. Rodriguez, 46 Phil. 595, 597; <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>
vs. Hernandez, 62 Phil. 584, 587; <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>, G.R. L-13206)."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">2. It is in the context just expressed that we make our approach
to the problem of ascertaining whether or not the proclamation of <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1967</st1:date> should merit the
imprimatur of this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is seemingly a purpose firm on the part of the four mem­bers
of the board of canvassers to railroad the proclamation in the hope of creating
a status of proclaimed candidate on behalf of herein petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is easy enough to understand that upon
examination of the return from Precinct 25, a mistake must have been
committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be recalled at this point
is Section 150 of the Revised Election Code which provides that the return
shall show "the total number of votes polled by each candidate, writing
out the said number in words and figures." We are certain that the members
of the board of can­vassers are well posted with this legal provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, the can­vassers must have observed at
least from the first 24 precincts that the name of <span class="SpellE">Sulam</span>
and the votes he obtained were entered in the res­pective returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are therefore strong grounds that point
to the fact that if the name of candidate <span class="SpellE">Sulam</span> does
not appear in the return from Precinct 25, it is, as stated by the chairman,
the poll clerk and the two inspectors, because of "an honest mistake,
inadvertence due to fatigue, and lack of sleep" and "done without any
malice or deliberate intent on the part of the board or the individual members
thereof to injure, damage or prejudice any particular person, candidate or
political party."</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Javier</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Commission</u> <u>on</u> <u>Elections</u>,
L-22248, January 30, 1965, the municipal board of canvassers found that in the
election return from Precinct 4 of <span class="SpellE">Culasi</span>, Antique,
respondent candidate for Mayor was credited with 23 votes only, whilst the
tally board of the same precinct showed that he obtained 83 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The board of inspectors of Precinct 4
unanimously filed a verified petition with the board of canvassers requesting
permission to correct the elec­tion return concerned inasmuch as the
discrepancy in the votes would materially affect the result of the
election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
representative instructed the board to suspend the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the board refused, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
by telegram also ordered suspension of the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The board of canvassers however proceeded
with the canvass and <u>proclaimed</u> petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, in ruling that the proclamation
was null and void, stated that: "Where the board of canvassers, as in this
instance, with knowledge that the return from one precinct is <u>undoubtedly</u>
<u>vitiated</u> <u>by</u> <u>clerical</u> <u>mistake</u>, con­tinued the
canvass and proclaimed a winner based on the result of such canvass, the
proclamation cannot be said to have been made in faithful discharge of its
ministerial duty under the law."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The board of canvassers here should have suspended the can­vassing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, it was only November 20 then and
the assumption of office of the newly elected municipal officials was to take
place on the following January 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
appreciable damage could have been suffered by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would have been an easy matter to check
why there was an omission in the return from Precinct 25. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The election records were within easy
reach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The members of the board of
election inspectors from whom information could be obtained were local people,
residents of <span class="SpellE">Ibajay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The certificate of canvass signed by all the members of the canvassing
board, by mandate of Section 153 of the Revised Election Code, to be given out
to the watchers who may request them, could also be availed of.</p>

<p class="BODY">The members of the board of canvassers should not be insensible to
the difference between right and wrong, between truth and untruth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While we may concede that the composition of
the board of canvassers is drawn in accordance with political party lines<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
they are not expected to act arbitrarily, to throw overboard their sense of
fairness, to be but blind partisan followers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They are not there to throttle the will of the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are public officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have the duty to perform their functions
well, truly and faith­fully to the end that democratic processes may be
maintained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, the four members of
the board of canvassers, over the objection of three others, went ahead and
made the proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This act, we are
constrained to say, is beyond the bounds of accepted candor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mischief that stems <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
- the <u>fait</u> <u>accompli</u> - should not be permitted to take its
toll.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proclamation, indeed, is not the
end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may yet be annulled.</p>

<p class="BODY">If only for the reasons just stated, the proclamation by the
board of canvassers as to Esperanza <span class="SpellE">Solidum</span> should be
stricken down.</p>

<p class="BODY">But greater reason exists why that proclamation should not be
allowed to stand unchallenged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
that impressive unani­mity on the part of the members of the board of
inspectors who, in their affidavit set forth in the answer to the petition below,
expressly acknowledged that in truth and in fact candidate <span class="SpellE">Sulam</span>
obtained 34 votes in Precinct 25.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
that this unanimous statement stands alone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Affiants made solemn representations under oath in the
same affidavit that the fact that <span class="SpellE">Sulam</span> obtained 34
votes in Precinct 25 was</span> "duly and properly entered in the Tally
Board and Tally Sheet prepared by the board." More than this, when the
ballot box was opened and the cor­responding tally sheet taken out, it is not
disputed, not seriously at least, that the unanimous statement of the four
members of the board of inspectors aforesaid was confirmed in that <span class="SpellE">Sulam</span> received 34 votes in Precinct 25.</p>

<p class="BODY">We thus find ourselves in no position to pronounce that
petitioner should be allowed to sit as councilor solely and exclusively upon
the basis of the proclamation heretofore adverted to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are impelled to say so because upon the
record before us, the inclusion or non-inclusion of the votes in favor of <span class="SpellE">Sulam</span> in Precinct 25 spells the difference between <u>prima</u>
<u>facie</u> giving effect to the will of the elec­torate, or defeating it by
saying that the right to proclamation may be earned by pure technicality rather
than adherence to fact.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. Petitioner challenges the jurisdiction of the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her argument is that upon Sections 163 and
168 of the Revised Elec­tion Code, there could not be any recount, for the
reason that no discrepancy or contradiction exists between copies of the same
return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Really, there is neither
discrepancy nor contradiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
petitioner is correct in that Sections 163 and 168 aforesaid are both out of
the way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No ground there is for a
recount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The juris­diction of the court
on this matter of recount is quite limited.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But the same thing cannot be said about the petition for the
correction of the election return.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because, the members of the board of inspectors themselves have
unanimously represented to the court below that the omission was but a
mistake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prayer in their answer to <span class="SpellE">Sulam's</span> petition below is that the election return should
precisely be corrected and amended to conform to the facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unanimity<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
on the part of the said members of the board of ins­pectors paves the way for
the application of Section 154 of the Revised Election Code, which reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 154.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Alterations</u> <u>in</u>
<u>the</u> <u>statement</u>.</span> - After the announcement of the result of
the election in the polling place, the board of inspectors shall not make any
alteration or amendment in any of its statements, unless it be so ordered by a
competent court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In other words, the members of the board
of inspectors are willing to make the alterations which may be ordered by the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rationale behind the grant of
power to courts of first instance to order corrections of election returns is
that "[m]<span class="SpellE">istakes</span> of all sorts are too common in
human experience to justify anyone in denying the possibility of honest error x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and it was in
contemplation of the pos­sibility of such errors that the lawmakers provided
for their correc­tion with judicial approval."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
In <span class="SpellE"><u>Rabe</u></span> <u>vs.</u> <u>Commission</u> <u>on</u>
<u>Elections</u>, L-16341 &amp; L-16470, May 25, 1960, we ruled that where the
three elec­tion inspectors and the poll clerk of a precinct "have signed
state­ments acknowledging their error" in the election return, this
"makes out a case for correction or amendment of the election returns
(state­ment) under the provisions of sec. 154 of the Revised Election
Code."</p>

<p class="NUM">4. Needless to state, canvass and proclamation must be made with
the returns complete.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have repeatedly
held that proclamation made on incomplete returns is null and void.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A case which approximates the present is <span class="SpellE"><u>Mutuc</u></span>
<u>vs.</u> <u>Commis­sion</u> <u>on</u> <u>Elections</u>, 22 SCRA 662,
666.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Mutuc</u></span>,
the municipal board of canvassers was confronted with an election return (from
Precinct 124 of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>) which, while listing the
names of the candidates, con­tained no entry of votes cast for them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The consequent <u>proclamation</u> we
declared illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We likewise held that
the assumption of office of those proclaimed cannot affect the basic issues of
the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Since the proclamation herein was made on incomplete returns in
the sense that the votes to which <span class="SpellE">Sulam</span> is entitled
in Precinct 25 have not been included, we rule that the proclamation is null
and void.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. Even on the assumption that the proclamation is valid,
petitioner's cause still fails.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For,
proclamation is in umbilical dependence upon the returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But one of such returns - that from Precinct
25 - which does not include the votes of candidate <span class="SpellE">Sulam</span>
may yet be corrected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this point, it
has been held to be the better doctrine "that after canvassers have made
one canvass, declared the result and adjourned they may be compelled by 'man­damus'
to reassemble and make a correct canvass of all the returns where it appears
that upon the first canvass they neglected or refused fully to perform their
duties."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> <u>De</u>

of an election return "<u>can</u> <u>only</u> <u>be</u> <u>made</u> <u>by</u>

"within the <u>two-week period</u> within which an election may be
contested" and that this period is jurisdictional, for the reason that
after the lapse of that period, "the right of the candidate proclaimed to
the office is deemed vested."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>
