decision </span>rendered by the Court of First Instance <span style="letter-spacing: 1.25pt;">of Iloilo in Civil Case
No. 3926 states the issue raised </span><span style="letter-spacing: 1.1pt;">therein as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"The
pivotal question to be determined in </span>this case is whether the true
contract between plaintiff and defendant is that embodied in the 'contract to
sell' (Exh. A) wherein it appears that plaintiff <span style="">agreed to sell, </span>and <span style="">defendant agreed to
buy, Lots Nos. 1368 </span>and 1536-, for the sum of P13,200 payable by
defendant to plaintiff in installments with 1% monthly interest until fully
paid, as claimed <span style="">by </span>plain­tiff,
or that of loan of P11,000 secured by an equitable mortgage on the aforesaid
lots with <span style="">20% interest, or the sum of
P2,200, immediately added to the capital plus 1% <span style="">monthly interest until the whole </span>amount of P13,200 is fully paid
by defendant to plaintiff, as claimed by de­fendant and intervenors."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After an exhaustive
review of the evidence the Court held that the transaction involved was
usurious, and that the document marked as Exhibit </span><span style="">A </span><span style="">was a mere subterfuge conceived by <span style="">the original plaintiff the </span>now
deceased C. N. Hodges; to conceal the <span style="">true
nature </span>thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result it
rendered judgment as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“(a) Declaring that the contracts evidenced by Annex A of the
complaint and A<span style="">nnexes </span>3, <span style="">4 &amp; 5 of </span>the answer (Exhs. A of
plaintiff and Exhs. 1, 2, &amp; <span style="">4 </span>of
defendant, respectively) were all re­latively simulated to conceal a usurious
loan of P11,000 with equitable mortgage on the two lots above mentioned;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(b) Declaring <span style="">that </span>plaintiff
is not entitled to recover from defendant the stipulated usurious interest;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“(c) Declaring that
plaintiff has been fully paid </span>by defendant the total sum of P11,000
loaned to the latter;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(d) Ordering defendant to pay plaintiff the sum of P79.07 <span style="">representing real </span>estate taxes paid by
plaintiff for end in behalf of defendant on Lot No. 1536-A for <span style="">the </span>years
1953 to 1956, in­clusive, and on Lot No. 1368 for part of the year 1958, with
the legal interest thereon from the <span style="">filing
of the complaint until fully paid;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“(e) Ordering plaintiff to
forthwith re-convey the aforesaid Lots Nos. 1536 A and 1368 </span>of the
Cadastral Survey of Sta. Barbara, Iloilo, to defendant and his wife,
Anunciacion C. Griño, upon full payment by them of the said sum of P79.07 with
the corresponding legal interest thereon.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Without pronouncement as to costs."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On appeal, while the
Court of Appeals also held that the contract Exhibit A </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">"fictitious and simulated to </span>conceal
the usurious transaction of the parties", it modified the above decision
as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"It has been admitted
that at the time complaint was presented by the plaintiff to the court,
defendant had already paid the former sum of P1,997.10 (p. 14 t.s.n. I).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 13,1959, defendant further paid
the plaintiff, who accepted such payment with­out prejudice to his claim,
another sum of P9,002.90.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the full
amount of the prin­cipal obligation, P11,000.00, has now been fully paid</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"However, we do not agree with the trial court that plaintiff
is entitled to recover from the defendant only the amount loaned with­out
interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case <span style="">of </span>Sajo <span style="">V. Gustilo </span>(supra)
the Supreme Court <span style="">held:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The Usury Law, as construed by this court, permits the creditor to
recover the principal but not the stipulated usurious interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This could well be taken to mean forefeiture
of the right to any interest so as not to arrive at a contradiction in
terms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the court has
fallen into the habit in cases of <span style="">this
</span>character of allowing the creditor the legal rate of interest on the
judgment from the date of the filing of the complaint.’</p>

<blockquote>Consequently, defendant should be ordered
to pay interest at the legal rate, on the amount of P9,002.90 to be computed
from the filing of the complaint up to the time the same had been paid.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, with the modification that defendant should be
ordered to pay interest to the plaintiff at <span style="">a </span>legal rate on the amount of P9,002.90 from the filing of <span style="">the </span>complaint up to the time the same
had been paid, the appealed judgment is hereby af­firmed in all other respects,
with costs against plaintiff-appellant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After the decision of the Court of Appeals had become final and
executory the <span style="">record </span>f the case
was remanded below where on August 23, 1965, the appellee <span style="">Juan Griño filed a motion for entry of
satisfaction of </span>judgment and for conveyance of Lots 1536-A and 1368,
alleging, among other things, that on December 14, 1965 the lower court <span style="">in </span>Special
Proceedings <span style="">No. </span>1307 and 1672,
involving the settlement of the Testate Estate of Mr. and Mrs. C. N. Hodges
issued an order directing the Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank -
hereinafter referred to as PCIB administrator of the Testate E<span style="">state of </span>C. N. Hodges - to reconvey
the <span style="">abovementioned </span>parcels of
land to the spouses Juan Griño and A<span style="">nunciacion
C. Griño upon </span>payment by them of the sum of P79.07, with legal interest
from the filing of the complaint in Civil Case No. 3926 of the Court of First
Instance of Iloilo, until fully paid, and the legal interest an the amount of
P9,002.90 from the filing of the complaint in thee same civil case until the
date of payment of the said sum of P9,002.90; that on August <span style="">8, </span>1966 appellant had tendered to the
PCIB, in its capacity as Administrator of the Hodges Estate, the <span style="">sum of P1,556.27 in full satisfaction of the
amount due to </span>said estate under the final judgment rendered in this
case, <span style="">with a request for the conveyance
of the parcels of land already mentioned, but that the PCIB refused to accept </span>said
payment and to make <span style="">the conveyance,
alleging that the amount due from the defendant to the Hodges estate </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">P2,549.67 </span><span style="">as </span>of
August 8, 1966, end no the sum tendered; that the sum of P1,556.27 was <span style="">deposited by said defendant with </span>the
Clerk of Court in satisfaction of said judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The PCIB objected to the motion as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"When the complaint was filed on May 22, 1956, the principal
of the loan in the sum of P9,002.90 started to bear interest at the rate of 6%,
per annum On January 13, 1959, the accrued interest amounted to P1,<span style="">426.96.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When on this date the defendant paid P9,002.90, this payment </span>was
applied first to the accrued in­terest and then to the principal, in accordance
with the Civil Code which <span style="">provides -<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'If the debt produces interest, payment of the principal shall not
be deemed to have been made until the interests have been <span style="">covered’ </span>(Art. 1253)’</p>

<blockquote>"After such application of payment on January 13, 1959, there
remained an unpaid balance of the principal in the sum of P1,426.96 which
continued to bear interest at the rate of 6% per annum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said remaining balance of the principal
remains unpaid up to the present time, and the decision of the Court of Appeals
holds that interest will continue to run 'up to the time the same had been
paid'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This amounts to P2,080.50 as of
August 27, 1966.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The PCIB <span style="">is </span>also
entitled to col­lect additional amounts for taxes and interest thereon, and
miscellaneous ex­penses, which should be reimbursed by the defendant.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Necessary expenses shall be refunded to every possessor; x x x'
(Art. 546).</p>

<p class="2Q">'<span style="">A</span>ny person who is
constrained to pay the taxes of another shall be entitled to reimbursement from
the letter' (Art. 2175).</p>

<blockquote>"The total amount due, therefore, is not only P1,556.27 as the
defendant contends but P2,562.51 as of August 27, 1966.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The computation of the defendants is clearly erroneous
because it ignores miscellaneous expenses <span style="">as
</span>well as <span style="">the </span>land taxes
and interest thereon for part of the year 1958 up to the present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the principal of the loan, it
computes interest only up to January 30, 1959 (?), which is clearly contrary to
Art <span style="">1253 of
the Civil Code above-cited as well as the decision of the Court of Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It <span style="">is </span>the
defendant, contrary, to what he would make the court believe who is 'altering
and misconstruing' the de­cision of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said court did not <span style="">say </span>that the interest shall run only 'up to January 13, 1959',
but on the contrary it did not set <span style="">a </span>cut-off
date because it did not know <span style="">when the
entire obligation (accrued interest and principal) would be finally paid by the
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why should the PCIB are for
re­consideration of something which it believes to be correct?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to what he would make the court
believe, the PCIB does not contend that the Court of Appeals 'deviates from the
</span>rule <span style="">on the application of
payments </span><span style="">under A</span><span style="">rt. 1253, new Civil
Code’ but rather that said decision should be understood in the light of such
plain, obvious, and simple </span><span style="">provision </span><span style="">of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span><span style="">PCIB agrees that
said judgment </span><span style="">is final end
beyond recall; that </span><span style="">the defendant's (not administrator's) attempt to revise it now is
improper; and </span><span style="">that it should be </span><span style="">executed </span><span style="">strictly in accordance with </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">terms."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The matter having been
submitted for resolution, the lower court, under date of September 21, 1966, </span><span style="">issued the </span><span style="">order appealed from, whose dispositive part
reads </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the entry of satisfaction of judgment in this ease
by defendant Juan <span style="">is hereby ordered and the PCIB is hereby directed to execute </span><span style="">the conveyance of Lots Nos. 1526-A </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">1368 of the cadastral survey of Sta. Barbara,
Iloilo, in favor of defendant Juan </span><span style="">Griño </span><span style="">and
</span><span style="">his
wife Anunciacion C. Griño within ten (10) </span><span style="">days from receipt hereof and in the event of </span><span style="">its re­</span><span style="">fusal then the </span>Clerk <span style="">of Court shall </span><span style="">execute the conveyance of </span><span style="">the aforesaid lots in favor of defendant Juan
Griño end his wife Anunciacion C. Griño which instrument shall </span><span style="">be effective </span><span style="">and registerable </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">if it were </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">conveyance </span><span style="">executed in </span><span style="">due form of law by plaintiff in this case."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As grounds for the reversal
of the above order, appellant submits that the lower court erred, firstly, in
not applying the provisions of Article 1253 </span><span style="">of the Civil Code so that the sum of </span><span style="">P9,002.90 paid by appellee on January 13,
1959 should be applied first to the accrued </span><span style="">interest and then to the principal </span><span style="">of the judgment debt; and secondly, in not
ordering appellee to pay the unpaid balance of the principal amounting to the
sum of </span><span style="">P1,426.96,
with legal interest from </span><span style="">January
13, 1959 </span><span style="">until fully paid, end in not ordering </span><span style="">appellee to pay to appellant real estate taxes and miscellaneous
expenses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find appellant's
contentions unmeritorious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
must not lose sight of the fact that appellee's motion of August 23, 1965
involved nothing more than the satisfaction of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">decision rendered by the Court of Appeals quoted heretofore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, after the same had become final and
executory, there was no other question left but its faithful execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under its plain terms appellee was under
obligation to pay to the estate of </span><span style="">Hodges the following </span><span style="">amounts, and no more:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">(a) 6% interest on the
sum of P9,002.90 from the filing of the complaint (May 21, 1956) up to the time
payment thereof is made;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">(b) P79.07 representing
real estate taxes paid </span><span style="">by Hodges and/or the PCIB for and on behalf of appellant
on Lot No. 1536-A for the years 1953-1956, </span><span style="">inclusive, and </span><span style="">on Lot No. </span><span style="">1368 for part
of the year 1958, with legal </span><span style="">interest thereon from the filing of the complaint
until </span><span style="">full payment thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The record discloses that
on August 8, 1966 </span><span style="">appellee tendered to appellant the sum </span><span style="">of P1,556.27 representing </span><span style="">tae 6% accrued interest on the amount of P9,002.90
from May 22, 1956 (the date when the action was commenced) up to January </span><span style="">13, 1959, the date of payment of the
aforesaid sum of </span><span style="">P9,002.90, and the sum of P79.07 representing the </span><span style="">real <span style="">estate
</span></span><span style="">taxes
</span><span style="">paid by appellant for and on
