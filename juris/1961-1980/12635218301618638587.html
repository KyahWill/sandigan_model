Practices Act in connection with the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Reclamation
Project, by virtue of an information filed on <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1966</st1:date>, in Criminal Case No. <span class="GramE">V-10874
of the Court of First Instance of </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cebu</span></span></st1:place><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was assigned by means of raffle to
Branch II of said court, <span class="GramE">then</span> presided over <span style="">by </span>Judge Amador E. Gomez. Having
previously decided the civil case involving the project in question, which is
also the subject-matter of the anti-graft case, upholding the legality of the
said project, Judge Gomez voluntarily disqualified himself on <st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1968</st1:date>, from hearing the
criminal action.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A </span>re-raffle was
held, <span style="">as a </span>result of which the
case was assigned to Branch I of the court, presided over by respondent Judge
Guillermo P. <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the arraignment on <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1968</st1:date>, petitioner entered a plea of
not guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the Circuit Criminal Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
<span style="">was </span>organized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Criminal
cases pending before the different branches of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> belonging to the category of cases enumerated in RA <span style="">No. </span><span style="">5179, </span>which may be taken cognizance of by the Circuit Criminal
Court, including the anti-graft case hereinbefore mentioned, were raffled
pursuant to Administrative Order No. <span style="">258
</span>of the Secretary of Justice, dated September 11, <span style="">1968, </span>with the end in <span style="">view
</span>of transferring thirty <span style="">(30) </span>of
such cases to the Circuit Criminal Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> to
constitute the latter's initial cases The result of that raffle (the third for
this case) was that the case was to continue to pertain to Branch I, presided
over by Judge <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, Judge <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span> set the case
for hearing several times; but each time a postponement was had upon repeated
motions of the prosecution headed by respondent Fiscal Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Amadora</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then on <st1:date year="1969" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1969</st1:date>, just before the
scheduled hearings which had been re-set <span style="">for
</span>January <span style="">28, 29, </span><span style="">30 </span>and 31, 1969, the said Fiscal filed
a motion to transfer the case to the Circuit Criminal Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This move was opposed by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span>
denied the motion on the ground that, in accordance with the raffle held for
distribution purposes, the aforementioned anti-graft case <span style="">was </span>to be retained by Branch I,
presided over by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hearing was set
for <st1:date year="1969" day="21" month="3">March <span style="">21, 1969</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the day of the trial, respondent Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Amadora</span>
obtained another postponement by virtue of a telegram from the Undersecretary
of Justice, which was shown to the Presiding Judge, ordering another raffle of
that one case so as to transfer it to one court - the Circuit Criminal Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial of the <span style="">case </span>was
re-set again for April 28 and <span style="">29,
1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Respondent Fiscal filed a
second motion to raffle the case for transfer to the Circuit Criminal Court,
for which reason the hearing of the case was again suspended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the Secretary of Justice issued
Memorandum Circular No. <span style="">53 </span><span style="">of </span><st1:date year="1969" day="22" month="7"><span style="">July 22, </span><span style="">1969</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>authorizing the transfer to the
Circuit Criminal Courts of <span style="">all </span>anti-graft
cases pending in <span style="">all </span>Courts of First Instance, actual trial of which had not yet
been commenced.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner persisted in his objection to the transfer of the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He <span style="">was </span>given time by respondent Judge <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Villa</span>sor</span>
within which to seek a reconsideration of Memorandum Circular No. <span style="">53 </span>of the Secretary of Justice;
otherwise, the anti-graft case in question would be transferred to the Circuit
Criminal Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 12, <span style="">1969, </span>Fiscal
<span class="SpellE">Amadora</span> filed another motion (urgent) to transfer the
case to the Circuit Criminal Court so that trial could be held immediately; but
on September 19, 1969, respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">V<span style="">illasor</span></span><span style=""> issued an order voluntarily inhibiting </span>himself from hearing the
case and directing "the Clerk of Court to take up with the Executive Judge
the matter of re-assigning this case in the usual manner among the other
branches of this Court."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, or on September 8, 1969, petitioner, thru his
counsel, asked the Secretary of Justice, in writing, if the Anti-graft case in
question <span style="">was </span>covered by his
Memorandum Circular No. 53; and on September 15, <span style="">1969, </span>the Secretary of Justice replied to the effect that his
aforesaid circular did not have "the least intention of singling out any
particular case, much less criminal case No. <span class="GramE">V-10874.</span>
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">Indeed</span>,
as this Department said in a letter dated <st1:date year="1969" day="5" month="2">February <span style="">5, </span>1969</st1:date>
to Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Amadora</span>: 'The Department finds no
sufficient reason to authorize the transfer to the Circuit Criminal Court of
the particular case (No. <span class="GramE">V-10874) mentioned in (your) request.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, if the Circuit Criminal
Court would not object to the transfer of additional cases in excess of the 30
already transferred, this Department would authorize the transfer by raffle of
such number as would be agreeable to the Court." However, this case was
transferred just the same without benefit of raffle, pursuant to a memorandum
circular, dated January 26, 1970, signed by all the judges of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, except Judge <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span>, executed "[<span class="SpellE">i</span>]n<span style=""> </span>the light of the intentions of
Memorandum Circular No. <span style="">53 </span>of
the Department of Justice," directing all Branch Clerks "to turn over
to the Clerk of Court, in order to effect the transfer to the Circuit Criminal
Court of all cases involving violations of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices
Act and violations of the Tariff and Customs Code and Sections 174, 175 and <span style="">345 </span>of the National Internal Revenue
Code, pending <span style="">in our Salas, </span>the
actual trial of which has not yet been commenced." The case is now
docketed in the Circuit Criminal Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> as
Criminal Case No. <span class="GramE">CCC-XIV-47.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner moved on <st1:date year="1969" day="25" month="9">September
 <span style="">25, 1969</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>to reconsider the order of voluntary
disqualification of Judge <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Villasor</span></span><span style=""> </span>because
it was not based on any legal ground; but the same was denied in an order of <st1:date year="1970" day="30" month="1">January 30<span class="GramE">,1970</span></st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, respondent Judge Francisco Ro. <span class="SpellE">Cupin</span> of the Circuit Criminal Court scheduled the trial of
the anti-graft <span style="">case
</span>for June 1, 2, <span style="">3 </span>and <span style="">4, 1970.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1970</st1:date>,
petitioner moved for the return of the case to Branch I of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, and for the cancellation of the
scheduled dates <span style="">of </span>trial on June
1, 2, <span style="">3 </span>and <span style="">4, 1970; </span>respondent Fiscal <span style="">opposed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On </span><st1:date year="1970" day="1" month="6"><span style="">June 1, </span><span style="">1970</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Cupin</span>

to proceed as scheduled June 2, </span><span style="">3
</span><span style="">and </span><span style="">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">He likewise denied the opposition previously
filed by petitioner to the appearance of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">private prosecutor in the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is in this factual backdrop that petitioner came to this Court
by means of the present special civil action of <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition
and <i>mandamus</i>, praying that Judge <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Villasor's</span></span><span style=""> </span>order of voluntary inhibition be set
aside; that the order for the reassignment and/or transfer of Criminal <span style="">Case No. </span>V-10874 to the Circuit
Criminal Court, as well as Memorandum Circular No. <span style="">53 </span>of the Department of Justice insofar as it concerns the
present anti-graft case, be annulled; and that the order of the Circuit
Criminal Court scheduling trial of the case and denying petitioner's opposition
to the appearance of a private prosecutor be like<span style="">wise </span>annulled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
also prays that the <span style="">case </span>be returned
to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, and that
Judge <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span> be ordered to resume or continue
taking cognizance and jurisdiction of <span style="">the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, petitioner seeks </span><span style="">issuance </span>of
a writ of <span style="">preliminary injunction
against Circuit Judge <span class="SpellE">Cupin</span>, enjoining him, in the
meanwhile, from proceeding with </span>the trial of the anti-graft case against
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1970" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1970</st1:date>, we issued a temporary restraining
order.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue of whether or not Judge <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span>
abused his<span style=""> </span>discretion in
voluntarily inhibiting himself from the trial of the anti-graft case against
petitioner has become moot and academic by virtue of his transfer from <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We come </span>to the
more substantial issue of whether or not the transfer of the present anti-graft
case to the Circuit Criminal Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> was in
excess of jurisdiction or in grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The transfer was <span class="GramE">effected</span> by virtue of <span style="">a </span>memorandum circular, dated <st1:date year="1970" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1970</st1:date>, signed by all the
judges of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> except
Judge <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The said circular itself <span style="">states </span>that
it was <span style="">made "[<span class="SpellE">i</span>]n
the light of the intentions of Memorandum Circular No. </span><span style="">53 of </span>the Department of Justice."
The memorandum circular therein <span style="">mentioned,
dated </span><st1:date year="1969" day="22" month="7"><span style="">July 22, </span><span style="">1969</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">authorizes</span></span><span style=""> the transfer to </span>the circuit <span style="">criminal courts of all </span>anti-graft
cases pend<span style="">ing in all courts </span>of
first instance, actual <span style="">trial of which
had not </span>yet been commenced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
directing their respective Branch Clerks to turn over to the Clerk of Court
certain cases - including the present case - for transfer to the Circuit
Criminal Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, the judges were, therefore,
in large measure, if not entirely, motivated by Memorandum Circular <span style="">No. </span>53.</p>

<p class="BODY">In People vs. Gutierrez, etc., e<span style="">t</span> al., L-32282-83, <st1:date year="1970" day="26" month="11">November
 26, 1970</st1:date>, we said:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"We </span>agree with
respondents that the present laws do not confer upon the Secretary of Justice
power to determine what court should hear specific cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any such power, even in the guise of
administrative regulation executive affairs, trenches upon the time-honored
separation of the Executive and the Judiciary; and while not directly depriving
the courts of their independence, it would endanger the rights and immunities
of the accused or civil party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">could be </span>much too easily transformed
into a means of predetermining the outcome of individual cases, so as to
produce a result in harmony with the Administration's preferences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The creation by Republic Act No. <span style="">5179 </span>of the Circuit Criminal Courts
for the purpose of <span style="">alleviating </span>the
burden of the regular Courts of First Instance, and to accelerate the disposition
of criminal cases pending or to be filed therein, nowhere indicates an intent
to permit the transfer of <span class="SpellE">preselected</span> individual
cases to the circuit courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither do
Administrative Orders Mos. 258 and 274 evidence any such intention;
particularly since Administrative Order <span style="">No.
</span>258, Series of 1968, in Section 2 of its Part V, <span style="">as </span>confirmed by Administrative Order No. 274 of the <span style="">same </span>year, in Section <span style="">3 </span>of Part III thereof, provides that
the transfer to Circuit Criminal Courts of cases pending in the regular Courts
of First Instance should be effected by <u>raffle</u>, chance here operating to
nullify any executive<span style=""> </span>arbitration of what <span style="">particular
</span>cases should be apportioned to <span style="">either
tribunal. <span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">While Memorandum Circular No. 53 of the
Department of <span style="">Justice does not, on its </span>face,
single out the anti-graft <span style="">case </span>against
petitioner, the peculiar facts sur<span style="">rounding
the </span>transfer of <span style="">said </span>case
to the circuit court <span style="">lead to no </span>other
conclusion than that the transfer was in effect one of a <span class="SpellE">preselected</span>
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Note that although <span style="">petitioner was </span>arraigned way back on <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1968</st1:date>, <span style="">before Judge <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span>,
</span>who set the case for trial seve<span style="">ral
times, trial </span>had to be postponed each time on motion of Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Amadora</span>. Note also that even if the raffle <span style="">held pursuant to </span>Administrative Order
No. 258 resulted - <span style="">as Fate would have </span>it
- in the retention of the case by the court of first instance, the said court,
much <span style="">as </span>it
<span style="">wanted to, </span>could not proceed to
trial because on the date scheduled <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Amadora</span> again obtained <span style="">a </span>postponement by flashing in open
court a telegram from the Undersecretary of Justice ordering another raffle of
the present anti-graft case for transfer to the circuit court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We join petitioner in wondering how chance
could come into play by raffling one case in one court for transfer to another
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The postponement <span style="">was </span>followed by the filing of another
motion to raffle the case for transfer to <span style="">the
</span>circuit court, which again resulted in the suspension of the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, when Memorandum Circular No, 53<span style=""> </span>was issued a few months thereafter,
or on July 22, 1969, authorizing the transfer to the circuit criminal courts of
all anti-graft cases actual trial <span style="">of </span>which
had not yet been <span style="">commenced, </span><span style="">the </span>necessary
groundwork had already been laid to ensure that the anti-graft case against petitioner
would be among those that could be transferred to the circuit court on the
strength of the circular; the repeated postponements of the trial of the case
on the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> motions had seen to that.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although on <st1:date year="1969" day="15" month="9">September
 15, 1969</st1:date>, in answer to <span style="">peti</span>tioner's
query as to whether or not the case against him was covered by Memorandum
Circular No, 53, the Secretary of Justice assured petitioner that if more cases
would be transferred to the circuit court, the cases <span style="">to </span>be transferred would be determined by<span style=""> </span>raffle, no such raffle ever took place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What came next - after Judge <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span> had inhibited himself on <st1:date year="1969" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1969</st1:date> was the circular of the other
judges which, far from giving weight and effect to the abovementioned assurance
of the Secretary of Justice, in effect accomplished in one broad sweep what,
previously, chance could not bring about.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, it <span style="">did </span>little to
accord respect to the valid order of Judge <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span>
wherein he had expressly contemplated the re-assignment of the case "in
the usual manner"--meaning by raffle--"among the other branches of
this Court." This, apparently, is the reason why Judge <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span>
could not, in conscience, give his imprimatur to his colleagues' circular.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the repeated postponements, on the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> motions, of the trial of Criminal Case No.V-10874
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, were
obviously intended to place the case within the coverage of what <span style="">la</span>ter came out as Memorandum Circular
No. <span style="">53; </span>that the <span style="">memo</span>randum circular signed by the
judges was made [<span class="SpellE"><span style="">i</span></span><span style="">]n </span>the light of the intentions of
Memorandum Circular <span style="">No. 53;" </span>that
the Secretary of Justice, from whose Office the said memorandum circular
emanated, had expressly stated - in connection with petitioner's case - that
any transfer of additional cases to the Circuit Criminal Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> pursuant to Memorandum Circular No. 53 <span style="">would </span>be determined by raffle; that
contrary to such <span style="">official </span>commitment
no raffle was held; and that no serious and weighty reasons <span style="">similar </span>to those which prompted this
Court in People vs. Gutierrez, etc., et al., <u>supra</u>, to exercise its
inherent <span style="">power </span>to decree the
transfer of trial from one court to another, obtain in the instant case, we
hold that the transfer of Criminal Case No. V-10874 from the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> to the Circuit Criminal Court is null and
void.</p>

<p class="BODY">The remaining issue before us relates to the denial by respondent
Judge <span class="SpellE">Cupin</span> of the Circuit Criminal Court of petitioner's
opposition to the appearance of Atty. Vicente S. del Rosario as a private
prosecutor in the anti-graft case in behalf of Mr. Manuel O. Ponce. The Judge
denied the opposition on the ground that the information alleges that damages
have been caused to <span style="">Mr. </span>Ponce.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Cupin</span> must have in mind charges
Nos. 1 and 2 of the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
the first charge, petitioner is alleged to have violated Sec. <span style="">3, </span>par. (e), of RA No. <span style="">3019, i.e., </span>causing undue injury to
any party, including the Government, in that petitioner, taking advantage of
his position as Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City, "Committed
acts of harassment and <span class="SpellE">embarassment</span> against said
Manuel O. Ponce by (a) ordering the prosecution of said Manuel O. Ponce by the
City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> for the violation of building
ordinance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City; and (b) other ordinances that
took place more than ten (10) years ago, by ordering thru Secretary of Health,
Manuel A. <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>, who obtained his appointment on such
position thru <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> political influence, the
exhumation of the dead body of the wife of said Manuel Ponce, despite the fact
that it was legally buried more than a year ago in the Ponce Island, the manmade
island constructed with great sacrifice of said Mr. Ponce and his family, and
finally causing the destruction of said island to the tremendous financial and
material losses of said Mr. Ponce by having said island buried under silt and
mud by the dredging operation of the Dillingham dredging machine rented by said
<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Development Corporation and <span class="SpellE">Essel</span>,
Inc., in the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Reclamation area." Under the
second charge petitioner is alleged to have violated Sec. 3, par. (f), of the
same law, in that he neglected or refused, after due demand or request, without
sufficient justification, to act within a reasonable <span style="">time, </span>by preventing "Manuel O.
Ponce from securing a Mayor's permit to exercise his calling or profession as
boat builder for the year 1965 in order to drive him out of the Ponce Island,
which was badly coveted by the accused, being included in the area of the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Reclamation Project, where said Mr. Ponce was having
his dry-docking, boat building and other business," for the purpose of
favoring petitioner's own interest or giving undue advantage to another
interested party.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since we have already held above that the order transferring the
present anti-graft case to the Circuit Criminal Court is null and void, it
follows that all proceedings had before the said court - including that in
connection with Judge <span class="SpellE">Cupin's</span> order denying petitioner's
opposition to the appearance of a private prosecutor - are likewise void and of
no legal effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore
unnecessary for us for the present purpose to pass upon the legality of such
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering, however, that
proceedings will have to continue in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> after the return of this case to that court where this
same issue may again crop up, it becomes incumbent upon us to make a ruling
thereon for the guidance of the parties and the court below.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that Manuel O. Ponce has previously filed two civil
cases against petitioner in connection with the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
Reclamation Project.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In
one of them, Civil Case No.</span> R-7978, Manuel O. Ponce, et al. vs. City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, et al., Mr. Ponce lost in the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, which held Mr. Ponce and the other
plaintiffs to "have no personal interest that stands to be affected by the
reclamation work undertaken by the herein defendants," because Ponce
Island <span style="">"is
definitely </span>within the foreshore area over which the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> has unquestioned authority to reclaim under Republic
Act No. 1899." <span class="GramE">In the other case, Civil Case No.</span> <span style="">R-9455, </span>Manuel O. Ponce, et al <span class="SpellE">vs</span>, Sergio <span class="SpellE">OsmeÃ±a</span>, Jr., et al.,
the same court, in a decision which is now on appeal to this Court absolved <span class="SpellE">OsmeÃ±a</span> from liability <span style="">and
</span>dismissed "the complaint for damages and insofar as the reclamation
by the defendants of the foreshore proper which includes the Ponce Island is
concerned." The filing of those cases by Mr. Ponce was a positive step
toward the protection of his interest and the recovery of indemnity from
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On account thereof, and
considering that whatever injury or loss Mr. Ponce may have personally suffered
from the acts of petitioner alleged in the present information could only stem
from <span style="">his </span>right
to Ponce Island, over which, as already stated, Mr. Ponce has already filed two
civil cases, it must be concluded that he has no more interest of a civil
character to protect in the present criminal proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents shield themselves behind the
terse argument that "in cases of violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt
Practices Act the offended party is really the entire populace and not only the
Government."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming that Mr.
Ponce is an offended party in the present case on account of the allegations of
the information earlier referred to and quoted, he lost his right to intervene
when he instituted the two civil actions in court, because by so doing his
special interest in the criminal case had disappeared (<span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span>,

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the result.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">My principal reason for
my vote in favor of the judgment in this case is that I cannot find any justification
for allowing the Secretary of Justice to have any part at all in the
distribution or assignment of </span>cases among the different branches of any
Court of First Instance, of which the corresponding Circuit Criminal Court is
one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took this view in my concurring
opinion in the case of People v. Gutierrez, cited in the main opinion of
Justice <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>, and I cannot see why I must opine
differently now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that the
transfer of the case against petitioner herein involved was directed by a
circular of the judges of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
which is how it should be, but it appears, however, that the said circular is
expressly premised on the "intentions of Memorandum Circular No. 53 of the
Department of Justice", and naturally, matters would be worse if such an
attitude on the part of the judges were to be sanctioned by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is bad enough if the Secretary should
interfere with the judges, but it is definitely the end of judicial
independence if the judges themselves are to act pursuant to the intentions of
the Department of Justice in the distribution and assignment of cases among
them.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I do not have to share
the view expressed in the main opinion as to the purposeful tendency of the
maneuvers of the fiscal in trying to see to it that the transfer of petitioner's
case to the Circuit Criminal Court is effected, but I feel very strongly that
any suspicion engendered by the circumstances recounted by Justice <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span> should not be allowed to <span style="">deve</span>lop into a <span style="">definite </span>conclusion,
and the wisest step to avoid such an eventuality is to leave the case against
petitioner in the hands of any of the judges of the regular courts who should
be chosen by raffle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Insofar as the appearance of Atty. Vicente del Rosario as private
prosecutor is concerned, I agree that the private interests of Mr. Manuel O.
Ponce affected by the allegedly illegal acts of petitioner may best be
protected in the civil case filed by said party against petitioner now pending
on appeal in this Court and wherein Atty. del Rosario is one of his lawyers.</p>
