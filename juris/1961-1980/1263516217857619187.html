<p class="BODY"><span style="">The following are the <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> salient facts:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(1) In the years 1949, 1950 and 1951 <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> was a <span class="SpellE">Huk</span>-infested province.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Frequent clashes took place during that period between the dissidents </span><span style="">and the</span><span style=""> temporary police (T. P.) and the "civilian guards” of the various
municipalities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, in particular, the then incumbent Mayor Eduardo L. <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>, the prin­cipal complainant in both cases, led a
vigorous and unrelenting campaign against the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(2) In the local elections of 1947 and 1951
Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> and Jose Alto were the </span><span style="">major </span><span style="">candidates for the mayoralty of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueava</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Joson</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">won over Alto in both
elec­tions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter admitted that
after the 1947 election he chanced to remark that he had been c</span><span style="">heated b</span><span style="">ecause "the civilian guards of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>
had carried away the ballot boxes." However, he ne­ver filed any formal
protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(3) On </span><st1:date year="1950" day="12" month="11"><span style="">November
 12, 1950</span></st1:date><span style="">, at the

these were on their way to reinforce the temporary detachment detailed at <u>barrio</u>

for the liquidation of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The complete measure of

</span>What is </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Salvador</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">'s story?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified that he
was "in charge” of the </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Tanggulang</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">Bayan</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></u></span></a><u>
</u><span style="">in <u>barrio</u> <span class="SpellE">Parukot</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> from 1946 to
1952.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(In this latter year he
surrendered to the authorities and severed his connections with the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span>.) In such capacity, he operated under the command</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">of
Isaac Francisco who was the supreme leader of the various </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Tanggulang</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">Bayan</span></u> <span style="">units in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> and
the neighboring localities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
behest of Francisco, he attended a meeting at the house of Carlos Gabriel
around the middle of </span><span style="">August, </span><span style="">1950.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Present at the meeting, aside from Francisco
and </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Salvador</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, were commanders <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> and Reyes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Francisco informed them that Jose </span><span style="">Alto </span><span style="">had offered P2<span class="GramE">,000</span> for the liquidation of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>,
and those present unanimously agreed to the proposal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More than two months later, or more
specifically on the day following all Saints' Day (November 2, 1950), Salvador
went with Francisco to the house of Jose Alto in the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span>
of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> where they conveyed to the latter the
acceptance by the <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> commanders of the appellant's
proposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alto then gave to Francisco
the promised P2<span class="GramE">,000</span>, with the explicit instructions
that the money be delivered to commander <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> and
that the ambush of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> be effected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Forthwith, the two emissaries left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>On <span style="">the afternoon of thee same day they proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Pantok</span>
in </span><u>barrio</u> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Parukot</span></span><span style="">, a part
of the land owned by </span><span style="">Alto, </span><span style="">where Fran­cisco
delivered the P2,000 to commander <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> in the
presence of commanders <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> and Reyes and another
person whom Salvador could not identify.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Francisco informed the <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> comman­ders about
Alto's instructions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The commanders then
issued a receipt for P2<span class="GramE">,000</span>, and swore - by raising
their hands - that they had received the money.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After this occasion, he never again saw <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> and Reyes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He admitted that he did not witness the two ambushes in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="">Because
the principal foundation of the entire case against the appellant is </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Salvador</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">'s testimony, it behooved us to scrutinize
and examine it with painstaking care.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even after three readings of the entire transcript, we must confess that
we are unable to shake off nagging doubts as to the veracity of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Salvador</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">'s declarations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, his testimony is utterly uncorroborated in its vital
points.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far as the record goes - and
we have repeatedly probed the four corners of the record - Salvador was the <u>only
eyewitness</u> to the handling by Alto of the amount of P2,000 to Francisco and
the subsequent delivery by the latter to <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two other </span><span style="">witnesses, <span class="SpellE">Toribio</span></span><span style=""> Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
Pineda, were not privy to the passing on the money from hand to hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sworn statement of <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>
Marcos speaks of knowledge sup­posedly acquired by him <u>after</u> the money
had been delivered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On top of this,
Francisco, who was allegedly with </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Salvador</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> when the money was given by Alto, </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">already dead and therefore cannot be cross-<span class="GramE">examined.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This uncorroborated
testimony of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Salvador</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> is considerably </span>enfeebled by his own
admission that he was an accomplice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although the law does not exclude evidence given by an accomplice, our
juris­prudence has consistently enjoined courts, in the appreciation of such
evidence, to exercise the greatest degree of caution and <span style="">cir</span><span style="">cumspection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Asinas</span></u>, </span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> this Court emphasized "that a defendant
in a criminal case cannot be convicted on the evidence of </span><span style="">an </span><span style="">accomplice only, and to sustain </span><span style="">such conviction, there must be other evidence corroborating that of </span><span style="">the accomplice which tends to show the guilt
of the defendant.” In an earlier case, this Court stated that the testimony of
an accomplice "must be assayed and weighed with scrupulous care," and
that "the corroborating testi</span>mony must be strong and convincing.’<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">A</span>nd
the proper test to determine whether there is sufficient corroboration of the
testimony of an accomplice is to "examine the evidence or evidences of the
other witness or witnesses with a view to ascertaining if there be <span class="SpellE">inculpatory</span> evidence - evidence tending to connect the
defendant with the offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there the
accomplice is corroborated; if there is no <span class="SpellE">inculpatory</span>
evidence there is no corroboration, although the accomplice may be corroborated
in regard to any number of facts sworn to <span style="">by </span>him."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>2. The intrinsic and basic <span class="SpellE">inverisimilitude</span>
of Salvador's testimony is underscored </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">his repetitious
invocation of dead per</span>sons like Francisco and <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>
who can never be confronted <span style="">by </span>the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense proved the fact of death
of Francisco and <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> by presenting their
respective death certificates (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. 3-A <span style="">and <span class="SpellE">exh</span>. 3-E,
respectively).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Salvador himself, in his

knew <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> because they were "in-laws" (<span class="SpellE"><u>magbilas</u></span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
stands to reason that </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Salvador</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> should have known the real name of <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">(c) </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Salvador</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> declared that after he and Francisco
delivered the money to <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>, at no occasion did he
again see <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>, Reyes and <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contradicts his previous affirmation

<p class="BODY"><span style="">4. Furthermore, the long

he suddenly volun­teered to testify for the prosecution, engenders serious
doubt as to his motives and renders his testimony suspect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course he tried to justify his long
silence by saying that he feared reprisal from the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To our mind, this is preposterous - for did
he in 1952 have any apprehensions about incurring the animosity of his comrades
when he deserted them and jumped over to the side of the law and the duly
constituted authorities?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If indeed he
had knowledge of the events, as he professed</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">he had, why did he not
make report of them earlier, or in 1952 when he abandoned his arrant ways and
retraced his steps to the path of the law?<span style="">&nbsp;

participated in the commission of the offense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, he re­mained silent for approximately three years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court took a dim view of the witness'
"long continued silence" and his motives for breaking his silence,
saying, in no uncertain terms, that the change of attitude "could have not
been due to a desirable impulse to serve the interest of justice and proves, if
it proves anything at all, the tardy revival of stultified civic
consciousness."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Let us examine Garcia's story.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since 1940, so he declared, he had been a member of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Hukbong</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">Mapagpalaya</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayan</span></u>, otherwise known as
the HMB.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He abandoned this organization
in Septem­ber, 1951 when he surrendered at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename>Murphy</st1:placename></st1:place> to General <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1950 <span class="SpellE">Ramson</span> was in command of the HMB military forces in <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, Estrada of the 12th field unit which embraced <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. <span class="GramE">Domingo in its area of operations.</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon instructions of <span class="SpellE">Ramson</span>
and Estrada, Garcia used to procure medicines and rice from Alto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the year 1950 he saw and met Alto
thrice:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in </span><u>barrio </u><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Osmeña</span></span><span style=""> around the middle of October, in <span class="SpellE">Pantok</span> (<span class="SpellE">Parukot</span>) toward the end
of October, and in <span class="SpellE">Malayok</span> about the end of
December.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he met Alto in <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>, the latter was looking for Estrada in order to
inquire why the agreement regarding <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> had not yet
been imple­mented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told Alto that he
would relay the inquiry to Estrada.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Before he left, Alto said that the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> must
send for him the moment they were in the vicinity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he later met Alto in <span class="SpellE">Pantok</span>,
the latter was accompanied by <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span> Salvador and
Isaac Francisco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also present at this
meeting were Estrada and himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alto
remarked that "Ding" - referring to <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> -
could already be ambushed because he used to commute between <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. <span class="GramE">Domingo and <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Estrada told Alto that although he could no
longer direct the ambush because he had been assigned to Laguna, he would nevertheless
assign <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> and <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>
to <span class="GramE">effect</span> it, and added that the money should be given
to <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Garcia did not witness the ambush staged on </span><st1:date year="1950" day="12" month="11"><span style="">November 12, 1950</span></st1:date><span style="">, although he later learned about it from <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, he met Alto in <span class="SpellE">Malayok</span>, toward
the end of December, 1950.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alto was then
with <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> Santiago while he (Garcia) was with
Estrada.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this meeting Alto remarked that
"Ding" could not be ambushed anymore because he was always
"ready," and that they should wait a few months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Estrada agreed, adding that a new plan was
necessary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">1. We are of the view
that Garcia's version is not entitled to credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the array of prosecution witnesses, only
Garcia testified on the alleged meetings had by Alto with the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> concerning the liquidation of <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not even the principal witness, <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span> Salvador, made any advertence to the meetings
allegedly had at <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>, <span class="SpellE">Parukot</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Malayok</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Garcia was categorical on the presence of Salvador at the meeting
between the appellant and Estrada in <span class="SpellE">Parukot</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Salvador never even as much as hinted at
this conference, and as a matter of fact he denied having had any conversation
with Alto prior to November 2, 1950.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The drift of Garcia' s
declarations is that the conspiracy to liquidate <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>
was originally conceived by Estrada and Alto, and that <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> learned of the plot only after the
meeting in <span class="SpellE">Parukot</span> had toward the end of October,
1950, at which time Estrada informed Alto that he could not anymore direct the
ambush as he had been assigned to Laguna.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This belies the asseveration of Salvador that the conspiracy was forged
in the middle of August, 1950 when Francisco for the first time relayed to <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>, </span><span class="SpellE">Mel<span style="">chor</span></span><span style=""> and Reyes the appellant's offer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>Salvador <span style="">testified thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">"</span>COURT:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
understands that you and Isaac Francisco had entered into the agreement with
Commanders Reyes and <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>, and <span style="">two </span>other parties <span style="">to </span>ambus<span style="">h </span>Mayor <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> <span style="">for P2,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is that correct?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, <span style="">sir.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q. <span style=""> </span>When did you enter
into that agreement? </blockquote>

<blockquote>“A. <span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the month of August,
1950, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What date in August?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More or less about
the middle of the month."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
inconsistencies between Garcia's narration and Salvador's sto­ry are so patent
and so palpably irreconcilable, that this Court is inclined to agree with the
contention of the defense that the charges against Alto were fabricated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">2. The improbability of
both the story of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Salvador</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> and the narration of Garcia is heightened when we consider that they
in effect picture Alto as so naive and utterly reckless as to conspire with
numerous persons of divergent and <span class="SpellE">heteregeneous</span> back</span>grounds
and persuasions regarding an evil and dangerous mission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It stands to reason that one who plots evil
hides in the cloak of secrecy, if not anonymity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution has projected <span style="">A</span>lto's image as that of <span style="">a </span>man who
scuttled all precaution and discretion, and not only called and attended
meetings with <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> commanders to discuss the alleged
conspiracy, and but as well even went to the extent of divulging his design to
mere dissident followers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Against this <span class="SpellE">cumulation</span> of acts imputed to Alto is the defense's
unembellished recitation of the life of a respected man in society, a pre-war
mayor of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, a family man with eight children,
all of whom were then studying at the University of Santo Tomas (four in the
college of medicine, one in the college of law, one in school of architecture,
and two in high school), a progressive business man who owned a pharmacy,
sari-sari store and a gasoline station, and operated a thriving transportation
system, "The <span class="SpellE">Angelita</span> Transit." For such a
man to risk his entire future and that of his fami­ly in one pitch and toss by
confederating openly with the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span>, he must be driven
by an overriding compelling motive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
such motive appears on record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True it
is that <span style="">Alto
</span>was embittered by his defeat to <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> <span style="">in </span>1947 and that he made the remark
that he had lost because <span class="SpellE">Joson's</span> "civilian
guards" ran away with the ballot boxes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But <span style="">remarks of this nature arc
ordinary woof and warp of the lives of politicians - who must make excuses for
their defeats.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could be said, too,
that Alto probably did not mean what he said because he did not even file a
formal protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, this remark
was made shortly after the elections in 1947 - and Alto is charged with
conspiring in 1950 to have <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> killed, that in,
after a lapse of three years!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the oft-cited case</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">of
<u>Daggers vs. Van Dyke</u>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> New Jersey Vice Chancellor Van Fleet quite
aptly stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Evidence, to be believed, must not only proceed from the
mouth of a credible witness, but it must be credible in itself - such as the
common experience and observation of mankind can approve as probable under the

truth of human testimony</u>, <u>except its </u><u><span style="">conformity to our knowledge</span></u><span style="">, </span><u>observation</u>, <u><span style="">and-ex­</span>perience</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">Whatever
is repugnant to these belongs to the miraculous and is outside of judicial
cognizance.</span></u><span style="">" (emphasis
supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">3. Like Salvador, Garcia repeatedly referred to Alto's alleged
criminal alliance with persons whom, he knew at the time he gave his testimony
in court to be already dead, and who could not therefore be
cross-examined.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The following admissions
are revealing:</p>

<blockquote>“Q. <span style=""> </span>On that occasion when you
were being investigated by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Malubag</span> you knew
already that Major Estrada was already dead?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I already know. </blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q. <span style=""> </span>You knew also then that
Commander <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> whom you mentioned in this
affidavit Exhibit 2-impeachment is also dead?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A. <span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know it already
sir."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">4. Again, like Salvador, Garcia said that he was privy to the
conspiracy to liquidate Mayor <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>, but kept silent
for more than five years, only to emerge in unexplained suddenness to nar­rate
his tale.</p>

<p class="BODY">5. Finally, when Garcia testified for the prosecution, he was
already a tenant of the principal complainant <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>,
who ad­mitted their landlord-tenant relationship after some hesitation:</p>

<blockquote>“Q. <span style=""> </span>Is it not a fact that <span class="SpellE">Toribio</span> Garcia is one of your tenants in your farm in <span class="SpellE">Parukot</span>? </blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, he is not a
tenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have no farm in <span class="SpellE">Parukot</span>. </blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where is your farm?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">"COURT:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is he your tenant?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q. <span style=""> </span>Has he ever been
your tenant?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"S.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Only this year,
your Honor."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Obviously Garcia's motives in testifying
against Alto are suspect.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III.</p>

<p class="BODY">The third witness, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Pineda,
implicated Alto with the second ambush staged on December 15, 1951 at <span class="SpellE">Curva</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">1. The only relevant declaration of Pineda with respect to the
alleged complicity of the appellant is his statement that he saw Alto in his
house talking with commander <span class="SpellE">Rodil</span> (<span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> Marcos) about Mayor <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not, however, elaborate nor give details
of the conversation, although he stated that he overheard <span class="SpellE">Rodil</span>
say to Alto that the "scales" (<span class="SpellE"><u>kaliskis</u></span>)
of <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> are of high quality and that he (Alto) must
not be impatient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on
cross-examination, Pineda gravely contradicted himself by admitting that this
alleged statement was addressed to him by <span class="SpellE">Rodil</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q. <span style=""> </span>Are you sure of
that, - that you did not have any conversation with the companions of <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> de Leon that night?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A. <span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was able to talk to <span class="SpellE">Rodil</span> then, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q. <span style=""> </span>What did <span class="SpellE">Rodil</span> or <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> Marcos tell
you? </blockquote>

<blockquote>“A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He said that the Mayor
is of a high quality (<span class="SpellE"><u>mataas</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">ang</span> </u><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">kaliskis</span></u></span><span style="">).<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>That is all you heard from <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> Marcos? </blockquote>

<blockquote>“A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That was the only thing <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> Marcos told me, sir."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">2.
</span>Pineda's testimony is impeached by the manifest improbability of his
assertions.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>First</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- He
testified that the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> frequently gathered and ate
in his house, and that on the night of the ambush at <span class="SpellE">Curva</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ro­dil</span> and his companions met in his house before
proceeding to the ambuscade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
Pineda admitted that his house was only 300 meters away from the municipal
building, and that the temporary police were in constant patrol in that
vicinity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact on the night he
allegedly saw <span class="SpellE">Rodil</span> and Alto talking, he<span style=""> </span>brought his family to his parents’
house because he feared that the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> and the temporary
police might meet in armed encounter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
would seem then unusual that the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> frequently
gathered at his house and more unnatural that they made it their precise
rendezvous point on the night of the attack at <span class="SpellE">Curva</span>
despite its proximity to the municipal building and the patrol activities
thereabouts of the temporary po­lice.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Second</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Despite
Pineda's supposed closeness to the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span>, he admitted
that on the night of the ambush at <span class="SpellE">Curva</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rodil</span>, before leaving, had him guarded on surveillance by a
<span class="SpellE">Huk</span> soldier.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Third</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Pineda
testified that <span class="SpellE">Bertese</span> is about three kilo­meters
distant from his house, but when asked, upon cross-exami­nation, to calculate
the time which transpired from the moment the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span>
left his house to the time he heard the first volley of shots at <span class="SpellE">Bertese</span>, and also to approximate the time which elapsed
from the moment and his companions left his house to the time they returned for
the <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> soldier, he (Pineda) made patently ridi­culous
<span style="">estimates:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Q. <span style=""> </span>If you smoke a cigarette
from the time these people you said ate in your house up to the time the first
volley of shots occurred in <span class="SpellE">Bertese</span> how many could
you have consumed?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Are you referring
to the occasion beginning the time when they left?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, from the time they
left to the first volley of shots?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More or less one
cigarette.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q. <span style=""> </span>How many cigarettes would
you have consumed if you smoked from the time the guard guarded you up to the
time they took him away?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A. <span style="">&nbsp; </span>About after smoking a
cigarette.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the time
from the time they left you with a guard up to the time they passed by the
guard?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir."</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">IV.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution sought to bolster its case against the appellant
by introducing in evidence a sworn statement of <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>
Marcos, a co-accused, made by the latter while he was a detention prisoner in
the provincial jail of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This sworn statement, to which the trial
court accorded inordinate credence, <span style="">recites
</span>that <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> Marcos was the representative or
"<span class="SpellE">kinatawan</span>" of the commander of the PC -12,
a military unit of the HMB; that on August 12, 1950 he saw Alto, <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocol</span>, <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> Angeles and Isaac Francisco in the house of Carlos
Gabriel in <u>barrio</u> <span class="SpellE">Parukot</span> at a meeting
attended by himself, <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>, <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>,
commander <span class="SpellE">Golong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Telmo</span>;
that Alto said that the meeting was called in connection with the liquidation
of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> as to which he was offering a reward
of P2 ,000; that Alto added that if the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> wanted
they could send someone to get the money from him the next day; that the money
was received from Alto the following month (September), but of the amount of
P2,000, only P1,800 was delivered by Francisco to <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> before November 10, 1950 because
Francisco retained the sum of P200; that subsequently <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>
was ambushed at <span class="SpellE">Mambarao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>; that more than
a year later, or on December 12, 1951, Marcos again saw Alto, <span class="SpellE">Ocol</span> Angeles and Francisco at <span class="SpellE">Dulong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bayan</span> in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> together
with colonel <span class="SpellE">Aleman</span>, commander <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Golong</span>; that at this meeting Alto, <span class="SpellE">Ocol</span>, Angeles and Francisco suggested that the best way to
kill Jason was to<span style="">&nbsp; </span>attack <u>barrio</u> <span class="SpellE">Bertese</span> and to ambush him at <span class="SpellE">Curva</span>
on his way to aid the detachment at <span class="SpellE">Bertese</span>; and that
scheme was carried out and on December 15, 1951 Mayor <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>
was ambushed at <span class="SpellE">Curva</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Is this sworn statement
entitled to credence, assuming that it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">admissible as against
appellant?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not believe so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">1. We underscore the fact
that this sworn statement was unequivocally retracted by <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>
Marcos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But before delving into the whys
and wherefores of the said retraction, let us first analyze Marcos'
declarations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The impression that
immediately comes to the fore is that his story is completely at variance with
the already conflicting accounts made by Salvador and Garcia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In</span> fact it contradicts the testimony

who testified on the conferences allegedly attended by Alto in <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>, <span class="SpellE">Parukot</span> and <span class="SpellE">Malayok</span> never mentioned the presence of Marcos, and Marcos
himself did not mention the presence of Garcia in any of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">said conferences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did
Salvador mention the presence of Marcos in the said conclaves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And although they were unanimous that
Francisco, Es­trada and <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> were present at the
various meetings which they attended, the cold undeniable fact is that all
these <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> leaders are dead and could not be
confronted by the appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">3. Moreover, the
statement of Marcos deserves no credit, not only because it was recanted, but
also because it was given upon the repeated inducements of <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>
while Marcos was a detention prisoner in the provincial jail of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following declarations of Marcos during
the trial are significant:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Q. <span style=""> </span>Will you please tell us
why you signed this Exhibit E for the prosecution, and accord­ing to you have
not seen Jose <span style="">Alto </span>in the month
of August 1950, in the house of Car<span style="">los
Gabriel pertaining whom you stated a while ago </span><span style="">you </span><span style="">did </span><span style="">not know that fellow?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“A. <span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reasons why I signed
that document, sir are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>first, because I
was intimidated by the policemen of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>;
second, because Mayor <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> promised me that he would
help me in my two other cases that I have besides these ones; and third, that
he would procure my release by the filing of a bond.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A</span>ny other reason for your signing this
docu<span style="">ment Exhibit E?</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir. There are some
more.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>“Q. </span>Will you please <span style="">tell </span>us?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Other reasons for my having signed
the said document was that Mayor <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> together with
Jose <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> promised that after I would be released
upon the filing of a bond, I would live <span style="">in
any place in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, and that he would lend me three hectares of land
which I could farm for my own benefit and that the produce will be exclusively
mine until the cases are finished.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q. <span style=""> </span>Did you know that when
you signed this Exhi­bit E <span style="">that </span>you
were declaring against Jose <span style="">Alto, <span class="SpellE">Ismael</span> <span class="SpellE">Dungao</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> Gregorio in this case?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"A. <span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only against
Jose Alto that I knew that I was testifying, sir, but with respect to <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Is</span>mael</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dungao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>
Gregorio and <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bienvenido</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Almuete</span> I did not

<blockquote>“Q. <span style=""> </span>Had you talk about Jose
Alto with Mayor <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> concerning this Exhibit E, the
statement of yours?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, <span style="">sir.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q. <span style=""> </span></span>What did he tell you about Alto?</blockquote>

to sign that document in order to send to jail Jose Alto after which he would
do me every favor if he would suc<span style="">ceed.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The testimony of Marcos
regarding his reasons for making the sworn statement was corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> Bernardo whose pertinent testimony is summarized </span>by
<span style="">the trial </span>court in <span style="">its decision, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Sometime during the middle of October, 1954, Mayor <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> went to the house of <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>
Bernardo and requested the latter to help Mayor <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>
by testifying in his favor, and Mayor <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> promised
that he would take care of the cases of <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>
Marcos and secure his release on bail.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mayor <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> and Bernardo went to the
provincial jail where <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> Marcos was and is
still pre<span style="">sently confined, and B</span><span style="">e</span><span style="">rnardo
informed him of the wishes of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> Marcos
refused to testify in favor of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> because,
accord­ing to him, he did not know anything about the matter and that was the

latter talked with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ma­yor <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> Bernardo
again returned to the provincial jail about the end of October with the same
request and with the same promises, but again <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>
Marcos refused.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It must be noted that in

<p class="NUMROMANS">V.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In according</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">credit
to the prosecution witnesses, the trial court observed that "these
witnesses for the prosecution had demonstrated a fair knowledge of the <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> organization and the functions of each of the branches
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not denied for example,
that in any given section or command the military branch could not do anything
without consulting the civilian branch of the organization." But it is
precisely because of their intimate knowledge of the organizational set-up and
operations of the <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> organization that any
fabricated charge against the appellant could be given the semblance of
verity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also obvious that these
confessed <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> would with alacrity ally with the
authorities just to purchase their security, knowing that the said authorities
could at will revive charges against them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As a salutary proposition, this Court usually desists from
disturbing the conclusions of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses,
in deference to the rule that the lower court, having seen and heard the
witnesses and observed their demeanor and manner of testifying, is in a better
position to appreciate the evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
But this doctrine must bow to the superior and immutable rule that the guilt of
the accused must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, because the law presumes
that a defendant is inno­cent, and this presumption must prevail unless
overturned by com­petent and credible proof.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We find the record wanting of competent and credible proof to sustain a
moral certainty as to the guilt of the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Viewing the record in its entirety, we are not prepared to say
that the evidence adduced precludes the possibility that the charges against
Alto were politically motivated and contrived.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor is the evidence incompatible with the suggested probability that the
ambushes in question were integral parts of a determined campaign by the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> to eliminate Mayor <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> who
was an avowed mortal foe - of which campaign <span style="">Alto </span>may have been completely unaware; or if he was aware
thereof he had no complicity therein.</p>
