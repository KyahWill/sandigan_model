				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The facts of this case, as related by the City Fiscal of Manila and adopted 
by the herein respondent, are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Criminal Case No. 171.52 entitled the "People of the Philippines 
<i>vs.</i> Secretary Jaime Hernandez," of the Court of First Instance of Manila, 
Branch XVII presided over by appellant Judge Arsenio Solidum, wherein appellee 
is charged with violation of Article 216 of the Revised Penal Code, appellant 
Hermogenes Concepcion, Jr. filed on April 18, 1959 an amended information 
alleging in substance that appellee, having acquired shares of stock in the 
Avegon Construction and Electrical Co., Inc., and having thus become interested, 
directly or indirectly, in its business, granted said corporation tax exemptions 
and otherwise acted favorably upon its various requests and petitions in his 
capacity as Secretary of Finance, and participated, as presiding officer, and 
member of the Monetary Board of the Central Rank, in meetings thereof wherein 
said Board decided to grant, and in fact granted said corporation dollar 
allocations in the total amount of $1,612,224 from 1954 to 1958 and otherwise 
acted favorably on its other requests and petitions. </p>
<p>On June 15, 1959, appellee filed a motion to quash said amended information 
on the ground that the facts charged therein do not constitute an offense, 
alleging three reasons in support, to wit: </p>
<p>1) that 'the mere ownership by him of shares, of stock in a private 
corporation, whether or not that corporation may transact official business with 
him in his official capacity, does not fall within the purview of prohibited 
interest in a 'contrato u operacion' under Article 216 of the Revised Penal 
Code; 2) that petitioner had no interest or shareholding whatever in the 
corporation, Avegon, Inc., as of any of the material dates when said corporation 
was granted its tax exemption privileges in the Department of Finance and other 
requests by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank; and 3) that 'Article 216 of 
the Penal Code does not apply to a department head, such as petitioner, by 
virtue of Article VII, Sec. 11 paragraph 2 of the Constitution. </p>
<p>On July 9, 1959, appellant Hermogenes Concepcion, Jr., fiscal for the City of 
Manila, filed an opposition to the motion to quash aforementioned, showing 
clearly that appellee's interest as a stockholder of the Avegon, Inc., in whose 
business and transactions he intervened in his official capacity as Secretary of 
Finance and as presiding officer of the Monetary Board of the Central Bank by 
granting said corporation tax exemptions and dollar allocations, and otherwise 
acting favorably upon its other requests and petitions, was such an interest 
that Article 216 of the Revised Penal Code prohibits a public officer to have in 
a 'contrator u operacion'; that appellee's allegation that he 'had no interest 
or shareholding whatsoever in the corporation Avegon, Inc., as of the material 
dates when said corporation was granted tax exemption privileges in the 
Department of Finance and other requests by the Monetary Board of the Central 
Bank was purely a matter of evidence which appellee could probably avail of as a 
defense in the trial of the case, and that Article 216 of the Revised Penal Code 
is still a good law, effective and applicable to department heads, like 
appellee, because there is no inconsistency between said article of the penal 
code snd the provisions of Article VII, Section 11, paragraph 2 of the 
Philippine Constitution. </p>
<p>On July 17, 1959 appellant Judge issued an order denying the motion to quash, 
which reads thus:</p>
<p>"The last motion to quash filed by the defense raises fundamental question's 
which, in the opinion of the Court, cannot be decided properly intelligently and 
adequately without presentation of evidence. </p>
<p>"The Court likewise reserves its decision as to whether the provisions of 
Art. 216 of the Revised penal Code for the violation of which the herein accused 
is prosecuted, are repugnant to and inconsistent with the provisions of Art. 
VII, Section 11, paragraph 2 of the Constitution of the Philippines.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the motion to quash is hereby denied, and the arraignment of the 
accused is set on July 25, 1959, at 10:00 A.M.</p>
<p>So ordered."</p>
<p>"Appellee filed a motion for reconsideration of said order, which motion was 
denied by appellant Judge in an order of August 1, 1959. </p>
<p>On August 12, 1959, appellee filed with the Court of Appeals, a petition for 
prohibition and/or mandamus, with prayer for the issuance of a writ of 
preliminary injunction. In support of tins petition for mandamus, it is alleged 
that respondent Judge acted without or in excess of his jurisdiction or with 
grave abuse of discretion in issuing the two orders complained of and in not 
having quashed the information on the ground that the provisions of Article 216 
of the Revised Penal Code do not apply and were rendered inoperative as to a 
department head, such a petitioner, by virtue of Article VII, Section 11, 
paragraph 2 of the Philippine Constitution. And as regard the petition for 
mandamus, it is alleged that respondent Judge neglected the performance of a 
duty specifically enjoined on him by his office under Section 6, Rule 113 of the 
Rules of Court, in not resolving herein appellee's motion to quash of June 15, 
1959 and in deferring in effect until after trial on the merits his resolution 
on the fundamental questions raised therein as per the order of July 17, 1959, 
reaffirmed by him in the order of August 1, 1959. </p>
<p>In their answer of September 2, 1959, appellants alleged that, contrary to 
the appellee's charge, appellant Judge acted within his jurisdiction and without 
grave abuse of discretion in denying the appellee's motion to quash, for the 
reason that in the mind of appellant Judge, the motion raised fundamental 
questions which could not be resolved properly, intelligently, and adequately 
without presentation of evidence, especially that regarding the alleged implied 
repeal of Article 216 of the penal code by the Constitution insofar as 
department heads, chiefs of bureaus or offices and their assistants are 
concerned, the same not being indubitable considering the proposition advanced 
by Hermogenes Concepcion, Jr. that no consistency exists between the penal 
article and the constitutional provision and therefore the latter could not have 
impliedly repealed the former. Moreover, appellee has some other adequate remedy 
in law from the disputed order denying his motion to quash, and that is appeal 
in due time therefrom, following the ruling of this Honorable Court in several 
cases, the last of which is Eulogio Mill <i>vs.</i> Hon. Nicasio Yatco, 101 
Phil., 599., (54 O.. Gaz, No. 10, p. 3232) </p>
<p>On January 23, 1960, the Court of Appeals rendered, a decision issuing the 
writ of prohibition prayed for, annulling the orders complained of and directing 
respondents to desist from further proceeding in Criminal Case No. 47152 of 
respondent Court on the ground that Article 216 of the Revised Penal Code had 
been rendered inoperative by Article VII, Section 11, paragraph 2 of the 
Philippine Constitution as regard heads of departments, and chiefs of bureaus or 
offices and their assistants. </p></blockquote>
<p>Disagreeing with the above ruling of the Court of Appeals, herein petitioners 
have elevated the same to this Court contending that the Court of Appeals erredâ€”</p><table style="width: 618px; height: 170px;" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0">

<p>It is the view of this Court that a resolution of the third assignment of 
error should be accorded priority inasmuch as a finding that the writ should not 
have been issued in the first place would render a ruling on the first two 
assigned errors premature at this stage of the proceeding. </p>
<p>We declare the Court of Appeals in error when it issued the writ of 
prohibition here complained of.</p>
<p>One of the more profound doctrines of procedural jurisprudence is that which 
allows the issuance of prohibitive writs only upon a showing of lack or excess 
of jurisdiction or of authority, or, grave abuse of discretion on the part of an 
inferior tribunal, corporation, board or person. (Rule 67, Sec. 2, Rules of 
Court; Aglipay <i>vs.</i> Ruiz, 64 Phil. 201; Reyes et al. <i>vs.</i> The Hon. 
Guillermo Romero et al., G. R. No. L-14917, May 31, 1961; 42 Am. Jurs. Sec. 5, 
pp. 140-141; Livingston <i>vs.</i> Wyatt, 186 N.Y. 383). The reason for the 
aforestated rule is not difficult to discern. In the exercise of discretion, 
inferior tribunals, corporations, boards or persons should be allowed some 
latitude of independence, a freedom of movement and judgment consistent with the 
trust reposed on them by law or regulation to mediate over specific disputes. If 
every act or ruling of them were to be subjected to the scrutiny and 
re-examination of a superior tribunal, and, in every instance must be reconciled 
with the views of the reviewing body, then the administration of justice will 
greatly be hampered. The discretion of lower tribunals will then bet but a work, 
not a reality .</p>
<p>Thus, We have always adhered to the standard that for grave abuse of 
discretion to prosper as a ground for prohibition, it must be first demonstrated 
that there was such a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is 
equivalent to lack of jurisdiction (Abad Santos <i>vs.</i> Province of Tarlac, 
67 Phil. 480; Bibby de Padilla <i>vs.</i> Horrilleno, 60 Phil. 511; Alafriz 
<i>vs.</i> Nable, 72 Phil. 278). Similarly, We have ruled that there is "excess 
of jurisdiction" where the court has jurisdiction but has transcended the same 
or acted without any statutory authority (Leung Ben <i>vs.</i> O'Brien, 38 Phil. 
182; Salvador Campos y Cia <i>vs.</i> Del Rosario, 41 Phil. 45). In other words, 
prohibition ought he issued only after the reviewing tribunal shall have 
convinced itself that the lower court has exercised its power "in an arbitrary 
or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and it must be so 
patent and gross as to amount to an evasion or to a virtual refusal to perform 
the duty enjoined or to act in contemplation of law (Tavera-Luna, Inc. 
<i>vs.</i> Nable, 67 Phil. 340). </p>
<p>Considering the above discussion, We cannot concur with the conclusion of the 
Court of Appeals regarding the conduct of the herein respondent judge. A cursory 
reading of the Order complained of shows how, on the contrary, he had cautioned 
himself against acting arbitrarily, despotically or whimsically. The same Order 
precisely reflects a deep sense of justice and mature exercise of discretion on 
the part of the respondent Judge when it recognized that the motion to quash 
filed by the defendant "raises fundamental questions which, * * * * cannot be 
decided properly, intelligently and adequately without presentation of 
evidence." </p>
<p>Furthermore, there is no exigency in this instant proceeding which would 
justify a disregard for the time-honored rule that prohibition is granted only 
where no other remedy is available which is sufficient to afford redress (III 
Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, p. 174). For this particular case, We 
hold the view that the observation of the City Fiscal that "the obvious and only 
remedy available to the appellee is appeal in due time from the decision that 
the appellant Court might render in the case" is valid and well taken. And, as 
the herein respondent has another and complete remedy at law either by appeal or 
otherwise. We need proceed no further to justify the lifting of the writ issued 
by the Court of Appeals. </p>
<p>As originally intimated, a ruling on the first two assignments of error would 
be premature at this stage. Wherefore, the writ of prohibition issued by the 
Court of Appeals is hereby lifted and this case is remanded to the lower court 
for a continuance of the suspended proceedings. Costs against appellee. </p>
