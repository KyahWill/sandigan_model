				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner Vicente Dichoso filed with the Court of First Instance of Cagayan 
a petition, which was amended on February 18, 1960, for quo warranto with 
mandatory injunction and damages against respondents Leandro Valdepeñas, 
Apolonio Reyes (as municipal mayor of Tuguegarao, Cagayan), and Vicente Tamayao 
alleging, <i>inter alia</i>, that he is a civil service eligible and is the 
Chief of Police of Tuguegarao, having been appointed to said (position effective 
January 16, 1959, with a compensation of P1740 per annum; that on <i>October 28, 
1959</i>, then Mayor Natividad of Tuguegarao extended to him a promotional 
appointment of permanent regular Chief of Police of Tuguegarao effective <i>July 
1, 1959</i>, with a salary of P1,920 per annum, which appointment was duly 
attested by the Provincial Treasurer of Cagayan (as deputy of the Commissioner 
of Civil Service), as required by Section 20 of Republic Act No. 2260; that on 
January 10, 1960, while he was in the performance of his duties as Chief of 
Police, respondent Valdepeñas usurped and unlawfully assumed his position, and 
illegally exercised the functions thereof; that as a result of said usurpation, 
petitioner was deprived of his functions as Chief of Police; that respondent 
Valdepeñas acts of usurpation caused petitioner moral damages in the sum of 
P5,000.00 and to incur P1,000.00 as attorney's fees; that respondent Mayor 
Reyes, on January 7, 1960 appointed respondent Valdepeñas as Chief of Police, in 
violation of the provisions of Republic Act No. 2260; that upon the filing of 
the present petition respondent Valdepeñas resigned as Chief of Police and, 
thereafter, respondent Mayor Reyes appointed respondent Tamayao illegally to 
said position; that the municipal council of Tuguegarao refused to approve said 
appointments made by respondent Mayor Reyes; that respondent Tamayao is 
illegally exercising the functions of Chief of Police, to the prejudice of the 
people of Tuguegarao, and his acts amount to usurpation of petitioner's official 
functions as the lawful Chief of Police of Tuguegarao; and that the act of 
respondent Mayor Reyes in appointing respondent Tamayao caused petitioner to 
suffer moral damages in the sum of P5,000.00. Petitioner prayed that judgment be 
rendered declaring petitioner the lawful Chief of Police of Tuguegarao; 
declaring respondent Valdepeñas guilty of usurpation from January 6 to 31, 1960 
and declaring the latter's acts during said period invalid; declaring the 
appointments of respondents Valdepeñas and Tamayao illegal; ordering the 
immediate ouster of respondent Tamayao as Chief of Police of Tuguegarao; 
ordering the payment of P5,000.00 damages by respondents Valdepeñas and Mayor 
Reyes and P5,000.00 damages by respondents Mayor Reyes' and Tamayao; ordering 
respondents jointly and severally to pay petitioner P1,000.00 as attorney's 
fees; and restraining respondent Mayor Reyes from making any further appointment 
to the position of Chief of Police pending decision of the petition.
<p>To this petition, respondents filed an answer denying the illegal acts 
imputed to them and alleging, as special defenses, that petitioner is unfit to 
discharge police duties due to his previous convictions and mental illness; that 
petitioner's appointment as Chief of Police terminated on December 31, 1959, in 
accordance with the attestation of the Commissioner of Civil Service; that 
petitioner's character and temperament do not permit him to hold the position of 
Chief of Police; that respondent Mayor Reyes has no confidence in petitioner; 
that respondent Valdepeñas is duly qualified to assume the duties of Chief of 
Police, being a major in the reserve force of the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines, and having previously served as provincial commander of Cotabato 
and Sorsogon; that respondent Tamayao is likewise duly qualified having twice 
passed the examinations for Chief of Police and Patrolman given by the Civil 
Service; and that respondent Tamayao is senior to petitioner in matters of 
appointment. Respondents prayed for the dismissal of the petition.</p>
<p>Issues having been joined, the case was tried and thereafter, the court on 
July 18, 1960, dismissed the petition and declared as legal the appointments of 
respondents Valdepeñas and Tamayao, in a decision which in part reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The evidence on record shows that the petitioner was not at all removed from 
the government service, as can be seen from Exhibit I of the petitioner (Exhibit 
5 of the respondents). Exhibit I clearly states that the petitioner's services 
as chief of police has already been terminated, and that he should assume his 
former duties as patrolman of the police department of Tuguegarao. In other 
words, the herein petitioner was only returned to his former position as 
patrolman, to which he is qualified. He cannot, therefore, claim that he was 
unlawfully removed from the government service.</p>
<p>"Exhibits 1, 10-A, 11, 12, 12-A, and 12-B of the respondents corroborate the 
allegations of the respondent Mayor Reyes that the petitioner herein was only 
acting as Chief of Police in a temporary capacity, and that his services as 
such, terminated as of December 31, 1959. We quote herein pertinent portions of 
Exhibit 10-A: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>'* * * Moreover, it appears from the appointee's information sheet that, for 
slight physical injuries, he was fined P5.00 without imprisonment. However, for 
services actually rendered, the said appointment may be authorized under Section 
3 of Civil Service Rule VI, the last, up to June 18, 1959, and approved 
effective June 19, 1959 to continue but not beyond December 31, 1959.' 
</p></blockquote>
<p>"The municipal mayor is the highest executive official in the municipality 
and, as such, he is empowered by law to appoint minor officials and employees. 
He has, therefore, the discretion to appoint men of his confidence to work with 
him.</p>
<p>"In this particular case, Mayor Reyes acted within his power and discretion 
when he appointed Major Leandro Valdepeñas. The appointment extended to Vicente 
Tamayao and, likewise, within the power and discretion of said respondent Mayor. 
As such mayor of Tuguegarao, he also has the power and discretion to return the 
herein petitioner Vicente Dichoso to his former position as patrolman. Officials 
having the power to appoint should be given wider latitude in selecting their 
subordinates, because the success of their administration depends partly, if not 
widely, upon the cooperation of their subordinates. Thus, it was held in the 
case of Jimenez vs. Francisco, et.al., 100 Phil., 1025; 53 Off. Gaz. 4804 
that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'The power to appoint is in essense discretionary on the part of the proper 
authority. * * * The appointing power has the right of choice which he may 
exercise freely according to his judgment, deciding for himself who is hest 
qualified for any competitive position in the Civil Service. Mere certification 
as a civil service eligible, does not amount to an appointment. The Civil 
Service Commissioner does not issue an appointment; it only certifies an 
eligible to be possessed of qualification; as required for a position classified 
under its rules.'</p></blockquote>
<p>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the Court hereby pronounces judgment 
dismissing the petitioner's petition for <i>quo warranto</i> with mandatory 
injunction and damages against the herein respondents, and declaring as legal 
the appointments extended by the herein respondent Mayor in favor of Major 
Leandro Valdepeñas and Vicente Tamayao, without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
<p>"SO ORDERED."</p></blockquote>
<p>From this decision, petitioner appealed directly to us.</p>
<p>The only issue for determination in this case is whether appellant's ouster 
from his position as Chief of Police of Tuguegarao was legal.</p>
<p>The records disclose that on October 28, 1959, then Mayor Natividad of 
Tuguegarao extended to appellant a promotional appointment (effective July 1, 
1959), with a compensation of 11,920 per annum (Exh. B). Said appointment was 
duly attested by the Provincial Treasurer of Cagayan, as deputy of the 
Commissioner of Civil Service, pursuant to Section 20<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] </sup>of Republic Act No. 2260. The records also 
show that when said appointment was extended to him, appellant was a civil 
service eligible, having passed the Patrolman examination (with a general 
average of 77.78%), given by the Civil Service at Tuguegarao, on October 27, 
1956, as shown by the Report of Ratings dated April 16, 1959 (Exh. A). Being a 
civil service eligible, appellant can not be ousted from his position of Chief 
of Police, except on the grouncte provided in Section 1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of Republic Act No. 557. (Mission vs. Del 
Rosario, 94 Phil., 483; 50 Off. Gaz. 1571; see also Abella vs. Rodriguez, 95 
Phil., 289; Uy vs. Rodriguez, 95 Phil., 493; Quintos vs. Lacson, 97 Phil., 290; 
51 Off. Gaz. 3429; and Diaz vs. Amante, 104 Phil., 968; 55 Off. Gaz. 8643) In 
the <i>Mission</i> case, we said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It appearing that petitioners, as detectives or members of the police force 
of Cebu City, were separated from the service not for any of the grounds 
enumerated in Republic Act No. 557, and without the benefit of investigation or 
trial therein prescribed, the conclusion is inescapable that their removal is 
illegal and of no valid effect."</p></blockquote>
<p>Appellees argue that the attestation by the Provincial Treasurer of Cagayan 
of petitioner's appointment dated October 28, 1959 pursuant to Section 20 of 
Republic Act No. 2260 did not make his appointment permanent, as it was still 
subject to correction or revision by the Commissioner of Civil Service within 
180 days from the latter's receipt thereof. But appellant's ouster took place on 
January 6, 1960 (Exh. I), or 2 months and 9 days only from his appointment on 
October 28, 1959, and there is iio pretense that the Commissioner did revise or 
correct said appointment during such period. In fact, the 180-day period within 
which the Commissioner may revise or correct said appointment has not yet 
elapsed at the time of appellant's ouster. In fairness to appellant, appellee 
Mayor Reyes should have awaited the action of the Commissioner on said 
appointment, and only after its correction or revision should he have acted 
against appellant. Note that the law does not require the action of the 
Commissioner in order to make the appointment made by the municipal mayor 
effective. On the contrary the appointment is, according to the provision of 
Section 20, "effective upon issuance" thereof, and "upon attestation by the 
provincial treasurer," subject only to the resolutory condition by way of 
correction or revision thereof by the Commisisoner within 180 days after the 
apointments' submission to him. And the records do not show any such correction 
or revision.</p>
<p>Appellees capitalize on the action taken by the Commissioner of Civil Service 
on appellant's previous appointments as Desk Sergeant (effective Dec. 1, 1957), 
as Police Lieutenant (effective March 1, 1958), as Police Lieutenant (effective 
July 1, 1958), and <i>as Chief of Police</i> (<i>effective Jan. 16, 1959</i>). 
[See Exhs. F and 10], wherein the Commissioner authorized said appointments 
"under Section 3 of Civil Service Rule VI, the last, up to June 18, 1959, and 
approved effective June 19,1959, to continue but not beyond December 31, 1959". 
But the appellees and the lower court overlooked the fact that at the time such 
appointments were made, appellant was not yet a civil service eligible and, for 
that reason, said appointments are deemed temporary in nature and terminable by 
action of the Commissioner of Civil Service by limiting the period of their 
effectivity subject to the requirements of the service. But appellant's last 
promotional appointment extended to him on October 28, 1959 (Exh. B), was made 
and attested on the strength of his eligibility certified by the Civil Service 
on April 16, 1959 (Exhs. A &amp; B). Appellant, therefore, became entitled to 
the protection of civil service law and rules, specifically, of Republic Act No. 
557, which prohibits the removal or suspension of members of the municipal 
police force except for the grounds enumerated in Section 1 therein.</p>
<p>Appellees also contend that appellant's appointment of October 28, 1959 is 
not permanent in nature, but merely probationary under Section 24 (<i>b</i>) of 
Republic Act No. 2260<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and, for that 
reason, he was subject to removal from his position of Chief of Police. But 
under said provision, a probationer may be dropped from the service only for 
"unsatisfactory conduct" or "want of capacity", and there is no showing that 
appellant was removed for said causes. On the contrary, it appears from 
appellee-mayor's own letter of January 6, 1960 (Exhs. 1 &amp; 5) terminating 
appellant's services as "Acting" Chief of Police, that the mayor expressly 
recognized appellant's "efficient administration" of the police force during his 
incumbency.</p>
<p>Furthermore the appointment of respondent Tamayao was not approved by the 
Municipal Council as required in Section 1 of Republic Act No. 1531 (t.s.n. p. 
27).</p>
<p>For all the foregoing, we hold that appellant's ouster as Chief of Police of 
Tuguegarao was illegal and unjustified and that the appointments extended by 
appellee Mayor Reyes to appellees Valdepeñas and Tamayao as Chief of Police, 
vice the appellant, are invalid.</p>
<p align="center">"* * * * * * *"</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed and appellee Mayor Apolonio 
Reyes is ordered to immediately reinstate appellant to his former position of 
Chief of Police of Tuguegarao and to pay his back salaries from the date of his 
ouster until he is reinstated. Appellee Tamayao is also directed to immediately 
vacate the position of Chief of Police and to refrain from exercising the 
functions appurtenant thereto. Appellee Mayor Reyes is ordered to pay appellant, 
under the circumstances, attorney's fees in the sum of P1,000.00 and the costs. 
So ordered.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.
