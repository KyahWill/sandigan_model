				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal stemmed from a decision of the Court of Appeals, promulgated on 
September 30, 1954, the pertinent portion of which reads:—
<blockquote>
<p>"In view of the foregoing, we are with the trial court in holding that the 
land in question belongs to the second conjugal partnership, so that one-half of 
it should pertain to Elias Naval's second wife, while the other half, which 
corresponds to the deceased Elias Naval,should be divided equally among his 
surviving children; Francisco, Concepcion, Serafin and Jose, all surnamed Naval. 
And it being understood that the shares of the children shall be subject to the 
usufruct of the surviving spouse as provided by law, the judgment appealed from 
is affirmed, without special pronouncement as to costs."</p></blockquote>
<p>The surviving spouse is Dolores Jonsay, defendant-appellant. In order to 
execute the judgment, the trial court on September 26, 1956, appointed Pantaleon 
Panelo as Commissioner to partition the property in question. Panelo, a duly 
certified Surveyor, made a survey of the property litigated, and submitted a 
report containing three "positions" (Rec. on Appeal, pp. 3-12), from which the 
parties and/or the Court might choose for the usufruct in favor of Dolores 
Jonsay. On March 8, 1957, after the Commissioner had rendered the report, the 
defendant Dolores Jonsay thru counsel, filed the following manifestation:—</p>
<blockquote>
<ol><li>That these portions chosen by the widow is in accordance with the concept 
and purpose of usufruct intended by law. 

<p></p></li><li>That portions designated on the first and second positions of the 
Commissioner's Sketch are without any improvements and are unproductive, hence 
to give any of these portions to the widow as her usufruct would not serve the 
purpose intended by law in giving usufruct to the widow a portion of the 
property of her deceased husband, where she could maintain or support herself 
during widowhood.<p></p> <p></p></li><li>That out of about 120 or more fruit-bearing coconuts found on the portions 
selected by the widow, only 80 trees are inside her portion and 40 trees are 
within the portions designated for the plaintiffs.<p></p> </li><li>That since the 120 fruit-bearing coconut trees were planted by the widow 
during her conjugal life with the father of the plaintiffs, it is but just that 
the portions where the 80 trees are found be given to her in usufruct." 
</li></ol></blockquote>
<p>The plaintiffs presented a counter-manifestation of the following tenor:—</p>
<blockquote>
<ol><li>
<p>That if the portion to be given to the widow in usufruct be that which is 
indicated in the first position, it will be to the best advantage of the parties 
and will be just to both of them; </p>
</li><li>
<p>That in accordance with this first position, the portion to be given to the 
widow in usufruct adjoins the portion adjudicated to her in ownership;</p>
</li><li>
<p>That on the contrary, if the third position is followed, plaintiffs will be 
sandwiched between the portion adjudicated to the widow in ownership and that to 
be adjudicated to her in usufruct; and this is very disadvantageous to the 
plaintiffs aside from the fact that it may be a source of friction between 
them;</p>
</li><li>
<p>That the portion which is being adjudicated to the widow in ownership is 
already the best portion of the whole parcel of land and to give her in usufruct 
that portion which is indicated in the third position, will be giving her double 
advantage over the plaintiffs;</p>
</li><li>
<p>That in fact, if the plaintiffs previously agreed to give to the widow the 
portion adjudicated to her in ownership, it was premised on a condition that the 
widow would renounce her usufruct, taking into consideration that the said 
portion adjudicated to her in ownership is, as we have already mentioned, the 
best and the most productive portion;</p>
</li><li>
<p>That it is not true that the portion being adjudicated in usufruct to the 
widow in accordance with the first position is unproductive because while there 
are no coconut trees thereon, the same is being dedicated to the planting of 
palay and in fact, the widow has, since the death of her husband until at 
present, been planting there and benefiting by the products thereof." 
</p></li></ol></blockquote>
<p>In her manifestation, it would appear that the defendant Dolores Jonsay 
preferred and chose the portions appearing in the Commissioner's report, 
designated as "third position", reasoning out that it was more in keeping with 
the concept and purpose of usufruct intended by law and it would be more 
beneficial to her. It would also appear that the plaintiffs in their 
counter-manifestation, claimed that the portions designated as first position in 
the Commissioner's report would be advantageous, beneficial and just to both 
parties.<br><br>On March 14, 1957, the lower court, without giving reasons 
therefor, promulgated an Order, giving as usufruct to Dolores Jonsay the 
portions of the land in question, marked as <i>first position</i> in the 
Commissioner's report. A motion for reconsideration was duly filed by Jonsay, 
pointing therein that the portions awarded to her are unproductive and at the 
same time intimated that she would present evidence in support of her contention 
anent the unproductiveness of the said portions. On March 28, 1957, this motion 
was denied, and an appeal was taken by defendant Jonsay to the Court of Appeals, 
which certified the same to this Court.<br><br>Appellant Dolores Jonsay alleges 
that the trial court erred: (1) In disregarding the choice made by her of the 
portion designated as third position in the Commissioner's report, as her 
usufruct; (2) in decreeing to her as her usufruct the portion designated on the 
sketch of the Commissioner as first position in the said report; and (3) in not 
giving her the opportunity to present evidence to prove that the portion decreed 
to her as her usufruct was unproductive and not beneficial to her.<br><br>In a 
nutshell the alleged errors converge on only one issue, that is, the legality of 
the trial court's order awarding to appellant Jonsay that which the appellees 
wanted, and not what she (appellant) had chosen.<br><br>The case was conducted 
solely on the plane of pleadings, motions and manifestations. No formal hearing 
was held; and no testimonial or documentary proofs were produced or presented by 
the parties, except the Commissioner's report. It is thus seen that before the 
trial court could properly determine which portion should be given or awarded to 
the appellant widow as her usufruct, the parties should have been given 
opportunity to present evidence, to support their respective contentions, 
specially on the allegation of appellant Jonsay that the portion designated as 
first position given to her was not advantageous, beneficial and just, because 
it was unproductive and it violates the concept and purpose of usufruct intended 
by law for her, more so when the said defendant-appellant had asked for an 
opportunity to do so.<br><br>Considering, therefore, that the decision of the 
trial court should be based upon facts proven therein, and not upon conflicting 
manifestations, the truth of which can not be ascertained without the adduction 
of proofs, the Orders dated March 14, 1957, and March 28, 1957, respectively, 
are hereby reversed, and another entered, remanding the case to the trial court 
for further proceedings. With costs to the 
plaintiffs-appellees.<br><br><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, 
Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, De Leon,</i> and <i>Natividad, 
JJ.,</i> concur.</p></div>
