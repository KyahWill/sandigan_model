				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal by way of <i>certiorari</i> from the decision of
the Court of Appeals of <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="8">August 31,
 1966</st1:date> in CA -G. R. 35593-R, de­nying a petition for a writ of <i>certiorari</i>
brought against an order of the Court of Agrarian Relations, Branch III of the
Third Regional District at <span class="SpellE">lba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This latter order, promulgated on October 1,
1964 in CAR 5666-R-Z-55, set aside an earlier order of the same court denying a
motion for a writ of <span class="GramE">execution</span> of the final judgment
in the said CAR<span style=""> </span>case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The following findings of
the Court of Appeals are not dis­puted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In CAR Case No. 5666-R-Z of the Court of Agrarian Relations
of <span class="SpellE">Iba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, Mateo <span class="SpellE">Casela</span>, the petitioner herein, was the defendant, and <span class="SpellE">Exequiel</span> <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>, now one of
the respon­dents, the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
October 26, 1956, after due trial, the said Court decided the case against the
defendant, who was ordered ejected; and de­cision thereon having become final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> the Court on August 12, 1957, issued a
writ of exe­cution commanding the defendant to vacate the pre­mises and remove
his house <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The defen­dant, however, refused to comply with the said writ; so, the
Court issued another writ on May 6, 1958, and <span class="GramE">still</span>
another on April 14, 1959.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Instead of obeying the writ, however, the defendant
instituted Civil Case No. 2142 before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> asking that the plaintiff be condemned to pay him
the value of his house in the amount of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
improve­ments of P2,000.00, in addition to damages in the sum of
P1,600.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, the
defendant filed a motion for suspension of the implementa­tion of the writ of
execution pending the final out­come of the said civil case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Against this motion for suspension, the
plaintiff filed a countermotion to declare the defendant and the provincial
Sheriff in contempt of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing
the respective motions of the parties, the Court granted the defendant's motion
for suspension until after the said Civil Case No. 2142 would have been
disposed of on the merits.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Civil Case No. 2142 eventually reached the Court of Appeals,
which, on October 6, 1965, rendered a decision dismissing the defendant's
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said decision, the appellate
Court ruled once and for all that the claims of the defendant for in­demnity
for the value of his house and improvements were in the nature of compulsory
counterclaims that should have been pleaded before the agrarian court and not
in the Court of First Instance where they were brought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the plaintiff could not be
compelled to pay said claims and the demolition of the defendant's house could
be done without pay­ment of indemnity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By reason of this categorical pronouncement of the Court of Appeals,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> filed a motion dated December 6,
1963 and another dated February 11, 1964 praying for the issuance of an alias
writ of execution attaching there­to a copy of the appealed decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The agrarian court, however, in an order
dated March 5, 1964, denied the motion, holding that its decision dated October
26, 1956 could no longer be executed on mere motion for the reason that a period
of five (5) years had already elapsed from the said date.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1964</st1:date>,
the plaintiff moved for <span class="GramE">a reconsideration</span> of the order
of denial of <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1964</st1:date>;
this was granted by the Court in its order of <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1964</st1:date>, which forthwith directed the execution
of its judgment of <st1:date year="1956" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1956</st1:date>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">That the decision of October 26, 1956 of the Court of Agra­rian
Relations became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> on December 17,
1956, is not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counting five years from December 17, 1956,
the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Exequiel</span> <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>
had until December 17, 1961 within which to move for execution of the said
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would thus appear that
Magsaysay’s<span style=""> </span>motion for execution
of December 11, 1963, having been filed beyond the five-year <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, was time-barred.</p>

<p class="BODY">The peculiar circumstances of this case, however, would, to our
mind, indicate that the said motion for execution was filed on time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record indubitably shows that <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> had per­sistently and consistently moved the
court to execute the decision of October 26, 1956 which became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> on Decem­ber 17, 1956.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In point of fact he succeeded in securing a
writ of execution for no less than three times, which writs were however <span style="">not executed because of the stubborn refusal
of the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Casela</span> to vacate the premises and
because of the lower court's order sustaining <span class="SpellE">Casela's</span>
motion for suspension of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magsay­say</span> obtained a writ of execution as early as August
12, 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was not served on account
of <span class="SpellE">Casela's</span> refusal to comply with the writ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay's</span>
motion, the court issued an <u>alias</u> writ on April 14, 1959, which writ
explicitly directed the sheriff to eject <span class="SpellE">Casela</span> and
to demolish the latter's house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
second writ was however not implemented because the court, upon <span class="SpellE">Casela's</span> own motion, ordered the suspension of the writ two
times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first suspension was <span class="GramE">effected</span> by order of September 22, 1959 and lasted until
April 22, 1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This </span><span style="">suspension </span><span style="">was occasioned by the <span class="SpellE">pen­dency</span>
of civil case 2142 between <span class="SpellE">Casela</span> and <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> before the <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>
Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second
suspension, which was effected by the lower court's order of </span><st1:date year="1960" day="11" month="7"><span style="">July 11,
 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, lasted until </span><st1:date year="1963" day="6" month="10"><span style="">October
 6, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These two suspensions which all told co­vered
a period of three years, nine months and twenty-five days were granted on
motions of <span class="SpellE">Casela</span>, to await the final disposition of
civil case 2142.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It thus appears that <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> had not
incurred in the least delay in the enforcement of the judgment which had become
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He exhausted all legal means within his po­wer to eject <span class="SpellE">Casela</span> from his land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the writs of execution is­sued <span style="">by </span>the lower court were not complied with and/or were sus­pended
by reason of acts or causes not of <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay's</span> own
making and against his objections.</p>

<p class="BODY">From <st1:date year="1956" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1956</st1:date>
when the decision <span style="">in </span>question
became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, to <st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1963</st1:date>, the date when <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay's</span> motion for execution was filed, a period <span style="">of six </span>years,
eleven months and twenty-four days elapsed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From this period must be subtracted the time during which <span style="">the writs </span>of
exe­cution could not be served, or a period of three years, nine months and
twenty-five days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, only
three years, one month and twenty-nine days can be charged against the
five-year <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Undoubtedly, therefore, <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay'<span style="">s</span></span><span style=""> </span>motion for
execution of <st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1963</st1:date>
was filed well within the five-year <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period.</p>

<p class="BODY">Conscience and equity should always be considered <span style="">in </span>the
construction of statutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The courts are
not to be hedged in by the literal meaning of the language of the statute; the
spirit and intendment thereof must prevail over its letter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This rule of construction is especially
applicable where adherence <span style="">to the let</span>ter of the statute would result in absurdity and
injustice.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">ACCORDINGLY</span></b><span style="">, the judgment of the Court of appeals of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="8"><span style="">August
 31, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, which
upheld the order of the Court of Agrarian Relations of </span><st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="10"><span style="">October
