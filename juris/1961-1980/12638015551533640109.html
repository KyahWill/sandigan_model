<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is an appeal by Francisco G. 
<span class="SpellE">Aleja</span>, et al., from the decision of the Court of First 
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> (in 
Civil Case No. 3335) dismissing their complaint against the Government Service 
Insurance System (GSIS) and denying their claim to the proceeds of the insurance 
policy No. 310973 issued to the late <span class="SpellE">Rosauro</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Aleja</span>, on the ground that the deceased was not covered by 
insurance at the time of his death. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As found by the lower court, the 
deceased <span class="SpellE">Rosauro</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Aleja</span> 
was appointed as temporary classroom teacher in the Bureau of Public Schools, 
Division of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, on 
July 8, 1958. Thereafter, a compulsory term insurance policy, No. 310973, was 
issued in his name, said policy to take effect on </span><st1:date month="2" day="1" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 1, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. The 
corresponding premium <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> was deducted for the 
first time from his salary on </span><st1:date month="1" day="31" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 31, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
However, two days before that or on </span><st1:date month="1" day="29" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 29, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
while guarding the rice stack in front of their house, <span class="SpellE">Rosauro</span> <span class="SpellE">Aleja</span> died of a gunshot 
wound inflicted by his own gun. Plaintiffs, as beneficiaries named in the 
policy, filed a claim with the GSIS to collect the proceeds of the said policy, 
but the same was denied allegedly because at the time of <span class="SpellE">Aleja's</span> death, the policy was not yet effective and the 
latter was, therefore, not covered by insurance. <span class="GramE">Hence, the 
institution of this case and the consequent promulgation of the decision by the 
lower court which is the subject of the Present appeal.</span> 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In denying plain 
tiffs-appellants' claim, the GSIS contends although <span class="SpellE">Aleja</span> became a permanent employee and entitled to membership 
in the System 6 months after his original appointment, or on January 8, 1959, 
yet as specified in the policy issued to him, the same shall become effective 
only on February 1, 1959. And this latter date was fixed in accordance with the 
provisions of Commonwealth Act 186, as amended by Republic Act 660, which read: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"SEC. 
4.<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Scope of application of 
System</span></em>.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (a) Membership to the System 
shall be compulsory upon all regularly and permanently appointed employees, 
including those whose tenure of office is fixed or limited by law; upon all 
teachers except only those who are substitutes; * * *. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"SEC. 
8.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">a</span></em>) <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Compulsory membership insurance</span></em>. n 
employee whose membership in the System is compulsory shall be automatically 
insured on the first day of the seventh calendar month following the month he 
was appointed or on the first day of the sixth calendar month if the date of his 
appointment is the first day of the month: Provided, That his medical 
examination, if required, has been approved by the System." 
<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> that the deceased had rendered services to the 
government for 6 months and 21 days before his death; that he was insured and in 
fact a policy was already issued in his favor at the time of his death; that the 
date fixed for the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of said policy was made 
pursuant to the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> provisions of the GSIS 
Charter. Appellants, however, maintain that section 8 of Commonwealth Act 186, 
insofar as it fixes the date of compulsory membership therein, is absurd and 
discriminatory, in that, whereas those whose appointments are dated on the first 
day of the month become covered by insurance on the first day of the sixth month 
following their appointment, those who were appointed on other dates become 
insured only on the first day of the seventh calendar month from their original 
appointment. In other words, if an employee is appointed on January 1, he will 
be covered by insurance on June 1, whereas one who gets appointed on January 2 
becomes insured only on July 1. This arrangement, appellants claim, was made 
only to facilitate office transactions or for office procedure, and should not 
be construed to defeat the purpose for which the System was established i.e., to 
promote the welfare of the employees. It is, therefore, urged that the coverage 
of compulsory insurance should commence on the date when the employee becomes 
entitled to membership in the System, or upon completion of six months 
service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It may be admitted that as thus 
worded, the disputed provision makes a distinction, in the matter of <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> the service on the first day of the month and 
those who of their insurance coverage, between those appointed to receive their 
appointments on any other date. But classification or class legislation, 
assuming this to be one, does not <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ipso 
facto</span></em> make a statutory provision invalid. Classification will not 
constitute an infringement of the individual's right to constitutional 
guarantees of equality if it is not unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious. To be 
reasonable, the classification must be based on substantial distinctions which 
make real differences; must be germane to the purposes of the law; must not be 
limited to existing conditions only, and must apply equally to each member of 
the class, under similar conditions<span class="GramE">.<sup><span style="color: red;">[</span></sup></span><sup><span style="color: red;">1]</span></sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the instant case, it may be 
true that the disputed provision must have been incorporated in the law to 
promote efficiency and convenience in office procedure of the System. Taking 
into account the volume of business that the System handles, the providing of 
this measure which ultimately may redound to the benefit of the members in the 
form of efficient and prompt <span class="GramE">service,</span> cannot be 
considered capricious or arbitrary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Furthermore, it appears that the 
policy issued and accepted by <span class="SpellE">Aleja</span> during his 
lifetime specifically provides that the effective date of the insurance contract 
is </span><st1:date month="2" day="1" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 1, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
Additionally, it is not denied that the first premium on said insurance contract 
was deducted from <span class="SpellE">Aleja's</span> salary only on 
</span><st1:date month="1" day="31" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 31, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> or 
after his death. Clearly, at the time of his said death, there Lacuna vs. Board 
of Liquidators, et al. was no existing contract between him and the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> GSIS, there being no consideration for the risk 
sought to be enforced against the insurance system. The offer of the latter to 
refund the amount collected after <span class="SpellE">Aleja's</span> death, is 
proper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision of the lower court 
appealed from is hereby modified in the sense that the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> shall return to the plaintiffs the amount deducted 
from the deceased's salary in the form of premium. No costs. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">SO 
ORDERED.</span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
