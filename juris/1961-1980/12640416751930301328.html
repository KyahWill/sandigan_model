<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Direct appeal against a decision 
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, in a 
declaratory judgment suit (Civil Case No. 2317 of the court below) filed by 
petitioners-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, owners of factories producing 
"<span class="SpellE">bijon</span>" (rice spaghetti), to annul Resolution No. 10 
of the Rice and Com Board that declared that the "<span class="SpellE">bijon</span>" industry is included within the terms of Republic Act 
No. 3018, nationalizing the Rice and Corn Industry. At the original petitioners' 
behest, the court a quo issued a writ of preliminary injunction upon a bond of 
P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, which was duly accomplished and 
filed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The case was submitted to the 
court of origin upon an agreed stipulation of facts, reciting as follows: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">" '1. That petitioners were and 
are still owners and operators of the <span class="SpellE">Bijon</span> Factories 
in the province of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> Tons before the passage of 
Republic Act No. 3018 with licenses duly paid and issued in the name of each of 
the respective petitioners;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">" 
'2</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. That in 
the manufacture of <span class="SpellE">Bijon</span>, petitioners are using rice 
and/or corn as the principal ingredient;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">" 
'3</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. That in 
the year 1960, the Congress of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> passed a bill regulating the 
trade of. <span class="SpellE">palay</span>, rice and corn, which became and is 
now Republic Act No. 3018, and pursuant to said Act, the President of the 
Philippine created the Rice and Corn Board to implement and carry out the 
provisions of said Act and respondents are duly appointed and qualified members 
of the said Rice and Corn Board;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">" 
'4</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. That the 
Federation of Chinese Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines sent a letter dated 
September 20, 1960, to the Rice and Corn Board, requesting information as to 
whether or not the manufacturers and/or dealers in <span class="SpellE">bijon</span> or noodle corn starch and <span class="SpellE">gaugau</span>, rice, wine and poultry or chicken feed of other 
by-products of rice and corn are within the scope of the provisions of Republic 
Act No. 3018. Copy of said letter is attached hereto as Annex 
"A";<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">" 
'</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 5. That the 
respondents acting as members of the Rice and Corn Board ruled that the 
processing of rice and/or corn or its by-products are included in the aforesaid 
Republic Act No. 3018 and the petitioners are within the purview of the said 
Act, in a letter dated January 3, 1961, signed by its Acting Executive Director, 
<span class="SpellE">Efren</span> V. Mendoza, copy of which letter is attached 
hereto as Annex "B‚Äù;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">" '6. That although under 
Republic Act No. 3018, Section 2 thereof, persons who are not citizens of the 
Philippines and associations, partnerships or corporations the capital or 
capital stock of which is not wholly owned by citizens of the Philippines, who 
are engaged and duly licensed to engage in the rice and/or corn industry, as of 
the date of the approval of the law, shall file their statement of ownership, 
assets and liabilities with the proper office within 60 days from the approval 
thereof, that is, August 2, 1960; the respondent members of the Rice and Corn 
Board however have extended the period of filing of applications for permit to 
continue operation of aliens in the rice and corn industry up to January 31, 
1961;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">" '7. That petitioners filed" 
their present petition with this Court on January 25, 1961, with a prayer for a 
writ of preliminary injunction pending the determination of the present petition 
on the merits which was granted on said day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">" '8. That petitioners and 
respondents submit for determination of the issues as to whether Republic Act 
No. 3018 is applicable to the <span class="SpellE">bijon</span> industry, operated 
and owned by the petitioners as alleged in paragraph 1 of the complaint;' 
"<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The lower court found for the 
petitioners, and declared that Republic Act No. 3018 did not include "<span class="SpellE">bijon</span>" manufacturers, because the latter did not deal in 
rice or corn or any of its by-products, and made its injunction permanent. <span class="GramE">Whereupon, the Rice and Corn Board, through the Solicitor General, 
appealed directly to this Court on points of law.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We agree with the Solicitor 
General that this case for declaratory judgment should have been dismissed for 
several reasons. In the first place, from the time the Rice and Corn Board 
issued a ruling that the petitioners-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> were 
covered by the terms of Republic Act No. 3018, the way was open for said 
petitioners to appeal the Board's ruling its administrative superiors, and 
thereafter institute an ordinary judicial action to contest the Board's ruling 
and prohibit it from enforcing the ruling. This Court has repeatedly ruled that 
the remedy of declaratory judgment is proper only if adequate relief is not 
available through other existing forms of action or proceeding (<span class="SpellE">Ollada</span> vs. Central Bank, 115 Phil., 284; <span class="SpellE">Hoskyns</span> vs. National City Bank, of New York, 85 Phil. 201, 
cit. 1 C. J. S., 1027). As ruled in Elliott vs. American Manufacturing, Co., 138 
Fed. 2d, 678, courts are loath to interfere prematurely with administrative 
proceedings, and will not assume jurisdiction of declaratory judgment 
proceedings until administrative remedies have been exhausted<span class="GramE">.<sup><span style="color: red;">[</span></sup></span><sup><span style="color: red;">1]</span></sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">A second reason for denying 
relief is that the declaratory judgment herein sought would necessarily affect 
also other manufacturers and processors of rice and corn derivative products 
(such as <span class="SpellE"><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">gaw-gaw</span></em></span>, face powder, etc.), 
which were not represented in these proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the third place, it is also 
the rule in this jurisdiction that action for declaratory judgment must be 
brought before any breach of the statute or ordinance sought to be tested (Rules 
66, sec. 2; Santos vs. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, 94 Phil. 
65).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">But even if the declaratory 
judgment were proper, we believe that the facts stipulated are insufficient to 
warrant a verdict in this case. As observed in the appealed decision itself 
(Rec. App. p. 26), the avowed purpose of Republic Act No. 3018, as shown in the 
explanatory note to the original bill, was to do away with the possibility and 
practice of aliens creating artificial shortages of rice and corn by hoarding 
these commodities or cornering the market <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, so 
as to enable them to dictate prices thereof. It thus becomes a necessary point 
of inquiry whether or not the producers of derivatives, in which rice or corn is 
the main ingredient, could singly, or in combination with others, create an 
artificial scarcity of the cereals at any given time; and for that purpose, 
complete data of the consumption capacity of these producers are material. Such 
particulars are not available in the record before us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">FOR THE FOREGOING 
CONSIDERATIONS</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the judgment under appeal is 
reversed, and the action for declaratory judgment is ordered dismissed, without 
prejudice to other remedies as may be in law available to the parties. No 
costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
