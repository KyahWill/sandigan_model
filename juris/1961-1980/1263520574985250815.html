				<BR><STRONG>MAKALINTAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The only issue in this appeal, taken by the plaintiff in <u>forma</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>pauperis</u></span>, is whether or not the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, in
its Civil Case No. 4337, correctly dismissed the complaint, upon motion of the
defendant, on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff's allegations, which were deemed admitted for
purposes of the motion to dismiss, are as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the plaintiff was employed as a mechanic
by the defendant; that while the plaintiff was repairing <span style="">a </span>truck belonging to the defendant the
truck caught fire and ex­ploded, as <span style="">a </span>result
of which he suffered serious burns in different parts of his body; that the
defendant was immediately notified of the mishap, and its manager promised to
compensate him for the damages he sustained and to pay all the necessary
expenses for his treatment and hospitalization; that aside from the wages he
failed to earn because of his inability to engage in his usual work he paid
certain amounts for his confinement in <span style="">a
</span>hospital and for <span style="">the plastic
surgery he had to undergo; that the defendant's refusal to satisfy his claim
for compensation caused him mental suffering, for which he is entitled to moral
and exemplary damages; and that because he was compelled to seek the services
of legal counsel he </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">also entitled to recover attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant's motion to dismiss, which was granted by the trial
court, was based on the ground that the case involved a claim for compensation
under Act No. 3428 and hence pertained to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Work­men's Compensation Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
plaintiff, on the other hand, contended and now maintains in this appeal that
his claim is based on Article 1711 of the Civil Code and is therefore
cognizable by the Court of First Instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">We affirm the order of dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no material difference, insofar as the plaintiff's cause of
action is concerned, <span style="">between </span>the
provisions of the Work­men's Compensation Act, Section 2, and Article 1711 of
the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The compensable injury
referred to in both statutes is one that arises "out of and in the course
of the employment." Before the enactment of Republic Act No. 772 (amending
Act No. 3428), which took effect on June 20, 1952, claims for compensation
under the Workmen's Compensa­tion Act were cognizable by the regular courts,
but since then exclusive jurisdiction was vested in the Workmen's Compensation
Commission, <span style="">as </span>provided in
Section 46 of the amendatory law, which states:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 46.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u><span style="">Jurisdiction</span></u><span style="">.</span></span><span style=""> - </span>The Workmen's Compensation
Commissioner shall have juris­diction to hear and decide claims for com­pensation
under the Workmen's Compensation Act, subject to appeal to the Supreme
Court..."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In relation to Section
46, Section 5 must also be considered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Section provides that "the rights and remedies granted by this
Act to an employee by reason of a personal injury entitling him to compensation
shall exclude all other rights and remedies accruing to an employee, his
personal representatives, dependents or nearest of kin against the employer
under the Civil Code and other laws, because of said injury." These
provisions were applied by this Court in the case of <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>
vs. Foster Wheeler Corporation, et al., 98 Phil. 856, in sustaining the order
of the trial court dismissing an employee's claim for damages against the
employer for injuries suffered in an accident which happened in the course of
his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was there </span><span style="">said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">"The Legislature evidently deemed it
best, in the interest of expediency and uniformity, that all claims of workmen
against their employers for damages due to accidents suffered in the course of
employment shall be investigated and adjudicated by the Workmen's Compensation
Commission, subject to the appeal in the law provided."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It may of course happen that an employee may have claims against
his employer other than those re­coverable under the Workmen's Compensation
Act, in which case he should pursue his remedy in the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus in the case of <span class="SpellE">Pacana</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Autobus Co., 32 SCRA 442, where aside from
disability compensation the plaintiff sued for separation pay, sick leave,
vacation and overtime pay, we held that the order of the Court of First
Instance dis­missing the complaint on the ground of lack of jurisdiction was
erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, however,
the claims are for work disability by reason of the accident as well as for
medical, surgical and hospital services, all of which are provided for in the
Workmen's Compensation Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Insofar as the plaintiff's claim for moral and exemplary damages
is concerned, we do not find it sufficient to remove this case from the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Workmen's Compensation Commission, since a mere
refusal on the part of an employer to pay the employee's extra-­judicial claim
for compensation, as alleged in the complaint, is not a ground for the award of
such damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise there would be a
premium on the right to litigate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
following comments of Schneider are apropos:</p>

<blockquote>"Since the remedy provided <span style="">by </span>the compensation act <span style="">is
</span>exclusive as against the employer, the employee must pursue all rights
for enforcement of his claim under the statute, and he has no other
remedies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He may not maintain an action
ex <span class="SpellE">delicto</span> and for punitive damages because of the
alleged wrongful and wanton refusal of the employer to pay the compensation due
him."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">Wherefore</span></b><span style="">, the order appealed from is affirmed,
without pronouncement as to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
