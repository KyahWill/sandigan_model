				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">May a Court of First Instance assume jurisdiction over an action
to enforce a no-strike clause in a collective bargaining agreement, the
complaint setting forth that there was a threat of a strike, with two labor
federations engaged in a dispute over the affiliation of the local union,
which, if carried out, would be <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the
above clause?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge, the Hon.
Jose N. <span class="SpellE">Leuterio</span>, of the Court of First Instance of
Manila, answered in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court views the matter differently.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a petition for certiorari and prohibition with preliminary
injunction, dated January 15, 1968, petitioners being the Security Bank
Employees Union-NATU, hereinafter referred to as the Local Union, and Ruben <span class="SpellE">Puertollano</span>, who according to the petition, is its
president, it was stated that on October 20, 1967, the petitioner-union filed a
notice of strike with the Department of Labor, complaining of unfair labor
practices committed by the respondent Security Bank and Trust Co. against
petitioners and consisting of the following acts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"(1) Interference with, restraint and
coercion of employees in their rights to self-organization; and (2) Assistance
to and support of a labor organization favored by management."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came the assertion that on October 21, 1967, the respondent Bank in an
obvious attempt to invest the <span style="">Court of
First Instance of Manila, presided by respondent Judge, with jurisdiction over
the </span>labor dispute it had with petitioners, filed with said court a
complaint against petitioners for damages with preliminary injunction, alleging
that the filing of a strike notice<span style=""> by
petitioners on October 20, 1967 was <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the
existing Collective Bargaining Agreement.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The grievance of petitioners against respondent Judge is that
"in total disregard of repeated pronouncements and injunctions by this
Honorable Court against the grant of <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
injunctions and restraining orders in labor disputes, and acting without or in
excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of
jurisdiction," he issued <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
a restraining order prohibiting the defendants in that case, petitioners here,
from staging or continuing a strike or picketing "of whatever kind or
form, particularly, at plaintiff's main office at <span class="SpellE">Escolta</span>,
Manila," as well as any of its branches.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came the allegations that petitioners, on October 26, 1967, filed their
opposition to the issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction on the ground
of lack of jurisdiction on the part of the lower court as well as the fatally defective
character of the plea for injunction;<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
that on November 2, 1967, respondent Judge issued an order denying the
opposition of petitioners on the ground of the absence of a labor dispute;<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
that on the same date, upon receipt of such order of denial, petitioners filed
a motion for reconsideration;<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and that on November 8, 1967, respon­dent Bank filed its opposition to
petitioners motion for reconsideration.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court, however, in an order by respondent Judge dated
December 23, 1967, denied the motion for reconsideration of petitioners
principally on the ground that there was no labor dispute, a denial, which,
according to the petition, was "in complete disregard of [their]
constitutional rights * * *, more specifically the right to picket, * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came the order of January 3, 1968, modifying the writ of prelimi­nary
injunction issued by it on November 2, 1967, limiting it to a restraint on
"the defendants or their representative from picketing of whatever kind or
form until further orders by [it]."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The above actuations of respondent Judge according to the petition are
"without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion
amounting to lack of jurisdiction." The plea for preliminary injunction is
premised on the assertion that unless restrained, "respondent judge will
continue to enforce his arbitrary and high-handed orders restricting the
exercise by the petitioners of their Constitutional and legal rights respecting
their labor dispute with the respondent bank, which would work grave and
irreparable injustice to the petitioners; * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated January 24, 1968, the petition was given
due course with a restraining order being issued, respondents being given up to
January 31, 1968, to file an answer, and the hearing on the preliminary
injunction set for February 2, 1968.</p>

<p class="BODY">The answer of respondent Bank was filed on <st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the facts as alleged in the petition were in the main admitted,
there was a denial of petitioner <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Puertollano</span></st1:place></st1:city>
being the president of the Security Bank Employees Union and an assertion that
the notice of strike filed with the Department of Labor was his unauthorized
act not that of the Local Union.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
It sustained the jurisdiction of the lower court on the ground that there was
no labor dispute between respondent Bank and petitioners, "the dispute
being entirely between Ruben <span class="SpellE">Puertollano</span> on the one
hand and the majority officers and members of the Local Union on the other as
to which labor federation their local union would affiliate and, therefore, the
Court of First Instance of Manila had jurisdiction over the action instituted
by [it]; and because the allegations in the complaint filed * * * in the Court
of First Instance of Manila, * * *, are the best evidence of what the complaint
prayed for and the grounds therein relied upon, respondent [Bank] specifically
[denying] petitioners' erroneous inter­pretation as to what was the principal
relief and what were the grounds for the preliminary injunction therein prayed
for."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Basically, its defense was that the orders of respondent Judge complained of
far from having been issued without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave
abuse of discretion are in accordance with law and jurisprudence.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Before setting forth its affirmative defenses, there was <span style="">a </span>reiteration
of its contention that there was no labor dispute between respondent Bank and
petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The theme that respondent Judge "had jurisdiction over the
action filed" by it "and to issue the orders and decision sought to
be annulled by the instant petition" was more fully developed in its
affirmative defenses, it being argued that the sworn allegations in the
complaint conferred such competence on the respondent court, the action being
"actually one for the <u>enforcement of a negative contractual obligation</u>
solemnly assumed by therein defendants (regardless of what labor federation the
Local Union was affiliated to)" in the collective bargaining still in
force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seno v. <st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Mendoza</span></st1:place></st1:city><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
was quoted to the effect that even if there be a pending labor dispute between
an employer and employee, a Court of First <span style="">Instance </span>still has jurisdiction over the action which seeks the
enforcement of a provision of a collective bargaining agreement.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
It was then contended that with respondent Judge having jurisdiction over the
subject matter even if the orders were irregular or erroneous, they could not
be corrected by certiorari.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As </span>to the
allegedly fatal defect in the issuance of the injunction, it was asserted by
the respondent Bank that the restrictions and requirements contained in Sec.
9(d) of the Industrial Peace Act "apply <span style="">only to <u>cases involving labor disputes</u>; where no labor disputes
exist, ordinary courts may issue injunctions against wrongful picketing
pursuant to the general provisions</span> of the Rules of Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
From which it concluded:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The legal
principle, accurately stated, is there­fore, actually to the effect that it is
only when a labor dispute is involved that our regular courts of law are res­tricted
by Section 9(d) of Rep. Act 875 in the exercise of their otherwise recognized
discretionary authority to issue injunctions in accordance with the ordinary
provisions of the Rules of Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
It prayed that the petition be dismissed with costs against petitioners.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The crucial question then is one of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a settled rule that the jurisdiction of
a court over the subject matter is determined by the allegations of the
complaint,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
a rule which according to this Court is one "highly esteemed and honored
for so long a time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
It was even emphatically asserted in one case that no plausible argument could
be offered <span style="">to </span>dispute such <span style="">a </span><span style="">pro­position.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We therefore turn to the complaint<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
of respondent Bank filed in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of respondent
Judge to determine the question of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint stated plaintiff "is a
commercial banking corporation" while defendants National Association of
Trade Unions, thereinafter referred to as NATU, and the Lakes <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Manggagawang</span> <span class="SpellE">Makabayan</span>, there­inafter referred to as the LMM, are
legitimate labor federations duly registered with the Bureau of Labor,"
the other defendants, one of them, now petitioner, Ruben <span class="SpellE">Puertollano</span>
and Jesus V. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, being "officers of the
local union, both of whom claim rightful authority to act <span style="">as </span>the president thereof, * * *.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Reference was next made to a letter dated November 10, <span style="">1966 </span>addressed to plaintiff, now respondent Bank, wherein the
LMM, through its president, set forth the Local Union's affiliation with it and
that on December 13, 1966, a collective bargaining agreement was concluded and
signed between plaintiff, now respondent Bank, on the one hand and the Local
Union and LMM on the other, such collective bargaining agreement to be
effective and binding until June 30, 1970.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Then came the assertion that in a letter dated October 17, 1967,
addressed to plaintiff, now respondent Bank, defendant LMM advised plaintiff of
the "designation and appointment of Jesus V. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>,
union vice-president, as "acting president" of the Local Union, but
in a communication dated the same day "the defendant NATU, thru its
President, advised herein plaintiff of [Local Union's] affiliation with it and
of its intention to participate and act in collabo­ration with [such union] in
matters requiring represent­ation."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
A copy of such communication was immediately forwarded to defendant LMM, which
in turn "contested the legality and effectiveness of [such] affiliation *
* * with the defendant NATU for the reasons stated in the said letter and
demanded 'that [the plaintiff] disregard the claim of NATU [of such alleged]
affiliation with it', further threat­ening plaintiff that should its demand be
ignored, plaintiff's 'recognition of <span class="SpellE">NATU's</span> claim'
cannot be [a] guarantee to a continued cooperating and industrial peace in
[plaintiff's] establishment for [the LMM] will be forced to take drastic action
to protect [its] interests.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
That same afternoon of October 20, 1967, according to the complaint, "with
the obvious purpose of compelling immediate recognition by plaintiff of the
affiliation of the [Local Union] with the NATU notwithstanding its having been
disputed by the defendant LMM and a faction [thereof] headed by the defendant [<span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>], the defendant NATU and the faction * * * headed by
defendant Ruben <span class="SpellE">Puertollano</span>, filed a notice with the
Bureau of Labor Relations announcing its intention to stage an immediate
strike."<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After which came the categorical declaration that plain­tiff, now

being principally for the purpose of securing the immediate recognition by
plaintiff of their respective claims to the control and management of the Local
Union, will, if carried out constitute a violation of the provisions of Art.

foregoing threatening acts of the defendant, plaintiff was compelled to engage
the services of counsel to protect its rights and interests, for which it is
entitled to attorneys fees in such amount to be determined by the lower court.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint next took up the grounds on which the issuance of
an <u style="">ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u style="">parte</u></span> writ of preliminary injunction
was sought, plaintiff, now respondent Bank, after incorporating and reproducing
by reference what had been set forth stressing that such "concerted
action, picket or strike" threatened by both defendants NATU and LMM would
"be staged unless res­trained" by the lower court and that in view
"of the sensitive and vulnerable character of plaintiff's business,
substantial and irreparable damage and injury will be suffered by plain­tiff by
reason of any concerted action or strike against it before the matter can be
heard on notice; * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> </span></span>The prayer was for a writ of preliminary injunction directed
to defendants, their officers, members or agents from staging in front of or in
the vicinity of plaintiff's main office as well as any of its branches, any
strike or picketing of whatever kind or form during the existence or <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of any dispute or controversy between them as to
the affiliation, control and management of the local union with the further
plea that after a hearing on the merits, judgment be rendered declaring
permanent the aforesaid injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint contains an admission, binding against respondent
Bank, that such threatened "concerted collective action and strike"
that may be staged by both the LMM and the NATU "if carried out [would]
constitute a violation of the collective bargaining agreement." For it was
there pro­vided expressly that the Local Union, "its officers, agents and
members agree that for the duration of this agreement there shall be no strike,
walkouts, sit-downs, stoppage of work, strikes, boycotts, secondary boycotts,
sympathetic or general strikes, nor any acts of similar nature which would
interfere with the normal business operations and work schedules of the Bank,
or picketing of any kind or form, how­ever, peaceful, and that it will not
otherwise permit, countenance, or suffer the existence or continuance of any
kind of those acts," except in cases of unfair labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is this matter then properly cognizable by
the lower court, presided by respondent Judge?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We hold that it is not.</p>

<p class="BODY">From PAFLU v. Tan<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
to Bay View Hotel, Inc. v. Manila Hotel Workers Union,<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
there has been unwavering adherence to the principle that under the Industrial
Peace Act, unfair labor practice cases fall within the exclusive competence of
the Court of Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
Republic Savings Bank v. Court of Industrial Relations,<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
it was held that the grievance procedure provided by collective bargaining
agreement must be followed and that whatever obligation is incumbent on either
management or labor must be complied with.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A failure to perform its duty by either party amounts to a commission of
an unfair labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"For
collective bargaining does not end with the execution of an agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a continuous process."<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It being expressly provided in the Industrial Peace Act that
unfair labor practice is committed by a labor union or its agent by its refusal
"to bargain collectively with the employer"<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
and this Court having decided in the Republic Savings Bank case that collective
bargaining does not end with the execution of an agreement, being a continuous
process, the duty to bargain necessarily imposing on the parties the obli­gation
to live up to the terms of such a collective bargaining agreement if entered
into, it is undeniable that non-compliance therewith constitutes an unfair
labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It follows that the
complaint of respondent Bank in this case, tested by the allegations therein
made, should have been filed with the Court of Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Deference to a long line of decisions from
PAFLU v. Tan, unequivocal in language and imperative in tone, calls for a
ruling that respondent Judge acted without jurisdiction on the matter.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. The point might be raised however, that from Dee <span class="SpellE">Cho</span> Lumber Workers' Union v. Dee <span class="SpellE">Cho</span>
Lumber Co.,<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
relying on the PAFLU v. Tan decision, this Court has been committed to the view
that jurisdiction over a case involving the enforce­ment of a collective
bargaining contract rests not with the Court of Industrial Relations but with a
Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a
principle does not call for application in the present case in view of the
Republic Savings Bank doctrine, which if adhered to, as it ought to be, would
result in labor litigations of this character being submitted to the Court of
Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would thus have
the opportunity of availing itself of its <u style="">expertise</u>
on labor matters.</p>

<p class="BODY">That such a result is not to be deplored should be obvious to
all, for no agency is better equipped by training, experience, and background
to handle labor controversies than the Court of Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The observation of Justice J. B. L. Reyes,
though subject to qualifications, still possesses rele­vance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted by him, the regular courts
"have not intervened in labor cases [since 1936], and are therefore
ill-prepared to apply labor was and policies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And the frequency with which this Court has had to upset their labor
injunctions attests to the fact."<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
For it is undeniable that injunctions in labor disputes under the Industrial
Peace Act are not favored, to put it at its mildest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They nay issue only after a strict and rigorous
compliance with the statutory requisites</p>

<p class="NUM">3. The contention is earnestly pressed by respondent Bank, that
the provisions of the Industrial Peace Act do not call for application there
being no labor dispute, in which case it suffices to meet the less stringent
requirements of the Rules of Court for the issuance of an injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be admitted that as expounded in its
answer and memorandum, the argument has a ring of plausibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot, however, carry the heavy burden of
persuasion.</p>

<p class="BODY">For one thing, the very allegations of the complaint of
respondent Bank on which respondent Judge acted as well as its prayer betrayed
what undoubtedly was its well-founded fear that a strike was in the offing, a
strike undoubtedly to be participated in by members of the local union
independently of whether the LMM or the NATU would emerge victorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would thus be far-fetched to characterize
such an impasse as lacking the elements of a labor dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to fail to accord recognition to
reality.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that respondent Bank is in the unenviable position of
an innocent bystander caught in the cross-fire.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It enlists one's sympathy, but it cannot with reason assert that its
difficulties are in no way connected with a labor controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it is now too late to consider as
lacking the elements of a labor dispute a situation where rival unions vie for
supremacy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This court has so indicated
in at least two decisions, <span class="SpellE">Balaquezon</span> Trans. Labor
Union v. <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>-Palma<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
and <span class="SpellE">Malayang</span> <span class="SpellE">Manggagawa</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">Esso</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Esso</span>
Standard Eastern.<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Even if it be granted, however, that the ordinary procedure
provided by the Rules of Court could be relied upon, the last mentioned order
of respondent Judge dated January 3, 1968, which modified what was issued by
him on November 2, 1967 enjoining "the defendants or their representatives
from picketing of whatever kind or form",<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>
still could not survive the jurisdictional test.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It suffers from the fatal defect of
prohibiting any picketing "of whatever kind or form." This cannot be
done consistently with the Industrial Peace Act, which categorically provides
that no Court, Commission or Board of the Philippines "shall have
jurisdiction except as provided in section ten of this Act to issue any
restraining order, temporary or permanent injunction in any case involving or
growing out of a labor dispute to prohibit any person or persons participating
or interested in such dispute from doing, whether singly or in concert, any of
the following acts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *; (5) Giving
publicity to the existence of, or the facts in­volved in any labor dispute,
whether by advertising, speaking, patrolling or by any method not involving
fraud or violence; * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, this Court, in <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span>
Refinery Association v. Lucero,<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a>
made explicit its disapproval of an injunction against strikes, holding that
"no Court can issue a restrain­ing order against union members who plan to
hold a strike even if the same may appear to be illegal." That is so in
view of the unmistakable language employed in the Industrial Peace Act, with
reference to strikes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statutory
command on picketing likewise calls for a similar declaration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The obstacle that bars respondent Bank from
attaining its objective to bar all picketing is indeed too formidable to
surmount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, even without such a
categorical mandate expressed in the Act, the recognition of peaceful picketing
as a constitutional right embraced in the freedom of expression, dating from
the 1947 decision of <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span> v. Court of Industrial
Relations,<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a>
precludes the issuance of such a blanket prohibition as that imposed in the
challenged order of respondent Judge of January 3, 1968.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is not to say that picketing, like freedom of expression in
general, has no limits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, to
the extent that it is an instrument of coercion rather than of persuasion, it
cannot rightfully be entitled to the protection associated with free
speech.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Equally so, there can be no
indiscriminate ban on the freedom to disseminate the facts of a labor dispute
and to appeal for public sympathy, which is the aim of peaceful picketing,
without a transgression of the Constitution, sufficient to oust a court of
jurisdiction, even on the assumption that it was originally possessed of such a
competence, which was not so in this case as had been earlier made clear.</p>
