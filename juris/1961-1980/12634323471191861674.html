the returns from said voting centers be excluded from the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the start of the hearings, the canvass
was suspended, but after the supervisory panel presented its report, on <st1:date year="1978" day="15" month="5">May 15, 1978</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
lifted its order of suspension and directed the resumption of the canvass to be
done in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This order was the one assailed in this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We issued a restraining order.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing the parties, the Court allowed the resumption of
the canvass but issued the following guidelines to be observed thereat:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">That</span> the resumption of
said canvass shall be held in the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> main office
in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> starting not later than <st1:date year="1978" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1978</st1:date>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in preparation <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
respondent Commission on Elections shall see to it that all the material
election para­phernalia corresponding to all the voting centers involved in
Election Cases Nos. 78-8, 78-9, 78-10, 78-11 and 78-12 are taken to its main
office in Manila, more particularly, the ballot boxes, with their contents,
used during the said elections, the books of voters or records of voting and
the lists or records of registered voters, on or before May 31, 1978;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That as soon as the corresponding records are
available, petitioners and their counsel shall be allowed to examine the same
under such security measures as the respondent Board may determine, except the
contents of the ballot boxes which shall be opened only upon orders of either
the respondent Board or respondent Commission, after the need <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> has become evident, the purpose of such
examination being to enable petitioners and their counsel to expeditiously
determine which of them they would wish to be scrutinized and passed upon by
the Board as supporting their charges of election frauds and anomalies,
petitioners and their counsel being ad­monished, in this connection, that no
dilatory tactics should be indulged in by them and that only such records as
would support substantial objections should be offered by them for the scrutiny
by the Board;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That none of the election returns referred to
in the petition herein shall be canvassed without first giving the herein
petitioners ample opportunity to make their specific objections thereto, if
they have any, and to show sufficient basis for the rejection of any of the
returns, and, in this con­nection, the respondent Regional Board of Canvassers
should give due consideration to the points raised in the memorandum filed by
said petitioners with the Commission on Elections in the above cases dated
April 26, 1978;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That should it appear to the Board upon summary
scrutiny of the records to be offered by petitioners that there is sufficient
indication that in the voting centers concerned, no election was actually held
and/or that election returns were prepared either before the day of the
election or at any other time, without counting the ballots or with­out regard
thereto or that there has been massive substitution of voters, or that ballots
and/or returns were prepared by the same groups of persons or individuals or
outside of the voting centers, the Board should exclude the corresponding
returns from the canvass;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That appeals to the Commission on Elec­tions
from rulings of the Board may be made only after all the returns in question in
all the above five cases shall have been passed upon by the Board and; accordingly,
no proclamation shall be made until after the Commission shall have finally re­solved
the appeal without prejudice to recourse to this Court, if warranted as
provided by the Code and the Constitution, giving the parties reasonable time <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">That</span> the copies of
the election returns found in the corresponding ballot boxes shall be the one
used in the canvass;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the canvass shall be conducted with
utmost dispatch, to the end that a proclamation, if feasible, may be made not
later than June 10, 1978; thus, the canvass may be terminated as soon as it is
evident that the possible number of votes in the still uncanvassed returns will
no longer affect the general results of the elections here in controversy;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That respondent Commission shall promulgate
such other directive not inconsistent with this resolution as it may deem
necessary to expedite the proceedings herein contemplated and to accomplish the
purposes herein intended." <span class="GramE">(Pp. 8-9, Record.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1978</st1:date>,
upon proper motion, said guidelines were modified:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> in
the sense that the ballot boxes for the voting centers just referred to need
not be taken to Manila, EXCEPT those of the particular voting centers as to
which the petitioners have the right to demand that the corresponding ballot
boxes be opened in order that the votes therein may be counted because said
ballots unlike the election returns, have not been tampered with or
substituted, in which instances the result of the counting shall be the basis
of the canvass, provided that the voting centers concerned shall be specified
and made known by petitioners to the Regional Board of Canvassers not later
than June 3, 1978; it being understood, that for the purposes of the canvass,
the petitioners shall not be al­lowed to invoke any objection not already
alleged in or comprehended within the allegations in their complaint in the
election cases above-mentioned." (Page 8, <st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, respondent Board proceeded with the canvass, with the
herein petitioners presenting objections, most of them supported by the report
of handwriting and finger-print experts who had examined the voting records and
lists of voters in 878 voting centers, out of 2,700 which they specified in
their complaints or petitions in Election Cases 78-8, 78-9, 78-10, 78-11 and
78-12 in the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In regard to 501 voting centers, the records of which, consisting of the
voters lists and voting records were not available and could not be brought to
Manila, petitioners asked that the results therein be completely excluded from
the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1978</st1:date>, respondent Board terminated its
canvass and declared the result of the voting to be as follows:</p>

Diaz vs. Commission on Elections (November 29, 1971; 42 SCRA 426), and
particularly the highly restrictive criterion that when the votes obtained by
the candidates with the highest number of votes exceed the total number of
highest possible valid votes, the COMELEC ruled to exclude from the canvass the
election returns reflecting such results, under which the COMELEC excluded
1,004 election returns, involving around 100,000 votes, 95% of which are for
KBL candidates, particularly the peti­tioner <span class="SpellE">Linang</span> <span class="SpellE">Mandangan</span>, and which rule is so patently unfair, unjust and
oppressive.</blockquote>

Diaz Case is not the total exclusion of election returns simply because the
total number of votes exceed the total number of highest possible valid votes,
but 'even if all the votes cast by persons identified as registered voters were
added to the votes cast by persons who can not be definitely ascertained as
registered or not, and granting, <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>,
that all of them voted for respondent <span class="SpellE">Daoas</span>, still
the resulting total is much below the number of votes credited to the latter in

<p class="BODY">Now, before discussing the merits of the foregoing contentions,
it is necessary to clarify first the nature and extent of the Supreme Court's
power of review in the premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Aratuc</span> petition is expressly predicated on the ground that
respondent <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> "committed grave abuse of
discretion, amounting to lack of jurisdiction" in eight
specifications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the <span class="SpellE">Mandangan</span> petition raises pure questions of law and
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, both
petitions invoke the Court's certiorari jurisdiction, not its appellate
authority of review.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is as it should be.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While under the Constitution of 1935, "the decisions, orders and
rulings of the Commission shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court"
(Sec. 2, first paragraph, Article X) and pursuant to the Rules of Court, the
petition for "certiorari or review" shall be on the ground that the
Commission "has decided a question of substance not theretofore determined
by the Supreme Court, or has decided it in a way not in accord with law or the
applicable decisions of the Supreme Court" (Sec. 3, Rule 43), and such
provisions refer not only to election contests but even to pre-proclamation
proceedings, the 1973 Constitution provides somewhat differently thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Any decision, order or ruling of the
Commission <u>may be brought</u> to the Supreme Court on <u>certiorari</u> by
the aggrieved party within thirty days from his receipt of a copy thereof"
(Section 11, Article XII c), even as it ordains that the Commission shall
"be the sole judge of all contests relating to the elections, returns and
qualifications of all members of the National Assembly and elective provincial
and city officials" (Section 2 (2)).</p>

<p class="BODY">Correspondingly, the Election Code of 1978, which is the first
legislative construction of the pertinent constitutional provisions, makes the
Commission also the "sole judge of all pre-proclamation
controversies" and further provides that "any of its decisions,
orders or rulings (in such controversies) shall be final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>", just as in election contests, "the
decision of the Commission shall be final, <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
and <span class="SpellE">inappealable</span>." (Section 193)</p>

<p class="BODY">It is at once evident from these constitutional and statutory
modifications that there is a definite tendency to enhance and invigorate the
role of the Commission on Elections as the independent constitutional body
charged with the safeguarding of free, peaceful and honest elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The framers of the new Constitution must be
presumed to have definite knowledge of what it means to make the decisions,
orders and rulings of the Commission "subject to review by the Supreme
Court".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since instead of
maintaining that provision intact, it ordained that the Commission's actuations
be instead "<u>brought</u> to the Supreme Court <u>on certiorari</u>",
<span class="GramE">We</span> cannot insist that there was no intent to change
the nature of the remedy, considering that the limited scope of <u>certiorari</u>,
compared to a review, is well known in remedial law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Withal, as already stated, the legislative construction of the
modified pertinent constitutional provision is to the effect that the
actuations of the Commission are final, <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and
even <span class="SpellE">inappealable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While such construction does not exclude the general certiorari
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court which inheres in it as the final guardian of
the Constitution, particularly, of its imperious due process mandate, it correspondingly
narrows down the scope and extent of the inquiry the Court is supposed to
undertake to what is strictly the office of certiorari as distinguished from
review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are of the considered opinion
that the statutory modifications are consistent with the apparent new
constitutional intent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is
obvious that to say that actuations of the Commission may be brought to the
Supreme Court on <u>certiorari</u> technically connotes something less than
saying that the same "shall be subject to review by the Supreme
Court", when it comes to the measure of the Court's reviewing authority or
prerogative in the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">A review includes digging into the merits and unearthing errors
of judgment, while certiorari deals exclusively with grave abuse of discretion,
which may not exist even when the decision is otherwise erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certiorari implies an indifferent disregard
of the law, arbitrariness and caprice, an omission to weigh pertinent <span class="GramE">considerations,</span> a decision arrived at without rational
deliberation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the effects of an
error of judgment may not differ from that of an indiscretion, as a matter of
policy, there are matters that by their nature ought to be left for final
determination to the sound discretion of certain officers or entities,
reserving it to the Supreme Court to insure the faithful observance of due
process only in cases of patent arbitrariness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such, to <span class="GramE">Our</span> mind, is the constitutional
scheme relative to the Commission on Elections.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Conceived by the charter as the effective instrument to preserve the
sanctity of popular suffrage, endowed with independence and all the needed <span class="SpellE">concomittant</span> powers, it is but proper that the Court should
accord the greatest measure of presumption of regularity its course of action
and choice of means in performing its duties, to the end that it may achieve
its designed place in the democratic fabric of our government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ideally, its members should be free from all
suspicions of partisan inclina­tions, but the fact that actually some of them
have had stints in the arena of politics should not, unless the contrary is
shown, serve as basis for denying to its actuations the respect and
consideration that the Constitution contemplates should be accorded to it, in
the same manner that the Supreme Court itself which from time to time may have
members drawn from the political ranks or even from the military is at all
times deemed insulated from every degree or form of external pressure and
influence as well as improper internal motivations that could arise from such
background or orientation.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold, therefore, that under the existing constitutional and
statutory provisions, the certiorari jurisdiction of the Court over orders,
rulings and decisions of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> is not as broad
as it used to be and should be confined to instances of grave abuse of
discretion amounting to patent and substantial denial of due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, it is in this light that <span class="GramE">We</span> shall proceed to examine the opposing contentions of the
parties in these cases.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><u>THE MANDANGAN CASE<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Being more simple in <span class="GramE">Our</span> view, We shall
deal with the petition in G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-49717-21 first.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The errors assigned in this petition boil down to two main
propositions, namely, (1) that it was an error of law on the part of respondent
<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to have applied to the extant circumstances
hereof the ruling of this Court in Diaz vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
42 SCRA 426 instead of that of <span class="SpellE">Bashier</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, 43 SCRA 238; and (2) that respondent <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> exceeded its jurisdiction and denied due process to
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mandangan</span> in extending its inquiry beyond
the election records of "the 878 voting centers examined by the KB experts
and passed upon by the Regional Board of Canvassers" and in excluding from
the canvass the returns, showing 90 to 100% voting, from voting centers where
military operations were certified by the Army to be going on, to the extent
that said voting centers had to be transferred to the <span class="SpellE">poblaciones</span>,
the same being unsupported by evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the first proposition, it must be made clear that the Diaz
and <span class="SpellE">Bashier</span> rulings are not mutually exclusive of
each other, each being an outgrowth of the basic rationale of statistical
improbability laid down in <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> and <span class="SpellE">Climaco</span>, 16 SCRA
175.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether they should be applied
together or separately or which of them should be applied depends on the
situation on hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the factual milieu
of the instant case as found by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, We see
no cogent reason, and petitioner has not shown any, why returns in voting
centers showing that the votes of the candidate obtaining the highest number of
votes exceeds the highest possible number of valid votes cast therein should
not be deemed as spurious and manufactured just because the total number of
excess votes in said voting centers were not more than 40%.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, this is not the occasion, considering
the historical antecedents relative to the highly questionable manner in which
elections have been held in the past in the provinces herein involved, of which
the Court has judicial notice as attested by its numerous decisions in cases involving
practically every such election, for the Court to move a whit back from the
standards it has enunciated in those decisions.</p>

<p class="BODY">In regard to the jurisdictional and due process points raised by
herein petitioner, it is of decisive importance to bear in mind that under
Section 168 of the Revised Election Code of 1978, "the Commission (on
Elections) shall have direct control and supervision over the board of
canvassers" and that <span class="SpellE">relatedly</span>, Section 175 of
the same Code provides that it "shall be the sole judge of all
pre-proclamation controversies." While nominally, the procedure of
bringing to the Commission objections to the actuations of boards of canvassers
has been quite loosely referred to in certain quarters, even by the Commission
and by this Court, such as in the guidelines of May 23, 1978 quoted earlier in
this opinion, as an appeal, the fact of the matter is that the authority of the
Commission in reviewing such actuations does not spring from any appellate
jurisdiction conferred by any specific provision of law, for there is none such
provision anywhere in the Election Code, but from the plenary prerogative of
direct control and supervision endowed to it by the above-quoted provisions of
Section 168.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in administrative law,
it is a too well settled postulate to need any supporting citation here, that a
superior body or office having supervision and control over another may do
directly what the latter is supposed to do or ought to have done.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, anything said in <span class="SpellE">Lucman</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Dimaporo</span>, 33 SCRA 387, cited by petitioner, to
the contrary notwithstanding, We cannot fault respondent <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
for its having extended its inquiry beyond that undertaken by the Board of
Canvassers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it must be
stated that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> correctly and commendably
asserted its statutory authority born of its envisaged constitutional duties <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> the preservation of the purity of elections and
electoral processes and procedures in doing what petitioner claims it should
not have done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incidentally, it cannot
be said that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> went further than even what <span class="SpellE">Aratuc</span>, et al. have asked, since said complainants had
impugned from the outset not only the returns from the 878 voting centers
examined by their experts but all those mentioned in their complaints in the
election cases filed originally with the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
enumerated in the opening statements hereof, hence respondent <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> had that much field to work on.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same principle should apply in respect to the ruling of the
Commission regarding the voting centers affected by military operations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It took cognizance of the fact, not
considered by the board of <span class="GramE">canvassers, that</span> said
voting centers had been transferred to the <span class="SpellE">poblaciones</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, if only for purposes of pre-proclamation
proceedings, We are persuaded it did not constitute a denial of due process for
the Commission to have taken into account, without the need of presentation of
evidence by the parties, a matter so publicly notorious as the unsettled
situation of peace and order in some localities in the provinces herein
involved that they may perhaps be taken judicial notice of, the same being
capable of unquestionable demonstration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Sec. 1, Rule 129)</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, We may as well, perhaps, say here as later
that regrettably We cannot, however, go along with the view, expressed in the
dissent of our respected Chief Justice, that from the fact that some of the
voting centers had been transferred to the <span class="SpellE">poblaciones</span>
there is already sufficient basis for Us to rule that the Commission should
have also subjected all the returns from the other voting centers of the same
municipalities, if not provinces, to the same degree of scrutiny as in the
former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The majority of the Court feels
that had the Commission done so, it would have fallen into the error precisely
alleged by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mandangan</span> about denial of due
process, for it is relatively unsafe to draw adverse conclusions as to the
exact conditions of peace and order in those other voting centers without at
least some <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> evidence to rely on considering that there
is no allegation, much less any showing at all that the voting centers in
question are so close to those excluded by the Commission as to warrant the
inescapable conclusion that the relevant circumstances found by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> as obtaining in the latter were identical to those
in the former.</p>

<p class="BODY">Premises <span class="GramE">considered,</span> the petition in
G.R. Nos. L-49717-21 is hereby dismissed, for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><u>THE ARATUC ET AL. PETITION<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Of the eight errors assigned by herein petitioners earlier
adverted to, the seventh and the eighth do not require any extended
disquisition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the issue of whether
the elections in the voting centers concerned were held on April 7, 1978, the
date designated by law, or earlier, to which the seventh alleged error is
addressed, We note that apparently petitioners are not seriously pressing on it
anymore, as evidenced by the complete absence of any reference thereto during
the oral argument of their counsel and the practically cavalier discussion
thereof in the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, <span class="GramE">We</span> are satisfied from a careful review of the analysis by
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> in its resolution now before Us that it
took pains to consider as meticulously as the nature of the evidence presented
by both parties would permit all the contentions of petitioners relative to the
weight that should be given to such evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The detailed discussion of said evidence is contained in not less than
nineteen pages (pp. 70-89) of the resolution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In these premises, <span class="GramE">We</span> are not prepared to hold
that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> acted wantonly and arbitrarily in
drawing its conclusions adverse to petitioners' position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If errors there are in any of those
conclusions, they are errors of judgment which are not <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span>
in certiorari, so long as they are founded on substantial evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to eighth <span class="GramE">assigned</span> error, the thrust
of respondents' comment is that the results in the voting centers mentioned in
this assignment of error had already been canvassed at the regional canvassing
center in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, We cannot say that in sustaining the
board of canvassers in this regard, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> gravely
abused its discretion, if only because in the guidelines set by this Court,
what appears to have been referred to is, rightly or wrongly, the resumption
only of the canvass, which does not necessarily include the setting aside and
repetition of the canvass already made in <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>
City.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second and fourth assignments of error concern the voting
centers the corresponding voter's record (C.E. Form 1) and record of voting, (C.E.
Form 5) of which have never been brought to Manila because they were not
available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record is not clear as to
how many are these voting centers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to petitioners they are 501, but in the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
resolution in question, the number mentioned is only 408, and this number is
directly challenged in the petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the second assignment, it is contended that the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> gravely abused its discretion in including in the
canvass the election returns from these voting centers and, somewhat alternatively,
it is alleged as fourth assignment that petitioners' motion for the opening of
the ballot boxes pertaining to said voting centers was arbitrarily denied by
respondent <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The resolution under scrutiny explains the situation that
confronted the Commission in regard to the 408 voting centers referred to as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The Commission had the option of excluding from the canvass
the election returns under this category.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By deciding to exclude, the Commission would be summarily
disenfranchising the voters registered in the voting centers affected without
any basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission could also
order the inclusion in the canvass of these election returns under the
injunction of the Supreme Court that extreme caution must be exercised in
rejecting returns unless these are palpably irregular.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission chose to give <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
validity to the election returns mentioned and uphold the votes cast by the
voters in those areas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission
held the view that the failure of some election officials to comply with
Commission orders (to submit the records) should not prejudice the right of
suffrage of the citizens who were not parties to such official
disobedience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> Luna vs. Rodriguez, 39 Phil. 208, the Supreme Court
ruled that when voters have honestly cast their ballots, the same should not be
nullified because the officers appointed under the law to direct the election
and guard the purity of the ballot have not complied with their duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">cited</span> in <st1:city><st1:place>Laurel</st1:place></st1:city>
on Elections, p. 24)" (Pp. 139-140, Record.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">On page 14 of the comment of the
Solicitor General, however, it is stated that:</p>

<blockquote>"At all events, the returns corresponding to these voting
centers were examined by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> and 141 of such
returns were excluded, as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Page 301, Record.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This assertion has not been denied by
petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, it appears that precisely because of the absence or
unavailability of the CE Forms 1 and 5 corresponding to the more than 400 voting
centers concerned in our present discussion, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
examined the returns from said voting centers to determine their
trustworthiness by scrutinizing the purported relevant data appearing on their
faces, believing that such was the next best thing that could be done to avoid
total disenfranchisement of the voters in all of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, petitioners' insist that
the right thing to do was to order the opening of the ballot boxes involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with such opposing contentions, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
explanation in its resolution is:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">The</span> commission had it seen fit to so order, could have
directed the opening of the ballot boxes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the Commission did not see the necessity of going to such length in
a proceeding that was summary in nature and decided that there <span class="GramE">was suf­ficient bases</span> for the resolution of the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the Commission has discretion to
determine when the ballot boxes should be opened is implicit in the guidelines
set by the Supreme Court which states that ' ... the ballot boxes [which] shall
be opened only upon orders of either the respondent Board or respondent
Commission, <u>after the need <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> has become
evident</u> . . . ' (guideline No. 3; underscoring supplied).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the Court on June 1, 1978,
amended the guidelines by providing that the '<u>ballot boxes for the voting
centers</u> . . . <u>need not be taken</u> to <u>Manila</u>, EXCEPT those of
the particular centers as to which the petitioners have the right to demand
that the corresponding ballot boxes be opened . . . <u>provided that the voting
centers concerned shall be specified and made known by petitioners to the
Regional Board of Canvassers not later than June 3, 1978</u> . . . .' (<span class="GramE">under­scoring</span> supplied).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The KB, candidates did not take advantage of the option granted them
under these guidelines." <span class="GramE">(Pp. 106-107, Record.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Considering that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, if it had
wished to do so, had the facilities to identify on its own the voting centers
without CE Forms 1 and 5, thereby precluding the need for the petitioners
having to specify them, and under the circumstances the need for opening the
ballot boxes in question should have appeared to it to be quite apparent, it
may be contended that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> would have done greater
service to the public interest had it proceeded to order such opening, as it
had announced it had thoughts of doing in its resolution of August 30,
1978.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, We cannot
really blame the Commission too much, since the exacting tenor of the
guidelines issued by Us left it with very little elbow room, so to speak, to
use its own discretion independently of what We had ordered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What could have saved matters altogether
would have been a timely move on the part of petitioners on or before <st1:date year="1978" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1978</st1:date>, as contemplated in <span class="GramE">Our</span> resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
all, come to think of it, that the possible outcome of the opening of the
ballot boxes would favor the petitioners was not a certainty — the contents
thereof could conceivably boomerang against them, such as, for example, if the
ballots therein had been found to be regular and preponderantly for their
opponents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having in mind that
significantly, petitioners filed their motion for opening only on January 9,
1979, practically on the eve of the promulgation of the resolution, We hold that
by having adhered to Our guidelines of June 1, 1978, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
certainly cannot be held to be guilty of having gravely abused its discretion,
whether in examining and passing on the returns from the voting centers
referred to in the second and fourth assignments of error in the canvass or in
denying petitioners' motion for the opening of the ballot boxes concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first, third and sixth assignment of errors involve related
matters and may be discussed together.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They all deal with the inclusion in or exclusion from the canvass of
certain returns on the basis of the percentage of voting in specified voting
centers and the corresponding findings of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
on the extent of substitute voting therein as indicated by the result of either
the technical examination by experts of the signatures and thumb-prints of the
voters thereat.</p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, petitioners' complaint that the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> did not examine and study 1,694 of the records in
all the 2,775 voting centers questioned by them is hardly accurate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be more exact, the Commission excluded a
total of 1,267 returns coming under four categories namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1,001 under the Diaz, supra, ruling, 79
because of 90-100% turnout of voters despite military operations, <span class="GramE">105</span> palpably manufactured ones and 82 returns excluded by
the board of canvassers on other grounds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, 45.45% of the claims of the petitioners were sustained by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
contrast, in the board of canvassers, only 453 returns were excluded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The board was reversed as to 6 of these, and
821 returns were excluded by <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> over and above
those excluded by the board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> almost doubled the exclusions by
the board.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners would give the impression by their third assignment
of error that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> refused to consider high
percentage of voting, coupled with mass substitute voting, as proof that the
pertinent returns had been manufactured.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That such was not the case is already shown in the above specifications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To add more, it can be gleaned from the
resolution that in respect to the 1,065 voting centers in <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> and <span class="SpellE">Marawi</span> City
where a high percentage of voting appeared, the returns from the 867 voting
centers were excluded by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> and only 198
were included a ratio of roughly 78% to 22%.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The following tabulation drawn from the figures in the resolution shows
how the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> went over those returns center by
center and acted on them individually:</p>

<p class="BODY">We are convinced, apart from presuming regularity in the
performance of its duties, that there is enough showing in the record that it
did examine and study the returns and pertinent records corresponding to all
the 2775 voting centers subject of petitioners' complaints below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one part of its resolution the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> states:</p>

<blockquote>"The Commission as earlier stated examined on its own the
Books of Voters (<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> Form No. 1) and the Voters
Records <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> Form No. 5) to determine for itself
which of these election forms needed further examination by the COMELEC-NBI
experts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission, aware of the
summary nature of this pre-proclamation controversy, believes that it can
decider using common sense and perception, whether the election forms in
controversy needed further examination by the expert based on the presence or
absence of patent signs of irregularity." <span class="GramE">(Pp. 137-138,
Record.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In the face of this categorical assertion
of fact of the Commission, the bare charge of petitioners that the records
pertaining to the 1,694 voting centers assailed by them should not create any
ripple of serious doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="GramE">We</span> view this point under discussion, what is more factually
accurate is that those records complained at were not examined with the aid of
experts and that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> passed upon the returns
concerned "using common sense and perception only." And there is
nothing basically objectionable in this.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The defunct Presidential, Senate and House Electoral Tribunals examined,
passed upon and voided millions of votes in several national elections without
the assistance of experts and "using" only "common sense and
perception".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one ever raised any
eyebrows about such procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Withal,
what we discern from the resolution is that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> preliminarily
screened the records and whatever it could not properly pass upon by
"using common sense and perception" it left to the experts to work
on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We might disagree with the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> as to which voting center should be excluded or
included, were We to go over the same records Ourselves, but still a case of
grave abuse of discretion would not come out, considering that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> cannot be said to have acted whimsically or
capriciously or without any rational basis, particularly if it is considered
that in many respects and from the very nature of our respective functions,
becoming candor would dictate to Us to concede that the Commission is in a
better position to appreciate and assess the vital circumstances closely and
accurately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By and large, therefore, the
first, third and sixth assignments of error of the petitioners are not well
taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fifth assignment of error is in <span class="GramE">Our</span>
view moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
identification of the ballot boxes in defective condition, in some instances
open and allegedly empty, is at best of secondary import because, as already
discussed, the records related thereto were after all examined studied and
passed upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If at all, deeper inquiry
into this point would be of real value in an electoral protest.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><u>CONCLUSION</u></p>

<p class="BODY">Before closing, it may not be amiss to state here that the Court
had initially agreed to dispose of the cases in a minute resolution, without
prejudice to an extended or reasoned-out opinion later, so that the Court's
decision may be known earlier.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering, however, that no less than the Honorable Chief Justice has
expressed misgivings as to the propriety of yielding to the conclusions of
respondent Commission because in his view there are strong considerations
warranting further meticulous inquiry of what he deems to be earmarks of
seemingly traditional faults in the manner elections are held in the
municipalities and provinces herein involved, and he is joined in this pose by
two other dis­tinguished colleagues of Ours, the majority opted to ask for more
time to put down at least some of the important considerations that impelled Us
to see the matters in dispute the other way, just as the minority <span class="SpellE">bidded</span> for the opportunity to record their points of
view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this manner, all concerned will
perhaps have ample basis to place their respective reactions in proper
perspective.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, the majority feels it is but meet to advert
to the following portion of the ratiocination of respondent Board of Canvassers
adopted by respondent Commission with approval in its resolution under
question:</p>

<blockquote>"First of all this Board was guided by the legal doctrine that
canvassing boards must exercise "extreme caution" in rejecting
returns and they may do so only when the returns are palpably irregular.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A conclusion that an election return is
obviously manufactured or false and consequently should be disregarded in the
canvass must be approached with extreme caution, and only upon the most
convincing proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any plausible
explanation, one which is acceptable to a reasonable man in the light of
experience and of the probabilities of the situation, should suffice to avoid
outright nullification, with the resulting disenfranchisement of those who
exercised their right of suffrage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Anni</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Isquierdo</span>
et al, L-35918, June 28, 1974; <span class="SpellE">Villalon</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, L-32008, August 31, 1970; <span class="SpellE">Tagoranao</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, 22 SCRA 978).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of strong evidence
establishing the spuriousness of the return, the basic rule of their being
accorded prima facie status as bona fide reports of the results of the count of
the votes for canvassing and proclamation purposes must be applied, without
prejudice to the question being tried on the merits with the presentation of
evidence, testimonial and real, in the corresponding electoral protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Bashier</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, L-33692, 33699, 33728, 43 SCRA 238,
February 24, 1972).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decisive
factor is that where it has been duly determined after investigation and
examination of the voting and registration records that <u>actual</u> voting
and election by the registered voters had taken place in the questioned voting
centers, the election returns cannot be disregarded and excluded with the
resulting disenfranchisement of the voters, but must be accorded prima facie
status as <u>bona fide</u> reports of the results of the voting for canvassing
and proclamation purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the
grievances relied upon is the commission of irregularities and violation of the
Election Law the proper remedy is election protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Anni</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Isquierdo</span> et al, Supra)."</span> <span class="GramE">(P. 59, Record, L-49705-09.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The writer of this opinion has taken care to personally check on
the citations to be doubly sure they were not taken out of context, considering
that most, if not all of them, arose from similar situations in the very venues
of the factual milieu of the instant cases, and We are satisfied they do fit
our chosen posture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More importantly,
they actually came from the pens of different members of the Court, already
retired or still with <span class="GramE">Us</span>, distinguished by their
perspicacity and their perceptive prowess.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the context of the constitutional and legislative intent expounded at
the outset of this opinion and evident in the modifications of the duties and
responsibilities of the Commission on Elections <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span>
the matters that have con­cerned Us herein, particularly the elevation of the
Commission as the "sole judge of pre-proclamation controversies" as
well as of all electoral contests, We find the afore-quoted doctrines
compelling as they reveal through the clouds of existing jurisprudence the
polestar by which the future should be guided in delineating and circumscribing
separate spheres of action of the Commission as it functions in its equally
important dual role just indicated bearing as they do on the purity and
sanctity of elections in this country.</p>

<p class="BODY">In conclusion, the Court finds insufficient merit in the petition
to warrant its being given due course.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petition dismissed, without pronouncement as to costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justices Fernando, Antonio and Guerrero who
are presently on official missions abroad voted for such dismissal.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">CASTRO, <i>C.J.</i>:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><u>1<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset I must state that constraints of time effectively
prevent me from writing an extended dissent.  Hence, this abbreviated exposition of my views.</p>

<p class="BODY">For a clear understanding of the issues, a summary of the
essential events relative to these cases is necessary.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 7, 1978, elections of representatives to the Batasang
Pambansa were held throughout the Philippines.  The cases at bar concern only the results of the elections in Region XII
(Central Mindanao) which comprises the provinces of Lanao del Sur, Lanao del
Norte, Maguindanao, North Cotabato and Sultan Kudarat, and the cities of
Marawi, Iligan and Cotabato.  (The
entire Region had a total of 4,107 voting centers, but only 3,984 were
functional).</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 11, 1978, the Regional Board of Canvassers issued a
resolution, over the objection of the Konsensiya ng Bayan (KB) candidates,
declaring all the eight Kilusan ng Bagong Lipunan (KBL) candidates elected.  Appeal was taken by the KB candidates to the
Comelec.  On January 13, 1979, the
Comelec issued its questioned resolution declaring seven KBL candidates and one
KB candidate as having obtained the first eight places, and ordering the
Regional Board of Canvassers to proclaim the winning candidates.  The KB candidates forthwith interposed the
present petition; in due time the respondents filed their comments.</p>

<p class="BODY">Oral argument was had before the Court for two days, specifically
on January 31 and February 1, 1979.  Atty. Lino Patajo argued for and in behalf of the KB candidates,
Assemblyman Estanislao Fernandez for the KBL and the private respondents, and
Solicitor General Estelito P. Mendoza for the public respondents.  The Court subjected the three counsels to
intensive interrogation.  The cases were
then submitted for decision in the afternoon of February 1.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><u>2<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I have carefully read the entire record, more particularly the
Comelec resolution of January 13, 1979, and I must confess that until now my
mind cannot rest easy on a number of questions sharply in issue, some of which
are hereunder briefly discussed.</p>

<p class="NUM"><u>a.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the Comelec
examined very closely the voting returns, books of voters and voting records
from 1,116 voting centers protested by the KB candidates, to the extent of
subjecting them to detailed documentary examination and fingerprint comparison
by Comelec experts, and thereafter annulled 31.84% of the votes cast, why did
it refuse to proceed to subject all the records of the remaining 1,659 voting
centers protested by the KB candidates to the same manner of close scrutiny?</p>

<p class="NUM"><u>b.</u> Why did not the Comelec examine, utilizing the same
meticulous method, similar documents and records appertaining to a total of 164
voting centers in Lanao del Sur and 19 voting centers in Lanao del Norte - two
provinces where concededly there had been military operations - and an
additional number of voting centers in the other provinces, all of which
registered a 100% turnout of voters?  The peace and order conditions in the two cities of Iligan and Cotabato
on the day of the elections were normal, and yet the total percentages of
voting were only 73% and 52%, respectively.  How then can the Comelec explain why and how in many voting centers
located in areas where there had been military operations there was a voting
turnout of 100%?  Assuming that the KB
candidates did not call the attention of the Comelec - although they actually
did - to the stark improbability of 100% vote turnout in the said places,
because the peace and order conditions were far from normal, it perforce
devolved on the Comelec to conduct, <u>motu</u> <u>proprio</u>, an in-depth and
full-blown inquiry into this paradox.  The record shows that there was 100% voting in the whole of each of
three municipalities, over 99% voting in each of thirteen other municipalities,
and an average 97% turnout in five more municipalities.  Of inescapable significance is the fact that
most of these municipalities are located in the provinces of Lanao del Sur and
Lanao del Norte, the past election history of which is replete with the
perpetration of massive frauds, terrorism and scandalous substitutions of
voters.</p>

<p class="NUM"><u>c.</u> Why did the Comelec deny the motion of the KB candidates
for the opening of ballot boxes pertaining to a total of 408 voting centers -
the voting records of which were not available as they had somehow mysteriously
disappeared – to determine whether or not the election in each of the said
voting centers was a sham?  This
remedial measure was resorted to by the Comelec in 1969 when it ordered the
opening of a number of ballot boxes in the pre-proclamation contest in <u>Lucman
vs. Dimaporo</u> in order to see whether or not there were ballots inside them,
without counting the ballots, and determine whether there had been an actual
election in each of the disputed precints.  In that case the Supreme Court sustained the action of the Comelec.</p>

<p class="NUM"><u>d.</u> Why did the Comelec include in the canvass the voting
returns from some indicated 100 voting centers when the ballot boxes
corresponding thereto were found to be completely empty?  And why did the Comelec also include in the
canvass the election returns corresponding to almost 200 ballot boxes found to
be without padlocks?</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><u>3<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Of incalculable significance is the absence of any statement in
the Comelec resolution that indicates that, granting that all the questions I
have above raised would be resolved in favor of the KB candidates, the election
results would not be materially altered.  Upon the other hand, the KB candidates state categorically, with benefit
of extrapolation, that the election results would be consider­ably changed in
their favor.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><u>4<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The majority of my brethren anchor their denial of the petition
on two principal grounds, namely:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]-->a.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->The issues raised by the KB candidates would be better and properly
ventilated in an election protest; and</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]-->b.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->No grave abuse of discretion is discernible from the
actuations of the Comelec.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the <u>first</u> ground, it is a notorious fact in the
history of Philippine politics that an election protest not only is usually inordinately
protracted but as well entails heavy and prohibitive expenditure of time, money
and effort on the part of the protestant.  More than this, should the protestant in the end win, very little time
or none at all is left for him to assume and discharge the duties of his
office.  In the meantime, the person
previously proclaimed elected continues to fraudulently represent the people
who had in law and in fact duly elected someone else to represent them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, taking a broad view of the fundamental issues raised by
the KB candidates, I am of the opinion that resolution of these issues by the
Comelec would not take more than six months of conscientious labor - and surely
this period is short, very short indeed, compared to the time that will be wasted
by the Comelec in deciding a formal electoral protest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Is it not time the Supreme Court asserted its powers in order to
excise completely the Old Society pernicious evil of "grab the
proclamation at all costs"?</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the <u>second</u> ground, I squarely traverse the statement
that no grave abuse of discretion can be imputed to the Comelec.  The grave misgivings I have above
articulated demonstrate what to my mind constitute the size and shape of the
remissness of the Comelec.  And more
compelling and overriding a consideration than the overwrought technicality of
"grave abuse of discretion" is the fundamental matter of the faith of
the people of Region XII in the electoral process.  There will always be the nagging question in the minds of the
voters in that Region as to the legitimacy of those who will be proclaimed
elected under the Comelec resolution should the Court refuse to direct that
body to continue the meticulous search for legitimacy and truth.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><u>5<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon all the foregoing, it behooves the Court to remand these
cases to the Comelec, with the direction that that body immediately convene
and, within an unextendible period and as speedily as possible, resolve with
definitiveness all the questions I have above posed, under such unequivocal
guidelines as the Court may prescribe.</p>

<p class="BODY">For my part, unless and until this is done, I shall continue to
entertain grave doubt as to the correctness and validity of the results already
reached by the Comelec, especially when political history, placed in
perspective, pointedly reminds me of the massive frauds, terrorism and
scandalous substitutions of voters that have characterized past elections in
the two Lanao provinces.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">DE CASTRO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">The present case has afforded Us an early opportunity to examine
mid define the extent of the power of judicial review as granted to the Supreme
Court over any decision, order or ruling of the Commission on Elections under the
new Constitution the pertinent provision of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 11.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any
decision, order or ruling of the Commission may be brought to the Supreme Court
on <u>certiorari</u> by the aggrieved party within thirty days from his receipt
of a copy thereof." (Article XII, Consti­tution).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Commission on Elections has been granted powers under the new
Constitution which, under the old Constitution, belonged either to the
legislative body (Electoral Tribunals) or to the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is evident from the provision of the new
Constitution which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be the sole judge of all contests relating to
the elections, returns, and qualifications of all Members of the National
Assembly and elective provincial and city officials." (Section 2, Article
XII, Constitution).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Commission is thus envisioned to exercise exclusive powers on
all electoral matters except the right to vote, such as the enforcement and
administration of laws relative to the conduct of elections deciding
administrative questions affect­ing elections, except those involving the right
to vote, but also those that heretofore have been regarded, as matters for
strictly judicial inquiry, such as the hearing and disposition of election
contests, as is doubtlessly shown by the transfer thereto of the powers
previously conferred upon the Electoral Tribunal of Congress and the
Courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(see Section 2, par. 2, Article
XII, New Constitution).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This change may
properly be viewed as having the intention to relieve the Courts, particularly
the Supreme Court, of those burdens placed upon them relating to the conduct of
election and matters incident thereto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It could have been, likewise, intended to insulate judicial bodies from
the baneful effects of partisan politics, the more deleterious ones being those
that could come from the higher seats of political power, such as those in the
Assembly and in provincial and city government levels.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is, therefore, my view that what was intended by the new
Constitution is to limit the intervention of the Supreme Court in the acts of
the Commission as constitutional body like said Court, but with broadened
powers, allocating to it a domain as exclusive as that of the legislative body
(which includes the President or Prime Minister) on matters of law?making,
to that of "judicial inquiry".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This power is confined to <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>
questions not of political nature, and always involving alleged violation of
constitutional rights or the constitution itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a controversy of a political character,
commonly referred to as "political questions", is excluded from the
scope of the Supreme Court's power of judicial inquiry.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The exclusive character of the power conferred upon the Commission on
Elections, and considering that political rights, as distinguished from civil
and personal or property rights,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
are for the most part, if not in their totality, the subject of its authority,
should counsel against an expansive intervention by the Supreme Court in the
acts of the Commission on Elections.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With the <span class="SpellE">confernment</span> of exclusive authority on
the electoral process upon it, the Commission may be said to have been given
full discretionary authority, the exercise of which would give rise to a
controversy involving a political question.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What then is the test or criterion in determining whether the
Supreme Court may exercise its power under Article XII, Section 11 of the new
Constitution?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is my humble sub­mission
that the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> provision is merely as
reassertion of the power of the Supreme Court, as guardian of the Consti­tution
and protector of constitutional rights, of which, under no circumstance, could
it be deprived, if our present constitutional system is to be maintained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is a power constitutionally assigned
to it as the essence of the high judicial power of the Supreme Court, for the
orderly and salutary apportionment of governmental powers among the different
branches of the govern­ment, as well as the special constitutional bodies
created to deal more effectively with specific matters requiring govern­mental
action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Examining the instant petition, nothing reveals itself as raising
more than questions merely affecting the conduct of the election held on April
7, 1978, much less a truly constitutional question, aside perhaps from the
allegation that the COMELEC undertook an examination of election records beyond
those examined during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the controversy
before the Regional Board of Canvassers, allegedly without notice to the
petitioners, thus intimating a violation of due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This particular matter, however, can easily
be disposed of by citing the provision of Section 175 of the Electoral Code of
1978 which reads:</p>

<blockquote>“xx <span class="SpellE">xx</span> <span class="SpellE">xx</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission shall be the sole judge of all
pre-proclamation controversies and any of its decisions, orders or rulings
shall be final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may, <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">proprio</span></u> or upon written peti­tion, and after due
notice and hearing order the sus­pension of the proclamation of a
candidate-elect or annul any proclamation, if one has been made, on any of the
grounds mentioned in Sections 172, 173 and 174 hereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">If the Commission has the power to suspend <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">proprio</span></u> the proclamation of a candidate-elect, it
must have the power to conduct inquiry into the cause for which it ordains the
suspension of the proclamation, such as making its own examination of the
integrity of election returns or inquiring into any relevant matter affecting
the purity of the ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notice is
required by the legal provision cited, but this must be notice to the party
adversely affected, is the candidate-elect whose proclamation is
suspended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The action taken by the
COMELEC in examining additional election documents to those examined by the KB
experts during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the controversy with
the Regional Board of Canvassers was, therefore, one of which petitioners
cannot be heard, nor have any reason, to complain, for it even resulted in one
KB candidate getting into the winners' column.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the COMELEC stopped at a certain point in its examination, instead of
going through all those questioned by the petitioners, evidently due to time
constraint as fixed in the guidelines, set by this Court, and the summary
character of pre-proclamation proceedings, it cannot be charged with abuse of
discretion, much less a grave one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
did not have to conduct the additional examination, in the first place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The controversy which was heard and decided,
in the first instance, by the Regional Board of Canvassers, with guidelines set
by this Court, was appealed to the COMELEC.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter's appellate authority was thus limited to a review of the
decision of the Board rendered on the basis of the evidence presented before
it, rendering its own decision on the basis of the same evidence, and no
more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It incorporated the result of its
own examination of additional election returns, and found one KB as one of the
winning candidate, a fact clear­ly showing that COMELEC did examine the said
documents, otherwise, the result as previously declared by the Board of
Canvassers with a clean sweep of the KBL candidate would have remained unaltered.</p>

<p class="BODY">Expounding more on the one circumstance inclining me to the
theory that with the enlarged power and broadened authority of the COMELEC
which extends to and cover virtually the entire electoral process, as
exclusively as the power of legislation is constitutionally lodged in the
law-making body, what is given to the Supreme Court as its reviewing authority
over acts of the COMELEC is no more than what it could exercise under its power
of judicial inquiry with respect to acts of the legislative body, which is the
transfer to the COMELEC of the powers pertaining to the Electoral Tribunals and
the courts under the old Consti­tution over election contests, it must not be
hard to con­cede that with the composition of the electoral tribunals in which
six of the justices of the Supreme Court sit in said bodies, the Supreme Court
could not longer exercise any reviewing authority over the acts of the said
electoral tribunals except possibly when violation of the Constitution or
constitutional rights are involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
this limited concept of this Court's authority over the defunct electoral
tribunals now applied to an equally constitutional body that the COMELEC is
that took over the function of the Electoral Tribunals, I would hesitate to
hold that the Supreme Court may grant the relief as is prayed for in the
present petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">If this is so under the law and the Constitution, it should also
be upon consideration of public policy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The last elections were called by the President as a test or experiment
as to how the vital reforms and changes of political and social discipline and
moral values he has instituted to evolve a new order have affected the thinking
and the attitudes of our people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
should be extreme caution, if not restraint, in any act on our part that might
reflect on the success or failure of that experiment intended, at the same time
as a big stride in the way back to normalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is specially true in the field of
politics where the ills of the Old Society has been most grave, because our
elections then as a democratic process, have tarnished the image of our country
as a representative democracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except on
very compelling reasons then, which I believe do not exist in the case before
Us, should we make any pronouncement that would detract on how successful the
last political exercise had been, as the first election held under the new
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We must refrain from
imputing to the COMELEC which has been enlarged with fresh mandate and a bigger
trust by the Constitution failure in the performance of its functions either by
willful neglect, official incompetence, much less by deliberate partiality, in
the first real test of its capability.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing, I vote, in concurrence with the
majority, to dismiss the petition, first, as to the matter allegedly involving
a violation of the peti­tioners' right of due process on the ground that there
was no denial thereof, and second, as to the other matters involving no
violation of constitutional rights, on the ground they are purely political
questions, and that in any case, no grave abuse of discretion has been
committed by, much less is there lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of,
the Commission on Elections.</p>
