<p class="BODY">The record shows that <span class="SpellE">Anselma</span> <span class="SpellE">Pendon</span> is the owner of a tract of land, of about 3.5
hectares, situated in <span class="SpellE">Balocot</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tambulig</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, which <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> <span class="SpellE">Trabasas</span> had begun to cultivate in November 1960, as her
tenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alleging that, on <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1961</st1:date>, she had
arbitrarily ejected him from said land, without just <span class="GramE">cause</span>,
on <st1:date year="1961" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1961</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Trabasas</span> filed, with the Court of Agrarian Relations, 9th
Regional District, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, through Atty. Ramon P. <span class="SpellE">Mabanag</span>, CAR Case No. 30, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, against Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pendon</span>,
for reinstatement as her tenant, <span class="SpellE">reliquidation</span> of
their accounts and damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On or about
June 8, 1962, <span class="SpellE">Trabasas</span>, then represented by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> LT. Coronado, of the TCU, Tenancy Mediation
Commission, amended his petition to include as defendants the alleged new
tenants of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pendon</span>, namely, Santiago and <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Penistan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Orencio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In the answer to the
original petition and, later, to the amended Petition, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pendon</span>,
in the.</span> former, and, together with the other defendants, in the latter,
alleged that <span class="SpellE">Trabasas</span> had voluntarily abandoned the
land in dispute<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that Santiago <span class="SpellE">Penistan</span> is working, not on said land, but on another land;
and that <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Penistan</span>
is not her tenant, but merely helped his brother Santiago <span class="SpellE">Penistan</span>.
A counterclaim for damages was, also, set up in the answers to said petitions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues having been joined, on <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1962</st1:date> the case was set for hearing on October
17 of the same year, at the "<span class="SpellE">Sala</span> of the Justice
of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Molave</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
<span class="GramE">del</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon receipt of notice thereof, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Exaltacion</span> A. Navarro, of said Tenancy Mediation
Commission, acting as counsel for <span class="SpellE">Trabasas</span> moved for
postponement of the hearing to November 6, 1962, upon the ground that she could
not be at <span class="SpellE">Molave</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> on October 17, 1962, because the next day she
had to be at <span class="SpellE">Dumanjug</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
to attend the hearing of CAR Case No. 415Cebu, which had been set for hearing
earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copy of said motion for
postponement was served upon Atty. Benjamin S. <span class="SpellE">Rallon</span>,
counsel for Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pendon</span> and her aforementioned
codefendants, who, together with Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pendon</span>, are
hereinafter referred to as petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The latter allege under oath that Atty. Navarro, moreover,
informed Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rallon</span> that the hearing scheduled for
October 17 would definitely be postponed, because owing to said CAR Case No.
415 <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, to be heard in <span class="SpellE">Dumanjug</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, she (Atty. Navarro) could not Possibly be in <span class="SpellE">Molave</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, on said date; that, relying upon said motion for
postponement and the assurance thus given by Atty. Navarro, herein petitioners
and their counsel not appear at the premises of the justice of the Peace Court
of <span class="SpellE">Molave</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, until November 6, 1962; that, to their surprise, <span class="SpellE">Trabasas</span>, his counsel, and the CAR Commissioner or Judge
did not show up; and that, upon his return to <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
City, where he resides and has his office, on November 11, 1962, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rallon</span> was informed by CAR Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Alinsug</span>
that he (<span class="SpellE">Alinsug</span>) had heard Case No. 30 at <span class="SpellE">Molave</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, on October 17, 1962, <span class="SpellE">Trabasas</span>
and his counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mabanag</span>, having been present
then.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereupon, or on <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="11">November
 15, 1962</st1:date>, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pendon</span> filed a motion to
set aside the proceedings thus held on October 17, upon the ground that she had
not attended the same for the reasons already adverted to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, notwithstanding, on December 24, 1962,
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pendon</span> received copy of the decision of Judge
Jose R. <span class="SpellE">Cabatuando</span> of the Court of Agrarian
Relations, commanding her to reinstate <span class="SpellE">Trabasas</span> as
her tenant, ordering her codefendants to vacate the landholding in question,
should they be in possession thereof, senÂ­tencing her (Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pendor</span>)
to pay to <span class="SpellE">Trabasas</span> the sums specified in said
decision, and dismissing the counterclaim of petitioners herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 4, 1963, the latter filed a motion for reconsideration
and new trial, which was denied in a CAR resolution date February 15, 1963,
notice of which was served upon the petitioners on March 12, 1963 Soon
thereafter, or on April 2, 1963, petitioners commenced the present action for
certiorari against Judge <span class="SpellE">Cabatuando</span> and <span class="SpellE">Trabasas</span>, to annul the aforementioned decision and the
resolution denying petitioners' motion for reconsideration and new trial, and
to restrain the execution of said decision, upon the ground that respondent
judge had acted with grave abuse of discretion, amounting to excess of
jurisdiction, in rendering said decision and in issuing the aforementioned
resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, respondents maintain that petitioners' predicament
is due to their own counsel, for having allegedly relied upon the motion for
postponement of Atty. Navarro and the assurance said to have been given by her,
to the effect that the hearing scheduled for October 17 would definitely be
postponed, for no order granting said motion had been issued, apart from the
fact that petitioners had a plain, adequate and speedy remedy in the ordinary
course of law, which was to appeal from said decision and resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon consideration of all the circumstances obtaining in this
case, we find that petitioners herein have been denied due process and that the
aforementioned decision and resolution are, therefore, null and void.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is not denied that Atty. Navarro, on behalf of <span class="SpellE">Trabasas</span>, as plaintiff in CAR Case No. 30, filed a motion
for postponement of the hearing scheduled to take place in <span class="SpellE">Molave</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, on
October 17, 1962, upon the ground that she had to be in <span class="SpellE">Dumanjug</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, on October 18, 1962, to attend to CAR Case No.
415 <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, which had been set for hearing
earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Navarro was a member of
the staff of the Tenancy Mediation Commission and, hence, a public Officer,
whose word petitioners' counsel had no reason to doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, she did not appear at <span class="SpellE">Molave</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, on <st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="10">October 17, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mabanag</span>, who
had signed the original petition of <span class="SpellE">Trabasas</span>, as well
as the latter, were, however, present at <span class="SpellE">Molave</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>, on said date.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If <span class="SpellE">Mabanag</span> was then available, the allegations
made in said motion for postponement were, not merely misleading, but, also,
deceptive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is implied therein
that <span class="SpellE">Trabasas</span> would have no counsel to assist him at
the hearing of CAR Case No. 30 unless the motion was granted, for, otherwise,
it would have been unnecessary to seek its postponement.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this point, we must not overlook the fact that the CAR had its
share in placing Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rallon</span> in a difficult
situation, because the motion for postponement was filed on October 2 and was
set for hearing on October 6, and, yet, it was not resolved by the court,
although it had sufficient time to do so before October 17; that, in the
language of Justice <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">" x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> While Hodges' counsel had no right to assume that Atty.
Guerrero's motion to postponement would be granted, and good practice perhaps
demanded that they should have made an inquiry about the matter, yet the court
was not entirely justified in expecting the claimant's attorneys to come over
from a distant province for a trial which through no fault Of theirs could not
be carried out as the court knew or ought to have known.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the least, the court might have promptly
denied the motion for continuance and informed the parties that the hearing
would take place on the date originally set.â<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rallon</span>
is a resident of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City: and that, he was morally
bound to avoid the expenses necessary to make a trip to <span class="SpellE">Molave</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, for a
hearing he was reasonably justified in believing it was not likely to take
place, especially considering that this was the first postponement sought in
the case; that it was asked by the very plaintiff therein; that it was filed
over two (2) weeks before the scheduled hearing; that the property involved in
the case is a small parcel of land, barely 3.5 hectares: and that his main
client (Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pendon</span>) does not appear to be
particularly well off financially.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Even though petitioners counsel may not have been entirely
blameless for having accepted on its face value the allegations made and those
implied in the motion for postponement by an officer of the Republic who
represented <span class="SpellE">Trabasas</span>, it was a grave abuse of discreÂ­tion
on the art of respondent Judge, amounting to excess of jurisdiction, to deny
petitionersâ motion for reconsideration and new trial, because <span class="SpellE">Trabazas</span> was thereby allowed to profit by and take
advantage of a mistake committed by petitioners' counsel due to his (<span class="SpellE">Trabasas</span>) aforementioned motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This cannot sanctioned or tolerated by courts
of justice without violating the elementary principles of fair play and due
process, which go to the very roots of our legal system, and without impairing
the peopleâs faith in the inherent validity and soundness thereof or
undermining the very foundation of the Rule of Law. </p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that petitioners could he appealed from the decision
and the resolution complained of and that, as a general rule, the writ of
certiorari may be availed of to offset one's failure to appeal,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a> In
the case at bar such failure was due, however, to accident and excusable
neglect on the part of petitionersâ counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">In This connection it should be noted that copy of the decision
complained of was received by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rallon</span> on <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="12">December 24, 1962</st1:date>. Eleven (11) days
later, or on <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1963</st1:date>,
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rallon</span> filed his motion for reconsideration and
new trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notice of the order of the
lower court denying the motion was received by him on March 12, <span class="GramE">Having</span> previously consumed 11 of the 15 days he had to
appeal from said decision, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rallon</span> had 4 days or
up to <st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1963</st1:date>,
within which to perfect the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Meanwhile, his office in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>
was however, destroyed by fire, which, likewise, consumed his records,
including those of CAR Case No. 30.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
the other hand, the CAR records thereof were not available for examination to
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rallon</span> unless he went to <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>
where the records are kept,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> and this he could not do without <span class="SpellE">Ioss</span> of time, which was vital to his client.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rallon</span>
did the best he could, by filing his notice of appeal as soon as possible, or
on March18, which turned out to be two (2) days <u>late</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, he prepared petition in the case
at bar, which he finished on March 25, and air mailed it, together with 11
copies thereof and a P40.20 money order for the filing fees, on March 27, 1963,
to the Clerk of Court of the Supreme Court, who received, the same on April 2,
1963.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the aforementioned fortuitous event<span class="GramE">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a>could have had no effect upon
petitioners herein were it not for <span class="SpellE">Trabasas</span>'
misleading and deceptive motion for postponement, which is the basic cause of
the situation confronting us, we feel that the equities in this case are
sufficient to warrant its exclusion from the operation of the rule adverted to
above, as an exception thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the aforementioned decision and resolution of
respondent Judge are hereby declared null and void, without special
pronouncement as to costs.</p>
