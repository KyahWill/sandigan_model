Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, in an information filed by the

o'clock in the evening, and within the jurisdiction of the court, the said
accused, both policemen of the municipa­lity of <span class="SpellE">Naujan</span>,
Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, aiding one ano­ther, with treachery

Salazar, who <span style="">was </span>mistaken by the

the said <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> Salazar, a gunshot wound at the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts of the case, as
disclosed from the evidence, are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Late in the afternoon of November 12, 1959, appellant <span class="SpellE">Constancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, together
with Felipe Cornelio, <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span> <span class="SpellE">Frayre</span>,
Gregorio Mercado and <span class="SpellE">Jugo</span> <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>,
all policemen of the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Naujan</span>, Oriental
<span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, went to the house of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Amando</span> <span class="SpellE">Melgar</span> in barrio San Jose
No. 2, <span class="SpellE">Naujan</span>, Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>,
to inquire from Mayor <span class="SpellE">Melgar</span> what benefits would be
accruing to them for the services they have rendered as policemen, inasmuch as
they were contem­plating of tendering their resignation in view of the defeat
of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Melgar</span> in the election of that year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> was in
civilian clothes carrying about his person his service pistol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, said policeman went to a store in
front of the house of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Melgar</span> owned by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Garchico</span>, where they drank wine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Yolando</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>, a friend of the policemen joined them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They commented about the rumor coming from
the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Inarawan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Naujan</span>,
where Andres <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>, a defeated candidate for coun­cilor
in the last election, a Liberal, had said that Mayor <span class="SpellE">Melgar</span>,
a <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>, lost in the elections because of the
abuses of the police force of <span class="SpellE">Naujan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They discussed about what as be was best to
take under the circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
course of the conversation, Cornelio remarked that if there was some truth to
the rumor, something would happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appar­ently,
the group entertained a general feeling of resentment against Andres <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cornelio
and <span class="SpellE">Frayre</span> volunteered to go and ask <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span> about the rumor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They left the store and proceeded to the house of <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>
which was about 400 meters away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
way, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sarabia</span></span><span style=""> </span>who followed them, tried to dissuade
them from seeing <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>, but they proceeded
nevertheless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon arrival in the house,
<span class="SpellE">Papasin</span> invited Cornelio and <span class="SpellE">Frayre</span>,
and the latter told the former that they would like to talk about something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sara­bia</span> did not go
up but stayed by the gate of the fence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was later joined by appellant <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, and
the two waited at the gate.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a while, <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span> went down and
proceeded to the store of Minerva <span class="SpellE">Montejo</span>, opposite
the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cornelio and <span class="SpellE">Frayre</span> followed him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>
also followed but they stayed only by the door of the store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inside the store were Gregorio Mercado and <span class="SpellE">Jugo</span> <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Papasin</span> ordered
drinks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly thereafter, a heated
discussion between Cor­nelio and <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span> ensued, in
the course of which Cornelio bluntly told <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>
about the rumor attributed to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Papasin</span> denied the charge; he asked Cornelio who gave him
the information, and the latter said he would call the person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, Cornelio was sa­tisfied with the
explanation of <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Frayre</span>, how­ever,
was not satisfied, and in an ugly mood said:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"<span class="SpellE">Tirahin</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">iyan</span>."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
hearing those words, appel­lant <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> pulled out
his .45 caliber gun and was about to fire at <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>
when <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Garing</span>, who was
standing beside appellant <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, grabbed the gun
and foiled his attempt against <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon <span class="SpellE">Papa­sin’s</span>
wife arrived and she led her husband out of the store and together they
returned to their house.</p>

<p class="BODY">After <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span> had left, <span class="SpellE">Frayre</span> broke <span style="">the </span>bottles
on the table.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, Cornelio, Mercado, <span class="SpellE">Frayre</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span> went back to
the store in front of the house of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Melgar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the store of <span class="SpellE">Montejo</span>,
appellant <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> was heard to have said that he was
going home to the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> and took the road that
passes by the house of <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span> followed
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mer­cado also followed and joined
appellant <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> in going back to the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> where they were still assigned for duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>
stopped under a tamarind tree opposite house of <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>,
which <span style="">was about 20 meters to the house
of <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>, and waited there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, friends of <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>
arrived in a jeep driven by Antonio Valencia.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Garing</span> told <st1:country-region><st1:place>Valencia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to advise <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span> not to go down the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span>
Salazar, a cousin of <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>, arrived and also told <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span> not to go out of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:country-region><st1:place>Valencia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
stood near his jeep which was parked in front of the house of <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Shortly thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> Salazar
went down the house, crossed the road and proceeded to the co­conut groove to
take the shortcut path to his house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That road taken by Salazar, however, leads towards the very place where
appellant <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> was at the time waiting under the
tamarind tree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when Sala­zar was
about 15 meters away from appellant <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, the
latter fired his gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After firing,
appellant <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> emerged from under the tamarind
tree, moved to an <span class="SpellE"><u>atis</u></span> tree nearer to Salazar,
and from there, at a distance of 6 to <span style="">8
</span>meters, successively fired two more shots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Salazar fell.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon seeing his victim fall, appellant <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>
ran away, but in his hurry, he bumped his head against a <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">guyabano</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>tree.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He fell to the ground, and as soon <span style="">as </span>he had recovered, he pursued his way
passing at the back of the house of the barrio lieutenant until he reached the
house of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Melgar</span> which he entered through the
back door.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Antonio Valencia declared

Jose No. 2, <span class="SpellE">Naujan</span>, Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>;
he saw appellant at the foot of the <span class="SpellE"><u>atis</u></span> tree
from which place he fired his gun towards the direction where the sun sets;
Salazar passed by going towards the plantation; he saw appellant when he
hurriedly left the <span class="SpellE"><u>atis</u></span> tree, but he stumbled;
the distance between appellant and the place where the man fell was bet­ween 5
to 7 meters; the place where appellant fired the shot was </span>a <span style="">higher elevation, and at that time he
(witness) was about 15 meters away from the appel­lant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

declared that when Salazar was shot by the appellant, Salazar was about 5
meters from the <span class="SpellE"><u>atis</u></span> tree where <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> was standing, and, since according to Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Angcao</span>, on that particular night, a person at a distance of
5 meters could be recognized, <u>ergo</u>, "the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Constancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> that he could
not possibly mistook Salazar, when he knows for a long time, for <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>, stands credited.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Conversely, the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Yolando</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span> that at the aforementioned distance, accused <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> shot and killed Salazar, is </span><span style="">inherently improbable that it could not be
given credit." (p. 17, brief.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The argument implies that appellant <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>
did not shoot the victim, for, at a distance of 5 meters, said appellant could
not have failed to re­cognize Salazar, and as the latter was a friend, he had
no reason or cause to shoot him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
corollary thereto, appellant argues "that the aforementioned bullet came
not from the gun of <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> but from somebody
else."</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be noted that the argument is anchor-red on an inference
drawn upon an assumed fact, that at that particular time and place, the appel­lant
had recognized Salazar, and he will not shoot him because he was a friend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inference, however, <span style="">is </span>rebutted
by the testimony of no less than three eyewitnesses, one of them a fellow
policeman, and they declared that they saw the appellant fire the shots, and
they were positive thereof because the spark of the <span class="SpellE">gunburst</span>
<span style="">came </span>from
the place where the appellant was hidden, and after the firing, the appel­lant

5 meters away from <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> when <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>
fired his second shot direct­ed towards a man about 15 meters away and saw the
man fell." <span style="">Yet, "<u>he did
not know the direction where the man was walking</u>," </span>and counsel
argues, "It <span style="">is </span>apparent from the foregoing testimony of this witness a
showing of mark self-contradiction that are not badges of truth or sincerity
for if he could not pos­sibly determine even the direction where the man was
walking at that aforementioned distance, it logically follows that he could not
see a man fell down at that distance, much <span style="">less, </span>determine that the bullet that
hit that man came from the gun of <span class="SpellE">Constancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, taking into consideration that it was about 7:30

<p class="BODY">The argument <span style="">is </span>misleading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel
failed to take into account the witness' other answers on direct and

fired the second volley of shots, the witness was only 5 meters away from him,
and after the firing, <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> emerged from the place

<p class="BODY">Appellant testified that before November 12, 1959 he did not have

coming from the house of <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>, he believed that <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span> fired it; he did not think that the shot was
intended for him; however, he became afraid, be­cause he knew that <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span> had a gun; he ran towards the tamarind tree where

while he was talking with some of his visitors, he heard two shots in front of

Cornelio, who were in front of his house, for the cause of the firing; after a
while, he saw <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> with a wound on his fore­head;

<p class="BODY">The claim of <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> that he did not
have a misunderstanding with <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span> may be true, in

confronted each other, but the evidence shows that on the night in question,
when the group of policemen were in the store and were commenting on the rumor
attributed to <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>, and when <span class="SpellE">Frayre</span>,
in an ugly mood said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Tirahin</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">iyan</span>";
<span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> drew out his service pistol and prepared to

was behind him, grab­bed his pistol.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That he entertained resentment and ill-feeling against <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>, is further shown by the fact, as testified to by
his fellow-policeman Grego­rio Mercado, and corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Yolando</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>, that when <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>
had left the store to go to his house, <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>
followed him, and once he was in front of the house of <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>,
he stopped and hid under the tamarind tree, and waited thereat, and when he saw
a man coming down the house of <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>, and be­lieving
him to be <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>, he shot at the man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The overt act of the appellant shows his
intent to kill.</p>

have any misunderstand­ing and they were in fact in good terms, the very core
and substance of his whole defense - is highly incredible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such testimony remained not only
uncorroborated but as has al­ready been heretofore shown, had been contradicted
by his previous sworn statement, Exhibit A, executed by him the next day after
the commission of the crime when he did not have the opportunity to
contrive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His claim is likewise belied
by the testimony of his own friend and brother police­man who positively
testified that <span style="">they saw him shoot his
gun at the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, when he
ran away to Mayor <span class="SpellE">Melgar's</span> house after supposedly
firing the shots in the air, he avoided the straight and direct road to the
house of the Mayor, and instead went thru a circuitous and dark route by the
back­yard and coconut grooves, as a result of which he suffered a wound on the
head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only a guilty cons­cience would
try to sneak away un­noticed from the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> believed
that the shot he heard was not intended for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If these were true and he wanted to make
known </span><span style="">his
</span><span style="">presence as an offi­cer of the
law, why did he not go into the open, approached <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>
and make the formal inquiries, in­stead of running away like a fugitive from
justice?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">As he did not
report the matter to the Mayor, the theory of the prosecution that <span class="SpellE">Gue­varra</span> sought sanctuary and refuge in the house of the
Mayor who was his benefactor and godfather in marriage, gains validity and
credibility.</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in his confession made the day after the crime, he admitted
that he was in the store of <span class="SpellE">Mon­tejo</span> with his
fellow-policemen, and they had agreed to ask <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>
to account for his utterances against the police force; that when his
fellow-policemen left the store, he too left the place; that passing by in
front of the house of <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>, and claiming to have
heard the cocking of a gun followed by a shot, he hid under a tamarind tree in
front of the house of <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>, and waited thereat,
and when he saw a man cowing to­wards him, he fired at him believing him to be <span class="SpellE">Papasin</span>; that his distance to the man he shot was 14
meters; that he used his service pistol caliber .45.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fore­going salient facts in the
confession of the appellant have been corroborated by the witnesses of the
prose­cution, and one of them his fellow-policeman, Gregorio Mercado, who had
no motive or cause to testify in the manner he did pointing an accusing finger
to the appel­lant as the man whom he saw shoot the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over, the forehead injury of the
appellant is an undis­puted fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
witnesses of the prosecution said that appellant's head injury was caused when
he bumped his head against a <span class="SpellE"><u>guyabano</u></span> tree
while running <span style="">away from the place after
having shot the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant failed
to account where he received his fore­head injury, and why he had to hide in
the store-room of the house of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Melgar</span> like a
common criminal, instead of giving an official account of his where­abouts to
his superior officer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To the findings made and conclusion arrived at by the trial
court, We fully agree, it appearing that it is sustained by the evidence on the
record, and We find no reason to depart from the settled rule that appellate
courts will not interfere with the conclusion of the trial court concerning the
credibility of wit­nesses for the latter is in a better position to appre­ciate
the same, having seen and heard the witnesses themselves and observed their <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span> and manner of testifying during the trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime committed by the appellant is murder qualified by
treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he shot the victim,
appellant was then well hidden behind a tree that the victim, who was unarmed
and unaware, had no way of de­fending himself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, appellant employed means, me­thods or forms to insure the
execution of the crime, without risk to <span class="GramE">himself</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the appellant committed the act with intent to kill and with
treachery, the purely accidental circumstance that as a result of the shots a
person other than the one intended was killed, does not mo­dify the nature of
the crime nor lessen his criminal responsibility, and he is responsible for the
conse­quences of his acts.</p>

<blockquote>"The qualifying circumstance of treachery may be properly
considered, even when the victim of the attack was not the one whom the
defendant intended to kill, if it appears from the evidence that neither of the
two persons could in any manner put up defense against the attack or become
aware of it." (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Guillen</span>, 85 Phil.,
907; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, et al., 82 Phil. 808;
People vs. <span class="SpellE">Mamasalayan</span>, 92 Phil. 639; People s. <span class="SpellE">Gabbunton</span>, L-2435, May 10, 1950.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The aggravating circumstance of evident preme­ditation cannot be
appreciated because the deceased was not the intended victim (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Guillen</span>, <u><span style="">supr</span>a</u>);
neither the aggravating circumstance of night time may be appreciated for the
reason that the same is already absorbed in the qualifying circumstance of
treachery; nor the aggravating circumstance of superior strength for the reason
that only appellant <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> was responsible of the
crime, or that of official position for the reason that there is no proof that
the appellant has used the influence, pres­tige, or <span class="SpellE">ascendency</span>
which his office gives him as the means by which he realized his purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. Rod­riguez, 19 Phil. 156.)</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision is affirmed in all respect, with
costs against the appellant.</p>
