of respondent Judge, then presiding over the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Branch VIII, in 1) taking cognizance of Civil Case
No. 12384 for Damages with Preliminary Injunction filed by private respondent;
2) issuing a Restraining Order on October 16, 1969 and a Writ of Preliminary
Injunction on December 8, 1969; and 3) in promulgating a Deci­sion making said
injunctive Orders permanent, and sentencing petitioners to pay damages and
attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main thrust of petitioners' submission is that jurisdiction
properly belonged to the Court of Industrial Relations on the ground that
private respondent's suit (Civil Case No. 12384) for Damages with Preliminary
Injunction is "interrelated, inter­woven, or connected with acts of unfair
labor practice" and partakes of a labor dispute.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The records bare the following antecedents:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent Francisco DE JESUS is the
owner-operator of the "<span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span> Highway
Lines" (AHL, for short), a public service entity operating around 40
buses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in September, 1969, some
employees and workers of said transportation company organized themselves into
a union known as the <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span> High­way Lines
Employees' Union, petitioner herein, and affiliated itself with the <span class="SpellE">Pambansang</span> <span class="SpellE">Kilusan</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Paggawa</span> (hereinafter referred
to as AHLEU-KILUSAN).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
was duly registered with the Depart­ment of Labor and was issued Registration
Permit No. 6283-IB on <st1:date year="1969" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The individual peti­tioners are officers of
petitioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a letter dated <st1:date year="1969" day="15" month="9">September
 15, 1969</st1:date>, AHLEU-KILUSAN informed the AHL through private respondent
DE JESUS of its organization and due registration and requested for an
immediate conference between the company and the union representatives.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Attached to the letter was a list of proposals for a Collective Bargaining
Agreement among which were union recognition, union security job security,
grievance machinery and others.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently, no action was taken by AHL on the aforesaid letter,
as on September 29, 1969, AHLEU­-KILUSAN filed with the Bureau of Labor
Relations a Notice of Strike against the AHL for acts constituting unfair labor
practice under Republic Act No. 875, such as refusal to bargain, coercion,
discrimination against Union members in trip assignments, and violation of other
labor laws, among others.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>On <st1:date year="1969" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1969</st1:date>, AHLEU-KILUSAN declared a strike
against the AHL and established a picket line.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the strike was lifted the next day since conciliation
negotiations were undertaken by peti­tioners and DE JESUS with the assistance
of the Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span>, according to
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter contend further
that in the conference of <st1:date year="1969" day="4" month="10">October 4,
 1969</st1:date>, a "Return to Work Agreement" was arrived at in
principle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, when the draft for
said Agreement was presented at a conference to be held on <st1:date year="1969" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1969</st1:date>, DE JESUS did not attend the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, a representative of his
came and informed petitioners that AHL had already entered into a Collective
Bargaining Agreement with the <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span> Highway Lines
Employees' Association, affiliated with Philippine Transport and General
Workers Organization (AHLEA- PTGWO).<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
AHLEU-KILUSAN then resumed its picketing on <st1:date year="1969" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1969</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the following day, <st1:date year="1969" day="16" month="10">October
 16, 1969</st1:date>, DE JESUS filed with the lower Court a Complaint for Damages
with Preliminary Injunction against AHLEU-­KILUSAN and its officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Complaint alleged essentially that 1) AHL
had already entered into a Collective Bargaining Agreement with the AHLEA­-PTGWO
on September 10, 1969; 2) petitioners, who called an illegal strike against AHL
on October 15, 1969 and posted picket lines along its compound and around the
gasoline station owned by it, are not employees of the Company; 3) petitioners
pre­vented the employees of AHL from performing their work by means of threats,
violence and intimidation; 4) DE JESUS suffered material loss and damages in
the sum of P11,000 by reason of non-operation of his buses, and daily damages
in the amount of P4,000.00 due to illegal acts of petitioners in preventing and
blocking customers from <span class="SpellE">AHL's</span> gaso­line station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Complaint then prayed that Pre­liminary
Injunction be issued <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> enjoining
the petitioners from continuing their illegal acts; for payment of actual
damages in the amount of P15<span class="GramE">,000</span> plus moral damages in
the discretion of the Court; and attorney's fees in the amount of P6,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date of October 16, 1969, respondent Court issued an
ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> Restraining Order enjoining petitioners
"from continuing with their illegal acts and from posting their picket lines
along AHL pre­mises and on such places as are within the Certificate of Public
Convenience issued to (AHL)", and set the application for Preliminary
Injunction for hearing on October 29, 1969.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The Restraining Order is first challenged herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1969</st1:date>,
petitioners filed an Urgent Motion to Lift Restraining Order and/or to Dismiss
Complaint, which was opposed by DE JESUS.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="22" month="11">November 22, 1969</st1:date>,
upon manifestation of both parties, respondent Court considered the appli­cation
for the issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction submitted for resolution
on the basis of the pleadings, without oral argument.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1969</st1:date>,
respondent Court issued a Writ of Preliminary injunction, also questioned
herein by petitioners, upon DE JESUS' filing of a bond of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
rationalizing as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The main question before the Court is whether defendants are
employees of plaintiff (De Jesus).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During the hearing on the writ of preliminary injunction, defendants did
not present any evidence to prove that they are employees of the plain­tiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, plaintiff in his complaint
strongly denies the re­lationship of employer and employee between plaintiff
and defendants under oath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere
allegations in defendants' opposition to the issuance of the writ of
preliminary in­junction that defendants are employees of plain­tiff, without
evidence in support of it cannot divest this Court of jurisdiction over a case
of damages as set out in plaintiff's complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Until and unless it is established by convincing evidence that the rela­tionship
between plain­tiff and defendants is one of employee and em­ployer and the
incident from which the present case arose is one of a labor dispute a bare
claim in defendants' opposition to the writ asserting such relationship and
such dispute cannot divest this Court of jurisdiction."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In a letter dated <st1:date year="1969" day="21" month="12">December
 21, 1969</st1:date>, AHLEU-KILUSAN formally offered to return to work under
the same terms and conditions as prior to the strike, effective <st1:date year="1969" day="26" month="12">Decem­ber 26, 1969</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 p.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp;

However, DE JESUS refused to accept said offer to return to work on the ground
that the employees listed in said letter were not legitimate employees of his
company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>DE JESUS also called at­tention
to the pending case between him and the peti­tioners.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">AHLEU-KILUSAN then filed Charge No. 3294, dated <st1:date year="1970" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1970</st1:date>, against AHL and DE

The Charge essentially averred that private respondent refused to reinstate all
the striking employees to their former positions "without justifiable
reasons but to harass, discriminate, and coerce said striking employees because
of their union <span class="SpellE">activites</span> and affiliations".<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

And on <st1:date year="1970" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1970</st1:date>,

<p class="BODY">For the resolution of the jurisdictional issue posed, we refer to
the Industrial Peace Act (Repub­lic Act No. 875), which was the governing
statute at the time of the controversy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 5 (a) of that Act explicitly provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC. 5.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Unfair Labor Practice Cases.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- (a) The Court (of Industrial Relations)
shall have jurisdiction over the prevention of unfair labor practices and is

shall not be affected by any other means of adjust­ment or prevention that has
been or may be estab­lished by an agreement, code, <span class="GramE">law</span>
or otherwise. (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to what is constitutive of "unfair labor practice",
Section 4 of the same Act states:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 4.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Unfair Labor Practice.</span>

<blockquote>(a) <span style=""> </span>It shall be unfair labor practice for an em­ployer:</blockquote>

<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To refuse to bargain collectively with
the represent­atives of his employees subject to the provisions of sections
thirteen and fourteen."</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The seed of the controversy herein germinated from an alleged
unfair labor practice, particularly, the refusal of AHL to take action on
petitioner AHLEU-<span class="SpellE">KILUSAN's</span> proposals for a Collective
Bargaining Agreement. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>By reason thereof,
that <st1:place>Union</st1:place> declared a strike, which was called off the
next day due to conciliation negotiations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, however, DE JESUS refused to sit in conference with
AHLEU-KILUSAN<b> </b>on the ground that AHL had already entered into a Collective
Bargaining Agreement with another labor union, the AHLEA-PTGWO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That precipitated the picketing by petitioner
AHLEU-KILUSAN, which DE JESUS sought to enjoin in Civil Case No. 12384 filed
before respondent Court, and which the latter should not have taken cognizance
of.</p>

<p class="BODY">We restate what Justice J.B.L. Reyes, speaking for the Court in
the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Leoquinco</u></span>, <u>et</u> <u>al</u>. <u>vs</u>.

aptly said:</p>

<blockquote>"The authority of the Court of Industrial Relations to take
cognizance of cases connected with the carrying out of a strike is well re­cognized
in this jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a long line of
decided cases this Court has held that where the acts com­plained of in the
petition for injunction are found to arise out of or to be con­nected with any
case ex­clusively belonging to the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial
Relations, the case shall be heard by the said court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In those instances, the court of first
instance shall be without jurisdiction to issue any injunctive writ, whether
temporary or per­manent, to restrain the conducting by strikers of activities
related to, or connected with, the labor dispute, and where the in­junction is
indeed proper, recourse may be had to the <st1:street><st1:address>Industrial
  Court</st1:address></st1:street> where the main action belongs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Neither does a Court of First Instance have concurrent
jurisdiction with the Court of Industrial Relations over labor disputes arising
out of unfair labor practices.</p>

<blockquote>"Labor disputes arising out of unfair labor practices com­mitted
by any of the parties do not present a question of con­current jurisdiction
between the Court of First Instance and the Court of Industrial Relations, but
that jurisdiction over such matters is vested exclusively in the Court of
Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that a
civil case was filed ahead in the Court of First Instance than the filing of
the unfair labor practices charge in the <st1:street><st1:address>Industrial
  Court</st1:address></st1:street> does not deprive the Court of Industrial
Relations of its jurisdiction"<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Although it was artfully made to appear that the suit was one for
<span class="GramE">Damages, that</span> did not divest the Court of Industrial
Relations of its jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Complaint itself, in paragraph 5, adverted to an "illegal strike" and
"picket lines", which are but mere incidents or consequences of the
unfair labor practice complained against by petitioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it is clear that the cause of
action for damages "arose out of or was necessarily intertwined with"
an alleged unfair labor practice committed by DE JESUS in refusing to sit at
the bargaining table.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is still the
labor Court, therefore, that has jurisdiction, particularly under the principle
that split jurisdiction is not to be countenanced for being "obnoxious to
the orderly administration of justice."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE"><u>Leoquinco</u></span> <u>case</u>, <span class="GramE">supra.,</span> it was also maintained that the action was not
against the strike or the strikers but was a simple demand for payment of
damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court, through Justice
J.B.L. Reyes, held:</p>

<blockquote>"This is not the first time that the argument was presented
before and ruled on by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the<b> </b>case of Erlanger and <span class="SpellE">Galinger</span>, Inc. vs.
Erlanger &amp; <span class="SpellE">Galinger</span> Employees Asso­ciation (104
Phil 17), in­volving practically the same set of facts, the resort to the court
of first instance by the com­pany to restrain the strikers' allegedly unlawful
act of preventing the entrance into the company premises of the non-striking
employees and from molesting and harass­ing the company officials and agents,
was declared improper, the recourse being to institute appropriate action in
the Court of Industrial Rela­tions and there to secure the necessary
restraining order under Section 9 (d) of the Industrial Peace Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, overruling the con­tention that the
petition was for damages cognizable by the court of first ins­tance, this Court
said:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'While there is merit in petitioner's claim that the lower court
should not have dismissed its entire petition on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction, because said petition also asks for the pay­ment of damages
suffered by the company on account of the alleged acts of violence and coercion
committed by the respondent Union in the course of its picket­ing of
petitioner's premises, whether or not such damages are recover­able, and to
what extent, would still have to de­pend on the evidence in the unfair labor
practice case between the parties pending in the Court of Industrial Relations,
and its final outcome.'</p>

<blockquote>In other cases where the same question of
court jurisdiction was put in issue, because of the allegation of damages
against the strikers, this Court sustained the authority of the Court of
Industrial Relations, thus:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Neither would the claim for damages suf­fice to keep the case
within the jurisdictional boundaries of the court of first instance. That claim
is interwoven with unfair labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The legality or illegal­ity of the strike must necessarily be litigated
in the unfair labor practice case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
the right to damages would still have to depend on the evidence in the unfair
labor practice case -- in the CIR. To allow Civil Case No. 60864 to prosper
would be to bring about split juris­diction -- which is obnoxious to the or­derly
administration of justice.' (Asso­ciated Labor Union vs. Gomez, L-25999,

<p class="BODY">And <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span> jurisdiction stays even if no
unfair labor practice case has been filed with the CIR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is enough that unfair labor practice is

<p class="BODY">Since respondent Court was without jurisdiction over the subject
matter of Civil Case No. 12384, neither did it have the authority to provide
for the ancillary writ of preliminary injunction.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Further­more, even if it could take cognizance of the dispute, respondent Court
did not follow the procedure laid down by law for the issuance of injunction.</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><b> </b>in
order that an injunction may be properly issued the procedure laid down in
section 9 (d) of Republic Act 875 should be followed and cannot be granted <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> as allowed by Rule 60, section 6 of the Rules
of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason is that the case,
involving as it does a labor dispute, comes under said section 9(d) of the
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That procedure requires that there
should be a hear­ing at which the parties should be given an oppor­tunity to
present witnesses in support of the complaint and of the opposition, if any,
with opportunity for cross-examination, and that the other conditions required
by said section as pre­requisites for the grant­ing of relief must be
established and stated in the order of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unless this procedure is followed, the
proceedings would be invalid and of no effect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court would then be acting in excess of its jurisdiction"<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as exclusive jurisdiction over unfair labor practice
cases lies in the Court of Industrial Relations, the lack of employer-employee
relationship alleged by DE JESUS is a matter of defense which may be properly
raised in the Court of Industrial Relations.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Another clear proviso of the Industrial Peace Act overlooked by
respondent Judge is section 9(d), which provides that a temporary restraining
order is effect­ive for no longer than five days and becomes void at the
expiration of said five days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records
reveal that the Restraining Order, issued on <st1:date year="1969" day="16" month="10">October 16, 1969</st1:date>, continued in full force and effect
until Injunction was issued on <st1:date year="1969" day="8" month="12">December

<p class="BODY">All told, and as enunciated by Chief Justice Fernando in <span class="SpellE">Cyphil</span> Employees Association - NATU vs. Pharmaceutical
Industries, Inc. (supra.) "<span class="GramE">the</span> impress of
deceptive plausibility that could be affixed through artful advocacy to a
