Commonwealth Act No. 58, the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> may provide 
by ordinance for the collection of <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> shipping 
concerns whose vessels dock at the public wharves or piers located in said city 
but owned by the National Government The ordinance, No, 207, was purportedly 
enacted by the Municipal Board on August 14, 1956 and approved by the City Mayor 
on the following August 27. Plaintiffs paid the <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> charges under protest since September 1, 1966 and 
on May 8, 1957 filed this action in the Court of First Instance of Manila to 
have the said ordinance declared void, its enforcement enjoined in so far as the 
wharves, docks and other landing places belonging to the National Government 
were concerned, and all the amounts thus for collected by defendants refunded by 
them.</p>
<p>The court a quo dismissed the complaint after trial and the case has come to 
us on appeal by plaintiffs.</p>
<p>Appellants have raised some questions of fact, and in particular point out 
certain events and circumstances to show that ordinance No. 207 was not and 
could not have been enacted, as alleged by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, 
on August 14, 1956. This case, however, may be decided solely on the legal issue 
presented by the parties.</p>
<p>The Municipal Board's authority to pass the ordinance is claimed by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> under section 17 (w) of the charter of the City of 
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> of 
which states:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p><span class="GramE">"Section 17.</span> <u>General <span class="GramE">powers</span> and duties of the Board</u>.—Except at otherwise 
provided by law, and subject to the conditions and limitations thereof, the 
Municipal Boards shall have the following legislative powers:</p>
<p>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></p>
<p>(w) To fix the charges to be paid by all watercraft landing at or using 
public wharves, docks, levees, or landing places."</p></blockquote>
<p>The lower court ruled, upholding <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' 
contention in this respect, that in using the terms "public wharves, dock, 
levees or landing places," the legislature made no distinction between those 
owned by the National Govern-m and those owned by the City of 
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> and 
that consequently both fall within the scone of the power granted. Appellants 
assail this construction as erroneous, first in the light of the generally 
accepted meaning of "public wharf" as it may have a bearing on the right or 
authority to charge <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> and, secondly, in view of 
other related provisions of the same city charter.</p>
<p>The word "public”, as employed to describe a wharf, does not refer to its 
ownership either by the National Government or by a province or municipality. It 
denotes rather the nature of its use. Thus public wharves have been held to be 
those used generally by the public, free of charge or for compensation, while a 
private wharf is one whose owner or lessee has exclusive enjoyment or use 
thereof (Hamilton vs. Portland State Pier Site District, 112 A. 836). Piers or 
landing places and wharves may be private or they may be, in their nature, 
public, although the property may be in an individual owner, where the latter is 
under obligation to concede to others the privilege of landing their goods or of 
mooring their vessels there, upon payment of a reasonable compensation as <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> (<span class="SpellE">Duttoon</span> vs. Strong, 17 
Law, Ed. 29, 1 Black 35, 66 U.S. 339). So a wharf may be public whether it 
belongs to the National Government, to a municipal corporation or to a private 
individual or concern.</p>
<p>Assuming the public character of a wharf by reason of its availability for 
public use, the right to impose <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues rests on 
a different basis—that of ownership. For <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> is a 
charge against the vessel by way of rent or compensation for its being allowed 
to lie alongside a wharf for the purpose of loading or unloading freight (Phil. 
Sugar Centrals Agency vs. Insular Collector of Customs, 51 Phil. 131, citing 
Parkersburg, 27 Law Ed. 584) and River Transportation Co. vs. City of 
Parkersburg, 27 Ed. 584) and, of course, for the use of the artificial 
facilities offered for that purpose (City of Shreveport vs. B River and Coast 
lane, 55 Am. Rep. 504). That the right to charge <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> is based on ownership has been impliedly recognized 
by this Court in Province of <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> vs. Cruz, 74 
Phil. 108, as follows: ". . . the subsequent classification of the port of <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span> as a national port did not, and was not intended to, 
divest the province of <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> of its part ownership 
of the wharf and, accordingly, of its right to collect <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> for its use as it had theretofore done"; and "not 
until its complete ownership has become vested in the National Government by the 
mode of transfer provided by law may the province of <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> be divested of this right."</p>
<p>Under the foregoing test the right to collect the <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> in question here belongs to the National 
Government, as in fact it has always collected the same from appellants. It is 
unreasonable to conclude that the legislature, simply because it employed the 
term "public wharves'' in section 17 (w) of the charter of the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, thereby authorized the latter to collect <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> irrespective of the ownership of the wharves 
involved. The National Government did not surrender such ownership to the city; 
and there is no justifiable ground to read into the statute an intention to 
burden ship owners, such as appellants, with the obligation of paying twice for 
the same purpose.</p>
<p>Legislative intent must be ascertained from a consideration of the statute as 
a whole and not of an isolated part or a particular provision alone. This is a 
cardinal rule of statutory construction. For taken in the abstract, a word or 
phrase might easily convey a meaning quite different from the one actually 
intended and evident when the word or phrase is considered with those with which 
it is associated. Thus an apparently general provision may have a limited 
application if viewed together with other provisions.</p>
<p>Section 17 (w) of the charter of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> is a case in point. It 
authorizes the Municipal Board to fix he charges to be paid by all watercraft 
landing at or using <u>public</u> wharves, docks, levees, or landing places. 
There is indeed no distinction therein between public wharves owned by the 
National Government and those owned by the city itself. But the subsection 
immediately preceding (v) impliedly establishes such a distinction. It empowers 
the Municipal Board "to provide for the construction and maintenance, and 
regulate the use, of public landing places, wharves, piers, docks and levees." 
It seems fairly evident that when the law-making body used the term "public 
wharves, etc." in subsection 2 it meant to refer to those mentioned in the 
preceding subsection, namely, the "public wharves, etc." constructed and 
therefore owned by the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>. Section 30 of the 
charter has a similar bearing on the question, in granting to the City Engineer 
"the care and custody of all <u>public</u> docks, wharves, piers, levees, and 
landing places, <u>when erected</u>" —undoubtedly referring to those constructed 
and owned by the city. For in so far as those belonging to the National 
Government are concerned they remain under the exclusive control, direction and 
management of the Bureau of Customs, according to section 1142 of the Revised 
Administrative Code. And appellants have accordingly been paying to the National 
Government fees for the use of <span class="GramE">its wharves in 
</span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cebu</span></span></st1:place><span class="GramE">, pursuant to law, 
particularly Republic Act No. 1371, which took effect on </span><st1:date month="7" day="1" year="1955"><span class="GramE">July 1, 
1955</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> and was</span> later on embodied in the 
new Tariff and Customs Code.</p>
<p>The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> ruled that Section 17(w) of the city charter is 
"plainly evincive of the power to tax for revenue purposes,” and therefore the 
<span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> charges imposed by ordinance pursuant thereto 
are proper even the amounts actually collected are much more than h may be 
justified as license fees under the police power of regulation of "shipping 
offices" granted under section 17 (1) of the same charter. The power to tax is 
an attribute of sovereignty and for it to be exercised by municipal corporation 
requires a clear delegation of power by means of a charter grant or by a general 
enabling statute. The power is not inherent in a municipal corporation (<span class="SpellE">Saldaña</span> vs. City of 
<st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>, 104 Phil, 28; 55 Off. <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>., 10267), and if there is any doubt as to whether or not 
such power has been delegated to it the doubt must be resolved negatively (We 
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Wa</span></span> Yu vs. City of 
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Lipa</span></st1:place></st1:city>, 54 
O.G. 4055).</p>
<p>But even if the <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues authorized under 
Section 17 (w) be considered as taxes for revenue, such authority nevertheless 
is limited to public, wharves, docks, levees and other landing places belonging 
to the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> and not to those owned by the 
National Government under the exclusive supervision of the Bureau of 
Customs.</p>
<p><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the judgment appealed from is reversed; 
Ordinance No. 207 of the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> is declared null 
and void, and <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> are ordered to refund to 
appellants all amounts collected <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> and to 
refrain from making such collection. <span class="GramE">Costs against <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</span></p>
