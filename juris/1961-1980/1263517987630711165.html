				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal, taken by both parties, from a decision of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing consi­derations, the
Court hereby renders judgment declar­ing as null and void the Sheriff's sale of
the proper­ties of the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> de Guzman

therewith including the Notice of Attach­ment or Levy, Notice of Sheriff's
Sale, Certificate of Sale and Final Deed of Sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The injunction is­sued in this case is hereby

hereby ordered to enforce the writ of execution against <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span>
de Guzman Jr. by first pro­ceeding against his personal properties and when the
same are insufficient to go against the real properties in the manner provided
by law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that on September 13, 1960, herein
defendant-appellant Dolores L. Santos, as <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span>
of the estate of Amador Santos, filed with the municipal court of San Juan del
Monte, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, an action for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> (Civil Case No. 1814), against herein plaintiff-appellant
<span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> de Guzman, Jr. and one <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
Santos to eject both, for breach of contract, from a house and lot situated at
No. 54 Riverside Street, within said municipality, allegedly leased by Mrs.
Santos to De Guzman, and subleased by the latter to <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
Santos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the filing of defendants'
answer, <span class="SpellE">controverting</span> the alleged breach of contract,
and due trial, judgment was rendered on <st1:date year="1960" day="22" month="11">November 22, 1960</st1:date>, dismissing the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mrs. Santos appealed to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, where the action was docketed as Civil Case No.
6512.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On motion of said appellant, dated
March 20, 1961, that court declared De Guzman and <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
Santos in default, the next day, and soon thereafter, or on April 3, 1961,
rendered a decision sentencing them to vacate the aforementioned premises and
deliver the possession thereof to Mrs. Santos, as well as to pay her the sum of
P6,600.00, as accrued rentals for 11 months of 1960, in addition to P600.00 a
month from January 1961, until delivery of said premises to Mrs. Santos, with
interest at the rate of 6% per annum, apart from the sum of P200.00 as
attorney's fees and the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On motion of Mrs. Santos, filed on April 7, 1961, the corres­ponding
writ of execution was issued on April 14, 1961, in pursuance of which, Benito <span class="SpellE">Macrohon</span>, as Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
acting through his deputy sheriff, <span class="SpellE">Liberato</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>, issued, on April 19, 1961, a notice of attachment
and levy on several real properties, one of which is a residential house and
lot of about 1,140 sq. m., located at the corner of Stanford and Shaw
Boulevard, <span class="SpellE">Wack-Wack</span>, munici­pality of <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, and covered
by TCT No. 77090, in the name of De Guzman.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After publishing the corresponding notice of Sheriff's sale in the <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> Era, a newspaper of general circulation in <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, published in the Spanish language, said house and
lot were, on <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="6">June 12, 1961</st1:date>,
sold, at public auction, to the judgment creditor, Mrs. Santos, for the sum of
P10,313.20.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1962</st1:date>, the Sheriff issued the "officer's
deed of absolute sale" of said property to Mrs. Santos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day, she moved that De Guzman be
ordered to surrender the owner's duplicate of TCT No. 77090, in view of which,
the Court ordered him, on June 25, 1962, to show cause why the motion should
not be granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1962</st1:date>, De Guzman filed his opposition to
the motion, as well as moved to quash the writ of execution and "to annul
all proceedings of the Sheriff <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>, including
the notice of attachment or levy, the notice of sheriff's sale, the certificate
of sale and final deed of <span style="">sale." </span>On
<st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1962</st1:date>, Mrs. Santos
filed her opposition to this motion, which was denied on <st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, or on July 12, 1962, De Guzman had commenced the
present action, in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
- in which it was docketed as Civil Case No. 7266 - against Mrs. Santos,
Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Macrohon</span> and Deputy Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>, to annul the default judgment in Civil Case No.
6512 of said court, the certificate of sale and the deed of absolute sale above
referred to, as well as to recover damages and secure a writ of preliminary
injunction, to restrain said defendants from procuring the surrender and cancel­lation
of De Guzman's TCT No. 77090 of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writ of preliminary injunction was issued
the day following.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, said
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, upon the ground "that there is
another action pending between the same parties and for the same cause," -
referring to De Guzman's motion of <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="7">July
 6, 1962</st1:date>, in Civil Case No. 6512 - but the motion (to dismiss) was
denied, on <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the defendants filed their
answer with counterclaim, to which De Guzman replied sea­sonably.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due course, thereafter, the court of first
instance rendered its aforementioned decision - annulling the sheriff's sale,
making the injunction permanent, dismissing defendants' counterclaim and
directing the sheriff "to enforce the writ of execution against <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> de Guzman Jr. by first proceeding against his per­sonal
properties and when the same are insufficient to go against the real properties
in the manner provided by law" - from which both parties have appealed
directly to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">De Guzman maintains that the lower court should have annulled the
judgment in default rendered in Case No. 6512, whereas the defendants aver that
said court erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in denying their
motion to dismiss, instead of dismissing the present action as being barred by
a prior judgment or order; (2) in annulling the sheriff's sale, includ­ing the
certificate of sale and the deed of absolute sale executed in favor of Mrs.
Santos; (3) in not dismissing the action of De Guzman upon the ground of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>; and (4) in dismissing the counterclaim of Mrs.
Santos.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal taken by plaintiff De Guzman is anchored <span style="">upon the </span>theory that the judgment in
default rendered against him in Civil <span style="">Case
</span>No. 6512 is void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span>
for lack of notice to him:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) of the
receipt by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> of
the record of <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> <span style="">case </span>No. 1814 of the municipal court of San Juan del Monte; and
(2) <span style="">of the </span>motion of Mrs.
Santos, dated March 20, 1961, to declare the defen­dants in said Civil Case No.
6512 in default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contention is
clearly devoid of merit for notice of receipt of said record <span style="">was sent </span>by the Clerk of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, on February 22, 1961, and
served on March 1, 1961, upon Atty. <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Cabrera,
the then <u>counsel of record of De Guzman</u>, and it is well settled that no­tice
upon such counsel is notice upon his client.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, service of said notice would have been defective had it been
made upon the latter, instead of to the former.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Then, again, it has been re­peatedly held that a defendant who has not filed
his answer or mo­tion to dismiss within the period provided by law <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> is not entitled to notice of the motion filed to
declare him in default.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants allege that the lower court should have granted
their motion to dismiss, dated July 28, 1962, predicated upon the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of another action between the same parties and for
the <span style="">same </span>cause and that, in any
event, the present case should have been dis­missed, upon the ground that it is
barred by a prior judgment or order, namely, that issued on August 31, 1962, in
Civil Case No. 6512, denying the motion of De Guzman, of July 6, 1962, praying
that the writ of execution issued in that case be quashed, that the sheriff's
proceedings <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> - including the notice of
attachment or levy, the notice of sheriff's sale, the certificate of sale and
the deed of absolute sale executed in favor of Mrs. Santos - be annulled, and
that her motion of June 22, 1962, for the surrender of the owner's duplicate of
TCT No. 77090, be denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be
noted, how­ever, that the present action was commenced on <st1:date year="1962" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1962</st1:date> or about a month and a half <u>before</u>
said order of <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, such order was <u>subsequent</u>
to the filing of the complaint in the present case and, accordingly, could not
have barred its insti­tution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, let us grant, merely for the purpose of
argument, that said motion of De Guzman of <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1962</st1:date>, and that of Mrs. Santos, dated <st1:date year="1962" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1962</st1:date>, for the surrender of
the owner's duplicate of TCT No. 77090, may be considered as an
"action." Is the "cause" therein the same as that set up in
the case at bar?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, it
should be noted that the latter seeks <span style="">to
annul the </span>judgment rendered in Civil Case No. 6512, which, if valid, <span style="">was </span>concededly final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> prior to <st1:date year="1962" day="22" month="6">June
 22, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, such was
the theory therein sustained by Mrs. Santos, and such <span style="">was, in</span>deed, the position taken by the court of first instance in
said case No. 6512, in its order of <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="8">August
 31, 1962</st1:date>, which, as a consequence, did <u>not</u> pass upon the
merits of the issue on the validity of said judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it was thus impliedly held
that such <span style="">issue </span>could not
fittingly be settled in case No. 6512.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the proper forum for its determination is the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">Concerning the sale at public auction made in favor of Mrs.
Santos, on June 12, 1961, the lower court declared it null and void, upon the
ground of:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) lack of proper service to
De Guzman of the requisite notice of levy or attachment of the real property in
ques­tion; <span style="">(2) </span>insufficient
publication of the notice of the sheriff's sale; (3) failure of the sheriff to
proceed against the personal properties of De Guzman, to satisfy the money
judgment in favor of Mrs. Santos, before selling his aforementioned real
property; and (4) gross inade­quacy of the sale price.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the first ground, De Guzman affirms that he has not
been notified, either personally or by registered mail, of the attach­ment or
levy of the real property in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the other hand, defendants maintain that copy of the notice of
attachment or levy <span style="">was </span>served
upon De Guzman, through his mother, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pacita</span> de
Guzman, who stays in said property, but refused to acknowledge receipt of said
copy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the last ground,
it appears that His Honor, the trial Judge, had made an <span style="">ocular </span>inspection of the property and found that the house therein
is one "of strong materials and the wood used" therein "belong
to the best group of native wood, that the pre­mises are properly landscaped
and fully improved and <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>is located in about
the best place in <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>"
- at the corner of Stan­ford and Shaw Boulevard, which is "very near the
aristocratic <span class="SpellE">Wack</span> <span class="SpellE">Wack</span> Golf
and Country Club and about a kilometer away from the Provincial Government of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>" - and that the property, with all its
improvements, is easily worth over P200,000.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In relation to the third ground, the decision appealed from has the
following to <span style="">say, the </span>accuracy
of which is not disputed by herein defendants-appellants:</p>

<blockquote>"In the case at bar, it is beyond dispute that <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> de Guzman Jr. owns personal properties worth
several times more than the personal judgment against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not only borne out by the testimonies
of said party and his mother <span class="SpellE">Pacita</span> de Guzman but is
con­firmed by the Court in its ocular inspection of the pre­mises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the Sheriff's representative only wanted
to execute the judgment against <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> de Guzman Jr.
out of his personal properties he could have easily done so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear that the debtor in this case was
never given a chance to settle his obligation out of his personal properties
because the Sheriff's representative never took the serious trouble of seeing
the debtor personally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the extent
of de Guzman <span class="SpellE">Jr.'s</span> personal properties, opposing
counsel in his memoran­dum makes mention of said personal properties to be
worth about P80,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Although much can be said in favor of the foregoing findings of
the lower court, We deem it unnecessary to dwell upon the same and pass upon
the merits of the grounds therein relied upon, in view of the conclusion We had
reached in connection with the second objection to the contested sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the pertinent part of Section 16, Rule 39, of the Old
Rules of Court, now Section 18, Rule 39 of the present Rules, provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 18.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Notice of
sale of property on execution</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-
Before the sale of property on execution, notice thereof must be given as
follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(a) xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b) xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span style="">(c) </span>In case of real property, by posting a similar notice particularly
describing the property for twenty (20) days in three public places in the
municipality or city where the property is situated, and also where the pro­perty
is to be sold, and, if the assessed value of the property exceeds four hundred
pesos (P400), by publish­ing a copy of the notice once a week, for the same
period, in some newspaper published or having general circulation in the
province, if there be one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there are
newspapers published in the province in both the English and Spanish languages,
then a like publication for a like period shall be made in one newspaper
published in the English language, and in one published in the Spanish
language."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to this provision, before a real property can be validly
sold on execution, when its assessed value exceeds P400 - that of the property
in question is P58,780 - notice of the scheduled <span style="">sale, </span>particularly describing the property, shall be posted <u>for
20 days</u> in three public places in the municipality or city where it is
situated, and, in addition thereto, copy of said notice shall be published,
once a week, <u>for the same period</u>, "in one newspaper published in
the English language, and in one published in the Spanish language" -
"(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)f there are newspapers published in the
province in both the English and Spanish languages." It is not denied that
there are such newspapers, published in both languages, with general circu­lation
in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, the notice of the contested <span style="">sale </span>was published for not more than <u><span style="">15 days</span></u><span style=""> </span>(on May 15, 22 and 29) and in <u>one</u> (1) newspaper only,
the <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> Era, published in the Spanish language,
which has a very limited circulation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is thus manifest that the publication made in the case at bar has not complied
with the aforementioned provision and that the sale made to <span style="">Mrs. </span>Santos is, accordingly, null and
void<span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Herein defendants insist that the right of De Guzman to question
the aforesaid irregularities in the publication of the notice of sale had been waived
by him when, on June 5, 1961, he asked that the sale, ori­ginally scheduled for
that date, be postponed to June 12, "without need of further publication
nor posting of said sale." This request entailed a waiver of the
publication of another notice as to the <u>date</u> of the sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not imply a renunciation of the right
to question the same for <u><span style="">non-publication</span></u><span style=""> </span>of the notice in a newspaper
published in the English language, and for the failure of the <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> Era to publish the notice for <u><span style="">twenty</span></u><span style=""> </span>(20) days.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plea of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> set up by the
defendants-appellants is based upon Mateo vs. Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> which is not in point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That case was predicated upon the rule that
"when the time in which the debtor may redeem from a <u><span style="">valid</span></u><span style=""> </span>sale of his property has expired, he has no further right to or
interest in the property sold." This certainly is the rule <u><span style="">when there has been a valid sale</span></u><span style="">, </span>not when the sale is null and void,
as it is in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may not be amiss to note that, since the rendition of the default
judgment in Civil Case No. 6512, on <st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="4">April
 3, 1961</st1:date>, appellant De Guzman has been far from negligent in the
assertion of his rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on April
14, 1961, he filed a manifestation adopting by reference the answer filed by
him and <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> Santos in the municipal court of San
Juan del Monte.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date, he
filed a motion to set aside the order of default and for the admission of said
answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notice of the order denying that
motion having been served upon his counsel, on <span style="">May </span>2, 1961, De Guzman filed, on June 1, 1961, a motion for re­consideration
and new trial, dated May 28, 1961, which <span style="">was denied </span>on June 12, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the same date, he filed a motion to quash the writ of execution and
to dismiss the case, which <span style="">was </span>denied
on June 21.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, he filed a motion for
reconsideration, dated July 20, which was denied on <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1961</st1:date>,
he filed a notice of appeal, to which Mrs. Santos countered with a motion to
dismiss the appeal, which was granted on <st1:date year="1961" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, De Guzman instituted Case CA-G.R. No. 30911-R of the Court
of Appeals, against Mrs. Santos, the provincial sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
and His Honor, the trial Judge, for writs of certiorari, prohibition, mandamus
and preliminary injunction, to restrain the trial court from further pro­ceeding
in Civil Case No. 6512, and to annul its order of September 20, 1961 dismissing
the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Case CA-G.R. No.
30911-R was dismissed by the Court of Appeals on <st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
came De Guzman's motion of July 6, 1962, in Civil Case No. 6512, to <span style="">quash </span>the writ of execution issued
therein and annul all proceedings of the sheriff <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>,
which was followed, on July 12, 1962, by the in­stitution of the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus clear that plaintiff-appellant herein is not guilty of
<span class="SpellE">laches</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Being a mere corollary of the preceding questions, which have
already been disposed of, the counterclaim for damages of defendant Dolores L.
