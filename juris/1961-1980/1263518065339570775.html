				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case presents another aspect of the court-martial
proceedings against the petitioner, Major Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Martelino</span>,
<u>alias</u> Abdul <span class="SpellE">Latif</span> <span class="SpellE">Martelino</span>,
of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and the officers and men under him, for
violation of the 94th and 97th Articles of War, as a result of the alleged
shooting on March 18, 1968 of some Muslim recruits then undergoing commando
train­ing on the island of <span class="SpellE">Corregidor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once before the question was raised before
this Court whether the general court-martial, con­vened on April 6, 1968 to try
the case against the petitioners, ac­quired jurisdiction over the case despite
the fact that earlier, on March 23, a complaint for frustrated <span class="SpellE">muder</span> had been filed in the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span>
office of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> City by <span class="SpellE">Jibin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Anula</span> (who claimed to have been wounded in the
incident) against some of the herein petition­ers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proceedings had to be suspended until the
jurisdiction is­sue could be decided, On <st1:date year="1969" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1969</st1:date> this Court ruled in favor of the
jurisdiction of the military court.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The jurisdiction question thus settled, attention once again
shifted to the general court-martial, but no sooner had the proceedings resumed
than another hitch developed this came about as the petitioners, the accused in
the court-martial proceedings, in turn came to this Court, seeking relief
against certain orders of general court-martial.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that at the hearing on <st1:date year="1969" day="12" month="8">August 12, 1969</st1:date> the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Martelino</span>
sought the disqualification of the president of the general court-martial,
following the latter's admission that he read newspaper stories of the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Corregidor</span></st1:place> incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner contended that the case had
received such an amount of publicity in the press and other news media and in
fact was being exploited for political purposes in connection with the
presidential election on <st1:date year="1969" day="11" month="11">November 11,
 1969</st1:date> as to imperil his right to a fair trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After deliberating, the military court denied
the challenge.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter the petitioners raised peremptory challenges against
Col. Alejandro, as president of the court-martial, and Col. <span class="SpellE">Olfindo</span>,
Lt. Col. <span class="SpellE">Camagay</span>, Lt. Col. <span class="SpellE">Valones</span>,
Lt. Col. <span class="SpellE">Plan­co</span> and Col. <span class="SpellE">Malig</span>,
as members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With regard to peremptory
chal­lenges it was the petitioners' position that for each specification each
accused was entitled to one such challenge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They later changed their stand and adopted that of the trial judge
advocate that "for each specification jointly tried, all of the accused
are entitled to only 1 peremptory challenge; and that with respect to the
specifi­cations tried commonly, each one of the accused is entitled to one
peremptory challenge."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They there
contended that they were enti­tled to a total of eleven peremptory
challenges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand the
court-martial ruled that the accused were entitled to only one peremptory
challenge as the specifications were being jointly tried.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners therefore filed this petition for <i style=""><u>certiorari</u></i> and prohibition, to
nullify the orders of the court-martial denying their challenges, both
peremptory and for cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They allege
that the adverse publicity given in the mass media to the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Corregidor</span></st1:place> incident, coupled with the fact
that it became an issue against the administration in the 1969 elections, was
such as to unduly in­fluence the members of the court-martial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to peremp­tory challenges, they
contend that they are entitled to eleven such challenges, one for each
specification.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1969</st1:date>
this Court gave due course to the peti­tion, required the respondents as members
of the general court-martial to answer and, in the meantime, restrained them
from proceeding with the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their answer the respondents assert that despite the pub­licity
which the case had received, no proof has been presented showing that the court-martial's
president's fairness and impar­tiality have been impaired. On the contrary,
they claim, the peti­tioner's own counsel expressed confidence in the
"integrity, ex­perience and background" of the members of the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a pre­liminary consideration,
the respondents urge this Court to throw out the petition on the ground that it
has no power to review the proceedings of the court-martial, "except for
the purpose of as­certaining whether the military court had jurisdiction of the
per­son and subject matter, and whether, though having such jurisdiction, it
had exceeded its powers in the sentence pronounced," and that at any rate
the petitioners failed to exhaust remedies availa­ble to them within the
military justice system.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that civil courts as a rule exercise no supervi­sion
or correcting power over the proceedings of courts-martial, and that mere
errors in their proceedings are not open to consi­deration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The single inquiry, the test, is
jurisdiction."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is equally true that in the exercise
of their undoubted discretion, courts-martial may commit such an abuse of
discretion - what in the language of Rule 65 is referred to as "grave
abuse of discre­tion" - as to give rise to `a defect in their
jurisdiction.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is precisely the point at issue in this
action suggested by its nature as one for <i style=""><u>certiorari</u></i>
and prohibition, namely, whether in over-ruling the petitioners' challenges,
the general court-martial com­mitted such an abuse of discretion as to call for
the exercise of the corrective powers of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus obvious that no other way is open
to this Court by which it may avoid passing upon the constitutional issue
thrust upon it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor will the fact that
there may be available remedies within the system of military justice bar
review considering that the questions raised are questions of law.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">And so the threshold question is whether the publicity given to
the case against the petitioners was such as to prejudice their right to a fair
trial. As already stated, the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Martelino</span>
challenged the court-martial president on the ground that newspa­per accounts
of what had come to be referred to as the "<span class="SpellE">Corregidor</span>
massacre" might unduly influence the trial of their case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner's counsel referred to a news
item appearing in the July 29, 1969 issue of the <u>Daily</u> <u>Mirror</u> and
cited other news reports to the effect that "coffins are being prepared
for the President (of the Philippines) in <span class="SpellE">Jolo</span>,"
that according to Senator <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> "massa­cre
victims were given sea burial," and that Senator <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>,
opposition Vice Presidential candidate, had gone to <span class="SpellE">Corregidor</span>
and "found bullet shells."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
addition the petitioners cite in this Court a <st1:city><st1:place><u>Manila</u></st1:place></st1:city>
<u>Times</u> editorial of <st1:date year="1969" day="26" month="8">August 26,
 1969</st1:date> which states that "The <span class="SpellE">Jabidah</span>
[code name of the training operations] issue was bound to come up in the course
of the election campaign.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The oppo­sition
could not possibly ignore an issue that is heavily loaded against the
administration."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners
argue that under the circumstances they could not expect a just and fair trial
and that, in overruling their challenge for cause based on this ground, the
general court-martial committed a grave abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of their contention they invoke
the rulings of the United States Supreme Court in <u>Irvin v. Dowd</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE"><u>Rideau</u></span><u> v.

</u></p>

<p class="BODY">An examination of the cases cited, however, will show that they,
are widely disparate from this case in a fundamental sense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>Irvin</u>, for instance, the Supreme
Court found that shortly after the petitioner's arrest in connection with six
murders committed in Vanderburgh County, Indiana, the prosecutor and police
officials issued press releases stating that the petitioner had confessed to
the six murders and that "a barrage of newspaper headlines, arti­cles,
cartoons and pictures was unleashed against him during the six or seven months
preceding his trial."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reversing
his convic­tion, the Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"Here the 'pattern of deep and bitter preju­dice' shown to be
present throughout the community, . . . was clearly reflected in the sum total
of the <span class="SpellE"><u>voir</u></span> <u>dire</u> examination of a
majority of the jurors finally placed in the jury box.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eight out of the 12 thought petitioner was
guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With such an opinion permeating
their minds, it would be difficult to say that each could exclude this
preconception of guilt from his deliberations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The influence that lurks in an opinion once formed is so persistent that
it unconsciously fights detachment from the processes of the average man. . .
.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where one's life is at stake - and
accounting for the frailties of human nature - we can only say that in the
light of the circumstan­ces here the finding of impartiality does not meet the
constitutional standards. "<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><u>Irvin</u> marks the first time a state conviction was struck
down solely on the ground of prejudicial publicity.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the earlier case of <u>Shepherd v. Florida</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
which involved elements of publi­city, the reversal of the conviction was based
solely on racial dis­crimination in the selection of the jury, although to
concurring Justice Jackson, who was joined by Justice Frankfurter, "It is
hard to imagine a more prejudicial influence than a press release by the
officer of the court charged with defendants' custody stating that they had
confessed, and here just such a statement <span class="SpellE">unsworn</span> to,
unseen, uncross-examined and <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>, was
conveyed by the press to the jury."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Rideau</u></span> the petitioner,
suspect in the robbery of a bank in <st1:place><st1:city>Lake Charles</st1:city>,
 <st1:state>Louisiana</st1:state></st1:place> and in the kidnapping of three of
its employees and in the killing of one of them, was similarly given
"trial by publicity."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
the day after his arrest, a moving pic­ture film was taken of him in an
"interview" with the sheriff.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The "interview," which lasted approximately 20 minutes,
consisted of interrogation by the sheriff and admission by <span class="SpellE">Rideau</span>
that he had perpetrated the bank robbery, kidnapping and murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inter­view was seen and heard on
television by 24,000 people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two weeks
later he was arraigned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His lawyers
promptly moved for a change of venue but their motion was denied and <span class="SpellE">Rideau</span> was convicted and sentenced to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rideau's</span> counsel
had requested that jurors be excused for cause, having exhausted all of their
peremptory challenges, but these challenges for cause had been denied by the
trial judge. In reversing his conviction, the Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"[W]e hold that it was a denial of due
process of law to refuse the request for a change of venue, after the peo­ple
of Calcasieu Parish had been exposed repeatedly and in depth to the spectacle
of <span class="SpellE">Rideau</span> personally con­fessing in detail to the
crimes with which he was later to be charged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For anyone who has ever watched tele­vision the conclusion cannot be
avoided that this spec­tacle, to the tens of thousands of people who saw and
heard it, in a very real sense <u>was</u> <span class="SpellE">Rideau's</span>
trial - at which he pleaded guilty to murder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Any subsequent court proceedings in a community so pervasively ex­posed
to such a spectacle could be but a hollow for­mality."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the third case, <u>Estes</u>, the Court voided a televised cri­minal
trial for being inherently a denial of due process.</p>

<blockquote>"The state . . . says that the use of television in the
instant case was 'without injustice to the per­son immediately concerned,'
basing its position on the fact that the petitioner has established no isola­table
prejudice and that this must be shown in order to invalidate a conviction in
these circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The State paints
too broadly in this contention, for this Court itself has found instances in
which a show­ing of actual prejudice is not a prerequisite to re­versal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is such a case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that in most cases involving
claims of due process deprivations we require a showing of identifiable
prejudice to the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless,
at times a procedure em­ployed by the State involves such a probability that
prejudice will result that it is inherently lacking in due process."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Sheppard</u>, the celebrated murder case of Sam Sheppard,
who was accused of the murder of his wife Marilyn, the Supreme Court observed a
"carnival atmosphere" in which "bedlam reigned at the courthouse
... and newsmen took over practically the en­tire courtroom, hounding most of
the participants in the trial, es­pecially Sheppard."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It observed that "despite the extent and
nature of the publicity to which the jury was exposed during the trial, the
judge refused defense counsel's other requests that the jury be asked whether
they had read or heard specific prejudicial com­ment about the case. ... In
these circumstances, we can assume that some of this material reached members
of the jury." The Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"From the cases coming here we note that unfair and
prejudicial news comment on pending trials has become increasingly prevalent,
Due pro­cess requires that the accused receive a trial by an impartial jury
free from outside influences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gi­ven the
pervasiveness of modern communications and the difficulty of effacing
prejudicial publicity from the minds of the jurors, the trial courts must take
strong measures to ensure that the balance is never weighed against the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And appellate tribunals have
the duty to make an independent eva­luation of the circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, there is nothing that proscribes
the press from reporting events that transpire in the courtroom. But where
there is a reasonable likelihood that prejudicial news prior to trial will
prevent a fair trial, the judge should continue the case until the threat
abates; or transfer it to another county not so permeated with publicity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition sequestration of the jury was
something the judge should have raised <span class="SpellE"><u>sua</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>sponte</u></span> with counsel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If publicity during the proceed­ing threatens the fairness of the trial,
a new trial should be ordered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we
must remember that reversals are but palliatives; the cure lies in those
remedial measures that will prevent the prejudice at its inception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The courts must take such steps by rule and
regulation that will protect their pro­cesses from prejudicial outside
interference. Neither prosecutors, counsel for defense, the accused, wit­nesses,
court staff nor enforcement officers coming under the jurisdiction of the court
should be permitted to frustrate its function.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Collaboration between coun­sel and the press as to information affecting
the fair­ness of a criminal trial is not only subject to regulation, but is
highly censurable and worthy of disciplinary measure."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In contrast the spate of publicity in this case before us did not
focus on the guilt of the petitioners but rather on the responsibility of the
Government for what was claimed to be a "mas­sacre" of Muslim
trainees. If there was a "trial by newspaper" at all, it was not of
the petitioners but of the Government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ab­sent here is a showing of failure of the court-martial to protect the
accused from massive publicity encouraged by those connec­ted with the conduct
of the trial,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
either by a failure to control the release of information or to remove the
trial to another venue or to postpone it until the deluge of prejudicial
publicity shall have subsided. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Indeed we
cannot say that the trial of the petitioners was being held under circumstances
which did not permit the obser­vance of those imperative decencies of procedure
which have come to be identified with due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">At all events, even granting the existence of "massive"
and "prejudicial" publicity, since the petitioners here do not con­tend
that the respondents have been unduly influenced but simply that they might be
by the "barrage" of publicity, we think that the suspension of the
court-martial proceedings has accomplished the purpose sought by the
petitioners' challenge for cause, by postponing the trial of the petitioner
until calmer times have re­turned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
atmosphere has since been cleared and the publicity surrounding the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Corregidor</span></st1:place> incident has so far abated that we
be­lieve the trial may now be resumed in tranquility.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<p class="BODY">Article of War 18 provides that "Each side shall be enti­tled
to one peremptory challenge, but the law member of the court shall not be
challenged except for cause."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
general court-martial originally interpreted this provision to mean that the en­tire
defense was entitled to <u>only</u> <u>one</u> peremptory challenge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sub­sequently, on <st1:date year="1969" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1969</st1:date>, it changed its ruling and held
that the defense was entitled to <u>eight</u> peremptory challenges, but the
petitioners declined to exercise their right to challenge on the ground that
this Court had earlier restrained further proceedings in the court-martial.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the submission of the petitioners that "for every
charge, each side may exercise one peremptory challenge," and therefore
because there are eleven charges they are entitled to eleven separate
peremptory challenges. The respondents, upon the other hand, argue that
"for each specification jointly tried, all of the accused are entitled to
only one peremptory challenge and that with respect to specifications tried
commonly each of the ac­cused is entitled to one peremptory
challenge."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although there are
actually a total of eleven specifications against the petitioners, three of these
should be considered as merged with two other specifications, "since in
fact they allege the same offenses committed in conspiracy, thus leaving a
balance of eight specifications."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The general court-martial therefore takes the position that all the 23
petitioners are entitled to a total of only eight peremptory challenges.</p>

<p class="BODY">We thus inescapably confront, and therefore now address, the
issue here posed.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are of the view that both the petitioners and the general
court-martial misapprehend the true meaning, intent and scope of Article of War
18.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As will hereinafter be demonstrated,
<u>each</u> of the petitioners is entitled as a matter of right to <u>one</u>
peremptory challenge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The number of
specifications and/or charges, and whether the accused are being jointly tried
or undergoing a common trial, are of no moment.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the early formative years of the infant Philippine Army, after
the passage in 1935 of Commonwealth Act No. 1 (otherwise known as the National
Defense Act), except for a handful of Philippine Scout officers and graduates
of the United States military and naval academies who were on duty with the
Philippine Army, there was a complete dearth of officers learned in military
law, this aside from the fact that the officer corps of the developing army was
numerically inadequate for the demands of the strictly mili­tary aspects of the
national defense program.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of
these considerations it was then felt that peremptory challenges should not in
the meanwhile be permitted and that only challenges for cause, in any number,
would be allowed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus Article 18 of the
Articles of War (Commonwealth Act No. 408), as worded on <st1:date year="1938" day="14" month="9">Sep­tember 14, 1938</st1:date>, the date of the approval of
the Act, made no men­tion or reference to any peremptory challenge by either
the trial judge advocate of a court-martial or by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <st1:date year="1958" day="17" month="12">Decem­ber 17, 1958</st1:date>, when the Manual for Courts-Martial<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Philip­pine Army became effective, the Judge Advocate General's Ser­vice
of the Philippine Army conducted a continuing and intensive program of training
and education in military law, encompassing the length and breadth of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This program was pur­sued until the outbreak
of World War II in the Pacific on <st1:date year="1941" day="7" month="12">December
 7, 1941</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the formal
surrender of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to the allies in 1945, the officer corps of the Armed Forces of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
had ex­panded to a very large number, and a great many of the officers had been
indoctrinated in military law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was in
these environ­mental circumstances that Article of War 18 was amended on <st1:date year="1948" day="12" month="6">June 12, 1948</st1:date> to entitle "each
side" to one peremptory challenge, with the sole proviso, that "the
law member of the court shall not be challenged except for cause."</p>

<p class="BODY">By its very inherent nature a peremptory, challenge does not
require any reason or ground <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> to exist or to
be stated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be used before,
during, or after challenges for cause, or against a member of the court-martial
unsuccessfully challenged for cause, or against a new member if not previously
utilized in <span class="SpellE">in</span> the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A member challenged peremptorily is forthwith
ex­cused from duty with the court-martial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The right of challenge comes from the common law with the trial
by jury itself, and has always been held essential to the fairness of trial by
jury.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">"As was said by Blackstone, and repeated by Mr. Justice
Story: 'In criminal cases, or at least in capital ones, there is <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>favorem</u></span> <u>vitae</u>, allowed to the Prisoner an
arbitrary and capricious species of challenge to a certain number of jurors,
without show­ing any cause at all, which is called a peremptory challenge; a
pro­vision full of that tenderness and humanity to prisoners, for which our
English laws are justly famous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
grounded on two reasons: 1. A s every one must be sensible, what sudden
impression and unaccountable prejudices we are apt to conceive upon the bare
looks and gestures of another; and how necessary it is that a pri­soner (when
put to defend his life) should have a good opinion of his jury, the want of
which might totally disconcert him; the law has conceived a prejudice even
without being able to assign a reason for his dislike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>2. Because, upon challenges for cause shown,
if the reason assigned prove insufficient to set aside the juror, per­haps the
bare questioning his indifference may sometimes provoke a resentment, to
prevent all ill consequences from which, the pri­soner is still at liberty, if
he pleases, peremptorily to set him aside.’”<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The right to challenge is in quintessence the right to reject,
not to select.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If from the officers who
remain an impartial mili­tary court is obtained, the constitutional right of
the accused to a fair trial is maintained.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As we have hereinbefore stated, <u>each</u> of the 23 petitioners
(accused before the general court-martial) is entitled to <u>one</u> peremptory
challenge,<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
irrespective of the number of specifications and/or charges and regardless of
whether they are tried jointly or in common.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Three overriding reasons compel us to this conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>First</u>, a peremptory challenge is afforded to an accused
who, whether rightly or wrongly, honestly feels that the member of the court
peremptorily challenged by him cannot try him, can not sit in judgment over
him, impartially.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every accused person
is entitled to a fair trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
enough that objectively the members of the court may be fair and
impartial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is likewise necessary that
subjectively the accused must feel that he is be­ing tried by a fair and
impartial body of officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because the
petitioners may entertain grave doubts as to the fairness or im­partiality of
distinct, separate and different individual members of the court-martial, it
follows necessarily that each of the ac­cused is entitled to one peremptory
challenge.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Second</u>, Article of War 18 does not distinguish between
common trials and joint trials, nor does it make the nature or number of
specifications and/or charges a determinant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Reference is made by the respondents here to <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.
  S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> military law, in support of their
argument that for each specification jointly tried all of the accused are
entitled to only one peremptory challenge and with respect to all
specifications tried in common each of the accused is entitled to one
peremptory challenge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have care­fully
scrutinized <st1:country-region><st1:place>U. S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
Military law, and it is unmistakable from our reading thereof that each accused
person, whether in a joint or common trial unquestionably enjoys the right to
one peremptory challenge.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Third</u>, a perceptive analysis of the companion articles<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
to Article 18 convinces us that the words, "each side," as used in
the said article in reference to the defense, should be construed to mean <u>each</u>
accused person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Articles of War 17
(Trial Judge Advocate to Prosecute; Counsel to Defend), 19 (Oath), 21 (Re­fusal
or Failure to Plead), 28 (Court to Announce Action), 29 (Closed Sessions), 30
(Method of Voting), and 36 (Irregularities - Effect of), unequivocally speak of
and refer to the "accused" in the singular.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, subject to our pronouncement that each of the
23 petitioners is entitled to one separate peremptory challenge, the present
petition is denied. The temporary restraining order is­sued by this Court on <st1:date year="1969" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1969</st1:date> is hereby

Compare <u>Cruz <i>v</i>. <span class="SpellE">Salva</span></u>, 106 Phil. 1151
(1959) in which this Court censured a fiscal for allowing wide publicity and
sensationalism to be given to an investigation of a criminal case be­ing
conducted by him.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">"However, according to the
petitioner and not denied by the respondent, the investigation was conducted
not in respondent's office but in the session hall of the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City evidently, to accommodate the big crowd that
wanted to witness the proceeding, including members of the press.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A number of microphones were installed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reporters were everywhere and photographers
were busy taking pictures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, apparently with the permission of, if not the encouragement by the
respondent, news photographers and newsmen had a field day. Not only this, but
in the course of the investigation,' as shown by the transcript of the
stenographic notes taken during said investigation, on two occasions, the
first, af­ter Oscar <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span> had concluded his
testimony, respondent <span class="SpellE">Salva</span>, addressing the
newspapermen said, 'Gentlemen of the press, if you want to ask questions I am
willing to let you do so and the questions asked will be reproduced as my own';
and the second, after Jose <span class="SpellE">Maratella</span> y de Guzman had
finished testifying and respondent Salvia, addressing the newsmen, again said,
'Gentlemen of the press is free to ask questions to the witness if you want
to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are willing to adopt the
questions as ours.' Why respondent was willing to abdicate and renounce his
right and prero­gative to make and address the questions to the witnesses under
investigation, in favor of the members of the press, is difficult for us to
understand, unless he, respondent, wanted to curry favor with the press and
publicize his investigation as much as possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fortunately, the gentlemen of the press to
whom he accorded such unusual privi­lege and favor appeared to have wisely and
prudently de­clined the offer and did not ask questions, this according to the
transcript now before us.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">"But, the newspapers certainly
played up and gave wide publicity to what took place during the investigation,
and this involved headlines and extensive recitals, narra­tions of and comments
on the testimonies given by the wit­nesses as well as vivid descriptions of the
incidents that took place during the investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seemed as though the criminal
responsibility for the killing of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Monroy</span> which
had already been tried and finally determined by the lower court and which was
under appeal and advisement by this Tribunal, was being retried and <span class="SpellE">redetermined</span> in the press, and all with the apparent
complaisance of respondent.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">"Frankly, the members of this
Court were great­ly disturbed and annoyed by such publicity and sensational­ism,
all of which may property be laid at the door of res­pondent <span class="SpellE">Salva</span>. In this, he committed what we regard a griev­ous
error and poor judgment for which we fail to find any excuse or satisfactory
explanation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His actuations in this
regard went well beyond the bounds of prudence, discretion and good taste.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is bad enough to have such undue publicity
when a criminal case is being investigated by the authorities, even when it is
being tried in court; but when said publicity and sensationalism is allowed,
even encour­aged, when the case is on appeal and is pending considera­tion by
this Tribunal, the whole thing becomes inexcusable, even abhorrent, and this
Court, in the interest of justice, is constrained and called upon to put an end
to it and a de­terrent against its repetition by meting an appropriate dis­ciplinary
measure, even a penalty to the one liable.</p>

Modern statutes allow peremptory challenges in all criminal pro­secutions and
fix the number for both the prosecutor and the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under some statutes the number of peremp­tory
challenges allowed defendants jointly indicted is the same as though there were
only one defendant, while under other statutes each defendant is allowed the
same number of challenges as though he were prosecuted individually.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some of these statutes increase the number of
challenges allowed the prosecution when the number of defendants is increased,
while under others the prosecution is only gi­ven additional challenges when
the defendants are entitled to additional challenges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See Vol. 5, Wharton's Criminal Law and
Procedure, tar. 1991, pp. 122-124, citing autho­rities.)</p>

of indictments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>Krause vs. United

three peremptory challenges on each indictment, citing, in support thereof,
