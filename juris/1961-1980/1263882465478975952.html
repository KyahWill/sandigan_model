				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, petitioners
seek the reinstatement of the order dated <st1:date month="11" day="4" year="1976">November 4, 1976</st1:date> of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Branch XII, at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
in Civil Case No. C-4032 granting their "Motion for Admission of
Answer" and admitting their "Answer", it appearing that said
order had been lifted and set aside in a subsequent order dated <st1:date month="1" day="21" year="1977">January 21, 1977</st1:date> reviving a previous
order of default, which the court reiterated in its order dated <st1:date month="3" day="21" year="1977">March 21, 1977</st1:date> denying their motion
for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners herein are the defendants in a complaint filed by
private respondents as the <span class="SpellE">lessors</span> of the premises
occupied by the former at 12 E. Alonzo Street, <span class="SpellE">Daang</span> <span class="SpellE">Hari</span>, <span class="SpellE">Navotas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, for the recovery <span style="">of </span>the value of certain improvements
allegedly destroyed, demolished and/or damaged by them, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) Two giant <span class="SpellE">patis</span>
tanks of poured concrete (<span class="SpellE">buhos</span>) worth P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> each ….. P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>; (2) <span class="SpellE">Steelmatting</span> gate and fences with adobe/concrete bases …..
P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>; (3) One <span style="">toilet bowl with water closet ….. P650.00, all <span class="SpellE">totalling</span>
P24<span class="GramE">,650.00</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners, as defendants below, were served summons through one
Helen <span class="SpellE">Avendaño</span>, an employee in petitioners' factory
and not the person-in-charge, on <st1:date month="8" day="12" year="1976">August
 12, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They allegedly
found the <span style="">said summons </span>after the
expiration of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period for filing the
answer, as said Helen <span class="SpellE">Avendaño</span> did not deliver the same
to the defendants but merely placed it in one of the tables in the office.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="9" day="22" year="1976">September 22, 1976</st1:date>,
petitioners filed their "Motion for Admission of Answer" and attached
thereto their "Answer" to the complaint but failed to attach the
proof of service of the aforementioned pleadings to the adverse parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was set for hearing on <st1:date month="10" day="6" year="1976">October 6, 1976</st1:date> by petitioners'
counsel but since the respondent Presiding Judge of the trial court was on
vacation leave on that date, the Acting Branch Clerk of Court issued a notice
to the parties resetting the hearing of said motion to <st1:date month="10" day="27" year="1976">October 27, 1976</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, on <st1:date month="10" day="13" year="1976">October
 13, 1976</st1:date>, respondents' counsel filed an "Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span> Motion to Declare Defendants in Default" and set
the same for hearing on <st1:date month="10" day="20" year="1976">October 20, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In resolving said motion, the trial court
issued an order on <st1:date month="10" day="26" year="1976">October 26, 1976</st1:date>
declaring the petitioners in default.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing of the "Motion for Admission of Answer"
of petitioners on <st1:date month="10" day="27" year="1976">October 27, 1976</st1:date>,
the trial court dictated an order in open court denying the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, upon discovery that said motion was
filed earlier than the "Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span> Motion <span style="">to </span>Declare Defendants in Default"
of respondents, the trial court changed the order of denial and instead
considered the said "Motion for Admission of Answer" submitted for
resolution of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then on <st1:date month="11" day="4" year="1976">November 4, 1976</st1:date>, the trial court
issued an order granting the same "it appearing that said motion was filed
before the plaintiffs asked that defendants be declared in default, for reasons
stated therein and in the interest of justice."</p>

<p class="BODY">Seeking <span style="">a <span style="">reconsideration of </span></span><span style="">the order dated </span><st1:date month="11" day="4" year="1976"><span style="">November 4, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondents filed
the </span><span style="">corresponding
pleading which was </span>set for hearing on <st1:date month="12" day="1" year="1976">December 1, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the said hearing, the trial court, on prayer of petitioners' counsel,
gave said counsel five (5) days from said date to file his opposition to the
motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But said counsel mailed his
opposition only on <st1:date month="12" day="13" year="1976">December 13, 1976</st1:date>,
or seven (7) days after the expiration of the period granted to him by the
trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In resolving the aforementioned "Motion for Reconsideration"
of respondents and the opposition of petitioners, the trial court noted three
(3) failures and/or omissions on the part of petitioners, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) failure to file answer within the period
provided by the Rules; (b) failure to furnish plaintiffs' counsel a copy of the
"Motion for Admission of Answer"; and (c) failure to file opposition
to the "Motion for Reconsideration" within the period prayed for by
defendants' counsel and granted by the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the trial court, on <st1:date month="1" day="21" year="1977">January 21, 1977</st1:date> granted the "Motion for
Reconsideration" of plaintiffs, lifted and set aside the order of <st1:date month="11" day="4" year="1976">November 4, 1976</st1:date> and reinstated the
order of <st1:date month="10" day="26" year="1976">October 26, 1976</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the filing of a "Motion for Reconsideration of the
Order Dated <st1:date month="1" day="21" year="1977">January 21, 1977</st1:date>"
by petitioners, the trial court stood firm on the order of default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition for
review on <i>certiorari</i>.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find the petition meritorious and accordingly give due course
to the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears from the facts <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
that at the time of the filing of the "Motion for Admission of
Answer" and the "Answer" by petitioners on September 22, 1976,
they were not yet legally in default for failure to answer on time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 1, Rule 11 of the Rules of Court
ordains that a party shall be declared in default "upon motion of the
plaintiff and proof of such failure." As held in <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Viacrusis</span></u></span><u><span style=""> vs. <span class="SpellE">Estenzo</span>, et
al., L-18457, </span></u><st1:date month="6" day="30" year="1962"><u><span style="">June </span>30, </u><u><span style="">1962</span></u></st1:date><u><span style="">, 5 SCRA 560</span></u><span style="">, t</span>he court cannot <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">proprio</span></u> declare a party in default.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents filed their "Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span>
Motion to Declare Defendants in Default" only on October 13, 1976 and due
to circumstances not attributable to the fault of petitioners, the trial court
heard the "Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span> Motion to Declare Defendants
in Default" on an earlier date although the "Motion for Admission of
Answer" of petitioners was filed ahead.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But upon discovery of said fact, the trial court granted the
"Motion for Admission of Answer" of petitioners "for reasons
stated therein and in the interest of justice."</p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion that becomes inescapable from the fact that
petitioners filed their answer before respondents asked for a declaration of
default is that respondents were not particularly diligent in the exercise of
their rights and that they were not in any way prejudiced by the late filing of
the answer by petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further,
there was no evidence showing that petitioners intended to unduly delay the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, petitioners even
attached their "Answer" to the complaint upon the filing of their
"Motion <span style="">for </span>Admission of
Answer" and did not even file an extension of time to file the same of any
other dilatory motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Most importantly, petitioners set forth in their
"Answer" facts which when duly proved may constitute good and
substantial defenses against the complaint of respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They alleged therein that they were not the
original lessees of the premises and at the time they entered into possession
of the same, the toilet bowl and the water closet were no longer in place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They further alleged that they replaced the <span class="SpellE">steelmatting</span> gate and the <span class="SpellE">steelmatting</span>
fences since they were already rotting due to the passage of time and the
elements. At any rate, they assured respondents that the discarded <span class="SpellE">steelmatting</span> materials and the toilet bowl and its complements
are still in the premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As regards
the two giant <span class="SpellE">patis</span> tanks, they alleged that they are
intact and in place in exactly the same condition as they were when petitioners
became the lessees of the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, <span class="GramE">We</span> hold that the trial
court erred in issuing the order dated <st1:date month="1" day="21" year="1977">January
 21, 1977</st1:date> setting aside the order of <st1:date month="11" day="4" year="1976">November 4, 1976</st1:date> and in maintaining its stand in the
order dated <st1:date month="3" day="21" year="1977">March 21, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Bañares</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Flordeliza</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gavito</span>,
No. 29355, July </u><u><span style="">20, </span>1928,
51 Phil. 786</u>, this Court held that "when a motion to set aside the
order of default is made without loss of time and before a date is set for the
hearing of the case on the merits and is accompanied by a sworn statement of
merits and copies of documents which constitute <u>prima facie</u> a just and
valid defense, such failure is insufficient to deprive a defendant of his
rights, as in the present case, and the refusal to set aside the order of
default constitutes an abuse of discretion, and especially when such setting
aside of the order of default <span style="">will </span>in
no way prejudice the plaintiff."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the same vein, this Court held in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Ladislao</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Pestano</span>,
L-7623, April 29, 1955, 96 Phil. 890</u>, that "no prejudice could have
been caused to plaintiff by the admission of defendant's answer, since the
latter had not yet been declared in default and plaintiff had not yet presented
her evidence on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower
court, therefore, in the exercise of its discretion, should have admitted defendant's
answer instead of declaring her in default." These cases were reiterated
in the recent ruling of this Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Tumambing</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span>, L-17456, </u><st1:date month="10" day="22" year="1966"><u>October 22, 1966</u></st1:date><u>, 18 SCRA 411</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that it was only upon the resolution of a
"Motion for Reconsideration" by respondents of the order dated
November 4, 1976 that the trial court considered two other failures and/or
omissions of petitioners, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a)
failure to furnish plaintiffs' counsel a copy of the "Motion for Admission
of Answer"; and (b) failure to file the opposition to the "Motion for
Reconsideration" within the period prayed for by defendants' counsel and
granted by the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, such fact of non-service was alleged by respondents for
the first time in their "Motion for Reconsideration" of the order of
November 4, 1976 since at the hearing of the "Motion for Admission of
Answer" by petitioners, respondents' counsel merely manifested that he was
submitting the motion for the resolution of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, petitioners' counsel offered copies
of the aforementioned pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, on a second count, respondents failed to assert their rights
at the first opportunity to do so.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, petitioners' counsel offered copies of the aforementioned
pleadings to respondents' counsel who, however, refused to accept the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So petitioners' counsel just sent
the copies <span style="">by registered mail before
the "Motion for Reconsideration" of respondents could even be
resolved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the failure of petitioners' counsel to file his opposition
to the "Motion for Reconsideration" of respondents within the period
granted to him by the trial court, suffice it to say that such failure does not
warrant the declaration of default of petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, petitioners' counsel
satisfactorily explained his failure as due to physical weakness as a result of
influenza.</p>

<p class="BODY">We must stress here again that it is the policy of the law to
have every litigated case tried on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is for this reason that judgments by defaults are generally looked
upon with disfavor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As aptly held in <span style="">the leading case of </span><u><span style="">Coombs vs. </span></u><st1:city><st1:place><u><span style="">Santos</span></u></st1:place></st1:city><u><span style="">, 24 Phil. 446</span></u><span style="">, </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">"</span></span><span style="">a default judgment does</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">not </span><span style="">pretend to be based upon the merits of the controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its existence is justified on the ground that
it is the one final expedient to induce defendant to join issue upon the allegations
tendered by the plaintiff, and to do so without unnecessary delay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A judgment by default may amount to a
positive and considerable injustice to the defendant; and the possibility of
such serious consequences necessitates a careful examination of the grounds
upon which the defendant </span><span style="">asks </span><span style="">that it be set aside."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the questioned orders dated <st1:date month="1" day="21" year="1977">January 21, 1977</st1:date> and <st1:date month="3" day="21" year="1977">March 21, 1977</st1:date> are hereby lifted and set aside,
the order dated <st1:date month="11" day="4" year="1976">November 4, 1976</st1:date>
