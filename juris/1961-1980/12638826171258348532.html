reconsideration filed on <st1:date year="1971" day="21" month="4">April 21,
 1971</st1:date>, ask this Court to re-examine its decision dated <st1:date year="1971" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1971</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the main, the respondents question the review made by this
Court of the determination of facts reached by the Court of Industrial
Relations and the consequent revision of the said findings of fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondents allege that this Court
"swept into unmerited oblivion the voluminous documentary and testimonial
evidence" <span style="">they proffered, which
evidence consisted of<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Concededly, the findings of fact of the Court of Industrial Relations,
if supported by substantial evidence, bind this Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
This, for the reason that the rule of substantial evidence, rather than the
rule of preponderance of evidence applicable in ordinary civil cases, governs
the Court of Industrial - Relations in its findings of fact.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
And substantial evidence refers to "such relevant evidence as a reasonable
mind might accept as adequate to support a <span style="">conclusion."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Then, too, the substantiality of the
evidence depends on its quantitative as well as its <u><span style="">qualitative</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">aspects.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For </span><span style="">t</span><span style="">o </span><span style="">be considered as substantial evidence </span><span style="">should primarily be credible.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, findings of <span style="">fact
of </span>the Court of Industrial Relations <span style="">unsupported by </span>substantial and credible evidence do not <span style="">bind this </span>Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
And, certainly, the failure of <span style="">substantial
</span>and credible proof to sustain <span style="">the
<span style="">findings </span></span>of fact of the
Court of Industrial Relations <span style="">justifies </span>the review by this Court of the
said factual determination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Con­comitantly,
the need to revise, reverse or modify the factual findings of the Court of
Industrial Relations arises to enable this Court to draw the appropriate and
correct conclusions for the proper resolution of the questions on the rights
and obligations of the parties involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, before coming to the numerous errors which respondents
claim have been committed by this Court in reviewing and reversing the factual
deter­mination reached by the Court of Industrial Relations, we reiterate what
we stated in the decision of January 30, 1971:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>we deemed it necessary to review the entire factual milieu of the case
in controversy and to reverse the factual findings arrived at by the Court of
Industrial Relations because we found the same unsupported by substantial
evidence and, much more, by credible proof.</p>

<p class="BODY">The errors allegedly committed by this Court in its factual
findings and its conclusions derived <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
properly summed up and grouped, fall into three categories:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) those pertaining to findings and
conclusions without basis on record or contrary <span style="">to the evidence on record; (2) those referring to findings and
conclusions contrary to the factual determination made by and conclusions
arrived at by the Court of Industrial Relations; and (3) those relating to
issues not raised or errors not assigned by the parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To the respondents' first cauldron of steaming objections belong
the following factual findings and conclusions of this Court purportedly
unsupported by the records or contrary to what appears in the same:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the respondents instructed Ramon
Garcia and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Abella</span> to create the disturbance
which occurred on May 21, 1958; (2) that Garcia issued a circular to dissuade
the members of the <span style="">Unions from
disaffiliating with the FFW and joining the NATU; (3) that the respondents did
not make counter-proposals to the Unions' demands and that the said respondents
insisted on the Unions' dropping their demands for union security,
"promising money benefits if this was done;" (4) that the Court of
First Instance of Manila issued the restraining order "on the basis of the
<span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the various criminal cases against
striking members of the Unions;" (5) that "more than 120 criminal
charges" were filed against the members of the Unions; (6) that the
respondents hired Felipe <span class="SpellE">Enage</span> and Garcia,
"former legal counsels of the petitioners, as personnel manager and
assistant corporate secretary, respectively, with attractive
compensations;" and (7) that Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Olbes</span>
"brought three truckloads of </span><span style="">non</span><span style="">-</span><span style="">strikers
</span><span style="">and others, escorted by armed
men, who, despite the presence of eight entrances to the three buildings
occupied by the Companies, entered thru only one gate less than two meters wide
and in the process, crashed thru the picket line posted in front of the
premises of the Insular Life Building."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1. Anent the first point raised by the res­pondents, this Court,
in the decision of <st1:date year="1971" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1971</st1:date>,
stated:</p>

<blockquote>"There is therefore a reasonable suggestion that they were
sent to work at the latter building to create such an incident and have a basis
for filing criminal charges against the petitioners in the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span>
office and applying for injunction from the court of first instance."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUM" style="text-indent: 0in;">Earlier in the decision (Page 4) and in
the preceding statements, this Court briefly recounted the circums­tances
attending the occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To claim that
this Court, in the above-quoted portion of the decision, found and
categorically stated that Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Abella</span>
participated in some sort of a pre-planned scheme to "create the
disturbance" constitutes but a mistaken impression of the statement of
this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statement simply
expresses that in the circumstances <span style="">already
mentioned -- which circumstances the records unraveled lurked the distinct
likelihood that Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Abella</span> purposely provided
the provocation for the incident.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2. We find the second objection of the res­pondents well-taken,
for the records offer little to provide sufficient clarity on whether or not
Garcia, <span style="">as </span>acting president of
the Insular Life/FGU unions <span style="">and the
Insular Life Building Employees Association, "in a circular issued in his
name and signed by him, tried to dissuade the members of the Unions from
disaffiliating with the FFW and joining the National Association of Trade
Unions (NATU)." The transcript of the proceedings before the Court of
Industrial Relations reveals only Garcia's apparent adeptness at evasion </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">inability to recall, among other things, whether or not he issued the
circular aforementioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
the foregoing questioned statement of this Court in the narration of facts in
the decision bears no materiality to the conclusions finally arrived at.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">3. The respondents claim the statement of <span style="">this </span>Court that "the Companies did not make any counter
proposals but, instead, insisted that the Unions first drop their demand for
union security, promising money benefits if this was done" as "truly
false" and "an unwarranted deviation from the truth." Far from
being so, we find that the records precisely support the finding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The </span>thrust
of the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Enage</span> (Pages 13 to 65, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, March 30, 1960; pages 7 to 13, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
April 29, 1960) -- the chairman of the negotiating committee for the
respondents -- verily points out that the said respondents omitted, without
sufficient reasons, to present counter--proposals to the Unions' demands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, <span style="">in
</span>addition to the testi­monial evidence offered by Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Lacsina</span> (Pages 56 to 62, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
September 8, 1958) -- chairman of the <span style="">negotiating
panel for the Unions,- supports the finding that, indeed, the respondents
offered no </span>counter-proposals to the demands of the said Unions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At most, the records reveal, the respondents,
to placate the Unions, indulged in the superficial discussion of the demands,
requiring the said Unions to explain and clarify the import of their
demands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, too, the totality of the
testimonial evid<span style="">e</span>nce of <span class="SpellE">Lacsina</span> (Pages 35 to 38, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
October 14, 1958) and the Unions' panel members <span class="SpellE">Villaruel</span>
(Pages 60 to 61, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, November 21, 1958) and <span class="SpellE">Du</span> <span class="SpellE">Timbol</span> (Pages 25 to 26 and 30,
<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, November 18, 1959) clearly indicates that the
respondents more than persuaded the Unions to drop their union security demands
with the promise of monetary benefits.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">4. We consider the objection of the respondents to the statement
of this Court that the Court of First Instance of Manila issued the restraining
order "on the basis of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the
various criminal cases against striking members of the Unions" as
well-founded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records show that the
respondents predicated their petition for the issuance of the writ of
preliminary injunction (Ex­hibit "32-B") upon certain acts which the
said respondents claimed the picketing members of the striking Unions committed
through "force, threats, intimidation, coercion and violence." The
res­training order (Exhibit "33-C") issued by the Court of First
Instance of Manila on May 31, 1958 makes no express mention of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the various criminal charges already filed
against the picketing members of the striking Unions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neverthe­less, the fact remains that on the
day the Court of First Instance of Manila issued the restraining order, several
criminal charges (Exhibits "19," "20," "23" to
"29," inclusive and "31") had been filed already with the
Office of the City Fiscal of Manila against many of the picketing members of
the Unions.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. The respondents also question the statement of this Court
giving the impression of the filing of "more than 120 criminal
charges" against the members of the striking Unions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The </span>evidence
at hand (Exhibits "19," "20," "23" to
"31," inclusive) show, as of <st1:date year="1958" day="2" month="6">June
 2, 1958</st1:date>, four complaints for coercion and seven for grave coercion
already filed with the Office of the City Fiscal of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each of the preliminary investigation
memoranda, however, except three (Exhibits "26-," "29" and
"30") names several members of the striking Unions collectively as
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counting the charges individually
-- <span class="SpellE">prescinding</span> from the fact that a number of the
members of the striking Unions then faced two or more charges, having been
named as accused in more than one memorandum -­- the charges add up to
eighty-four.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this point, we sustain
the objection of the respondents.</p>

<p class="NUM">6. The respondents also allege as objectionable the following
statement of this Court:</p>

<blockquote>"It must be recalled that previous to the petitioners'
submission of proposals for an amended renewal of their respective collective
bargaining agreements to the respondents, the latter hired Felipe <span class="SpellE">Enage</span> and Ramon Garcia, former legal counsels of the
petitioners, as personnel manager and assistant corporate secretary,
respectively, with attractive compensations."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="NUM" style="text-indent: 0in;">The respondents claim the "falsity of
the finding" that <span class="SpellE">Enage</span> and Garcia worked as
"legal counsels of the petitioners" and allege this Court as
"unduly unkind" in giving the impression that they enticed <span class="SpellE">Enage</span> and Garcia "from their positions as 'legal
counsels of the petitioners' with high salaries." The records, however,
evince that Garcia served as Secretary-Treasurer of the Federation of Free
Workers (Pages 59 to 61, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <span style="">August </span>4, 1961) and that Garcia handled cases for the Federation
of Free Workers (Page 58, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, August 4, 1961) with
which the Unions then formed an affiliation (Pages 59 to 62, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, August 4, 1961; page 62,tsn, January 16, 1962).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to <span class="SpellE">Enage</span>,
the records show that he worked with the Federation of Free Workers (Page 25, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">tsn</span></span><span style="">, </span>April 29, 1960).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the respondents, in their brief (Page
46), stated that Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Enage</span> worked as counsels
for the Federation of Free Workers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, assuming the truth of the respondents' assertion that
neither Garcia nor <span class="SpellE">Enage</span> served as counsel, directly
or indirectly through the Federation of Free Workers, for the Unions, <span style="">this passing mention of the disputed former
connection of Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Enage</span> to the said Unions
bears no relevance to the principal merits of the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the other observations of the respondents,
we deem it unnecessary to discuss the same for only a <u>misreading</u> of the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> portion of the decision gives, in the words of
the respondents themselves, "the unkind impression that respondents
enticed them (<span class="SpellE">Enage</span> and Garcia) from their position
as 'legal counsels of the petitioners' with high salaries."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">7. The respondents' allegation that no evidence supports the
statement of this Court that they, through their president and manager Jose <span class="SpellE">Olbes</span>,</p>

<blockquote>"brought three truckloads of non-strikers and others, escorted
by armed men, who, despite the presence of eight entrances to the three
buildings occupied <span style="">by </span>the
Companies, entered thru only one gate less then two meters wide and in the
process, crashed thru the picket line posted in front of the premises of the
Insular Life Building,"<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="NUM" style="text-indent: 0in;">rounds up the objections of the said
respondents properly falling under the first group.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The res­pondents claim the absence of
evidence showing that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) <span class="SpellE">Olbes</span> held the position of manager; <span style="">(2) <span class="SpellE">Olbes</span> brought three truckloads of
"non-strikers and others;" (3) armed men escorted the <span class="SpellE">non­strikers</span> and others;" (4) eight entrances provided
access to the three buildings; and (5) that the gate through which the
"non-strikers and others" entered measured "less than two meters
wide."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Objection number one deals with an inconsequential detail --
whether or not <span class="SpellE">Olbes</span> held, in any capacity, the
position of manager -- which bears no materiality to the main issues raised by
the case at hand.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to number two, the evidence of the res­pondents' own witnesses
-- Ramon <span class="SpellE">Zosa</span> (Page 38, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
December 5, 1960), Nestor <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> (Pages 18, 19 and
26, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, February 1, 1961) and <span class="SpellE">Olbes</span>
(Pages 7 to 13, 33, 34 and 45 to 50, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, October 2,
1962)--more than sufficiently indicate the truth that <span class="SpellE">Olbes</span>
led three busloads of non-strikers and others to the picketed buildings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this effect, too, testified <span style="">some </span>witnesses
of the Unions; parti­cularly <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Abesamis</span> (Pages 57 to 66, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
January 20, 1959) and Jose <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> (Pages 19 to 25, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, June 11, 1959).</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding number three, the records miss to evince clearly
whether or not armed men escorted the three JD buses filled with non-strikers
and others to the respondents' picketed premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">On number four, a collation of all the evidence bearing on this
Objection reveals <span style="">the </span>following
means of access to the office premises of the respondents comprised of almost
one block bounded by Plaza Cervantes, Plaza Moraga, <span class="SpellE">Muelle</span>
de la <span class="SpellE">Industria</span> and Juan Luna:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the Plaza Cervantes entrance to the
Insular Life Building (Page 8, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, February 8,
1961); (2) the two Plaza Moraga entrances to the Insular Life Building (Page 8,
<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, September 13, 1960); (3) the basement entrance
to the Insular Life Building (Page 29, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, October
2, 1962); (4) the Juan Luna entrance to the Ayala Building (Page 11, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, August 4, 1961); (5) the <span class="SpellE">Muelle</span>
de la <span class="SpellE">Industria</span> entrance to the Ayala Building (Page
27, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, August <span style="">4,
</span>1961); (6) the Plaza Moraga entrance to the Filipinas Building (Page 21,
<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, August 18, 1959); and (7) the entrance to the
National City Bank of New York the premises of which have a connecting door to
the lobby of the Ayala Building (Page 30, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
October 2, 1962).</p>

<p class="BODY">As to objection number five, not one of the parties offers any
specific evidence showing the exact measurement of the gate through which the <span class="SpellE">non­strikers</span> and others entered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence on record relevant to this point
discloses that the gate measures about two to three meters wide.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents further unleash their vigorous exception to the
following findings arrived at by this Court; (1) that the respondents
discriminated against the strikers in the readmission; (2) that the respondents
dismissed thirty-four strikers <span style="">without
lawful cause; (3) that the respondents omitted to give the dismissed strikers
the opportunity to defend themselves against the supposed charges against them;
and (4) that the respondents' letter of May 21, 1959 (Exhibit "A")
contained "promises of benefits to the employees in order to entice them
to return to work" and that the said respondents' letter of May 31, 1958 </span><span style="">(Exhibit "B") </span><span style="">contained "threats to obtain
replacements for the striking employees" in the event of their failure to
report for work on June 2, 1958.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
respondents strongly protest against the alteration and reversal made by this
Court of the tactual determination reached by the Court of Industrial Relations
</span><span style="">on </span><span style="">these salient points.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Setting aside the incisive dissection performed by the
respondents on the statements of this Court relevant and related to the
aforementioned findings, the arguments of the said respondents all but lead to
their primary objection that this Court erred in finding that they committed
unfair labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, admittedly,
the foregoing findings provided this Court with the unshakeable bases in
arriving at the inescapable conclusion that the respondents committed unfair
labor practice.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the decision of January 30 1971, this Court, fully cognizant
that the findings now questioned by the respondents constituted the
considerations of importance to the issues involved in the case at <span style="">bar, </span>sufficiently and clearly, albeit
lengthily, discussed all of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And a
consultation with and a combing of the voluminous records disclose the
evidence, substantial and credible, in support of the said, findings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents labor under the impression that, in the
controversy at hand, the findings of fact of the Court of Industrial Relations
deserve much weight and consideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The said findings <span style="">of fact, the respondents
argue should remain conclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
the want of substantial evidence, nay, credible </span><span style="">proof, </span><span style="">to uphold the
findings of the Court of Industrial Relations on the matters now disputed by
the respondents, brought about by the mistaken appreciation of the facts,
prompted this </span>Court to review the facts <span style="">on </span>record and to alter and reverse the determination reached by
the said Court of Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These, consequently, re­sulted in a view rather different from that of
the Court of Industrial Relations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not infrequently, the Court of Industrial Relations misapprehends
the facts and, eventually, arrives at erroneous conclusions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For in the Court of Industrial Relations,
only one judge hears the case and usually, not even a judge hears the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, a hearing examiner -- an employee <span style="">of the Court of Industrial Relations -- takes
charge of the proceedings and receives the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing, the hearing examiner submits
his report on the case to the judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
judge then studies the case and, relying on the ability and integrity of the
hearing examiner who saw and heard the witnesses and submitted the report,
renders the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More often than
not, the proceedings before the Court of Indus­trial Relations drag through
years before the case finally becomes subject to study and decision by the
judge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">And even in the reconsideration of the decision asked for by the
aggrieved party, no rehearing takes place before the Court <span style="">of </span>Industrial Relations <u>en</u> <u><span style="">banc</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The individual judges,
if they have the disposition and the time to do so, review the evidence on
record or merely read and rely upon the memoranda submitted by the respective
parties and the decision subject of reconsideration, giving due consideration
to the capability, competency and probity of the judge who penned the said
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And almost, invariably, the
Court of Industrial Relations <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> upholds the decision for
reconsideration.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The case at bar, this Court notes, passed from the hands of one
hearing examiner -- <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Adriano-- to another --
Guillermo Medina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This case also took
more than seven years before its determination by the Court of Industrial
Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These factors, we opine, contributed
to the misapprehension of facts <span style="">committed
by </span><span style="">t</span><span style="">he Court of Industrial Relations warranting a
r</span><span style="">eview of the factual </span><span style="">determination in its totality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, <span style="">this Court finds it </span>neither important nor imperative to pursue any
further discussion and resolution <span style="">of </span>the
<span style="">matters </span>claimed by the
respondents as <span style="">contrary to the </span>findings
of the Court of Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And for the satisfaction of the respondents, an examination of the
entire evidence on record makes it more apparent that evidence of quantity and
quality sustains the findings of this Court on the aforementioned matters now
disputed by them.</p>

<p class="BODY">To the third group of the respondents' object­ions appertain
those findings of this Court on issues not raised or errors not assigned by the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondents question the
action taken by this Court in discussing and resolving the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the question as to the nature of the
strike staged by the Unions; (2) the issue as to whether or not the respondents
refused to bargain collectively in good faith; and (3) the question as to the reclassification
of eighty-seven employees as supervisors.</p>

<p class="BODY">Concededly, the Rules of Court, in proceedings before the
appellate courts, namely, the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court, require
the party seeking the review of a judgment to set out in his brief the errors
upon which he relies for reversal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise, the appellate courts would not consider those errors not
properly assigned or specified.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">However, the Supreme Court has ample
authority to review and resolve matters not assigned and specified as errors by
either of the parties in the appeal if it finds the consideration and determina­tion
of the same essential and indispensable in order to arrive at a just decision
in the case.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>This Court, thus, has the authority
to waive the lack of proper assignment of errors if the unassigned errors
closely relate to errors properly pinpointed out or if the unassigned errors
refer to matters upon which the determination of the questions raised by the
errors properly assigned depend.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The same also applies to issues not specifically raised by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court, <span style="">likewise, </span>has broad discretionary powers, in the resolution of a
controversy, to take into consideration matters <span style="">on </span>record which the parties fail to submit to the Court as
specific questions for determination.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Where the issues already raised also rest on other issues not specifically
presented, as long as the latter issues bear relevance and close relation to
the former and as long as they arise from matters on record, the Court has the
authority to include them in its dis­cussion of the controversy as well as to
pass upon them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In brief, in those cases
wherein questions not particularly raised by the parties surface as neces­sary
for the complete adjudication of the rights and obligations of the parties and
such questions fall within the issues already framed by the parties, the
interests of justice dictate that the Court consider and resolve them.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at hand, the questions as to the nature of the strike
staged by the Unions, the re­fusal of the respondents to bargain collectively
in good faith, and the reclassification of eighty-seven employees as
supervisors relate closely to the determination of whether or not the
respondents committed unfair labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, this Court found it necessary to resolve these issues, without
confining itself to those tendered by the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the same vein, we are also constrained to reassess the ruling
in our decision of January 30, 1971 .to the effect that the strikers <span style="">must </span>receive <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
from the date of the act of discrimina­tion, that is, from the date <span style="">of </span>their discharge or their offer to
return to work up to the date of their actual reinstatement, deducting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> whatever they have earned pending readmission.</p>

<p class="BODY">Significant <span style="">changes </span>have
since supervened as to the method of awarding <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a line of cases, the Court has established
a policy of fixing the amount of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> to a just
and reasonable level <u>without</u> qualification or deduction.</p>

to their total equivalent for <u><span style="">three </span>years</u>
(depending on the circumstances) without deduction or qualification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u><span style="">rationale</span></u><span style=""> </span>for the policy <span style="">was </span>stated in the following words:</p>
