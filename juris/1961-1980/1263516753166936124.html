<p class="BODY">Petitioners in Cases L-23331-32 are the retained lawyers of the
Santiago Labor Union who question respondent Court's appro­val of respondent
firm's settlement of the union members' judg­ment claims with the union board

by the majority of the union board “under circumstances of fraud, deceit,
misrepresentation and/or concealment, especially where a member of the Court
has actively used his official and personal influence to effect the settlement
which is manifestly unjust to laborers who by reason of their financial

<p class="BODY">The factual background goes as far back as June 21, 1952, when
the Santiago Labor Union, composed of workers of the Santiago Rice Mill, a
business enterprise engaged in the buying and mill­ing of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>
at Santiago, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, and owned and operated by King
Hong Co., Inc., filed before the respondent Court of Industrial Relations Cases
Nos. 709-V and V-1 thereof, a petition for over­time pay, premium pay for
night, Sunday and holiday work, and for reinstatement of workers illegally laid
off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As of then, the total sum claimed
by the workers, as itemized in their amended petition of September 2, 1952 -
P100,816.36 for overtime pay, P19,350.00 for premium pay and P3,360.00 for
differential pay under the Minimum Wage Law - amounted to P123,526.36.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

which affirmed the Court of Industrial Relations judgment in favor of the
workers, "on September 19, 1958, after a protracted hearing dur­ing which
scores of witnesses and voluminous exhibits were pre­sented, the court, thru
Judge <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Tabigne</span>,
rendered decision dismissing the petition of the union for lack of merit and
want of jurisdiction; but, upon a motion for reconsideration, the Court of
Industrial Relations <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, by a split decision of 3-2 vote,
issued a resolution reversing the decision of the trial judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of said resolution reads:</p>

<blockquote>"'WHEREFORE, the respondents are hereby ordered to pay the
overtime claim of both male and female claimants herein computed at their basic
pay for each period in question; the legal premium for night, Sunday and
holiday work or services rendered by the male claimants herein computed also on
the proven basic wage or salary at the time in question; to pay the overtime
claim of their drivers computed on their respective monthly salaries; to pay
the differentials due each of the women claimants on their wages from August 4,
1951 at the rate of P2.00 daily and P3.00 daily from August 4, 1952; and to
reinstate the claimants both male and female, who have testified and proved
their having been illegally laid-off, with the right of respondents to deduct
from the back wages due each claimant any amount earned during the period of
the illegal dismissal.'"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The workers' decade of travail was not yet to be at an end,
however, despite this Court's <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the
judgment for the workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the

<p class="BODY">The Chief Examiner's Report showed respondent firm's total assets
as at October 31, 1962 to be P191,151.08 (cash account of P148,411.20, fixed
assets of buildings, machinery &amp; equipment, corn mill, etc. with a book
value of P40,073.75 and deferred charges of P2,666.13), and its net worth to be
in the same amount of P191,151.08, (capital stock paid up of P232,000.00 less
deficit of P40,848.92).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Report
further stated that in January, 1962 and on <st1:date year="1962" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1962</st1:date>, respondent firm sold its trucks, jeep and
one car, with a net book value of P2,628.71 for P27,000.00 or a net gain of
P24,371.29.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners claim that the
book value of respondent firm's fixed assets is only one-sixth of their actual
market value of P240,442.50, and that its total <span class="SpellE">leviable</span>
assets therefore amounted to close to P390,000.00, without taking into account
the huge income potential of its rice mill operations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent firm disputes such a figure as

<p class="BODY">A general opposition to the Chief Examiner's Report was filed by
respondent firm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Tabigne</span>, as the trial
judge, <u>supra</u>, ordered a hearing thereon on <st1:date year="1962" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1962</st1:date>, as a condition precedent to execution

fail to show that the trial judge ever acted on or approved the Report.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before and after the submittal of the Chief Examiner's Report of <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1962</st1:date>, the union pressed
for execution of the final judgment in favor of its claimants-members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It filed, furthermore, on December 20, 1962,
an Urgent Motion for Preliminary Attach­ment, in view of the disposition by
respondent firm of its trucks and automotive equipment and by virtue of the
fact admitted by respondent firm that it had stopped operations preparatory to
liquidation, by reason of the alien nationality of most of its stock­holders,
under the provisions of Republic Act No. 3018 nationalizing the rice and corn
industry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In another motion of <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1962</st1:date>, the union had asked
that the Court at least order respondent firm to put up a bond of P500,000.00
to answer for the payment of the judgment or to deposit said amount in Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners assert that these motions were left hanging until the
union filed a mandamus petition with this Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
after which the trial judge issued and released on <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1963</st1:date> his Order dated <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this Order, the trial Judge, recognizing
that “petitioner (union) and its members concerned should be ex­tended the
necessary protection of their rights" ordered respondent firm, within 10
days from its finality, to deposit in Court the sum of one hundred thousand
(P100,000.00) pesos and to file a surety bond <u>of equal amount</u>, "to
guarantee the payment of whatever amount (a) due petitioner (union) and its
members concerned after this Court shall have finally decided the obligation of
herein respondents under the judgment." This Order was affirmed by
respondent court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, in its Resolution denying respondent
firm's motion for reconsideration thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent sought a review by this Court of the said Order and
Resolution requiring it to deposit P100,000.00 and to file a surety bond of
equal amount to guarantee payment of its judgment obligation in Santiago Rice
Mill et al. vs. Santiago Labor Union, etc., docketed as Cases G.R. Nos.
L-21758-59 of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, in
its Resolution of <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1963</st1:date>,
dismissed for lack of merit respondent's petition for review, and the dismissal
became final on <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Earlier, on <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="6">June 25,
 1963</st1:date>, pursuant to the request of the parties, who had advised the
trial judge that they would meet at the premises of respondent firm at <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, to take up direct negotiations for the possible
settlement of the judgment, a team of employees of the Court had been sent to
help in the negotia­tions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
transcript of the negotiations records that respondent had then offered the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
the maximum amount of P110,000.00 in full settlement of its obligations to the
members-claimants of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> under the judgment, but
that the union rejected the offer and counter-offered the minimum amount of
P200,000.00. </p>

<p class="BODY">The union meanwhile filed to no avail a series of urgent mo­tions
on May 8, July 1, August 29 and September 6, 1963 for appro­val of the Chief
Examiner's Partial Report of December 14, 1962 and for enforcement, through a
writ of execution or contempt pro­ceedings, of the Order of March 30, 1963
requiring respondent firm to deposit a total of P200,000.00 in cash and bond to
guaran­tee payment of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
the finality of this Court's Resolution dismissing respondent's petition for a
review of said Order of March 30, 1963, the union again filed on October 29,
1963 still another Urgent Motion, advising the trial judge of this Court's
action rejecting respondent's appeal and invoking the Court's ministerial duty
of enforcing its said Order - in vain again, as shall presently be seen.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial judge took no action on this latest Urgent Motion of
the union, wherein it emphasized that respondent, with this Court's action
rejecting its appeal, no longer had any excuse for refusing to comply with the
deposit Order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, an unscheduled
confer­ence was called and held on <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="10">October
 31, 1963</st1:date> in the chambers of the trial judge, and attended by
representatives of respondent firm, including their counsels of record, on one
hand and <span class="SpellE">Segundino</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Maylem</span>,
president of the union and eight directors of the union, on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four of these nine union representatives,
including the union president himself, had no claims or awards whatever un­der
the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said union officials were
not assisted by counsel, as petitioner Mary <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
counsel of record of the union, was not present, not having been notified of
the conference.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this conference of October 31, 1963, respondent firm made
again the same offer to settle and quitclaim the judgment in favor of the union
members for the same amount of P110,000.00, which offer had already been
rejected by the union at the earlier conference held on June 25, 1963 at
Santiago, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this time, as appears from the transcript
of the conference, respondent and the directors of the union decided to settle
the case amicably with the payment by the firm of the same amount of
P110,000.00 which was deposited with the Court's disbursing officer
"immediately upon the signing of the settlement which will be prepared by
the respondent firm through its counsel." The complete transcript of the
conference, as reproduced by respondent in its brief, follows:</p>

conference, charging the union president, <span class="SpellE">Maylem</span>,
with bad faith in that he never previously advised the union representatives

nor that this Court's resolution dismissing respondent's appeal from the trial
judge's Order dated March 30, 1963 requiring respondent to deposit P200,000.00
in cash and surety bond had already become final, and asking the trial judge to
shelve the proposed settlement until respondent firm shall have complied with
the said deposit order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent
portions of said Objection and Urgent Motion read:</p>

with other corresponding signatures in the Payroll dated November 8, 1963
submitted to respondent Court on November 21, 1963, such that "either one

"absolutely no truth to the claim" and that the signers of the
ratification letter “have all received their individual shares of the
P110,000.00 settle­ment paid by respondent company and this in itself is a
ratification on their part of said settlement." Nothing appears in the

petitioner's Board of Directors that it had authority to compromise when
previously said union members concerned had already manifested in Annex
"E" (Exhibit "G", at bar) that there was no such authority,"
he voted "that the case be restored to the <u>status</u> <u>quo</u> as of
October 30, 1963, but the payment already made to the union members be
considered as partial payments on account, subject to final liquidation and
adjustment; that an order of execution of the judgment in cases Nos. G.R.

removed from office <span class="SpellE">Maylem</span>, the union presi­dent and
his board of directors who had executed the "Settlement" with

<blockquote>"b) <u>The records of the respondent labor union do not show
any grant by the members to the former incumbency of any previous authority to
negotiate the claim or subsequent ratification of the settlement for
P110,000.00</u> for it is unthinkable and ridiculous for the real parties in
interest to give away gratuitously what had been awarded to them in a final
judgment, for a much lesser amount than that of the award;</blockquote>

be entitled to collect, in order to show unequivocally that <u>the negotiation
made by former President <span class="SpellE">Segundino</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Maylem</span> and his board of directors was unauthorized, and to

personality of the respondent labor union to represent them when so authorized

<p class="BODY">The core question is whether this Court can give its sanction to
respondent Court's majority resolution upholding the trial judge's approval of
the union board's settlement for P110,000.00 of the es­timated P423,756.74 -
judgment liability of respondent firm in favor of the individual union members,
over the timely opposition formally filed by three members (later joined by
forty-seven other members) expressly calling attention to the union board's bad
faith in the pre­mises and lack of any express authority to enter into the
settlement, and without giving the union the opportunity of being heard and
assisted by counsel, and notwithstanding the fact that respondent firm, which
had sufficient cash and fixed assets, was under legal compulsion by virtue of
respondent court's own final order to deposit P100,000.00 in cash and another
P100,000.00 in surety bond to gua­rantee payment of the union members' judgment
claims?</p>

<p class="BODY">The question answers itself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The precipitate approval of the purported settlement under the
circumstances goes against the grain of fundamental considerations of justice,
equity and due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">1. To begin with, petitioners were not accorded due process of
law, when, for reasons unexplained in the record, the conference set for November
8, 1963 at 2:30 p.m. to take up formally the proposed settlement was cancelled
and never held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<u>supra</u>, pp. 8-9)
Notice thereof had been served on the union counsel, in accordance with the
express request of the union president, as expressly noted by the trial
judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, such notice was deliberately
disregarded and the union was deprived of the assistance of its counsel.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Instead, the settlement as unilaterally drafted by respondent's counsel (<u>supra,</u>
p. 7) was executed ahead of the scheduled hour of the conference that turned
out to be a non-conference, by the union president with nine other members of
the union's board of directors, without the know­ledge, advice and conformity
of the union counsel, while respondent was duly assisted by its two counsels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By <st1:time minute="45" hour="13">1:45 p.m.</st1:time>
of the same day, the settlement had been approved by the trial judge as
"not contrary to law, morals and public policy." Similarly,
petitioners <span class="SpellE">Magalpo</span>, a board member herself and her
co-petitioners <span class="SpellE">Bulos</span> and <span class="SpellE">Batoon</span>
were not accorded an opportunity for a fair hearing on their grave charges
against the union leadership and their urgent motions to shelve the proposed
settlement and to enforce the final order of res­pondent court requiring
respondent firm to deposit P200,000.00 in cash and surety bond for satisfaction
of the union members' judg­ment, as said motions were totally ignored by the
trial judge and not touched upon at all in his Order rashly approving the
settlement.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. The lack of due deliberation and caution in the trial judge's
instant approval of the settlement is seen from the stipulations therein that
the union thereby waived and quitclaimed any and all claims which it may have
against the respondent, as <u>well as the claim of each and every one of the
members of the union against respondent</u>, when pre­cisely the authority of
the union board members to enter into any such compromise or settlement was
under express challenge by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Magalpo</span>, a
board member herself in her Objection and Urgent Motion to shelve the settlement
filed on November 5, 1963, which the trial judge completely disregarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Magalpo</span>
further made serious charges that <span class="SpellE">Maylem</span>, the union
president, had misled the board members into attending the unscheduled con­ference
held on October 31, 1963 before the trial judge, and had deliberately concealed
from them the fact of entry on October 24, 1963 of the Order of this Court in
G.R. Nos. L-21758-59 upholding the P200,000.00 deposit Order of respondent
court and the effect thereof of making mandatory upon the trial judge, in
accordance with the terms of his own order, the issuance of a writ for
execution or enforcement to compel respondent to so deposit P100,000.00 in cash
and an equal amount in surety bond to guarantee satisfaction of the union members'
judgment against respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In point of
fact, the union's own Urgent Motion of October 29, 1963, emphasizing that
respondent no longer had any excuse for not complying with the deposit order,
as well as petitioner <span class="SpellE">Magalpo</span> et al's Urgent ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion of November 4, 1963 to the same effect were
pending before the trial judge, unresolved and <span class="SpellE">unacted</span>
upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners <span class="SpellE">Magalpo</span>
et al. had reason, therefore, to assail the proposed settlement for P110,000.00
as unconscionable, when at the very least the union members could be assured of
P200,000.00 under the deposit order to satisfy their judgment credit, while the
report of respondent court's examiner showed that respondent firm had
sufficient assets, (supra, p. 5), and considering that their partial judgment
credit, as estimated by respondent court's examiner, amounted to more than
P400,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">3. The trial judge's rush approval of the settlement disregarded
the grave adverse consequences thereof to the union members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The settlement, as prepared by respondent's
counsel, provided for a union warranty that aside from the union itself and the
members thereof, "there are no other persons who have any interest over
the judgment debt and that if it should happen that other persons shall make a
claim against the respondent and/or said judgment debt, that the respondent,
nevertheless, shall no longer be liable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>."
Such warranty was against the very facts of record, which showed that as early
as <st1:date year="1963" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1963</st1:date>,
petitioners-counsels in Cases L-23331-32 had duly recorded their attorneys'
lien of "30% of whatever amount may finally be awarded in favor of the
petitioner." Thus, technically, since the award in favor of the union
members amounted to more than P400,000.00 the settlement for P110,000.00 would
conceivably just about cover the 30% attorneys' fees payable to the
petitioners-counsels under the contract, if they were so minded to enforce it
and bad faith on the union's part were shown, with the union members left
holding an empty bag.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Such onerous terms of the settlement could not then properly be approved by the

<p class="BODY">4. All these underscore the failure of due process when
petitioners were deprived of the formal conference on the proposed settlement scheduled
for November 8, 1963 and of their right to be assisted by the union counsel as
expressly requested, so that a fair hearing could be accorded petitioners and
an opportunity afforded them to air their serious charges of bad faith and lack
of author­ity against the union leadership.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly, all these serious ques­tions and charges made by petitioners
could have been threshed out and verified, if the formal conference scheduled
for <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="11">November 8, 1963</st1:date> had
been held with the presence of union counsel, considering that the latter
likewise had a right to be heard, since they had duly made of record their
attorneys' lien upon the judgment.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent, in its brief, asserts that it vividly remembers that the trial
judge repeatedly made mention of the P200,000.00 deposit order during the
unscheduled conference of <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="10">October 31,
 1963</st1:date> and "even explained the matter to the members of the
board in their native dialect." But the transcript of the conference
reproduced above (supra, pp. 7-9) does not bear out this assertion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trans­cript is obviously deficient and
does not reflect the actual discussions and proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is to be deplored, for in a matter of
such great importance, especially where the union officials were unassisted by
counsel in an unscheduled conference, care should be taken by the trial judge
that the proceedings are faithfully recorded.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, al­though the transcript again fails to make any mention of it,
respon­dent, in its brief, in effect provides support for petitioners' plaint
against the unscheduled conference and precipitate approval of the settlement
behind the back of union counsel, when it states that “the presiding judge
tried to help the parties reach a settlement by stressing to the union that
there was no sense in demanding more than P110,000.00 from the respondent if
that was all it could afford, and that any more delay in the execution of its
award to the union members might lead to their getting much less than the
P110,000.00 already being offered by respondents," and "while it is
true that the presiding judge took an active part in helping the parties reach
such settlement, it was only in line with the policy of the law encouraging
settlement of cases even after final judgment."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
The obvious fallacy of this untenable posture assumed by the trial judge, of
course, is that with this Court having upheld his P200,000.00 deposit order, it
made every sense to enforce execution of said order, which it was practically
his ministerial duty to do so, to assure the union members of recovery of their
judgment credit at the very least to the extent of P200,000.00, as the trial
judge had expressly recog­nized therein that 'petitioner (union) <u>and its
members concerned</u> should be extended the necessary protection of their
rights." Any further delay in the execution of the judgment award in favor
of the union members could readily be obviated, if the trial judge would but
expedite the hearings for approval of the Court examiner's Report which had
been filed and left pending since <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="12">December
 14, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly
contended by petitioners, he could have placed the union members, unassisted as
they were by counsel, on an equal footing in negotiating with respondent by a
mere stroke of his pen by order­ing the enforcement of his final P200,000.00 deposit
order, as to which there no longer existed any obstacle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find the forcing through of the
settlement, under such circumstances, arbitrary, unfair and unconscionable.</p>

<p class="BODY">5. Another vital reason for striking down the settlement is the
lack of any express or specific authority of the president and majority of the
union board of directors to execute the same and scale down the estimated
P423,756.74 - judgment liability of respondent firm in favor of the individuals
union members to P110,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary,
petitioner board member <span class="SpellE">Magalpo</span> timely challenged the
authority of the union board to execute any such settlement, expressly
informing the trial judge that the union had specifically appointed an entity
in Manila, the "CREAM, Inc.", formerly Credit Research and
Intelligence, as its attorney-in-fact and "exclusive authorized
representative for the evaluation, adjustment and liquidation of its claim
against respondent." Forty-seven other union members-claimants joined
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Magalpo</span> in their denunciation of the union
board's unauthorized action, and in their plea for reconsideration with
respondent court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Forty-nine union
members-claimants entitled to the bulk of the judgment award have filed this
appeal from the adverse rulings of the Court below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These union members have repudiated the
former union president, <span class="SpellE">Maylem</span> and his board of
directors, for having betrayed the union members, and the new union leadership,
in its Answer filed with the Court, has joined petitioners in their prayer for
redress, categorically asserting that the union records do not show any grant
by the members to the former union board under <span class="SpellE">Maylem</span>
to "negotiate the claim or subsequent ratification of the settlement for
P110,000.00" which is “unthinkable and ridiculous." (<u>supra</u>, p.
15) Under such circumstances, the letter of ratifica­tion of the settlement
purportedly signed by some 79 members, many of whose signatures thereon are
denounced as forgeries and which ratification was not authenticated in the
proceedings below and has been expressly disowned by petitioners herein, cannot
be given any legal significance or effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">6. When it is further taken into consideration that the judg­ment
award, as affirmed by this Court's decision of August 31, 1962,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
was for the <u>payment</u> of overtime, premium and differential pay to the <u>individual</u>
union members as claimants and for the <u>reinstatement</u> of the <u>individual</u>
union members who testified and proved their having been illegally laid-off,
which represent a per­sonal material interest directly in favor of the <u>individual</u>
union members, as against the lack of material interest on the part of the
union as such, the union's lack of authority to execute the settlement, in the
absence of express or specific authorization by the union members, becomes
patent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The authority of the union as
such, to execute a settlement of the judgment award in favor of the indivi­dual
union members, cannot be presumed but must be expressly granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">7. Recently, in the analogous case of <u>La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span>
Food Products, Inc. etc. Employees <span class="SpellE">Ass'n</span>. vs. Court
of Industrial Relations, et al</u>.,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court ruled upon the merits of the union's appeal, and set aside the
Industrial Court's questioned orders which would reopen its previous judgment
finding the employer guilty of unfair labor practice and ordering the
reinstatement of, and payment of back wages from December 4, 1963 to,
twenty-one (21) union mem­bers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
handing down its decision, this Court disregarded the petitioner union's motion
to dismiss the appeal, filed through new counsel while the case was pending
decision, alleging that the union's legis­lative council had adopted a
resolution relieving the former union counsel of his services and authorizing
the dismissal of the case, on the premise that such dismissal “would serve the
best interests of both parties who are now in the process of formulating a
collective bargaining agreement in their earnest desire to establish industrial
peace and promote the economic well-being of all the parties concerned."
For this Court ruled that the union's loss of interest in the case was no
ground for dismissing the case, since “<u>the labor union as a body in reality
has not so great a material interest in the controversy as would prejudice it
in the event of dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the
twenty-one (21) members for whose benefit the ULP case was prosecuted who stand
to take tremendous losses" and suffer injustice</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upholding the individual union members in
their stand of vindicating their rights acquired under the final judgment as
against the union's legislative council's resolution to dismiss the case, this
Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Sanchez, thus held:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-</p>

<blockquote>"We now come to the motion to dismiss filed in this Court on <st1:date year="1969" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1969</st1:date> by new counsel for
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that motion, we read the
averment that the petitioning union, 'after careful and serious consideration
of their Petition, taken in the light of recent developments affect­ing their
relationship with the respondent-company, have decided that they have lost
interest in the further prose­cution of their claims'; that the union's
legislative council, on February 5, 1969, adopted a resolution authorizing the
new counsel to file a motion dismissing this case; that the former counsel who
directed this case before this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Lerum</span>,
had been relieved of his services in a letter of the union dated January 13,
1969; and that 'the dismissal of this instant case would serve the best
interests of both parties who are now in the process of formulating a
collective bargaining agreement in their earnest desire to establish industrial
peace and promote the economic well-being of all parties concerned.' This drew
a reply from Atty. <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Lerum</span>
that 'while he admits that he had re­ceived termination notice from the alleged
officers of the above-named union, he had not been <span class="SpellE">disauthorized</span>
by the complainants who had retained him to appear in their be­half' and that
'said complainants are against the dismissal of their case for the reason that
they want to vindicate their rights and it is against public policy to settle
an unfair labor practice by amicable settlement (Sec. 5(a), Rep. Act 875).’</blockquote>

<blockquote>"While it may be true that the labor union itself has lost
interest in the case, we do not believe that such should give ground for the
dismissal of this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The labor union
as a body in reality has not so great a mater­ial interest in the controversy
as would prejudice it in the event of dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the twenty-one (21) mem­bers for whose
benefit the ULP case was prosecuted who stand to take tremendous losses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is the argument that union and employer
are now in the process of formu­lating a collective bargaining agreement of any
consequence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That would not be affected
by the decision we now render as an aftermath of the ULP case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unless of course such a dismissal is a <u>quid</u>
<u>pro</u> <u>quo</u> before the parties could sit around the bargaining
table.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Which surely enough is not to the
'best interests' of the laborers.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>"And, as we examine the
record, we observe none of the members of the legislative council who adopted
the resolution relied upon in the motion to dismiss is <u>personally</u>
affected by the decision rendered by the CIR in Case 3985-­ULP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That decision, it will be recalled, directs
private respondents herein not only to reinstate the twenty one (21) union
members without loss of seniority and other benefits and privileges but also to
pay their respective <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> from <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1963</st1:date>, date of filing of
the charge, basis of the complaint, until actual reinstate­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is easy enough to perceive the injustice
which may be visited upon these twenty-one (21) union members if the petition
herein were to be dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For then, a
new trial will be had, with the consequent trouble, expense, anxiety and
another long delay before they could enjoy the fruits of their victory which
they have <u>legally</u> and <u>definitely</u> won only after a long and
protracted legal battle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, it
is better on balance that we fore­close a flanking movement which could destroy
rather than uphold the rights -- to reinstatement and monetary award -- of
individual laborers acquired under the final judgment."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">8. Just as this Court has stricken down unjust exploitation of
laborers by oppressive employers, so will it strike down their unfair treatment
by their own unworthy leaders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Constitution enjoins the State to afford protection to labor.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Fair dealing is equally demanded of unions as well as of employers in their
dealings with employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The union has
been evolved as an organi­zation of collective strength for the protection of
labor against the unjust exactions of capital, but equally important is the
requirement of fair dealing between the union and its members, which is
fiduciary in nature, and arises out of two factors:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"one is the degree of dependence of the
individual employee on the union organization; the other, a corollary of the
first, is the comprehensive power vested in the union with respect to the
individual."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
The union may be considered but the agent of its members for the purpose of
securing for them fair and just wages and good working conditions and is
subject to the obligation of giving the members as its principals all
information relevant to union and labor matters entrusted to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already discussed above, the union
leadership in the case at bar was recreant in its duty towards the union
members in appa­rently having failed to disclose to the union members the full
situa­tion of their judgment credit against respondent, to wit, that they were
in the advantageous position of being able to require enforce­ment of the
respondent court's P200,000.00 - deposit order, and in presuming that it had
authority to waive and quitclaim the estima­ted P423,756.74 - judgment credit
of the union members for the unconscionable amount of P110,000.00, which had
already been previously rejected by the workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent firm could not claim that it dealt
in good faith with the union officials, for it has­tily executed the purported
settlement notwithstanding the serious charges of bad faith against the union
leadership, and the non-holding of the scheduled conference where the union
leaders, at their express request, could be duly assisted by union
counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is noteworthy that
respondent never filed with the court below any denial or res­ponsive pleading
traversing the factual allegations in petitioner <span class="SpellE">Magalpo's</span>
Manifestation and Objection charging that at the unsche­duled conference of
October 31, 1963, the proposed settlement was in effect railroaded with the
fact of the finality of the P200,000.00 - deposit order not having been
disclosed to the union representatives.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such failure on the part of respondent constitutes an implied admis­sion
of the material averments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent's
justification now that it did not file any responsive pleading or denial
because <span class="SpellE">Magalpo</span> and her co-petitioners had no
personality to file their pleadings as they were not parties to the cases in
the lower court is of no avail, for they were actually the awardees and
beneficiaries under the judgment against respondent and the union was but their
agent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Deplorable also is the failure of
the trial judge to defer precipitate action on approval of the settlement until
the union could be afforded the opportunity of a hearing thereon duly assisted
by counsel, and failure later of the majority of respondent court in the
reconsideration pro­ceedings as well, to look seriously into the grave charges
of bad faith and deception against the union officials and their lack of author­ity
to execute the settlement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of these
charges were just swept under the rug, and summarily dismissed, without even
being mentioned, in the unreasoned <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> Resolution, finding
arbitrarily as against the facts herein collated by this Court from the
pertinent pleadings and annexes furnished it, "no sufficient justification
to set aside, disturb or modify" the questioned approval of the
settlement.</p>

<p class="BODY">9. The cases of <span class="SpellE"><u>Jesalva</u></span><u> et

by respondent, clearly have no application in the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Jesalva</u></span>,
seventeen cases in different stages of hearing or execution before the <st1:street><st1:address>Industrial
  Court</st1:address></st1:street> were settled by a compromise agreement, and
this Court held that the three petitioners who questioned the settle­ment were
"bound by the actions of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>, that is to say,
a majo­rity of the members of the union." There was no question there that
the union had acted with the authority of the union membership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No deceit or concealment or misrepresentation
tainted the settle­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither was the
amount of the settlement denounced as unconscionable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The employer there, Premiere Productions,
Inc., agreed to pay the amount of P200,000.00 which appeared to be a reasonable
settlement as against the judgment credit of the union workers, and further
agreed to lease to the union its equipment and facilities for the Union to
produce two moving pictures, appa­rently to cover the other wage claims of the
union workers which were still pending trial and resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Diomela</u></span>,
the labor-management disputes were settled amicably with the unfair labor
practice charge against the employer, <span class="SpellE">Squibband</span> Sons
(Phil.) being withdrawn, upon motion signed by the union president and the
three employees against whom the acts of unfair labor practice charged in the
complaint had been allegedly committed, to which motion the Court's prosecutor
gave his conformity, and with the employer, which had secured a permanent writ
of injunction restraining the strikers who had apparently declared an illegal
strike, against the commission of acts of violence, threats and intimidation,
agree­ing to pay three months separation pay to each striking employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no question, therefore, of the
authority of the union pre­sident to withdraw the unfair labor practice charge,
as the three employees directly affected had co-signed the withdrawal motion
with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The subsequent move of <span class="SpellE">Diomela</span> and 23 co-petitioners to <span class="SpellE">disauthorize</span>
the union and its counsel of record, was by their own pleading, overruled by
the majority of the union membership.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The other acts of unfair labor practice sought to be filed by <span class="SpellE">Diomela</span> and his companions were there ruled out as
splitting a cause of action and harassing the employer with subsequent charges,
based upon acts committed during the same period of time and which should have
been in­cluded in the charges first preferred.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What should be borne in mind is that the interests of the individual
worker can be better protected on the whole by a strong union aware of its
moral and legal obligations to represent the rank and file faithfully and
secure for them the best wages and working terms and conditions in the process
of collective bargaining.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As has been
aptly pointed out, the will of the majority must prevail over that of the
minority in the process, for “under the philosophy of collective
responsibility, an employer who bargains in good faith should be entitled to
rely upon the promises and agree­ments of the union representatives with whom
he must deal under the compulsion of law and contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The collective bargaining pro­cess should be
carried on between parties who can mutually respect and rely upon the authority
of each other."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Where, however, collective bargaining process is not involved, and what is at
stake are back wages already earned by the individual workers by way of
overtime, premium and differential pay, and final judgment has been rendered in
their favor, as in the present case, the real parties in interest with direct
material interest, as against the union which has only served as a vehicle for
collective action to enforce their just claims, are the individual workers
themselves.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Authority of the union to waive or quitclaim all or part of the judgment award
in favor of the individual workers cannot be lightly presumed but must be
expressly granted, and the employer, as judgment debtor, must deal in all good
faith with the union as the agent of the individual workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court in turn should certainly verify and
assure it­self of the fact and extent of the authority of the union leadership
to execute any compromise or settlement of the judgment on behalf of the
individual workers who are the real judgment creditors.</p>

<p class="BODY">We therefore sustain the minority opinion of then Presiding Judge
Bautista of respondent Court that the settlement was precipi­tately approved
without verification of the union board's authority to execute the compromise
settlement, and find that there was no such authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said settlement is therefore set aside and
the cases below are restored to the <u>status</u> <u>quo</u>, as of October 30,
1963, with the payments already made to the union members to be consi­dered as
partial payments on account, subject to final liquidation and adjustment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is directed that an order for the
enforcement of the P200,000.00 - deposit order dated <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1963</st1:date> issued in the cases below, and
upheld in Cases G.R. Nos. L-21758-59 of this Court dismissing the respondent's
petition for review, be forthwith issued, and that hearings on the Chief Examiner's
Report of <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1962</st1:date>
be resumed immediately and without interrupt­ion so that the amounts due under
the judgment to the individual union members may be finally determined without
further delay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is unfortunate that
pending these proceedings, no application for preli­minary injunction
restraining respondent firm from disposing of its assets was made, since as
stated above, (<u>supra</u>, p. 5) respondent had stopped operations in 1962
preparatory to liquidation, by virtue of the provisions of Republic Act No.
3018 nationalizing the rice and corn industry.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The respondent firm's stockholders are, however, charged with notice of
the firm's liability by virtue of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
these appeals, and should any liquidating dividends have been dis­tributed and
paid to them in the meantime, they shall stand liable for the satisfaction of
the union workers' judgment against respondent to the extent of such dividends
respectively paid to and received by them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, any outstanding unpaid subscriptions or balances of
subscriptions to the firm's capital stock, estimated at P20,000.00,<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
shall be subject to garnishment and execution in satisfaction of the judg­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the contingent 30% attorneys' fees of
petitioners-lawyers, the Court deems it proper at this stage, to direct in the
exercise of its authority to control the amount of such fees, that
petitioners-lawyers may collect their stipulated contingent 30% attorneys' fees
to the extent that additional amounts may be realized on the union workers' judgment
up to the sum of P150,000.00, including the initial payment of P110,000.00, (on
which they have already collected their corresponding fee), such that any
further amounts collected beyond said sum of P150,000.00 shall no longer be
subject to said contingent fee.</p>
