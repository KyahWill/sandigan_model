a lien, because an attorney has no lien upon the cause of action before
judgment for his costs; nor was it upon the principle that his services had
produced the money paid his client upon the settlement, because that could not
be known, and in fact no money may have been paid upon the set­tlement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So far as I can perceive, it was based upon
no principle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a mere arbitrary
exercise of power by the courts; not arbitrary in the <span style="">sense </span>that it was unjust or improper, but in the sense that it
was not based upon any right or principle recognized in other cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties being in court, and <span style="">a </span>suit commenced and pend­ing, for
the purpose of protecting attorneys who were their officers and subject to
their control, the courts invented this practice and assumed this extraordinary
power to defeat attempts to cheat the attorneys out of their costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attorney's fees were fixed in definite
sums, easily deter­mined by taxation and this power was exercised to secure
them their fees.' (pp. 76-77)</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, these authorities are quite persuasive, but contrary

court had lost jurisdiction of the case and had no power to dismiss it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A moment's reflection should make it clear

<p class="BODY">The difference We perceive, however, between petitioner's case,
on the one hand, and that of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rustia</span>, in the
above decision, on the other, is that in the latter's case, neither the court
nor the party adverse to his clients were aware of the exact agreement as to
his fees, whereas in the case of petitioner, both the court and the other
parties knew the terms of the contract for professional services between
petitioner and his clients, the <span class="SpellE">Magtibay</span> brothers,
because the written contract <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, Annex A, was
made part of the complaint, and none seriously disputes its authenticity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the court had already dismissed the
case when Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rustia</span> raised the question of his
fees before the court; in petitioner's instance, he opposed the motion to
dismiss and pleaded with the court to protect his rights as officer of the
court before the first order in question was issued by respondent judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were it not for these differences, We would
have inclined towards denying the herein petition in line with the <span class="SpellE">Rustia</span> ruling, that, in any event, <i style="">certiorari</i> is not the appropriate remedy, the American authorities
cited by peti­tioner notwithstanding.</p>

<p class="BODY">Withal, there is another Philippine case which moves Us to sustain
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of Recto vs.
Harden, 100 Phil. 440, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Claro</span> M. Recto found
himself practically in the same situation as petitioner herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After Atty. Recto had rendered services to
Mrs. Esperanza P. de Harden in a protracted suit against her husband for the
purposes of securing an increase of her and her daughter's monthly support,
(the spouses were separated), to P10,000.00 and of protecting and preserving
her rights in the pro­perties of the conjugal partnership, which suit lasted
from 1941 to 1949, and after the Court of First Instance of Ma­nila had
rendered a judgment favorable to Mrs. Harden ack­nowledging, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, her rights to the assets of the conjugal
partnership, which turned out to be P4,000,000, and awarding her a monthly support
of P2,500, practically as prayed for in Atty. Recto's pleadings, while the case
was already pending on appeal before this Court, Mrs. Har­den and her husband,
Mr. Fred Harden, entered into a compromise of their case, without the knowledge
of Atty. Recto, whereby said spouses "purportedly agreed to settle their
differences in consideration of the sum of P5,000 paid by Mr. Harden to Mrs.
Harden, and a monthly pension of $500 to be paid by him to her; (2) Mr. Harden
had created a trust fund of $20,000 from which said monthly pension of $500
would be taken; and (3) Mr. and Mrs. Har­den had mutually released and forever
discharged each other from all actions, debts, duties, accounts, demands and
claims to the conjugal partnership, in consideration of the sum of $1."
(p. 435)</p>

<p class="BODY">Whereupon Atty. Recto filed a motion with this Court praying
that:</p>

<blockquote>“a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pending the resolution of this mo­tion, the
receiver appointed herein be authorized to continue holding the pro­perties
above mentioned in his custody in order not to defeat the undersigned's
inchoate lien on them;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A day set aside to receive the evidence of the
undersigned and those of the plaintiff and the defendant Fred M. Harden, in

<blockquote>“c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due hearing, the under signed be
declared entitled to the sum of P400,000 as his fees for services rendered in
behalf of the plaintiff in this case, under paragraph 3 of the con­tract, Annex
'A', and to that end a charging lien therefore be established upon the
properties above-mentioned;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the receiver be ordered to pay to the
undersigned the full amount of the fees to which the latter is found to be
entitled."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This motion was objected to by Mr. <span class="SpellE">Harden’s</span>
counsel, who in turn, moved for the dismissal of the case, to which Atty. Recto
objected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances,
this Court acceded to Atty. Rectos prayer that the case be not dismissed, that
the receivership be maintained except as to certain properties not material to
mention here, and that the case be remanded to the lower court so that his fees
may be determined and ordered paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
the remand of the case to the lower court, a commissioner was appointed to hear
the matter of the amount of the fees in question, and after the commissioner
had submitted a report recommending the payment to Atty. Recto of the 20%
attorney’s fees stipulated in the contract for his services, equivalent to
P369,410.04, the court rendered judgment as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The contingent fee to which the claimant is entitled under
paragraph 3 of the contract, Exhibit JJJ or 20, is 20% of P1,920,554.85 or the
sum of P384,110.97.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, this Court hereby approves the recommendation of
the Commissioner with the above-stated modification, and finds that Attorney <span class="SpellE">Claro</span> M. Recto is en­titled to the sum of THREE HUNDRED
EIGHTY-FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TEN PESOS AND NINETY-SEVEN CENTAVOS
(P384,110.97), re­presenting 20% of Esperanza P. de <span class="SpellE">Harden's</span>
share in the conjugal properties owned by her and her husband, Fred M. Harden,
as contingent fee stipulated in paragraph 3 of the Contract of Professional
Services, Exhibit JJJ or 20, and the said Esperanza P. de Harden is hereby
ordered to pay the said amount above-stated."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal from this judgment to this Court, the same was af­firmed,
the decision stating pertinently in part:</p>

<blockquote>"The last objection is based upon principles of equity, but,
pursuant there­to, one who seeks equity must come with clean hands (<span class="SpellE">Bastida</span>, et al., vs. <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> <span class="SpellE">Buncio</span> &amp; Co., 93 Phil. 195; 30 C.J.S. 475), and
appellants have not done so, for the cir­cumstances surrounding the case show,
to our satisfaction, that their aforementioned agreements, ostensibly for the
settlement of the differences between husband and wife, were made for the
purpose of circumventing or defeating the rights of herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
under his above-quoted contract of services with Mrs. Harden.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, having secured <span style="">a </span>judgment <span style="">in </span>her favor, acknowledging her rights to the assets of the
conjugal partnership, which turned out to be worth al­most P4,000,000 in
addition to <span class="SpellE"><u>litis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>expensae</u></span>
<span style="">in </span>the sum of P175,000, it is
in­conceivable that Mrs. Harden would have waived such rights, as well as the
benefits of all orders and judgments in her favor, in consideration of the
paltry sum of $5,000 allegedly paid to her by Mr. Harden and the additional sum
of $20,000 to be paid by him <u>in</u> <u>installments</u>, at the rate of $500
a month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, no explanation has
been given for this most unusual avowed settlement between Mr. and Mrs.
Harden.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One can not even consider the
possibility of <span style="">a </span>reconciliation
between the spouses, the same being inconsistent with the mone­tary
consideration for said alleged settle­ment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is more, the records show that the relations between said spouses -
which were bad indeed, not only in July, 1941, when Mrs. Harden engaged the
services of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, but, even, before, for Mr.
and Mrs. Harden were separated since 1938 - had worsened considerably
thereafter, as evidenced by an action for divorce filed by Mr. Harden in New
Jersey, in July 1948, upon the ground of repeated acts of infidelity allegedly
committed by Mrs. Harden in 1940 and 1941."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the same considerations of equity, and for the better
protection of lawyers, who, trusting in the good faith of their clients, render
professional services on contingent basis, and so that it may not be said that
this Court sanctions in any way the questionable practice of clients of
compromising their cases at the back of their counsel with the consequence that
the stipulated contingent fees of the lawyer are either unreason­ably reduced
or even completely rendered without basis, as in this case - wherein the
clients waived the whole of their rights in favor of their opponent after the
latter had acknowledged, in effect, the correctness of said clients’ contention
- We have decided to grant the herein petition, in so far as the rights of
petitioner have been prejudiced by the questioned compromise agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While <span style="">We
</span>here reaffirm the rule that "the client has an undoubted right to
compromise a suit without the intervention of his lawyer",<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="">We </span>hold that when such compromise is
entered into in fraud of the lawyer, with intent to deprive him of the fees
justly due him, the compromise must be subject to the said fees, and that when
it is evident that the said fraud is committed in confabulation with the
adverse party who had knowledge of the lawyer's contingent interest or such
interest appears of record and who would benefit under such com­promise, the
better practice is to settle the matter of the attorney’s fees in the same
proceeding, after hearing all the affected parties and without prejudice to the
finality of the compromise in so far as it does not adversely affect the rights
of the lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, "the client
cannot, by settling, compromising or dismissing his suit during its <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>, deprive the attorney of his compensation for the
agreed amount, unless the law­yer consents to such settlement, compromise or
dismissal", (Legal and Judicial Ethics by Martin, 1967 Rev. Ed., p. 121)
for the attorney is or "shall be entitled to have and recover from his
client - a reasonable compensa­tion (not more) for his services, with a view to
the im­portance of the subject-matter of the controversy, the extent of the
services rendered, and the professional standing of the attorney", (Sec.
24, Rule 138, on Attor­ney and Admission to Bar) albeit, under Canon 12 of the
Canons of Professional Ethics, "in fixing fees, it should not be forgotten
that the profession is a branch of the administration of justice and not a mere
money-getting trade."</p>

<p class="BODY">True it is also that <span style="">"a
</span>client may, at anytime, dis­miss his attorney or substitute another in
his place", (Sec. 26, Rule 138) but it must be emphasized that the same
provision, which is an incorporation of Republic Act 636 into the Rules of
Court, also provides that "if the contract between client and attorney had
been reduced to writing and the dismissal of the attorney was without
justifiable cause, he shall be entitled to recover from the client full
compensation x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."
In the case at bar, by entering into the compromise agreement in ques­tion and
even inserting therein a prayer to the court to dismiss their case filed by
petitioner, (see footnote 6, ante) petitioner's clients impliedly dismissed
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rus­tia</span>
vs. the Court etc. <u>supra.</u>)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
implied dismissal appears to Us to have been made without justifiable cause,
none is urged anywhere in the record, and so, the above-quoted provision of
Section 26, Rule 138 applies here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
terms of the compromise in question, as spelled out in Annex A of Annex I of
the petition, indicate clearly that Aurelia Martinez, the defendant aunt-in-law
of peti­tioner's clients, acknowledged that the rights of said clients were
practically as alleged by petitioner in the complaint he filed for them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, through the services of
petitioner, his clients secured, in effect, a recognition, which had been
previously denied by their aunt-in-law, that they were entitled to a 1/4 share
in the estate left by their uncle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
hold that under these circumstances, and since it appears that said clients
have no other means to pay petitioner, since they instituted their case as
paupers, and that their aunt-in-law was aware of the terms of their contract of
professional ser­vices with petitioner, said clients had no right to waive the
portion of their such acknowledged rights in favor of their opponent to the
extent that such waiver would pre­judice the stipulated contingent interest of
their lawyer and their aunt-in-law had no right to accept such waiver
unqualifiedly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Civil Code enjoins
that:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 19.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every person
must, in the exercise of his rights and in the performance of his duties, act
with justice, give everyone his due, and observe honesty and good faith."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Under the circumstance extant in the
record, it is clear that the compromise agreement in question falls short of
the moral requirements of this quoted article of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If for this reason alone, it should not be
allowed to prejudice the rights of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accord­ingly, as all of these circumstances were presented to respondent
judge before he issued the challenged order of dismissal and all the parties
were heard thereon, it was incumbent upon His Honor, in equity and to avoid
multiplicity of suits, particularly, because the amount claimed by petitioner
is only P1,000.00, to have directly passed upon petitioner's claim, and not
having done so, it would appear that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> abused its
discret­ion gravely enough to warrant the writ of <i style="">certiorari</i> herein prayed for in so far as the questioned orders
prejudiced petitioner's right to the fees for the profess­ional services which
appear to have been creditably rendered by him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents allege that the judgment of dismissal in question is already
final because no appeal was taken <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, but
since We hold that the same was rendered with enough grave abuse of discretion
to warrant the <i style="">certiorari</i> prayed for,
such alleged finality could not have materialized; obviously, petitioner could
not have appealed, not being a party in the case.</p>
