				<H3>GENERAL BUS CORPORATION AND HALCON BUS LINE, INC., SUBSTITUTED BY MINDORO TRANSPORTATION COMPANY INC., PETITIONERS, VS. GREGORIO CUNANAN, RESPONDENT.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On January 17, 1958, Gregorio Cunanan filed an application with the Public 
Service Commission to operate 5 units on the Pinamalayan-Bongabong line 
(Oriental Mindoro) and vice-versa. The application was opposed by the General 
Bus Corporation and the Halcon Bus Line, Inc.
<p>In support of his application, Cunanan presented evidence to show that there 
were many passengers along the line in question who have to wait for the buses 
of the Halcon and Gexieral Bus Corporations from one to two hours; that despite 
waiting for that length of time many are left behind because of lack of 
accommodation; and that because of engine trouble sometimes the buses are 
delayed or do not make the trips at all. He further proved that the town of 
Pinamalayan has a population of about 30,000 and that he is financially able to 
operate and maintain the service applied for.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the oppositors presented evidence tending to show that 
they were operating a total of 17 trucks which maintain hourly schedule of trips 
on the line in question; that although their buses have a capacity of 47 to 47-Â½ 
passengers, however, when they leave Bongabong the volume of passengers is only 
about 20%; and that there are other authorized TPU operators on the line. They 
also presented evidence to show that applicant is not financially able to 
maintain the service applied for by him. And, finally, they introduced as 
evidence the reports of three agents of the Commission relative to the volume of 
passengers and the intervals of trips undertaken by oppositors, together with 
the record of the Commission certified by one of its employees to the effect 
that on said line there is a total of 47 authorized round trips a day with a 
frequency of 15 minutes interval.</p>
<p>On November 9, 1958, the Commission, by a vote of 2 to 1, held, after careful 
consideration of the evidence, that public convenience will be promoted by 
approving the application, thereby authorizing applicant to operate 3 of the 5 
units applied for. Their motion for reconsideration having been denied, 
oppositors interposed the present petition for review.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Mindoro Transportation Company, Inc. acquired by purchase all 
the certificate of public convenience of oppositors, including all the 
auto-trucks used by them in operating the service, and after the sale had been 
provisionally approved by the Public Service Commission, its counsel moved this 
Court to allow the Mindoro Transportation Company, Inc., to prosecute this 
petition in lieu of oppositors being the real party in interest. This motion was 
duly noted.</p>
<p>The only question to be determined is whether or not in the light of the 
evidence adduced by both parties the Commission acted properly in granting 
respondent a certificate of public convenience to operate a TPU service on the 
Pinamalayan-Bongabong line.</p>
<p>It is clear that the issue posed by petitioners as stated above merely 
disputes the findings of fact made by the Commission in its decision, and such 
being the ease it is evident that in the light of the ruling of this Court in a 
long line of cases their petition cannot be sustained. Thus, we held in said 
cases that if after a review of the evidence the Public Service Commission 
arrives at the conclusion that the new service applied for is warranted by 
public necessity and convenience, this Court will not disturb such finding if 
there is sufficient evidence to support the same.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> And here there is such evidence. Indeed, 
there is ample evidence to support the Commission's finding that on the line in 
question many of the passengers have to wrait almost two hours before they are 
able to ride on the buses of oppositors to the extent that sometimes not all of 
them can be accommodated, and that because of engine trouble sometimes the buses 
are delayed or do not make the scheduled trips thereby causing prejudice to the 
passengers. The Commission even noted that, according to the very reports 
submitted by its own agents, the interval of trips of the oppositors' buses is 
one hour ol1 more and that their registered equipment is not sufficient to cover 
their time schedule thus abandoning some of their authorized trips.</p>
<p>On the other hand, although oppositors had given much emphasis to the record 
of the Commission regarding the authorized 47 round trips maintained daily by 
them and other operators on the line in question with a trip interval of 15 
minutes, nevertheless, this evidence has been sufficiently rebutted by the 
reports of the same agents to the effect that the other operators therein 
mentioned operate only within the towns of Naujan, Baco, San Teodoro and other 
adjacent municipalities; that of the 51 authorized units of oppositors onJy 48 
are being operated thus forcing them to abandon some of their trip schedules; 
and that much as they wanted to maintain their regular service, petitioners were 
prevented from doing so because of the rugged condition of the roads and the 
occasional swelling of the Bongabong river. These evidences amply support the 
conclusion arrived at by the Commission that public convenience and necessity 
may be promoted if applicant be permitted to operate three units on the line 
applied for by him.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, without pronouncement as 
to costs.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera,
