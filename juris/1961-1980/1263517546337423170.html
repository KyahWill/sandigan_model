 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> branches of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Case L-30871</u> arose from the following facts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A judgment for P35,000.00-actual, moral and
exemplary damages obtained by Enrique de Leon against private respondent <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> in Civil Case No.
C-189 of Branch XII of the <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> court of first
instance, <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City branch presided by Judge
Fernando A. Cruz, having become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
a writ of execution was issued by said court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pursuant thereto, the city sheriff, on Nov­ember 8, 1966 levied on
execution on two parcels of land of 682.5 square meters each registered in the
names of <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> under T. C. T. Nos. 94985 and 94986
of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the execution sale held on February 14, 1967, the city sheriff sold
the said pro­perties to herein petitioner, Aurora (sister of the judgment credi­tor)
as the highest bidder for the total sum of P30,194.00, (the property then being
subject to an existing mortgage lien in the amount of P120,000.00).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sheriff executed the corresponding
certificate of sale in her favor, which was duly registered on <st1:date year="1967" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1967</st1:date> with the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
register of deeds.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1968</st1:date>,
just about two weeks before the expiration, of the one-year period to redeem
the properties sold in execution, the judgment debtor <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>
filed a separate civil action docketed as Civil Case No. C-1217 against his judgment
creditor Enrique de Leon, herein petitioner Aurora P. de Leon as purchaser and
the sheriff as defendants for the setting aside or annulment of the execution
sale held on <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1967</st1:date>
"for being anomalous and irregular”, and for the ordering of a new auction
sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This second case, instead of being
referred to Judge Cruz presiding over Branch XII which had issued the writ of
execution, was assigned to Branch XIV, the other <span class="SpellE">Caloo­can</span>
City branch of the <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Court of First Instance
presided by Judge <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span> Salvador, who issued on
February 19, 1968 a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining therein
defendants, particu­larly the sheriff to desist "from taking further
proceedings against the properties of the plaintiff [<span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>]
that were sold at public auction on February 14, 1967, and from issuing a
sheriff's deed of sale at the expiration of the period of redemption on
February 21, 1968 in favor of defendant Aurora P. de Leon." Aurora moved
to dissolve the injunction and to dismiss this second case on the grounds of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> and lack of jurisdiction of Judge Salvador's court
to interfere with the execution proceedings pending in the first case before
Judge Cruz' court which is of equal and co-or­dinate jurisdiction, but Judge
Salvador denied the same for not being indubitable and tried the case,
notwithstanding Aurora's pleas before and after the trial to resolve the issue
of his court's lack of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">Pending his decision, Judge Salvador issued on May 20, 1969 an
order granting two ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motions, of <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> of May 12, and May 15, 1969 and ordering the
sheriff to allow <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> to redeem the two properties
sold at public auction more than two years ago on February 14, 1967 under the
writ of execution is­sued by Judge Cruz' court in the first case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the following day, <st1:date year="1969" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1969</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>
deposited with the sheriff the sum of P33,817.28 as the redemption price
(P15,987,00 per lot plus interests), who issued a certificate of
redemption.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>
then "registered on the following day, May 22, 1969, the sheriff's cer­tificate
of redemption with the register of deeds, who in turn cancelled the entry of
the execution sale in favor of Aurora, as <span style="">well
as registered on one of the properties covered by T. C. T. </span><span style="">No. </span><span style="">94986 a deed of first mortgage executed on May 20, 1969 by <span class="SpellE">Ber­nabe</span> in favor of one Antonio de <span class="SpellE">Zuzuarregui</span>
to secure a loan of P130,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Aurora's motion of May 28, 1969 in the second case to set aside the
order and certificate of redemption and re­gistration of mortgage on the ground
of lack of jurisdiction was denied by Judge Salvador, who ruled in his order of
June 23, 1969 that "there is no question that this Court has jurisdiction
to hear </span>and determine this case which questions the regularity and
legality of the auction sale of properties held on February 14, 1967, hence the
authority granted by the Court to redeem said properties within the redemption
period in order to write finis to the pending case."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, this action for certiorari filed by Aurora <span class="SpellE">impleading</span>
the sheriff and the register of deeds for the annulment and setting aside for
lack of jurisdiction of the ques­tioned orders of Judge Salvador's court as
well as of the chal­lenged <span class="SpellE">actuactions</span> of the other
respondent officials pursuant thereto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As prayed for, the Court issued a writ of preliminary injunction
enjoining said respondents from doing or taking any other act in connection
with the said properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">On May 30, 1969, Aurora also filed in the first case before Judge
Cruz' court a motion with proper notice for consolidation of title and for the
court to order the sheriff to issue in her favor a final deed of sale over the
subject parcels of land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge Cruz
order of September 5, 1969, granting Aurora's motion over <span class="SpellE">Ber­nabe's</span>
opposition that he had redeemed on May 21, 1969 the said properties by virtue
of Judge Salvador's order of May 20, 1969 in the second case and ordering <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> to surrender his owner's duplicates of title for
transfer to Aurora, in turn gave rise to <u>Case L-31603</u> filed by <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Bernabe's</span> motion for reconsideration urging Judge Cruz to
hold in abeyance Aurora's motion for consolidation of title until this Court's
decision in Case <span style="">L-30871 "which
will end once and for all the legal controversy" over the conflict of
jurisdiction between the two courts, was denied by Judge Cruz' order of January
8, 1970, he filed this action for certiorari, <span class="SpellE">impleading</span>
the sheriff, for the annulment and revocation of the questioned orders of Judge
Cruz, on the ground of the latter's lack of jurisdiction to issue the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As prayed for, the Court
also issued a writ of preliminary injunc­tion against the enforcement of Judge
Cruz' orders, until the con­flict between the parties could be finally
resolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">The decisive issue at bar is a simple one of jurisdiction:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>which court, Branch XII presided by Judge
Cruz or Branch XIV presided by Judge Salvador has exclusive jurisdiction to set
aside for alleged irregularities the execution sale held on February 14, 1967
by virtue of the writ for the execution of the final judgment in the first case
(No. C-189) issued by Judge Cruz court and to order a new auction sale - which
was the relief sought by the <span style="">judgment
debtor in the second case (No. C-1217) in Judge Salvador's court?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is patent that such exclusive jurisdiction was vested in Judge
Cruz' court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having acquired
jurisdiction over Case No. C-189 and rendered judgment that had become final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, it retained jurisdiction over its
judgment, to the exclusion of all other co-ordinate courts for its execution and
all incidents thereof, and to control, in furtherance of justice, the conduct
of its min­isterial officers in connection therewith.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Execution of its judgment having been carried out by the sheriff with the levy
and sale of the judgment debtor's properties, <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> as judgment debtor could not in the guise of
a new and separate second action (Case No. 1217) ask another court of
co-ordinate jurisdiction, Judge Salvador's court, to interfere by injunction
with the execution proceedings, to set them aside and to order the holding of a
new execution sale - instead of seeking such relief by proper motion and
application from Judge Cruz' court which had exclusive jurisdiction over the
execution proceedings and the properties sold at the execution sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">As early as 1922, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Cabigao</u></span><u>
vs. del Rosario</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court laid down the doctrine that "no court has power to inter­fere
by injunction with the judgments or decrees of a court of concurrent or
coordinate jurisdiction having power to grant the relief sought by
injunction'', pointing out that "(T)he various branches of the Court of
First Instance of Manila are in a sense coordinate courts and to allow them to
interfere with each other's judgments or decrees by injunctions would obviously
lead to con­fusion<span style=""> and might seriously
hinder the administration of justice."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court similarly ruled in <span class="SpellE"><u>Hubahib</u></span><u>
vs. Insular Drug Co., Inc</u>.,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
with reference to Branch II of the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> court of
first instance having taken cognizance of an independent action for the
annulment of a writ of execution issued by Branch III of the same court which
has rendered the judgment, that "the institution of said action was not
only improper but also absolutely unjustified, on the ground that the appellant
had the remedy of applying to the same Branch III of the lower court, which
issued the orders in question, for reconsideration thereof, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> or of appealing from said
orders or from that denying his motion in case such order has been issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The various branches of a Court of First
Instance of a province or city, having as they have the same or equal authority

less with their orders or judgments, by means of injunction</u>."</p>

the Court, through former Chief Justice Cesar <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>,
thus explained that the garnishment or levy of property on execution brings the
property into <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">legis</span></u>
of the court issuing the writ of exe­cution, beyond the interference of all
other co-ordinate courts, thereby avoiding conflicts of power between such
courts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"(T)he garnishment of
property to satisfy a writ of execution 'operates as an attachment and fastens
upon the property a lien by which the property is brought under the
jurisdiction of the court issuing the writ.'<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is brought into <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">legis</span>,</u> under the sole control of such court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Property is in the custody of the court when
it has been seized by an officer either under a writ of attachment on <span class="SpellE">mesne</span> process or under a writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A court which has control of such property,
exercises exclusive jurisdiction over the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No court, except one having a supervisory con­trol or superior
jurisdiction in the premises, has a right to in<span style="">terfere with and change that possession."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court in striking down the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
court's issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction against the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> city sheriff's garnishment of cash funds of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City deposited in the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
branch of the Philippine National Bank pursuant to a writ of exe­cution issued
by the Manila court of first instance for the satis­faction of a final judgment

procedure in such cases and the fundamental reason <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"(T)he reason advanced by the respondent

procedure to follow, <span class="SpellE">i</span>. e., a resort to the Manila
court, wherein the remedy may be obtained, it be­ing the court under whose
authority the illegal levy had been made.<span style="">&nbsp;

"that a judge of a branch of a court may not interfere with the
proceedings before a judge of another branch of the same court."</p>

<p class="BODY">The properties in question were brought into <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">legis</span></u> of Judge Cruz' court and came under its
exclusive jurisdiction when they were levied upon by the sheriff pursuant to
the writ for execution of the judgment rendered by said court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The levy is the essential act by which the
judgment debtor's property is set apart for the satisfaction of the judgment
and taken into custody of the law, and from such time the court issuing the
execution acquires exclusive jurisdiction over the property and all subsequent
claims of other parties are subordinated thereto, irrespec­tive of the time
when the property is actually sold.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The execution sale having been carried out upon order of Judge Cruz' court, any
and all questions concerning the validity and regular­ity of the sale
necessarily had to be addressed to: his court which had exclusive jurisdiction
over the properties and were beyond interference by Judge Salvador's
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge Cruz' court alone had
jurisdiction - subject only to the supervisory control or appel­late
jurisdiction of superior courts - to rule upon the regularity and validity of
the sale conducted by its ministerial officers from the sheriff's office, and
his affirmative ruling thereon could not be interfered with by injunction of,
nor sought to be foreclosed by, the challenged orders of Judge Salvador's
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bernabe's</span> contention that "he does
not attempt to annul or nullify the judgment or order issued by (Judge Cruz'
court) ...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If (Judge Salvador's court)

brought into the exclusive <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">legis</span></u> of Judge Cruz' court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is but in accordance with the

aptly called the life the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The suit
does not terminate with the judgment; and all proceedings on the execution, are
proceedings in the suit, and which are expressly, by the act of Congress, put
under the regulation and control of the Court out of which it issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a power incident to every Court from

Any and all questions involving the execution sale concerned the proceedings in
Judge Cruz' court and had to be raised and determined in that court, subject to
review by the higher courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They could
not be improperly passed upon by another co-ordinate court - behind the back,
as it were of Judge Cruz' court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">Judge Salvador's order of May 20, 1969 granting two ex­-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motions of the judgment debtor <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>
and directing the sheriff to allow the redemption of the properties notwithstanding
that the one-year redemption period had already lapsed more than one year ago
on February 21, 1968 (one year after registra­tion on May 21, 1967 of the
sheriff's sale of May 14, 1967) was equally untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted that <span class="SpellE">Bernabe's</span>
action in Judge Salvador's court filed on February 7, 1968 two weeks be­fore
the expiration of the redemption period sought to set aside the execution sale
and to have a new auction sale ordered, on the grounds that the sheriff had
allegedly sold the two parcels of land jointly instead of separately, and that
the total sales price of P30,194.00 was shocking to the conscience, alleging
that the two parcels, if sold separately, could easily be sold at P235,000.00
and P150,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pending decision and
without ruling squarely on his court's lack of jurisdiction over the
properties, Judge Sal­vador <span class="SpellE">preremptorily</span> issued his
redemption order on <span class="SpellE">Bernabe's</span> bare manifestation that
''(he) has but barely two days left of the one (1) year period granted by law
to redeem" and that "(he) is now ready and willing to redeem"
the properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aside from the basic lack of jurisdiction of Judge Salvador's
court to issue the redemption order, the order <u>per</u> <u>se</u> suffered
from other grave flaws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bernabe's</span> motions in effect amounted to an abandonment of
his position on the alleged irregularity of the execution sale, and the logical
consequence thereof would have been the dismissal of his suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Thus, soon after Aurora's filing of her
action for certiorari in this Court, <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> filed
his so-called "Urgent Motion to Dismiss" of August 27, 1969 with
Judge Salvador's court praying for the dismissal of the very case filed by him
on the ground that having redeemed the properties, "the case can therefore
be considered closed and terminated considering that defendants [Aurora, et
al.] did not interpose any appeal" from the redemption order. ) But <span class="SpellE">Bernabe's</span> motions were pre­sented on May 12 and May 15,
1969 and it was self-evident from the record that the one-year period for
redemption had long ex­pired more than a year ago on February 21, 1968 as above
stated and that <span class="SpellE">Bernabe's</span> allegations that he had <u>two
days</u> left - of the redemption period was a gratuitous one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the record indicates that <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> had ever timely made a valid offer of re­demption
so as to safeguard his right thereto prior to his filing his separate action
questioning the validity of the execution sale.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was therefore void and illogical for Judge Salvador to rule, in
denying Aurora's motion for reconsideration that "there is no question
that this Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine this case which
questions the regularity and legality of the auction sale of properties held on
February 14, 1967, hence the author­ity granted by the Court to redeem said
properties within the redemption period in order to write finis to the pending
case." For Judge Salvador thereby begged the basic prejudicial ques­tions
of his court's lack of jurisdiction and the expiration over a year ago of <span class="SpellE">Bernabe's</span> alleged right of redemption, not to men­tion that
any grant of such right to redeem could not be decreed in a summary unreasoned
order but would have to be adjudged in a formal decision reciting the facts and
the law on which it is <span style="">based, and which
may not be immediately executed, without a special order <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Judge Salvador's void orders, all that
a judgment debtor whose properties have been sold at execution sale but <span style="">who </span>does not have the funds to effect
redemp­tion has to do to unilaterally extend the one-year redemption period would
be to file a separate action before another court of coordinate jurisdiction
questioning the regularity of the exe­cution sale and upon his getting the
funds, notwithstanding the expiration of the redemption period, get an order of
redemption and ask the court "to write finis to the pending case" -
which should have been dismissed in the first instance for lack of jur</span><span style="">isd</span><span style="">iction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine cited that a court or a branch thereof may not interfere
with the proceedings before a judge of another court or branch of the same
court since they are all courts of equal and co-ordinate jurisdiction is an
elementary doctrine that has been established with the very system of courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Understand­able as <span class="SpellE">Bernabe's</span>
plight and financial predicament may be, still it is incomprehensible why he
should futilely resort, as he did, to filing his separate action with Judge
Salvador's court which patently lacked jurisdiction over the properties sold in
execution instead of questioning the regularity of the execution sale before
Judge Cruz' court as the court of competent and exclusive jurisdiction, and
properly applying, if he had just grounds, for extension of the redemption
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

total price of P385,000.00, <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> has admitted that
there was an existing mortgage lien on the pro­perties in the amount of P120,000.00
which necessarily affected their value.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This question was not raised at all before Judge Cruz' court nor did
Judge Salvador rule thereupon, since he merely issued his void order of
redemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to state on the
basis of the record, however, that the failure of <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>
to timely sell the properties for their fair value through negotiated sales
with third persons either before or after the execution sale in order to be
able to discharge his judgment debt or redeem the properties within the redemption
period, or to raise the neces­sary amount <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
to so effect redemption notwithstanding that they have been collecting the
substantial monthly rentals thereof of P2,500.00 monthly even up to now<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
can be attri­buted only to his own failings and gross improvidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They <span style="">cannot
be cited in law or in equity to defeat the lawful claim of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Aurora</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> nor to give validity to the void orders of
Judge Salvador's court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The applicable
rule on forced sales where the law gives the owner the right of redemption was
thus stated by the Court in <u>Velasquez vs. <span class="SpellE">Coronel</span>:</u></span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> "However, while in ordinary sales for <span style="">reasons </span>of equity a transaction may be
invalidated on the ground of inadequacy of price, or when such inadequacy
shocks one's conscience as to justify the courts to <span class="SpellE">interefere</span>,
<u>such does<span style="">&nbsp; </span>not follow when the law
gives to the owner the right to redeem, as when a sale is made at public
auction, upon the theory that the lesser the price the easier it is for the
owner to effect the redemp­tion</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
so it was aptly said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'When there is the
right to redeem, <u>inadequacy of price should not be material,</u> because the
judgment debtor may reacquire the property or also sell his right to redeem'
and thus recover the loss he claims to have suffered by reason of the price
obtained at the auction sale."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bernabe's</span> petition challenging the
jurisdiction, of Judge Cruz' court to issue its orders of September 5, 1969 and
January 5, 1970, confirming Aurora's acquisition of title to the properties by
virtue of the execution sale and ordering <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> to
transfer possession thereof to her, because of the separate civil action filed
by him in Judge Salvador's court, must necessarily fail -- since said orders
were within the exclusive competence and jurisdiction of Judge Cruz' court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, in Case L-30871, the writ of certiorari
prayed for is granted; respondent Judge Salvador's court is declared without

orders of May 20, 1969 and June 23, 1969 therein issued, as well as respondent
sheriff's certificate of redemption issued on May 21, 1969 are set aside and
declared null and void; and the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Court
on September 2, 1969 is made permanent.<span style="">&nbsp;
