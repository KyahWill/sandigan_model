				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Appeal taken by Leon <span class="SpellE">Climaco</span> from the order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> dated January 12, 1959 in Civil Case No. 740
entitled "Leon <span class="SpellE">Climaco</span>, plaintiff, vs. Carlos <span class="SpellE">Siy</span> <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and Manuel Co.
defendants," denying the admission of his amended complaint for the
substitution of a deceased party-defendant, and dismissing the action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On August 21, 1958 <span class="SpellE">Climaco</span> filed with the lower court an action for damages
against (1) Carlos <span class="SpellE">Siy</span> <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
and (2) Manuel Co, his complaint alleging:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that sometime in May, 1957, defendants maliciously charged him with the
crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> before the City Fiscal of Manila;
that, conspiring with </span>each <span style="">other,
they gave the latter a false Manila address for plaintiff in order to mislead
said officer into filing, as he did file, Criminal </span>Case No. 399622 with
the Court of First Instance of Manila against him, without giving him an
opportunity to present his side of the case; that, besides, defendants had
arranged to have plaintiff arrested and taken to Manila, without giving him a
chance to file a bond, albeit this part of the plan failed; that to defend himself,
plaintiff and his counsel had to make several trips to Manila by plane and
boat, thus, incurring extraordinary expenses; that, after trial, the Court of
First Instance of Manila dismissed the case; that the said prosecution hurt the
business credit and reputation of plaintiff, wounded his feelings, and caused
him suffering, anguish, humiliation, and damages in the total amount of
P19,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1958" day="8" month="9"><span style="">September
 8, 1958</span></st1:date><span style=""> defendants
filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it stated no cause
of action and that the Court had not acquired jurisdiction over the person of
defendant Carlos <span class="SpellE">Siy</span> <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> who
died on </span><st1:date year="1958" day="27" month="8"><span style="">August 27, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">
before summons could be served upon him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pending resolution of this motion, plaintiff filed a motion for leave to
amend his complaint to substitute the heirs of Carlos <span class="SpellE">Siy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Uy</span> - and eventually, the Executor of his Estate - as
defendants in the action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1958" day="11" month="10"><span style="">October
 11, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, the lower
court issued an order granting the motion, but subsequently, defendants moved
for a reconsideration of said order and, on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="12" month="1"><span style="">January 12, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, the court issued the appealed order not
only setting aside its previous order of </span><st1:date year="1958" day="11" month="10"><span style="">October 11, 1958</span></st1:date><span style=""> but also dismissing the complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thereupon the plaintiff
took the present appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the facts alleged in the complaint it is clear that <span class="SpellE">Climaco</span> had a cause of action against the persons named as
defendants therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was, however, a
cause of action for the recovery of damages, that is, a sum of money, and the
corresponding action is, unfortunately, one that does not survive upon the death
of the defendant, in accordance with the provisions of Section 21, Rule 3 of
the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither could the action as against the deceased <span class="SpellE">Siy</span> <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> be maintained under
Section 1, Rule 87 of the Rules of Court because this legal provision only authorizes
actions against the Executor or Administrator when they are for the recovery of
real or personal property, or an interest therein, from the estate, or to
enforce a lien thereon, or when the action is to recover damages for an injury
to person or property, real or personal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this case the damages which <span class="SpellE">Climaco</span> sought
to recover from the deceased <span class="SpellE">Siy</span> <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
did not spring from any injury caused to his <u>person</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, in so far <span style="">as </span>the appealed order denied <span class="SpellE">Climacoâ€™s</span>
motion for leave to amend his complaint in the sense stated therein, the same <span style="">is </span>correct.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the deceased <span class="SpellE">Siy</span> <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> was not the only defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Manuel Co was also named defendant in the
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, therefore, the
order appealed from <span style="">is </span>erroneous
insofar as it dismissed the case against <st1:place>Co.</st1:place></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order appealed from is set aside insofar as
it dismissed the case against defendant Manuel Co, and the record of this case
is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs.</span></p>
