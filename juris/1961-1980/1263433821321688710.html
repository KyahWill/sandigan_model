prohibition and <i>mandamus</i>, on the grounds of improper venue and <span class="SpellE"><u>litis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendentia</u></span>, is
the summary judgment of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
<span class="SpellE"><u>Caloocan</u></span><u> City</u> Branch XXXV, ejecting Lim
Se and Benito Lim from Door No. 72 of the <span class="SpellE">Venancia</span> Building
located at 72 Session Road, corner Calderon Street, <span class="SpellE"><u>Baguio</u></span><u>
City</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedents of this case are set forth in the resolution of
April 7, 1976 in the contempt incident, <u>In re</u> <span class="SpellE">Adaza</span>,
70 SCRA 378, wherein respondents' counsel was found guilty of contempt in <u>facie</u>
<u>curiae</u> and was severely censured for having used vicious, abusive and
disrespectful language in his motion for the lifting of the writ of preliminary
mandatory injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, only a
summary statement of the salient facts will be made herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1975</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulotano</span> filed a
complaint in the Court of First Instance at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
against Juana San Pedro <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> and Francisco San
Pedro, the children of <span class="SpellE">Venancia</span> <span class="SpellE">Chiombon</span>,
the owner of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Venancia</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>, who allegedly sold it to
Juana who in turn sold it to <span class="SpellE">Bulotano</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bulotano</span> prayed that defendants be
ordered to deliver to him the possession of Door No. 72, including its
mezzanine and the entire basement of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Venancia</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>
(Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">C-3547).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>No reason was adduced in that complaint as to
why an action to recover possession of realty located in <span class="SpellE"><u>Baguio</u></span><u>
City</u> was filed in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><u>Caloocan</u></span></st1:placename><u>
 </u><st1:placetype><u>City</u></st1:placetype></st1:place>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">That action of <span class="SpellE">Bulotano</span> should not
occasion any surprise because he had previously filed in the Court of First
Instance of Cavite a similar case, Civil Case No. N-1647, against Juana San
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, Lim Se, <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Zabala</span>
and Olivia R. <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span>, as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
of the Intestate Estate of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Reyes, Sr.</p>

<p class="BODY">In that <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>
case, <span class="SpellE">Bulotano</span> prayed that Lim Se, <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zabala</span> be ordered
to deliver to him the possession of the same <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Venancia</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
a part of which is involved in the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:place></st1:city>
case, Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">C-3547.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact shows that <span class="SpellE">Bulotano's</span>
counsel has a wanton disregard for the venue of real actions.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> case, defendants Juana
S. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> and Francisco San Pedro filed against Lim
Se and Benito Lim, father and son, <u>an unverified</u> third-party complaint
(in reality an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> action) praying that they be
ordered to vacate Door No. 72, the ground floor, mezzanine and basement of the
same <span class="SpellE">Venancia</span> Building and to pay the sum of P71<span class="GramE">,200</span> as back rentals.</p>

<p class="BODY">That third-party complaint or <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
action was based on the termination in 1970 of the 1965 lease contract between
Lim Se and Francisco San Pedro, as attorney-in-fact of his mother, <span class="SpellE">Venancia</span> <span class="SpellE">Chiombon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is noteworthy that in that contract it was
stipulated that "<u>in case of suit arising out of this contract,</u> <u>venue
thereof shall be the City of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></u>" (p. 31,
<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Lim Se and Benito Lim filed a motion to dismiss the third-party
complaint on the grounds of improper venue, <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span> and lack of jurisdiction over the <u>res</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court denied it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those grounds were pleaded as affirmative
defenses in the answer of Lim Se and Benito Lim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, Juana S. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> and
Francisco San Pedro filed an urgent motion for summary judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court granted the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ordered Lim Se and Benito Lim to vacate
Door No. 72 of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Venancia</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>, its mezzanine and
basement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Juana and Francisco then filed a motion for execution pending
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They alleged that Lim Se's
cotenants, <span class="SpellE">Zabala</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>
(occupants of Doors Nos. 74 and 76 of the same <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Venancia</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>),
were ejected in a decision rendered by Judge <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span>
Salvador of the same <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:place></st1:city>
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lim Se and Benito Lim opposed the
motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">They filed a motion for the reconsideration of the summary
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They alleged that they had
leased the disputed premises from the administrator of the estate of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Reyes, Sr. who was the owner of the lot on which
the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Venancia</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place> stands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reyes claimed to have become the owner of the
said building after the expiration of the lease of the lot executed between
Reyes and <span class="SpellE">Venancia</span> <span class="SpellE">Chiombon</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lim Se and Benito Lim alleged that there was pending in the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> <u>Civil Case No. 2817</u>
which was filed by the administrator of the estate of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
Reyes, Sr. against <span class="SpellE">Bulotano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Venancia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Chiombon</span>, Juana S. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>,
Francisco San Pedro, Lim Se and others to settle once and for all the ownership
and possession of the <span class="SpellE">Venancia</span> Building.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lim Se and Benito Lim further alleged that <span class="SpellE">Venancia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Chiombon</span> and her son, Francisco San Pedro, executed a
simulated and fraudulent sale of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Venancia</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>
to <span class="SpellE">Venancia's</span> daughter, Juana S. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>,
who in turn sold it fictitiously to <span class="SpellE">Bulotano</span> to
prevent the building from becoming the property of Reyes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lim Se and Benito Lim called the lower court's attention to the
fact that in Civil Case No. 1702 of the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:place></st1:city> court, Li <span class="SpellE">Hua</span>, the wife of Lim Se, was sought to be ejected from the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Venancia</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>
but Judge Salvador dismissed the case as to her.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:place></st1:city>
court denied the motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In a separate order dated <st1:date year="1976" day="29" month="1">January
 29, 1976</st1:date> it declared its summary judgment as final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and directed the issuance of a writ of possession
against Lim Se and Benito Lim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
deputy sheriff ejected Lim Se and Benito Lim from the disputed premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the filing of the instant petition assailing the summary
judgment and the writ of possession, this Court issued a writ of preliminary
mandatory injunction restoring Lim Se and Benito Lim to the possession of the
disputed premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the trial court acted with grave abuse of discretion
and in excess of jurisdiction in not dismissing the third-party complaint which
was an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit pure and simple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The venue of that real action was improperly
laid in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, that action was not maintainable in view of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> of the aforementioned Civil Case No. 2817 involving
the ownership and possession of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Venancia</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the parties in the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:place></st1:city> case are <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> in the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city>
case together with the estate of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Reyes, Sr.
which asserts ownership over the disputed premises adverse to that of the
private respondents herein, <span class="SpellE">Bulotano</span>, Juana S. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> and Francisco San Pedro and their
predecessor-in-interest, <span class="SpellE">Venancia</span> <span class="SpellE">Chiombon</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondents contend that since the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:place></st1:city> court had jurisdiction
over the main action, it had also jurisdiction over the third-party
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They cite the ruling that
"where a court has jurisdiction of a claim and the parties in the
principal action, it <u>generally</u> has jurisdiction also of a suit or
proceeding which is a continuation of or incidental and ancillary to the
principal action, even though it might not have jurisdiction of the ancillary proceeding
if it were an independent and original action or proceeding" (1 Moran's
Comments on the Rules of Court, 1970 Ed., p. 279, citing Republic vs. Central
Surety &amp; Ins. Co., L-27802, October 26, 1968, 25 SCRA 641, 648-9).</p>

<p class="BODY">That contention is wrong and misleading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The principal action in
Civil Case No.</span> C-3547 was denominated "specific performance with
damages".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Actually, it was a real
action to recover "the possession of Door No. 72, its mezzanine floor and
the entire basement of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Venancia</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>" located in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That principal action should have been
brought in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city>
and not in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants Juana S. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> and
Francisco San Pedro did not impugn the venue of the principal action in Civil
Case No. <span class="GramE">C-3547 because, according to petitioners' theory, <span class="SpellE">Bulotano</span>, the plaintiff in Civil Case No.</span> C-<span class="GramE">3547,</span> was merely a dummy of Juana and her brother, Francisco,
and the said principal action was a collusive suit between <span class="SpellE">Bulotano</span>
and the San <span class="SpellE">Pedros</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">If the venue of the principal action was improperly laid in <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City, then the venue of the third-party complaint,
which the private respondents characterize as an action ancillary to the main
action but which in reality was a variant of the main action, was likewise
improperly ventilated in <span class="SpellE">Calo­ocan</span> City just as a
prior similar action was improperly brought in <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also untenable is the theory of private respondents Juana S. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> and Francisco San Pedro that they could eject Lim Se
and Benito Lim from the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Venancia</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place> even if respondents'
ownership of that building is being questioned by the estate of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Reyes, Sr. in Civil Case No. 2817 where Lim Se
and private respondents were <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 1, Rule 4 of the Rules of Court provides that
"forcible entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> actions regarding
real property shall be brought in the municipality or city in which the subject
matter thereof is situated".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 2 of Rule 4 provides that "actions affecting title to, or
for recovery of possession" of real property shall be commenced and tried
in the province where the property or any part thereof is situated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Those rules on the venue of real actions are designed to prevent
courts sitting in places other than the place where the real property is
situated from taking cognizance of actions regarding the possession or
ownership of that particular real property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Those rules are dictated by convenience.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They forestall the rendition of conflicting decisions by different
courts on the issue of ownership or possession.</p>

<p class="BODY">The wisdom and expediency of those rules are illustrated in this
case where Lim Se, as the tenant of an apartment located in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city>, has been harassed by the
private respondents with an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit filed <u>in
</u><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><u>Cavite</u></span></st1:place></st1:city>
and another <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit filed in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><u>Caloocan</u></span></st1:placename><u> </u><st1:placetype><u>City</u></st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, Lim Se is a defendant in a <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><u>Baguio</u></span></st1:place></st1:city><u> case</u> where he
is being required to recognize the estate of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
Reyes, Sr. as the owner of the apartment and not the private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record contains indications that the private respondents, to
suit their purpose, deliberately sought to avoid the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city> courts as the legitimate
forum for their real action to recover the possession of premises located in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To sanction respondents' flagrant evasion of
the rule on the venue of a real action is to tolerate a palpable, <span class="SpellE">manipulatory</span> abuse or perversion of the right to litigate.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this Court's resolution of <st1:date year="1979" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1979</st1:date>, the parties were directed to state
whether this case has become moot and academic due to supervening events.</p>

<p class="BODY">In compliance with that resolution, the petitioners manifested
that they are still in possession of the disputed premises, that Civil Case No.
2817 is still pending, that the issue as to the ownership and possession of the
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Venancia</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>
is as yet unresolved and that this case has not become moot.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the private respondents' stand is that this
case has become moot and academic because the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city> court in its order of <st1:date year="1979" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1979</st1:date> has recognized their
right to collect the rentals from the tenants of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Venancia</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">That order of the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city>
court strengthens the view that, in the orderly administration of justice,
private respondents' remedy is in the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city>
case and not in the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:place></st1:city>
case since the disputed premises are outside the territorial jurisdiction of
the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:place></st1:city>
court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the partial summary judgment and the writ of
possession issued by the lower court against the petitioners are set
aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court is directed to
dismiss, on the grounds of improper venue and <span class="SpellE"><u>litis</u></span>
