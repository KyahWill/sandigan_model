<span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> a "Deed of Partition Inter <span class="SpellE">Vivos</span>" was executed between spouses <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> and Isabel <span class="SpellE">Ferrando</span> and their four children and a 7-hectare portion
was allocated to <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>
which includes the two hectares now being claimed by petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In their complaint filed on June 7, 1957, the <span class="SpellE">Gimenos</span>
claim that <u>sometime in 1926</u> their predecessors-in-interest, brothers <span class="SpellE">Exequiel</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimeno</span> and <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimeno</span>, now deceased, on
one hand and <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>
on the other, verbally agreed to jointly clear and cultivate the 17 hectares
with the understanding that when the coconuts planted by the <span class="SpellE">Gimenos</span> would have borne fruit, the land cleared by the
latter would be segregated by a competent surveyor and <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> would execute papers of relinquishment in
favor of the <span class="SpellE">Gimenos</span>; that as a consideration of this
agreement the <span class="SpellE">Gimenos</span> gave P150.00 to <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> to help the
latter cultivate the rest of the property; and in 1948, the 17 hectares were
surveyed and subdivided into "lot 2126" of two hectares and "lot
3320" containing an area of 15.590 hectares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2126 is the
portion now sought to be recovered by the <span class="SpellE">Gimenos</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The allegations of the complaint and the evidence adduced by the
petitioners were <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> by respondent <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> who claimed
that his father, <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>,
owned and possessed exclusively as a homestead the 17-hectare land for which
the latter was issued Original Certificate of Title 1354 since February 14,
1935; that <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>
declared for taxation purposes the entire 17 hectares solely in his name; that
a deed of partition was executed between <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> and his four children, and the area allocated to <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> measured
seven hectares of which two hectares are now being claimed by the <span class="SpellE">Gimenos</span> without justification.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court presided by Judge <span class="SpellE">Macapanton</span>
<span class="SpellE">Abbas</span> as well as the Court of Appeals dismissed the
complaint of the <span class="SpellE">Gimenos</span> because of "the dubious
character of plaintiffs' evidence" as well as "<span class="SpellE">laches</span>
in the enforcement of their alleged right", they having filed this
particular complaint only after "22 years, 3 months, and 6 days from
February 14, 1935 when OCT 1354 was issued in the name of <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>" and "31 years from the date of
the alleged verbal agreement of June 21, 1926" between the <span class="SpellE">Gimeno</span> brothers and <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The Court of Appeals further stated that petitioners (plaintiffs-appellants)
"failed to adduce clear, competent and con<span style="">vincing evidence that would justify this Court to hold that a fiduciary
relation existed between <span class="SpellE">Exequiel</span> and <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimeno</span> on the one hand
and <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> on
the other, with respect to the two-hectare portion which is now known as lot
2126 of <span class="SpellE">Baganga</span> Cadastre, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no gainsaying the fact that the
plaintiffs' evidence falls far short of the required quantum and quality that
can overthrow the homestead patent issued under OCT 1354 which, as mentioned
heretofore, has been in existence, <span class="SpellE">unassailed</span> for
more than 22 years prior to the institution of the present action."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners now seek a reversal of the decision of the Court of
Appeals raising a number of legal questions which respondent appellate court
allegedly disposed of erroneously.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find however that the issues are basically factual and that
they essentially involve an appreciation of the evidence adduced by the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, is there clear
and convincing evidence - as the Court of Appeals puts it - to sustain the
claim of petitioners that there was a verbal agreement of purchase entered into
in 1926 between their predecessors-in-interest and respondent's father, <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>, over the
two-hectare portion of land? Is there clear and convincing evidence that an
implied trust existed in favor of petitioners which respondent <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> is bound to
respect and comply with? The appellate court held <u>that there is none</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That finding of respondent court is binding
on Us in the absence of any showing that there has been a misapprehension of
facts or that a grave abuse of discretion was committed in the appreciation of
the evidence or that the situation calls for an exception to the general rule.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>the first assigned</u> error petitioners submit that
respondent Court of Appeals erred in not holding that private respondent waived
the defenses of "indefeasibility of title, prescription, <span class="SpellE">laches</span> and lack of cause of action," inasmuch as
respondent <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> failed to assert them in his
answer to the complaint, and under Rule 9, Section 2 of the Revised Rules of
Court, defenses and objections not pleaded either in a motion to dismiss or in
the answer are deemed waived.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the appellate court that there is substantial
compliance with the Rules considering that in the answer of respondent <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> it was specifically pleaded that the two hectares
object of the complaint are part of a bigger tract of land <u>covered by OCT
1354 issued since February 14, 1935</u> in the name of respondent's father <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>, and even prior
to that date respondent's predecessors-in-interest were in possession of said
property exclusively as owners thereof, and that respondent <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>
merely continued the possession of his father <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> after the partition of the property was
executed among the children of <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> in September of 1952.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted that in the overall appreciation of the
evidence of petitioners on their claim that there was a verbal purchase of the
two hectares since 1926, both the trial court and the Court of Appeals did not
find the claim credible, and one of the factors which led the two courts to
that conclusion was the inaction of petitioners and their
predecessors-in-interest to assert their supposed right over the pro­perty in
litigation notwithstanding the allegation that there was an agreement that a
document conveying the two hectares to the <span class="SpellE">Gimeno</span>
brothers would be executed by <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> after the coconut trees the <span class="SpellE">Gimenos</span>
planted shall have borne fruit and the two hectares shall have been segregated,
which events according to petitioners occurred since 1943 and 1948
respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is indeed surprising
why no positive step was taken by the <span class="SpellE">Gimeno</span> brothers
to enforce the supposed verbal agreement against <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> during the latter's lifetime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only after <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> died and was no longer in a position to
deny or dispute the supposed agreement that this complaint was filed on <st1:date month="6" day="7" year="1957">June 7, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In evaluating the evidence, both the court <u>a
quo</u> and the appellate court found that the <span class="SpellE">Gimenos</span>'
failure to take positive action since 1926 and before <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> died sometime in 1954 greatly weakened the
claim of petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To that We agree.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>PHHC and University of the Philippines vs. <span class="SpellE">Mencias</span>, et al.</u> this Court held among others that an
action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of a property that was <u>titled
since 1914</u> and brought only <u>in 1957</u> is to be barred <span style="">on grounds of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In <span class="SpellE"><u>Delima</u></span><u>

into a stale demand.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Again in <span class="SpellE"><u>Pabalate</u></span><u>
et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Echarri</span>, Jr.</u> the land in litigation

patent dated <u>February 20, 1926</u> which was sold by the heirs of the
original patentee to a third person who since 1927 was in continuous exclusive
possession in concept of owner thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The dismissal of the action for recovery of said property filed only in <u>1959
by the heirs of the vendors,</u> was upheld by this Court on the ground <u>inter
<span class="SpellE">alia</span></u> that by the long period of 37 years and the
plaintiffs' inaction or inexcusable neglect their claim was converted into </span>a
<span style="">"stale demand".</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In <u>the second assigned
error</u> it </span>is <span style="">asserted that
respondent Court of Appeals erred in not holding that a certificate of title

the pronouncements of this Court in <u>Nieto vs. <span class="SpellE">Quines</span></u>
to the effect that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> a
certificate of title based on a patent, even after the expiration of one year
from the issuance thereof, is still subject to certain conditions and
restrictions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of<span style=""> fact, in appropriate cases and after prior
administrative investigations by the Director of Lands, proper actions may be
instituted by said official which may lead to the cancellation of the patent
and the title, and the consequent reversion of the land to the Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, a certificate of title
issued pursuant to Act 2259, after the lapse of 1 year, becomes
incontrovertible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inescapable
conclusion, therefore, is that, while with the due registration and issuance of
a certificate of title over a land acquired pursuant to the Public Land Law,
said property becomes registered in contemplation of Act 496, in view of its
nature and manner of acquisition, </span><span style="">such
certificate of title, when in conflict with one obtained on the same date </span><span style="">through judicial </span><span style="">proceedings, must give way to the
latter." (L-14643, Sept. 29, 1962, 6 SCRA 74, 80)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <u>Nieto</u> case has no application to the present
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>Nieto</u> two certificates
of title were issued - one based on a homestead patent while the other was
obtained through a cadastral proceeding, and the issue was which of the two
registrations already effected and secured should prevail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this Case of the <span class="SpellE">Gimenos</span>
all that is involved is the latter's claim that the homestead patentee, <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>, agreed way
back in 1926 to convey to the <span class="SpellE">Gimenos</span> two hectares of
that homestead, which assertion was discarded by the trial court and the Court
of Appeals for lack of sufficient credible evidence to substantiate the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the dismissal of petitioners'
complaint for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>In their third assigned error</u>, petitioners contend that
the survey plan prepared and approved <span style="">in
</span>1948 by the Bureau of Lands which segregated the two hectares in
question from the rest of the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span></st1:place></st1:city>
property is "the most eloquent evidence" of their ownership.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Again We state that this is a matter of appreciation of evidence which is best
left to the trial court and the appellate court which are finders of
facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that said piece of
evidence was not given weight in the evaluation of the evidence of the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We note that the sketch plan,
Exhibit A, prepared by a private land surveyor does not bear the approval of
the Director of Lands as claimed in page 12 of the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that appears is a certification of the
Acting District Land Officer that the sketch is a true and correct copy of a
plan existing in the Land Office in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the existence of a sketch plan
of a real property even if approved by the Bureau of Lands is no proof in
itself of ownership of the land covered by the plan.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>In their fourth assigned error</u> petitioners claim that re­spondent
Court of Appeals erred in finding that the petitioners’ witness <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Manguiob</span> testified that
the subdivision plan Ex­hibit A had no technical descriptions because in truth
there was no such testimony in the record.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
We note however that petitioners' contention is premised on a wrong
interpretation of a portion of page four of the appellate court's
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The clause "without
technical description" is a specific finding of respondent court based on
the sketch, Exhibit A, for the truth of the matter is that said sketch plan is
without technical descriptions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the
appellate court meant and in effect stated on page four of its decision was
that according to <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Manguiob</span>
the subdivision survey was e<span style="">ffected in
June, 1948, at the instance of <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>, the registered owner of the title.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">10-a</span></span></a><span style=""> This
testimony of the witness was not however believed or given credit both by the
court <u>a quo</u> and the Court of Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><u>In the fifth assigned error</u> it is asserted that respondent
court erred in holding that fraud or bad faith is a necessary allegation in an
action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioners cite Sanchez vs. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Tamsi</span>, L-16736, <st1:date month="6" day="30" year="1961">June
 30,1961</st1:date>, wherein it was held that <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
can be justified on the ground of error.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners have a point in this regard, for in <u>Sanchez</u> it was
stated that where a property is erroneously included in a homestead patent, the
patentee by force of law becomes a trustee under an implied trust for the
benefit of the real owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, that
is not the issue in this case now before Us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">Gimenos</span> do not assert that there was error
or that there was fraud on the part of <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> in applying for a homestead patent for the 17
hectares and in securing the original certificate of title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No; what is alleged is that there <u>was a
verbal understanding or "purchase</u>" in that the two hectares
cleared and cultivated by petitioners' predecessors-in-interest would be
"deeded" in their favor, and to enforce that supposed oral agreement
entered into in 1926 this complaint was filed.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Fundamentally, therefore, the action is one for enforcement of a
verbal understanding supposedly entered into between the respective
predecessors-in-interest of the petitioners and the respondent herein, and if
the same is to prosper there must be a finding that the <span class="SpellE">Cartagenas</span>
held the two hectares in trust for the <span class="SpellE">Gimenos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in this context that respondent court
declared that there was need for petitioners to show that they were the owners
of the property claimed and were being deprived thereof by private respondent.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent court concluded that the record is "barren of evidence" to
establish a fiduciary relationship between the homestead patentee, <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Gimenos</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>The sixth assigned error</u> argues that respondent court
erred in not holding that petitioners sufficiently established their claim of
ownership and continuous possession on the basis of the allegation in their
complaint that they planted 377 coconuts which was admitted by respondent <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span></st1:place></st1:city> in the latter's answer
to the complaint.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On this point, We examined the answer of respondent <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span></st1:place></st1:city> to the amended complaint
and contrary to the assertion of petitioners, <span style="">there is no such admission on the part of defendant, now respondent, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cartagena</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Paragraph 9 of the amended complaint reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"9. That the
property in the case at bar consists of 377 productive coconut trees which
produce 30 <span class="SpellE">piculs</span> of copra every after three months
or 120 <span class="SpellE">piculs</span> every year;" (p. 14, Record on
Appeal)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph 9 of respondent's answer in turn states:</p>

<blockquote>"9. That the
Defendant ADMITS that the land in question is planted to 377 fruit-bearing coconut
trees but DENIES that the produce is 30 <span class="SpellE">piculs</span> per

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It is obvious that what <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span></st1:place></st1:city> admitted was that there
were 377 fruit-bearing coconut trees on the two hectares, but that was
all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Note that the allegation in
paragraph 4 of the amended complaint that plaintiffs' predecessors-in-interest
introduced the present improvements consisting mainly of coconuts, was <u>specifically
denied</u> in paragraph 4 of the defendant's answer, and it was alleged that it
was <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>, the
patentee, with the help of his children one of whom is the defendant, who
cleared, cultivated and improved the land in question which is only a part of

<p class="BODY">The stenographic transcript of the cross-examination of
respondent <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span></st1:place></st1:city>
shows that petitioners' counsel presented to the former a certain letter
written by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Hernandez to Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimeno</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No error <span style="">was </span>committed by the trial court in
sustaining the timely objection of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="SpellE">'s</span> counsel and ruling that the best witness competent to
testify on that letter was the addressee, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gimeno</span> and not <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> as the letter would constitute hearsay evidence
in so far as the latter was concerned.</p>
