				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The present three petitions for <u>certiorari</u> with
preliminary injunction (L-26751, L-26085 and L-26106) were separately inter­posed
within the short span of five months by Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>,
one of the fifteen heirs to the <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> <span class="SpellE">Olave</span> estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because these petitions are intertwined in
several material aspects and arose from a common environmental setting - the
intra-fraternal strife among the <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> heirs which
has unduly delayed for more than a decade the settlement of the <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> estate - this Court has decided to embody in a single
decision the independently discussed resolutions of the issues raised in the
said petitions.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><u>L-26751<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Although the petition in L-26751 was filed the latest (Octo­ber
27, 1966), we shall dispose of it first because our pronounce­ments and
observations in this case have direct and concrete rele­vance to the other two.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent events trace their origin to August 20, 1965 when
Carlos S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>, one of the <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>
heirs and a full-blood brother of both the petitioner and the herein respondent
<span class="SpellE">Matias</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>, filed in
special proceeding 25876 (settlement of the <span class="SpellE">Matu­te</span>
estate) a petition praying for the removal of <span class="SpellE">Matias</span>
as co-administrator and his (Carlos') appointment in such capacity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Carlos alleged that "for a period of
more than two years from the date of his appointment (on May 29, 1963), said <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> has neglected to
render a true, just and complete account of his administration," and that
he "is not only incompetent but also neg­ligent in his management of the
estate under his charge consisting of five haciendas on account of a criminal
charge for murder filed against him which is occupying most of his time."</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> claims that he
forthwith interposed an opposition to the aforesaid petition, and the record
discloses that he later filed an amended opposition dated <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1965</st1:date> wherein he contended</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the allegation
... that the herein co-administrator for the two years of his adminis­tration,
1963 and 1964, did not render any account­ing is completely without basis and
false, because the records show that under date of May 20, 1964, he submitted
to this Honorable Court with copies furnished to all the parties concerned,
including Carlos S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>, his accounting for 1963,
that on Feb. 8, 1965, he filed his accounting for 1964, which accounts for 1963
and 1964 have been approved by majority of the heirs composing 63% interests in
the estate as shown by the attached manifestation. …</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That his competence to
act as adminis­trator has been established to the satisfaction of this
Honorable Court as evidenced by his appoint­ment by a <u>fixed</u>, <u>final</u>
and <span class="SpellE"><u>executory</u></span> order dated May 29, 1963; and
Carlos S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> is now <span class="SpellE">estop­ped</span>
from denying his [<span class="SpellE">Matias</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Matute's</span>]
competence and qualification by reason of his failure to object to the
appointment of herein Judicial Administrator at the time application was made <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>... The records of the
pertinent case in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
will easi­ly discover that the 'criminal charge' supported by perjured testimony
is nothing but a trumped-up affair initiated by persons intent on intimidating
the herein Judicial Administrator into betraying his sworn duty to protect and
safeguard the inte­rest of the Estate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The records of the said case will also reveal that <u>it has not
occupied any time at all of the herein Judicial Administrator</u>, for aside
from a single hearing last December 1964 on his application for bail ... no
hearing has been held on the said case up to the present."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Subsequently, <span class="SpellE">Matias</span>
filed a memorandum dated <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="9">September 12,
 1965</st1:date> in support of his foregoing opposition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 21, 1965 the heirs <span class="SpellE">Agustina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Matute</span> <span class="SpellE">Cande­lario</span>, Elena <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> <span class="SpellE">Candelario</span> and <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> <span class="SpellE">Candelario</span>
and their mother and legatee <span class="SpellE">Anunciacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Candelario</span>, moved for the immediate appointment of <span class="SpellE">Agustina</span> <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> <span class="SpellE">Candelario</span>, Car­los S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> and
Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>, herein petitioner, as joint
co-administrators or anyone of them in place of <span class="SpellE">Matias</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>, whose removal they also sought together
with the ouster of the general administrator Carlos V. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>,
on the following addi­tional grounds:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite the vast
resources and income of the estate, the present administrators have failed to
pay even the annual real property tax for the years 1964 and 1965;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The financial statements
of both admi­nistrators were not properly signed and authen­ticated by a
certified public accountant, and do not contain the exact entries as filed by
former administrators containing the daily and monthly entries of receipts and
disbursements;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both administrators have
deliberately failed to file their inventories and statements of accounts on
time, and did so only when ordered by the probate court;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both administrators have
made unau­thorized disbursements as shown by their finan­cial statements; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The probate court has
discretion to remove the administrator.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It appears that during the reception of evidence conducted on
December 29, 1965 by the probate court (Branch IV of the Court of First
Instance of Manila with Honorable <span class="SpellE">Emigdio</span> <span class="SpellE">Nietes</span> as the then presiding judge), Carlos S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Candelario</span> ­<span class="SpellE">Matute</span> heirs submitted their respective lists of exhibits
in sup­port of their motion to oust <span class="SpellE">Matias</span>. On <st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1966</st1:date> <span class="SpellE">Matias</span>
filed a written objection to the admission of the <span class="SpellE">movants</span>'
exhibits on the ground that the same were hearsay, self-serving, irrele­vant
and/ or mere <span class="SpellE">photostatic</span> copies of supposed originals
which were never properly identified nor shown in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four days later, or on January 12, 1966, the
counsel for <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> filed with leave of court a
"Motion to Dismiss and/or Demurrer to Evi­dence" which avers that
"there is no sufficient evidence on record to justify and support the
motions for the removal of the herein co-administrator <span class="SpellE">Matias</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>." In the same motion, said counsel
reserved the right to introduce evidence in behalf of his client should the
foregoing motion be denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1966</st1:date>
the probate court issued an order, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"FOR ALL THE FOREGOING, the Court hereby removes
co-administrator, <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>,
as such co-administrator of the estate and orders him to submit a final
accounting of his administration together with his past administration accounts
which have not been approved, and, in his stead appoints Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>, a brother by the same mother of <span class="SpellE">Matias</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>, as co-administrator, who is hereby
required to put up a bond of P15,000.00, and thereafter immediate­ly qualify in
his commission and assume the responsibility of co-administrator…."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Forthwith, <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> interposed with the
Court of Appeals a petition for <u>certiorari</u> with preliminary mandatory
injunction (CA-G.R. 37039-R) dated February 1, 1966, praying that the aforesaid
order of January 31, 1966 be set aside as a nullity for having de­creed his
removal without due process and the appointment of Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>
without the requisite hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 4, 1966 the Court of Appeals gave due course to the
aforesaid petition and resolved to grant a writ of preliminary injunction
against Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> and the Honorable Judge <span class="SpellE">Emigdio</span> <span class="SpellE">Nietes</span>, respondents in
CA-G.R. 37039-R, conditioned on the filing of a P1,000 bond by the therein
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Matias</span>, the res­pondent herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="3">March
 22, 1966</st1:date> Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> moved for the
dismissal of the abovementioned petition on the ground that the Court of
Appeals does not have jurisdiction to take cognizance of the same since the
value of the estate involved is more than P200,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further contended that the value of the <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> <span class="SpellE">Ma­tute</span> <span class="SpellE">Olave</span> estate for purposes of jurisdiction had already been
resolved in CA-G.R. 35124-R where the Court of Appeals refused to take
jurisdiction over a petition for <u>certiorari</u> contesting the appointment
of <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> as
co-administrator, on the ground that the value of the <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>
estate was placed at P2,132,282.72 as evidenced by a "Compromise
Agreement" dated April 12, 1956 which was duly signed by all of the heirs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Despite repeated urgent motions filed by Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> praying that the Court of Appeals resolve with
dispatch the issue of jurisdiction, the said appellate tribunal instead
required then respondent Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> to answer,
which he did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on <st1:date year="1966" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1966</st1:date> herein petitioner
Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> interposed the instant petition for <u>certiorari</u>
with preliminary injunction against the Court of Appeals and <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>, challenging the
jurisdic­tion of the respondent Court of Appeals upon two basic contentions:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court of Appeals has<i> </i>no
jurisdiction to entertain, give due course, and much more to issue a writ of
preliminary injunction, against the petitioner, Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>,
and respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Emigdio</span> <span class="SpellE">Nietes</span>
in CA-G.R. No. 37039-R x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
because the estate of <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>
<span class="SpellE">Olave</span> is worth more than P200,000.00; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The same Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
No. 35124-­R, on <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1965</st1:date>,
special fourth division, has ruled that the Court of Appeals has no juris­diction
on the estate of <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>
<span class="SpellE">Olave</span> in the matter of the appointment and removal of
its<i> </i>administrators.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The respondent <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> does not controvert the peti­tioner's claim that the
value of the estate of their deceased father exceeds P200,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He maintains, however, that the respondent
Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over CA-G.R. 37039-R "because the subject
matter involved is merely x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
the right to collect the (monthly) rentals due the Estate in the sum of
P5,000.00" pursuant to a contract of lease which he executed in favor of
one Maria­no Nasser covering five <u>haciendas</u> of the estate under his
separate administration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing assertion does not merit credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A search­ing review of the record - from the
initial petition filed by Carlos <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> to oust the
respondent as co-administrator up to the latter's petition for <u>certiorari</u>
filed with the Court of Appeals impugning the validity of the abovementioned
order of January 31, 1966 which removed him as co-administrator and appointed
the petitioner in his place - reveals no single pleading, statement,
contention, re­ference or even inference which would justify the respondent's
pre­tension that the instant controversy is a mere contest over the right to
collect a P5,000 rental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In bold
contrast, the record vivid­ly chronicles the controversy as a bitter fight for
co-administra­tion: the removal of the respondent as co-administrator and the
ap­pointment of anyone of the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> and the herein
petitioner as new co-administrator.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the principal conflict gravitates over the right to <u>co-administer</u>
the vast <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> <span class="SpellE">Olave</span>-estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is the same issue underlying the respondent's abovementioned peti­tion in
CA-G.R.37039-R.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent's prayer
in said petition unmistakably indicates that the dispute pertains to the right
to co-administer in general, not the mere authority to collect a P5,000 monthly
rental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said prayer reads:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That an ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> writ of preliminary mandatory injunction be issued
enjoining and/or prohibiting the respondent Judge from approving the
administrator's bond that will be filed by res­pondent Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> and in issuing the letters of administration of the
latter, and from issuing Orders incidental and/ or connected with the exercise
and performance of acts of administration of said respondent Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>; likewise enjoin­ing and prohibiting respondent Jose
S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> himself, and/or through his counsels,
agents and re­presentatives from taking physical possession of the different
haciendas under the exclusive admi­nistration and management of herein
petitioner and from performing and exercising acts of a du­ly and legally
appointed administrator, upon filing a bond in such amount that this Honorable
Tribu­nal may fix;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the Order of
the respondent Judge dated January 31, 1966, removing herein petitioner as
co-administrator of the Estate of <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> <span class="SpellE">Olave</span> and appointing respondent Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>
as co?administrator without presentation of evidence, be declared null
and void and of no force and effect. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In fine, the pith of the controversy is the right to <u>co-administer</u>
the entire estate.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this regard, the
ruling in <u>Fernandez, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></u></span></a>
is determinative of the jurisdic­tional issue posed here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said case, this Court ruled that in a
contest for the administration of an estate, the amount in controversy is
deemed to be the value of the whole estate, which to­tal value should be the
proper basis of the jurisdictional amount.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the Court proceeded to conclude that the Court of Appeals
does not have jurisdiction to issue writs of <u>certiorari</u> and preliminary
injunction prayed for in a petition concerning a conflict over administration
arising as an incident in the main probate or settlement proceeding <u>if in
the first place the principal case or proceeding falls outside its appellate
jurisdiction considering the total value of the subject estate</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court in the aforesaid <span class="SpellE"><u>Maravilla</u></span> case elaborated thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court of Appeals, in the decision ap­pealed from, assumed
jurisdiction over the pre­sent case on the theory that ‘the amount in
controversy relative to the appointment of <span class="SpellE">Eliezar</span>
Lopez as special co-administrator to protect the interests of the respondents
(herein petitioners) is only P90,000.00 more or less, i.e., one fourth of the
conjugal property' (of respondent and the deceased <span class="SpellE">Digna</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span>) which, as per inventory submitted by the
respondent as special administrator, is valued at P362,424.90.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This theory is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Note that the proceedings had on the
appointment of <span class="SpellE">Eliezar</span> Lopez as special
co-administrator are merely incidental to the probate or testate proceedings of
the deceased <span class="SpellE">Digna</span> <span class="SpellE">Marvilla</span></u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>That the Court of Appeals has no
appellate jurisdiction over the said testate proceedings cannot be doubted,</u>
<u>considering the properties therein involved are valued at P362,434.00</u>, <u>as
per inventory of the special administrator</u>."</blockquote>

<blockquote>“* * * <u>Not having appellate jurisdiction over the proceedings in
probate (CA-G.R. No. 27478-R</u>), <u>considering that the amount involved
therein is more than P200,00.00,</u> <u>the Court of Appeals cannot also have
original jurisdiction to grant the writs of certiorari and prohibition prayed
for by respondent in the instant case</u>, <u>which are merely incidental
thereto</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Note also that <u>the present proceedings un­der review were
for the annulment of the appointment of <span class="SpellE">Eliezar</span> Lopez
as special co-administrator and to restrain the probate court from removing
respondent as special administration.</u><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>It is there­fore,</u> <u>a contest for the administration of the
estate and,</u> <u>consequently,</u> <u>the amount or value of the assets of
the whole estate is the value in controversy</u> (4 C.J.S. 204).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appearing that the value of the estate in
dispute is much more than P200,000.00, the Court of Appeals clearly had no
original juris­diction to issue the writs in question." (underscoring
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Like in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Maravilla</u></span> case, the instant intra­ fraternal
controversy involves a contest over administration, an incident in the
settlement of the vast <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that the value of the said estate
is more than P200,000, and con­sidering further that as enunciated in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Maravilla</u></span> case the to­tal value of the subject
estate determines the jurisdictional amount anent disputes over administration
arising as incidents in a pro­bate or settlement proceeding, like the case at
bar, then it is in­dubitable that the respondent Court of Appeals does not have
jurisdiction over CA-G.R. 37039-R nor the judicial authority to grant the writs
of <u>certiorari</u> and prohibition prayed for therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Herein respondent insists, however, that even granting that the
actual controversy pertains to administration, such con­tested administration
does not encompass the whole estate but is limited to the collection of a
P5,000 monthly rental, which sum should be the basis of the jurisdictional
amount, not the value of the whole estate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In support of his thesis, the respondent alleges that during his
incumbency as co-administrator, five <u>haciendas</u> in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
belonging to the estate of his deceased father were con­signed to his separate
administration; that in his capacity as co-administrator he leased on February
10, 1965 said <u>haciendas</u> to one Mariano Nasser for P5,000 a month; that
by virtue of the said lease contract, the possession, management and
administration of the said properties were transferred to the lessee until the
ex­piration<b> </b>of the contract; that consequently, only the collection of
the monthly rental of P5,000 remains as the subject of adminis­tration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing contention of the respondent is patently untenable.</p>

<p class="NUM" style=""><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The averment of the respondent that the controversy centers on the collection
of the alleged P5,000 monthly rental and that the contest over administration
is limited thereto, does not find any support in the record.</span></p>

<p class="NUM" style=""><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The rule remains that the jurisdictional amount is de­termined by the
total value of the estate, not by the value of the particular property or
portion of the estate subject to administra­tion, since the question of
administration is merely incidental to the principal proceeding for the
settlement and distribution of the whole estate.</span></p>

<p class="NUM" style=""><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">3.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The respondent's impression that a co-administrator's trust and
responsibility are circumscribed and delimited by the size and value of the
particular property or portion of the estate subject to his separate
administration, is erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although a
co-administrator is designated to administer a portion of the es­tate, he is no
less an administrator of the whole because his judi­cious management of a mere
parcel enhances the value of the entire estate, while his inefficient or
corrupt administration there­of necessarily diminishes the value of the whole
estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over, when two or more
administrators are appointed to admi­nister separate parts of a large estate
they are not to discharge their functions in distant isolation but in close
cooperation so as to safeguard and promote the general interests of the entire
estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The teaching in <span class="SpellE"><u>Sison</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span></u></span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
is of positive relevance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the said
case, the probate court charged against the entire estate the compensation of
an administrator who was assigned as judicial administrator representing the
interests of one of the two heiresses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The other heiress whose interest was represented by the executor opposed
the award on the ground that the said administrator had not rendered service to
the estate but only to his wife, the heiress whom he represented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal, this Court upheld the award and
dismissed the opposition:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"This argument erroneously assumes that because Carlos Moran <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> was 'judicial administrator representing the
interests of <span class="SpellE">Priscila</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>'
he was such administrator <u>'solely</u> for the purpose of protecting <span class="SpellE">Priscila's</span> interests,' and not to protect those of the
estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>No words are needed to
explain that in general</u>, <u>the interest of the heir coincides with those
of the estate - the bigger the estate the better for the heir.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>There­fore to protect the interest of

representation to designated heirs, is not deemed administrator of the estate</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>This
assumption has no legal foundation</u>, because it is admitted practice, where
the estate is large, to appoint two or more administrators of such estate to
have different interests represented and satisfied, and furthermore, to have <u>such

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Verily,
therefore, the scope of a </span>co-administrator's trust encompasses the
entire estate and is co-extensive in effect with those of the other
administrators; consequently, the value of the entire estate should be the
proper basis of the jurisdictional amount irrespective of the value of the
particular property or assets of the estate which are the objects of a separate
administration pending the settlement proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In view of all the
foregoing, we are of the consensus that the respondent Court of Appeals has no
jurisdiction to take cognizance </span>of CA -G.R. 37039-R, and consequently
was without power to issue or grant the writs of <u>certiorari</u> and <u>prohibition</u>
prayed for in said case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding that the herein petitioner delimited the is­sue,
as set forth in his petition for <u>certiorari</u>, to one of jurisdic­tion of
the respondent Court of Appeals over CA-G.R. 37039-R, in subsequent pleadings
and manifestations, however, the parties herein mutually expanded the issue to
include the question of the legality of the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
order of January 31, 1966 in CA-G.R. 37039-R.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of fact, the respondent, in a "Petition to
Resolve" dated <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="7">July 18, 1967</st1:date>,
prayed "that a <u>decision on the me­rits</u> in this case be now
rendered." To this manifestation, the pe­titioner replied "that he
has <u>no objection</u>, as in fact, he also prays that this case be decided at
the earliest by the Highest Tribunal."</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the respondent Court of Appeals does not have juris­diction
over CA-G.R. 37039-R, we are of the considered opinion that this Court can forestall
further delay in the already protrac­ted proceedings regarding the settlement
of the <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> estate if it now proceeds to resolve
the issue of legality of the abovemen­tioned disputed order, rather than wait
for the parties to come anew on a separate petition in quest for a verdict on
the said is­sue.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, both the
petitioner and the respondent private party have manifested and elaborated
their respective views on this issue and prayed and pressed for a decision
thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">We shall now discuss separately the twin aspects of the foregoing
<span class="SpellE">controverted</span> order, namely, (1) the removal of the
res­pondent as co-administrator of the <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> estate,
and (2) the ap­pointment of the petitioner as the new co-administrator.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent contends that the disputed order removing him as
co-administrator is a patent nullity for the following rea­sons:</p>

<p class="NUM">(1) He was removed in wanton disregard of due process of law
because the probate judge arbitrarily de­prived him of his day in court;</p>

<p class="NUM">(2) The evidence adduced by the <span class="SpellE">movants</span>
is manifestly insufficient, if not devoid of probative value, to warrant his
removal; and</p>

<p class="NUM">(3) He was removed not on the grounds specifically invoked by the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> but for causes discovered <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span><u> </u>by the probate judge in the
records of special proceeding 25876 and without affording him the opportunity
to rebut the findings of the said judge.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Upon the other hand, the petitioner
advances the following rea­sons in support of the order of removal:</p>

<p class="NUM">(1) The probate judge accorded the respondent all the opportunity
to adduce his evidence but the latter resorted to dilatory tactics such as
filing a "motion to dismiss or demurrer to evidence;"</p>

<p class="NUM">(2) The evidences presented to sustain the removal of the
respondent are incontrovertible since aside from being documentary, they are
parts of the record of special proceeding 25876; and</p>

<p class="NUM">(3) The evidence on record conclusively supports the findings of
the probate judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The settled rule is that the removal of an administrator under
section 2 of Rule 82 lies within the discretion of the court appointing
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As aptly expressed in one case,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
"The suffi­ciency of any ground for removal should thus be determined by
the said court, whose sensibilities are, in the first place, af­fected by any
act or omission on the part of the administrator not conformable to or in
disregard of the rules or the orders of the court." Consequently,
appellate tribunals are disinclined to interfere with the action taken by a
probate court in the matter of the removal of an executor or administrator <u>unless
positive error or gross abuse of discretion is shown</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, we are constrained, however, to nulli­fy the
disputed order of removal because it is indubitable that the probate judge
ousted the respondent from his trust without afford­ing him the full benefit of
a day in court, thus denying him his cardinal right to due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that shortly after the reception of evidence for the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> Carlos <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Candelario-Matute</span> heirs, the respondent filed on January 8,
1966 a verified objection to the admission in evidence of the <span class="SpellE">movants</span>' exhibits on the ground that the same were hearsay,
self-serving, irrelevant and/or mere <span class="SpellE">photostatic</span>
copies of supposed originals which were never proper­ly identified nor produced
in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four days later, or on <st1:date year="1966" day="12" month="1">Janua­ry 12, 1966</st1:date>, the respondent
filed <u>with leave of court</u> a "Motion to Dismiss and/or Demurrer to
Evidence," the pertinent and mate­rial portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>“* * * considering the specific objection to each exhibit contained
in said Objections to Admis­sion of <span class="SpellE">Movants</span>' Exhibits
and considering further the ruling of this Honorable Court in open court that
pleadings filed in this case are evidence only of the fact of their filing and
not of the truth of the statements contained therein and considering still
further the fact that no competent single witness was presented by <span class="SpellE">movants</span> in support of their res­pective contentions, we
submit that <u>there is no suf­ficient evidence on record to justify and
support<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the motions for removal of the
herein co-adminis­trator <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span></u> and in the light of the autho­rities <span class="SpellE">hereinbelow</span> cited, the motions to remove <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> must be
dismissed for insuffi­ciency of evidence:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“*<span style=""> </span>* * However, <span style="">in </span>the remote possibility that this
instant motion be denied by this Honorable Court, <u>the herein
co-administrator expressly reserves his right to present his own evidence</u> *
* * <u>at least five (5) days from the receipt of <span style="">said denial</span></u><span style=""> * * *.” </span>(underscoring
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Instead
of resolving </span>the <span style="">foregoing </span>motion,
the probate judge issued the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> order
removing the respondent as co-adminis­trator without giving him the opportunity
to adduce his own evidence despite his explicit reservation that he be afforded
the chance <span style="">to in­troduce evidence in <span style="">his </span></span>behalf in the event of
denial of his <span style="">motion to </span>dismiss
and/or demurrer to evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are of
the view that the <span style="">above actuation of </span>the
probate judge constituted grave abuse of dis­cretion which dooms his
improvident order as a <span style="">nullity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, </span>even without the respondent's
reservation, it was the bounden duty of the probate judge to schedule the
presentation and reception of the respondent's evidence before disposing of the
case on the me­rits because only the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> at that
time had presented their evi­dence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
duty is projected into bolder relief if we consider, which we must, that the
aforesaid motion is in form as well as in substance a <u>demurrer to evidence</u>
allowed by Rule 35, by virtue of which the defendant does not lose his right to
offer evidence in the event that his motion is denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Rule state</p>

<blockquote>"After the plaintiff has completed the pre­sentation of his
evidence, the defendant <u>without waiving his right to offer evidence in the
event the motion is not granted</u>, may move for a dismissal on the ground
that upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to
relief." (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The application of the <span class="SpellE">abovecited</span> Rule in special proceedings, like the case at
bar, is authorized by section 2 of Rule 72 which direct that in the
"absence of special provisions, the rules provided for in ordinary civil
actions shall be, as far as practicable, appli­cable in special
proceedings."</p>

<p class="BODY">But what is patently censurable is the actuation of the pro­bate
judge in removing the respondent, not on the strength of the evidence adduced
by the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> (not a single exhibit or document
introduced by the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> was specifically cited in
the disputed order as a justification of the respondent's ouster), but on the
ba­sis of his (judge's) findings, which he <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> gleaned from the records of special
proceeding 25876, without affording the res­pondent an opportunity to
controvert said findings or in the very least to explain why he should not be
removed on the basis thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">The probate judge did find, as essayed in his disputed or­der,
that the respondent "has shown indifference to his duties as such
co-administrator of the estate" as evidenced by:</p>

<p class="NUM">(1) the disapproval of his 1964 account by the probate court in an
order dated <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1966</st1:date>
due to his "non-appearance and non-submission of evidence to sustain his
account on the date set for the presentation of the same;"</p>

<p class="NUM">(2) the considerable decrease in the income of the properties
under his charge, as reflected in said 1964 account, which circumstance
"does not speak well of his diligence and attention to the administration
of said properties;" and</p>

<p class="NUM">(3) the failure of said 1964 account to disclose the number of
calves born during the accounting period, "thereby indicating a palpable
omis­sion of fact which directly reduced the value of the income or the
increase of the assets of the estate.”</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">But, significantly, the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> did not specifically invoke the aforesaid grounds
in support of their petition to oust the respon­dent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of the said grounds, which in the mind of
the probate judge exposed the supposed indifference and incompetence of the
respondent in the discharge of his trust, are based on alleged de­fects of the
respondent's 1964 account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these
circumstances, it behooved the probate judge to inform the respondent of his
find­ings before ordering the latter's removal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We concede that the probate judge enjoys a wide latitude of discretion
in the matter of the removal of executors and administrators and he can cause
their ouster at his own instance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, before they are de­prived of their office they must be given
the full benefit of a day in court, an opportunity not accorded to the
respondent herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without forgetting such patent denial of due process, which rendered
the order of removal a nullity, let us examine the me­rits of the probate
judge's <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>
findings to determine whe­ther they warrant the ouster of the respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">As proof, of the respondent's "indifference" in the, dis­charge
of his duties, the probate judge cited the court's order of <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1966</st1:date> disapproving the
respondent's 1964 account for his failure to personally appear on the date set
for the sub­mission of evidence in support of the said account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be emphasized, however, that the
respondent, two days before the issuance of the aforesaid order removing him as
co-administra­tor, seasonably moved for the reconsideration of the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> order of January 5, 1966 on the ground that his
failure to person­ally attend the scheduled hearing was due to illness on his
part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, when the probate court
decreed the removal of the respondent, the order disapproving his 1964 account,
which was used as one of the principal justifications for his removal as co-administrator,
was <u>not yet final</u> as it was still subject to possi­ble
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, on
<st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1966</st1:date> the same
probate judge <u>set aside</u> the aforesaid order of <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1966</st1:date>, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering that it will be to the benefit of all the parties
concerned if former co-admi­nistrator <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> will be allowed to subs­tantiate the accounting
which he submitted to this Court but which was disapproved on January 5, 1966
for his failure to personally appear at the hearing held for the purpose of
substantiating said accounting, <u>his motion for reconsideration filed on
January 28, 1966 is hereby granted and the order dated January 5, 1966
disapproving the accounting submitted by <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> is set aside</u>.” (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">With the order of <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1966</st1:date> thus revoked, the probate judge's
conclusion that the respondent was "indifferent" to his duties as
co-administrator as evidenced by the disapproval of his 1964 ac­count loses its
principal basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again using the 1964 account of the respondent as basis of his
finding that the respondent was guilty of disinterest in the dis­charge of his
trust, the probate judge stressed that "a verifica­tion of said accounting
shows that the income of the properties un­der his (respondent's) charge were
very much reduced which does not speak well of his diligence and attention to
the administration of the said properties," and that said account failed
to report the number of "offspring of the cattle during the period of
accounting belonging to the estate, thereby indicating a palpable omission of
fact which directly reduced the value of the income or increase of the assets
of the estate." It is pertinent to emphasize here that the <u>said 1964
account is still pending approval</u>, hence it was pre­mature to use alleged
defects in said account as grounds for the removal of the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it is now ruled that the respondent is
unfit to continue as co-administrator because of the alleged in­firmities in
his account for 1964, the respondent will be greatly prejudiced in the event
that said account is finally approved and the said defects are found to be
nonexistent or so trivial as not to affect the general validity and veracity of
the account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assum­ing, however, that
the probate judge correctly observed that the said account reflects a big
reduction in the income of the <u>haciendas</u> under the separate
administration of the respondent, this fact alone does not justify the
conclusion that the latter did not exer­cise due care and zeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no proof that the decrease in in­come
had been caused by the respondent's willful negligence or dishonesty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to stress, varied factors, some
beyond the control of an administrator, may cause the diminution of an es­tate's
income. </p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the failure to report the number of calves born du­ring the
accounting period, granting that the same is true, there is however no evidence
on record to prove that the said omission was deliberate or designed to
prejudice the estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could have been
either an honest mistake or mere inadvertence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the ab­sence of competent proof to the contrary, good faith must be
pre­sumed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The probate judge should have
required the respondent to explain the said omission instead of branding
outright said omis­sion as "palpable."</p>

<p class="BODY">In his excursion into the records of special proceeding 25876,
the probate judge also found a copy of a so-called "Compliance"
submitted by the respondent which reported "a very staggering amount of
over One Million Pesos supposedly given to the heirs" as advances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The probate judge proceeded to observe that
the "record does not show that the said advances to the heirs were
authorized by the Court in the amounts made to appear in the
‘Compliance.'" He added that a "verification of the record will show
that may be part of this amount supposed­ly paid by the co-administrator to the
heirs were authorized by the Court but a greater volume of the same was
obviously not authorized." On account of this particular finding, the
probate court concluded, without equivocation, that the respondent had been
acting without previous authority from the probate court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately again, the respondent was not
afforded the oppor­tunity to present his side and if possible to controvert the
said finding or correct the impressions of the judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hearing the res­pondent on this point is
imperative because, like the other grounds upon which the probate judge
anchored the order of removal, it was not put in issue by the <span class="SpellE">movants</span>, neither was a copy of said "Compliance"
submitted in evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It bears emphasis
that if there were unauthorized payments of advances to some heirs or simulated
grants as the probate judge appears to theorize, then it is most surprising why
the prejudiced <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> heirs, litigation-­<span class="SpellE">proned</span> as they are, did not impugn the so-called
"Compliance." Furthermore, not one of the <span class="SpellE">movants</span>
interested in the removal of the respondent specifically charged the latter
with unauthorized or fictitious payments of advances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should also be noted that the said
"Compliance" was submitted by the respondent in res­ponse to the
probate court's order for the submission of "a list of the heirs who have
personally received the advances from the <u>administration</u>," not from
the respondent alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It stands to rea­son,
therefore, that the said "Compliance" could very well be a <u>cumulative
list</u> of all the advances given and received by the <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>
heirs from the several administrators of the <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>
estate since 1955.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of
concrete evidence that the said "stag­gering amount" of over a
million pesos in advances was disbursed by the respondent alone during his
beleaguered term which com­menced only in 1963, we have no recourse but to
jettison the ad­verse conclusion of the probate judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the probate judge should have done was to
afford <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> the chance to explain and substantiate
the facts and the figures appearing in the aforesaid "Compliance,"
which unfortunately does not form part of the re­cord before us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent asserts that if only the
probate judge "took pains to examine fully the voluminous records of the <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> estate, and as reflected in the very 'Compliance'
submitted to the Court x <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>any disbursement given to the heirs by <u>all
the administrators</u> of the Estate were by virtue of the several Orders of
the Probate Court issued upon joint motion of all the heirs for their monthly
maintenance and support.”</p>

<p class="BODY">It likewise appears that the respondent was removed part­ly due
to his failure to pay the inheritance and estate taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this regard, it bears emphasis that the
failure to pay the taxes due from the estate is <u>per se</u> not a compelling
reason for the re­moval of an administrator, for "it may be true that the
respon­dent administrator failed to pay all the taxes due from the estate, but
said failure may be due to lack of funds, and not to a <span class="SpellE">wilful</span>
omission.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
"In the case at bar there is no evidence that the non­payment of taxes was
<span class="SpellE">wilful</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
contrary, the respondent al­leged, and this was unchallenged by the <span class="SpellE">movants</span>, that while the previous administrators left the
taxes unpaid, he had paid the real property taxes in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city> covering the years 1954 to
1966.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now come to the second part of the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
order - the appointment of the petitioner as co-administrator vice the
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the removal of <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> was done with inordinate haste and without due
process, aside from the fact that the grounds upon which he was removed have no
evidentiary justification, the same is void, and, consequently, there is no
vacancy to which the petitioner could be appointed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even granting <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that the
removal of <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> is free from infirmity, this Court
is not prepared to sustain the validity of the appointment of the petitioner in
place of the former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To start with, the
record does not disclose that any hearing was con­ducted, much less that
notices were sent to the other heirs and interested parties, anent the petition
for the appointment of Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>, among others,
as co-administrator <u>vice</u> <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> S.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Matute</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this regard, it is pertinent to observe
that any hearing conducted by the probate court was confined solely to the
primary prayers of the separate petitions of Carlos S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>
and the <span class="SpellE">Candelario-Matute</span> heirs seeking the ouster of
<span class="SpellE">Matias</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The corollary prayers contained in the same
petitions for the appoint­ment of Carlos S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>,
Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> and <span class="SpellE">Agustina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Matute</span> <span class="SpellE">Candelario</span> or anyone
of them as Co-administrator were never even considered at any of the
hearings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The requirement of a hearing
and the notification to all the known heirs and other interested par­ties as to
the date thereof is essential to the validity of the proceed­ing for the
appointment of an administrator "in order that no per­son may be deprived
of his right or property without due process of law." (<span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Valmores</span>, 97 Phil. 163) Moreover, a hearing is
necessary in order to fully determine the suitability of the applicant to the
trust, by giving him the opportunity to prove his qualifications and affording <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>, if any, to contest the said application.</p>

<p class="BODY">The provision of Rule 83 that if "there is no remaining exe­cutor
or administrator, administration may be granted to any suitable person,"
cannot be used to justify the institution of Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>
even without a hearing, because such institution has no factual basis
considering that there was a general administrator (Carlos V. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>) who remained in charge of the affairs of the <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> estate after the removal of <span class="SpellE">Matias</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>. The above-cited provision evidently
envisions a situation when after the re­moval of the incumbent administrator no
one is left to administer the estate, thus empowering the probate court, as a
matter of ne­cessity, to name a temporary administrator (or caretaker), pend­ing

<p class="BODY">L-26085 is a petition for <u>certiorari</u> with preliminary
injunction interposed on May 19, 1966 by the same petitioner Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>, praying that the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
order of default dated April 16, 1966, judgment by default dated April 23, 1966
and or­der of execution dated May 3, 1966, all issued by the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, be set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sequence of events, like in L-26751, commenced with the
issuance by the probate court (Court of First Instance of Ma­nila) of the order
of <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1966</st1:date>
removing <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>
as co-administrator and replacing him with Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Arm­ed with the letters of co-administration
awarded to him on Feb­ruary 3, 1966, Jose attempted to take possession of and
exercise administration over the <u>five</u> haciendas La Union, <span class="SpellE">Sigaboy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mon­serrat</span>, <span class="SpellE">Colatinan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pundaguitan</span>, all
belonging to the <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> estate and situated in
Governor <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said five <u>ha­ciendas</u> were previously
assigned to the separate administration of the deposed co-administrator, <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mariano Nasser, herein plaintiff-respondent, who was in actual
possession of the said <u>haciendas</u>, opposed the projected takeover by the
defendant-petitioner Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> on the ground
that the said properties were leased to him as of February 10, 1965 by <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> in the latter's
capacity as co-administrator.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, on <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="2">February 15,
 1966</st1:date>, <st1:place>Nasser</st1:place> instituted civil case 4968 in
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, a complaint for
injunction, alleging that the defendant-petitioner was forci­bly wresting
possession of the said <u>haciendas</u> with the aid of hired goons, and
praying that the said defendant-petitioner be enjoined from taking physical
possession, management and administration of the aforesaid five haciendas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 16, 1966 the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
issued a writ of preliminary injunction <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span><u>,</u>
prohibiting "Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> and/or his counsels,
agents, representatives or employees from taking physical possession,
management and ad­ministration" of the abovementioned properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1966</st1:date>,
seven days after he received on <st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="2">February
 16, 1966</st1:date>, the summons in civil case 4968, the defendant-petitioner
moved to dismiss the aforesaid complaint for injunc­tion and to dissolve the <u>ex</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> writ of injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said motion to dismiss was predicated mainly
on the contention that the court ­<u>a</u> <u>quo</u> did not have jurisdiction
over the subject <u>haciendas</u> consi­dering that the same "are
properties in <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>legis</u></span>
under the jurisdiction of the Probate Court of Manila, in Sp. Proc. No. 25876
since 1955 up to the present time," and consequently the probate court has
exclusive jurisdiction over all cases, like the one at bar, involving
possession and administration of the afore­said <u>haciendas</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same motion to dismiss, the
defendant-petitioner averred that the alleged contract of lease is simulated
and fictitious for which reason not even a copy of the said con­tract was
attached to the complaint, and that granting that such a contract was actually
executed, the same is invalid as it was never approved by the probate
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1966</st1:date> the defendant-petitioner was furnished a
copy of the plaintiff-respon­dent's opposition to the abovementioned motion to
dismiss and to lift the <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> writ
of injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Failing to receive any notice of a court resolution on his
client's Motion to dismiss during the period of about 1-1/2 months after the
filing of the said motion, the defendant-petitioner's coun­sel on April 11,
1966 wrote the clerk of court of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, requesting that
any resolution or order of the trial court be mailed to him by airmail at his
expense, instead of by surface mail, in order to minimize postal delay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime between April 11 and 19, 1966, the
said counsel also dispatched an emissary to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city> to in­quire about the status
of civil case 4968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After personal
verification of the record, the said emissary reported to the defendant?petitioner's
counsel that the abovementioned motion to dismiss had been denied by the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> in an order dated <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="3">March 31,
 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was also discovered
from the record that the plaintiff-respondent's counsel had been sent a copy of
the order of denial on the very day it was rendered (March 31, 1966) but the
record was si­lent as to the mailing of the corresponding copy for the
defendant- petitioner's counsel, which copy until then had not been received by
the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Forthwith, on <st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="4">April 19, 1966</st1:date>, although he had not
yet been furnished his copy of the said order of denial, defendant?petitioner's
counsel interposed the requisite answer with counter­claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then on <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1966</st1:date> he filed a manifestation calling the
attention of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> that as of the said date he had not
re­ceived a copy of the order denying his client's motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only two days later, or on <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1966</st1:date>, that the said counsel
claims, <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> by the respondent Judge and
the plaintiff-respondent, that he received his copy of the aforesaid order.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a "Motion to Strike" dated April 26, 1966, the plaintiff?respondent
urged that the aforementioned answer with counter­claim be stricken from the
record on the grounds that <u>on April 16,1966</u> the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
had declared defendant-petitioner <u>in default</u> for failure to answer the
complaint in civil case 4928 and that subsequently, on <u>April 23, 1966</u>, a
<u>judgment by default</u> had been entered against the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Immediately after receipt on May 5, 1966 of a copy of the said
"Motion to Strike," the defendant-petitioner filed his oppo­sition,
asserting that it was legally impossible to declare him in default as of April
16, 1966 for failure to file his responsive plead­ing, considering that it was
only after the said date, that is, on April 25, 1966, that he received, through
his counsel, a copy of the order denying his motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, May 5, 1966, the
defendant-petitioner's counsel dispatched a rush tele­gram to the clerk of
court of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
inquiring whether the trial court had really rendered the order of default dated
April 16, 1966 and the subsequent judgment by de­fault dated April 23, 1966,
copies of which had not been received by him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the following day, <st1:date year="1966" day="6" month="5">May 6,
 1966</st1:date>, the defendant-petitioner filed an "Urgent Motion to
Investigate the Office of the Clerk of Court for Mailing Discrepancy."</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant-petitioner's counsel claims - and this is not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> by the respondent Judge and the
plaintiff-respondent that it was only on May 17, 1966 that he received a copy
of the judgment by default and at the same time a copy of the <u>order of
execution dated May 3, 1966</u>, and that a copy of the order of de­fault had
never been furnished him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of the <u>impending</u> execution of the judgment by de­fault
with the following <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion –</p>

February, 1966, representing monthly salaries of security guards employed by
the plain­tiff in the haciendas leased plus P7,000.00 repre­senting
transportation, hotel and representation expenses incurred by the plaintiff for
plaintiff's counsel and another P700.00 representing the year­ly premiums on
the injunction bond filed by plain­tiff,"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">the defendant-petitioner interposed the
instant petition for <u>certiorari</u><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>with preliminary injunction to annul the order of default, the judgment <i>by
</i>default, and the order of execution, and to res­train<b><i> </i></b>the
execution of the aforesaid judgment pending the resolu­tion of the instant
petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 23,<b> </b>1966 this Court granted the writ of prelimi­nary
injunction prayed for, conditioned on the petitioner's posting a bond of

<p class="BODY">Reverting to the case at bar, the defendant-petitioner was served
with summons in connection with civil case 4968 on <st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="2">Feb­ruary 16, 1966</st1:date>, hence he had until <st1:date year="1966" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1966</st1:date> to file his res­ponsive
pleading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of filing an answer,
he <u>seasonably</u> inter­posed a motion to dismiss on <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the aforesaid motion to dismiss was
denied as early as <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1966</st1:date>,
he received notice of the denial, through his counsel of re­cord, <u>only on </u><st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="4"><u>April 25, 1966</u></st1:date>, a fact not
traversed by either the respondent Judge or the plaintiff-respondent.
Consequently, the defendant-petitioner had fifteen (15) days from <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1966</st1:date>, or up to <st1:date year="1966" day="10" month="5">May 10, 1966</st1:date>, to file his answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The delay in the mailing of a copy of the order of denial to the
defendant-petitioner's counsel was <u>confirmed</u> by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
in a report rendered after an investigation of the office of the clerk of court
upon urgent motion of the defendant-petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The report reads in part:</p>

<blockquote>"From its investigation of the employee in charge of Civil
Cases, the Court found out that, indeed, <u>there was a delay in the mailing</u>
of the Order of this Court dated <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="3">March
 31, 1966</st1:date> to counsel for the defendant, Atty. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span> <span class="SpellE">Inton</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, however, is convinced of the
sincerity of the reasons given by the employee concerned, and that is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that her failure to cause to be mailed the
copy intended for Atty. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span> <span class="SpellE">Inton</span> on the same date that she caused to be mailed the
copy for Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> <span class="SpellE">Canlas</span>
(plaintiff-respondent's counsel) was purely a case of an honest mistake and
inadvertence on her part owing to the volume of her work; the affidavit of the
employee in charge of Civil Cases being hereto attached."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The affidavit of the employee concerned
mentioned in the above-quoted portion of the report clearly admits the delay,
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"That due to the fact that I am the only one handling matters
relative to Civil Cases and, be­cause of the volume of my work in the office, I
must have inadvertently misplaced the envelope containing a copy of the Order
intended for Atty. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span> <span class="SpellE">Inton</span>,
and only discovered by (my) mistake on <u>April 14, 1966</u>, when I went over
some papers contained in the drawer of my table;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That upon discovery of the said envelope containing the copy
of the order dated March 31, 1966, among the papers in my table drawer, I
forthwith sent the same to the one in charge of mailing and who mailed the same
on <u>April 16, 1966</u>, by registered air mail special delivery, as evi­denced
by Registry Receipt No. 26897 now attach­ed to the records of this case.”
(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is unmistakable from the foregoing exposition that when the
defendant-petitioner was declared in default on April 16, 1966 the time for filing
his answer had not yet even commenced to run anew because on the said date his
counsel had not yet received notice of the denial of the motion to
dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of denial was
received only on <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1966</st1:date>,
or definitely <u>after</u> <st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="4">April 16,
 1966</st1:date>, the day when a copy of the said order was mailed to the
defendant-petitioner's counsel and when the defendant-petitioner was declared
in default.</p>

<p class="BODY">No further elaboration is needed to show that the trial judge
acted in excess of jurisdiction when he declared the defen­dant-petitioner in
default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the herein <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> order of default is a patent nullity, an
infirmity which likewise afflicts, necessarily, the subsequent judgment by
default and the order of execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not amiss to say that, at the very least, the
defendant-petitioner's motion to dismiss should have been considered as an
answer, since it raised issues on the merits of the case, such as the
invalidity of the alleged contract of lease.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the defendant-petitioner should have been notified of the
hearing, and failure to give him an opportunity to appear in the court below
tainted the subsequent proceedings not only with irregularity but also with
illegality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It follows, therefore, that
the petitioner was incorrectly declared in default, and the holding of the
trial of the case on the merits in his absences, without due notice to him, was
a denial of due process.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In opposing the instant petition, the plaintiff-respondent
contends that the remedy of the defendant-petitioner is not a pe­tition for <u>certiorari</u>
but an ordinary appeal pursuant to Rule 41, section 2, paragraph 3 which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"A party who has been declared in default may likewise appeal
from the judgment rendered against him as contrary to the evidence or to the
law, even if no petition for relief to set aside the order of default has been
presented by him in accordance with rule 38."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
remedy provided for in the above-quoted rule is properly, though not
exclusively, available to a defendant who has been <u>validly</u> declared in
default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not preclude a
defendant who has been <u>illegally</u> declared in default from pursuing a
more speedy and efficacious remedy, like a petition for <u>certiorari</u> to
have the judgment by default set aside as a nullity.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be emphasized that a defendant who is properly declared
in default is differently situated from one who is impro­vidently declared in
default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The former irreparably loses
his right to participate in the trial, while the latter retains such right and
may exercise the same after having the order of default and the subsequent
judgment by default annulled and the case re­manded to the court of
origin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover the former is <u>limited</u>
to the remedy set forth in section 2, paragraph 3 of Rule 41 by virtue of which
he can contest <u>only</u> the <u>judgment by default</u> on the desig­nated
ground that it is contrary to the evidence or the law; the latter, however, has
the option to avail of the same remedy or to forthwith interpose a petition for
<u>certiorari</u> seeking the nulli­fication of the order of default even
before the promulgation of a judgment by default, or in the event that the
latter has been ren­dered, to have both court decrees - the order of default
and the judgment by default - declared void.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The defendant-petitioner's choice of the latter course of action is
correct for he controverts the judgment by default not on the ground that it is
not supported by evidence or it is contrary to law, but on the ground that it
is intrinsically void for having been rendered pursuant to a patently invalid
order of default.</p>

<p class="BODY">Granting, however, that an appeal is open to the
defendant-petitioner, the same is no longer an adequate and speedy remedy
considering that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> had already <u>ordered the
issuance of a writ of execution</u> and the carrying out of such writ loomed as
a great probability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is in<b> </b>consonance
with the doctrine enunciated in <span class="SpellE"><u>Vda</u></span><u>. de <span class="SpellE">Saludes</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Pajarillo</span> and
Bautista</u><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein this Court held that an "appeal under the circumstances was not an
adequate remedy there being an order of execution issued by the municipal
court." Hence, the rule that <u>certiorari</u> does not lie when there is
an appeal is relaxed where, as in the instant case, the trial court had already
ordered the issuance of a writ of execution.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff-respondent also argues that the instant peti­tion
should be denied for failure of the defendant-petitioner to move for a
reconsideration of the challenged decrees so as to af­ford the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
the chance to emend its errors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While as
a matter of policy a motion for reconsideration in the lower court has often
been considered a condition <u>sine</u> <u>qua</u> <u>non</u> for the grant­ing
of a writ of <u>certiorari</u>, this rule does not apply "where the
proceeding in which the error occurred is a patent nullity,"<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
or where "the deprivation of petitioner's fundamental right to due process
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> taints the
proceedings against him in the court below not only with irregularity but with
nullity,"<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
or when special circumstances warrant immediate and more direct action.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
The fact that the defendant-petitioner had been deprived of due pro­cess, taken
together with the circumstance that a writ of execu­tion had already been
issued, perforce takes this case outside of the purview of the rule requiring a
previous motion for reconsi­deration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The nullity of the challenged orders relieves the
defendant-petitioner from paying the damages assessed against him by the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u>; however, it does not entitle him to pursue further his claim of
possession and administration over the abovementioned five <u>haciendas</u>,
considering that we have declared in L-26751 that his appointment as
co-administrator is void.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing disquisition, the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
or­der of default, judgment by default and order of execution should be
annulled and set aside.</p>

had no authority to enter into the said compromise agreement without the

capacity to represent the plaintiff estate considering that his personality and
authority as co-administrator remained unimpaired because the order of January

<p class="BODY">Undeniably, the aforesaid order of dismissal with preju­dice
adjudicated civil case 4252 upon the merits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since there is no showing that the respondent judge issued the said
order with grave abuse of discretion or without or in excess of jurisdiction,
an ordinary <u>appeal</u>, then, not a petition for <u>certiorari</u>, was the

as a substitute remedy<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
to challenge the said order, which in the meantime had already become <u>final</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pretension of the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>-petitioner
that his ina­bility to appeal on time was due to the failure of the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> to furnish him a copy of the order of dismissal is a spurious, if
not an utterly perfidious, claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
begin with, when the herein <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>-petitioner and
his brother Luis filed their motion to intervene on August 17, 1964, they were
not represented by coun­sel, but they failed to disclose their respective
addresses or at least the address of one of them, contrary to the requirement
of section 5 of Rule 7 that a "party who is <u>not represented by an at­torney
</u>shall sign his pleadings and <u>state his address</u>." (emphasis
supplied) Consequently, if the pertinent Orders and notices were not sent to
the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>, it was because of their failure to
dis­close their mailing addresses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
all<b> </b>events, since the <span class="SpellE">Interve­nors</span> virtually
allied with the plaintiff estate by adopting <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>
the latter's complaint without filing a separate complaint in inter­vention, it
is not without justification to rule, considering the particular circumstances
obtaining, that notice to the plaintiff estate should be deemed sufficient
notice to the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it is of record that both Attys. <span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span> <span class="SpellE">Laureta</span> and Robert
Porter, who appeared on February 7, 1966 as<i> </i>coun­sels for the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> in his
capacity as alleged co-administrator by virtue of the <span class="SpellE">abovecited</span>
order of the probate court dated January 31, 1966, were duly furnished with
copies of all orders of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> subsequent to their
appearance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An­ent the order of
dismissal dated February 15, 1966, the lower court reported, after an
investigation of the deputy clerk of court for alleged mailing discrepancies
upon motion of the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>, that copies of the
said order were "each mailed to and received by Attys. <span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span>
<span class="SpellE">Laureta</span> and Robert E. Porter on March 18 and 3, 1966,
respectively, per registry return cards duly attached to the records of this
case." In other words, the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>-petitioner
Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> was furnished, through counsel, a copy
of the order of dismissal at the earliest on <u>March 3, 1966</u> when Atty.
Porter received a copy of the order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a lapse of <u>twenty-three (23) days</u> from the receipt of the
said copy, Attys. <span class="SpellE">Laureta</span> and Porter filed on <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1966</st1:date> a motion for
reconsideration of the order of dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, when the said motion was filed, the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>-petitioner
had still <u>seven (7) days</u> to perfect an appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, on <st1:date year="1966" day="11" month="4">April 11,<b> </b>1966</st1:date>, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
denied the aforesaid motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Separate copies of said denial were received
by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Laureta</span> on <st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="4"><u>April 16, 1966</u></st1:date> and by Atty. Porter on <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="4"><u>April 18, 1966</u></st1:date>, respectively,
as per registry receipts 25870 and 25872 and delivery No. 69785 and the
reply-telegram dated <st1:date year="1966" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1966</st1:date>
from the Bureau of Posts addressed to the respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From <st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="4">April
 16, 1966</st1:date> the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>-petitioner still
had seven (7) days or up <u>to </u><st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="4"><u>April
 23, 1966</u></st1:date> to per­fect an appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, it was only on <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="4">April
 25, 1966</st1:date> that the requisite notice of appeal and appeal bond were
filed while the record on appeal was filed much later, on <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1966</st1:date>, clear­ly way beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>-petitioner contends
however, that it was only on <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="4">April 25,
 1966</st1:date> that he received notice of the dismissal of civil case 4252
and on the very same day he caused the filing of the necessary notice of appeal
and appeal bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conceding that the
foregoing assertion is correct, the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>-petitioner's
projected appeal was still out of time since the requisite record on appeal was
filed only on <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1966</st1:date>,
or thirty-one days from <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In passing, it is pertinent to note that the dismissal of the
complaint in civil case 4252, after the issues were joined with the filing of
the responsive pleadings, upon the defendants' mo­tion to resolve a pending
motion to dismiss, the resolution of which had been previously deferred until
after the trial by virtue of an order of the same court under another judge, is
a procedu­ral deviation from the standard sequence of trial in accordance with
which the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> after the requisite answers were filed,
should have proceeded with the trial on the merits, and only thereafter
resolved the motion to dismiss as was the import of the order of
deferment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, it is relevant
to empha­size, on the other hand, that an order deferring the resolution of a
motion to dismiss, being an <u>interlocutory</u> order, may be al­tered or
revoked by the trial court during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the
main action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is settled that an
"interlocutory order or decree made in the progress of a case is always
under the control of the court until the final decision of the suit, and may be
modified or rescinded upon sufficient grounds shown at any time before final
judgment x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Of similar import is the ruling of this Court de­claring that "it is
rudimentary that such (interlocutory) orders are subject to change in the
discretion of the court."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, one of the inherent powers of the court is "To amend and control
its process and orders so as to make them conformable to law and justice.”<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
In the language of Chief Justice Moran, paraphrasing the ruling in <span class="SpellE"><u>Veluz</u></span><u> vs. Justice of the Peace of <span class="SpellE">Sariaya</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
since judges are human, susceptible to mistakes, and are bound to administer
justice in accordance with law, they are given the inherent power of amending
their orders or judgments so as to make them conformable to law and justice,
and they can do so be­fore they lose their jurisdiction of the case, that is
before the time to appeal has expired and no appeal has been perfected.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in the <span class="SpellE">abovecited</span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>Veluz</u></span> case, this Court held that " If the
trial court should discover or be convinced that it had committed an error in
its judgment, or had done an injustice, before the same has become final, it
may, upon its own motion or upon a motion of the parties, correct such error in
order to do justice between the parties. ... It would seem to be the very
height of absurdity to prohibit a trial judge from correcting an error,
mistake, or injustice which is called to his attention before he has lost con­trol
of his judgment." <span class="SpellE">Corollarily</span>, it has also been
held "that a judge of first instance is not legally prevented from
revoking the interlocutory order of another judge in the very litigation
subsequently assigned to him for judicial action."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing rulings, it is then enough to say that
the abovementioned order of deferment, issued by the Honor­able Judge Vicente <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span>, Jr., to whose <span class="SpellE">sala</span> civil
case 4252 was originally assigned, is interlocutory in nature, and as such, the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, through the now respondent Judge Vicente <span class="SpellE">Bullecer</span>, had the power to set it aside, as it did by
finally deciding the pend­ing motion to dismiss on the ground of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, as previously stated, there is no
evidence to show that the respondent Judge, in issuing the order of dismissal,
acted with grave abuse of discretion or without or in excess of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now come to the challenged order of default and judg­ment by
default, both contained in the abovementioned order dated<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:date year="1966" day="29" month="3">March
 29, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attacking the
validity of the said order of default, the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>-petitioner
claims that the respondent Judge failed to consider that <span class="SpellE">Matias</span>
<span class="SpellE">Matute</span>, representing the plaintiff estate, filed on
time an answer dated March 1, 1965 traversing the allega­tions of <span class="SpellE">Canlas</span>' counterclaim, which answer inured to the benefit of
not only <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> but
also to the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> who were jointly <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as defendants in the said counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant-respondent <span class="SpellE">Canlas</span>,
on the other hand, while not denying receipt of the aforesaid answer to his
counterclaim, contends that the herein <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>-petitioner's
failure to personally ans­wer said counterclaim is fatal and that he could not
take refuge under the answer interposed by <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are of the considered opinion that the herein disputed order
of default is illegal and void, and, consequently, the <span class="SpellE">con­troverted</span>
judgment by default and order of execution were impro­vidently issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The counterclaim interposed
by <span class="SpellE">Canlas</span> raised a com­mon cause of action for
damages against <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>,
as the representative of the plaintiff estate, and Jose and Luis <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>, as <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> in civil
case 4252, all in their personal capaci­ties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The counterclaim reads:</p>

<blockquote>"That for instituting this patently frivolous and unfounded
action in bad faith calculated to merely harass answering defendant <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Canlas</span> in order to
satisfy the personal revenge, hatred and vindictiveness of the co-administrator,
<span class="SpellE"><u>Matias</u></span><u> S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span></u>,
<u>representing the plaintiff Estate</u>, <u>and the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> and Luis S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span></u>,
defendant <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Canlas</span>
suffered actual, moral and consequential damages in the to­tal amount of
P100,000.00, <u>for which plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Ma­tias</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> and Luis S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> should
be held personally liable</u>." (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Having been thus jointly charged to pay
the <span class="SpellE">abovestated</span> damages, the brothers <span class="SpellE">Matias</span>, Jose and Luis <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>
could validly file a common responsive pleading, as in effect they did when <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> filed an answer to
the aforesaid counterclaim, the receipt of which <span class="SpellE">Canlas</span>
admits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is significant to note that
the said ans­wer does not only deny the charge against <span class="SpellE">Matias</span>
<span class="SpellE">Matute</span> but as well as negates the claim against the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. Moreover, having successfully prayed for the resolu­tion of
his pending motion to dismiss, even after the issues had been joined with the
filing of his answer, the defendant-respondent <span class="SpellE">Canlas</span>
is deemed to have abandoned his counterclaim and volun­tarily reverted himself
to the time when he initially interposed his motion to dismiss prior to the
filing of his answer with counter claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, when the complaint in civil case 4252 was dismissed on the basis
of <span class="SpellE">Canlas</span>' motion, the entire proceeding was inevita­bly
terminated and <u>there was nothing more to adjudge</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the termination of all the pending
incidents in civil case 4252 was sub­sequently decreed by the respondent Judge
himself in the orders of <st1:date year="1966" day="12" month="3">March 12,
 1966</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1966" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the respondent Judge, to say
the least, acted in excess of jurisdiction when he is­sued, after having
dismissed the principal complaint, the herein <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
order of default and judgment by default for then there was nothing left to be
adjudicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said decrees having been
ren­dered in excess of jurisdiction, <u>certiorari</u> will lie to have then an­nulled.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing discussion, the finality of the order of
dismissal should be upheld, while the disputed order of default, judgment by
default and order of execution should be declared void and set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">The motion interposed on June 14, 1966 by the herein <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>-petitioner, in his alleged capacity as
co-administrator, in behalf of the <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> <span class="SpellE">Olave</span> estate, praying that
the said estate be allowed to adopt the instant petition for <u>certiorari </u>with
preliminary injunction and be admitted as co-petitioner, the reso­lution of
which we had previously deferred should therefore be denied on the ground that
the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>-petitioner has no legal personality to
represent the <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> estate considering that his ap­pointment
as co-administrator has been voided.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, it is our considered view that the declaration of total
nullity of the abovementioned judgment by default shall perforce bar the execu­tion
against the <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> estate of that portion of the said
void judg­ment which condemns it to pay the sum of P50,000 in damages to the
defendants-respondents Rivera, del Rosario and <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, (1) in <u>L-26751 </u>the petition for <u>certiorari</u>

jurisdiction over CA-G.R. 37039-R; the probate court's <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
