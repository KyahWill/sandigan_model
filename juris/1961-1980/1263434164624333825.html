				<H3>SANTA PANGAN, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. DIONISIO
RAMOS, RESPONDENT.
<br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ANTONIO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This has reference to the
motion of complainant, Santa Pangan, to cite respondent Dionisio Ramos for
contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears from the record
that on Sep­tember 7, 1978 and March 13, 1979, the hearings in this
administrative case were postponed on the basis of respondent's motions for
postponement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These motions were
predicated on respondent's allegations that on said dates he had a case set </span><span style="">for hearing </span><span style="">before Branch VII, Court of First </span><span style="">Instance of Manila, entitled People v. Marieta M. Isip (Criminal </span><span style="">Case No. 35906).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon verification, the attorney of record of
the accused in said case is one "Atty. Pedro D.D. Ramos, 306 Doña Salud
Bldg., Dasmariñas, Manila." Respondent admits that he used the name of
"Pedro D.D. Ramos" before said court in connection with Criminal Case
No. 35906, but avers that he had a right to do so because in his Birth
Certificate (Annex "A"), </span><span style="">his
name </span><span style="">is "Pedro Dionisio
Ramos", and his parents are Pedro Ramos and Carmen Dayaw, and that the
"D.D." in "Pedro D.D. Ramos" is but an ab­breviation of
"Dionisio Dayaw", his other given name and maternal surname.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This explanation of
respondent is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The name
appearing in the "Roll of Attorneys" is "Dionisio D.
Ramos".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attorney's roll or
regis­ter is the official record containing the names and signatures of those
who are authorized to practice law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">A lawyer </span><span style="">is not authorized to use a name other than the one inscribed in the
Roll of </span><span style="">Attorneys in </span><span style="">his practice of law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The official oath obliges
the attorney solemnly to swear </span><span style="">that
</span><span style="">he </span><span style="">"will </span><span style="">do no falsehood".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As an of­ficer
in the temple of justice, an attorney has irrefragable obligations of
"truthfulness, candor and frankness".</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Indeed, candor and frankness should
characterize the conduct of the lawyer at every stage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This has to be so because the court has the
right to rely upon him in ascertaining the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In representing himself to the court as
"Pedro D.D. Ramos" instead of "Dionisio D. Ramos",
respondent has violated his solemn oath.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The duty of an attorney to the courts to employ, for the purpose
of maintaining the causes confided to him, such means as are consistent with
truth and honor, cannot be overemphasized.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These injunctions circumscribe the general duty of entire devotion of
the attorney to the client.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated in
a case, his "high vocation is to correctly inform the court upon the law
and the facts of the case, and to aid it in doing justice and arriving at
correct conclu­sions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He violates his
oath of office when he re­sorts to deception, or permits his client to do
so."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In using the name of "Pedro D.D. Ramos" before the
courts instead of the name by which he was autho­rized to practice law -
Dionisio D. Ramos -- res­pondent in effect resorted to deception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He demons­trated lack of candor in dealing
with the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstance that
this is his first aberration in this regard precludes Us from imposing a more
severe penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, respondent Dionisio
D. Ramos is severely REPRIMANDED and warned that a repetition of the same overt
act may warrant his suspension or disbarment from the practice of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appearing that the hearing of this case has been unduly
delayed, the Investigator of this Court is directed forthwith to proceed with
the hearing to terminate it as soon as possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The request of complainant to appear in the
afore-mentioned hearing, assisted by her counsel, Atty. Jose U. Lontoc, is
hereby granted.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
