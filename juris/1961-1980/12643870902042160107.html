refusal of the respondent Court of First Instance of Manila to suspend Ramon 
<span class="SpellE">Saura</span> as receiver in its Civil Case No. 34998.</p>
<p>Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Camins</span> seeks, in G.R. No. L-23754, a writ 
of certiorari against certain orders of the Court of First Instance of Manila 
(issued in the same civil case No. 34998) appointing <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Ofilada</span>, Clerk of the 
Court of First Instance, the permanent receiver of World War Veterans 
Enterprises, Inc., and refusing" to appoint the <span class="SpellE">Philipines</span> Veterans Bank as such receiver.</p>
<p>Said Case No. 34998, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> Normandy, 
Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Camins</span>, et al., vs. <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span> <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, et al." and "Jose 
and Susana <span class="SpellE">Cochingyan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Intervenors</span>", was a derivative suit filed by minority 
stockholders of the World War Veterans enterprises, Inc., seeking to annul and 
set aside certain agreements entered into by the directors of the corporation 
and Jose and Susana <span class="SpellE">Cochingyan</span>.</p>
<p>By order of <st1:date month="9" day="6" year="1960">September 6, 
1960</st1:date>, the Court of First Instance of Manila had, upon motion, 
appointed one Ramon E. <span class="SpellE">Saura</span> as receiver of the 
properties of the corporation. On <st1:date month="1" day="31" year="1961">January 31, 1961</st1:date>, defendants and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> filed charges against the receiver <span class="SpellE">Saura</span> and sought his suspension, praying further that a 
co-receiver be appointed. This motion was denied; whereupon, the <span class="SpellE">movants</span>, <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span> <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, et al., resorted to the Supreme Court, alleging grave 
abuse of discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction (G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-18359).</span> On <st1:date month="4" day="29" year="1961">April 
29, 1961</st1:date>, this Supreme Court issued a resolution giving the petition 
due course, and stated therein-</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p><u>"Without in any way prejudging the question involved in the motion for the 
removal of the receiver still pending in the respondent court, it is aim the 
opinion of this Court that, for the proper protection of the rights of 
petitioners, a second receiver should be appointed.</u> Therefore, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Ofilada</span>, Clerk of the 
Court of First Instance of Manila, is hereby appointed second receiver and may 
qualify us such upon filing and approval of a bond equal in the amount to the 
one filed by receiver Ramon <span class="SpellE">Saura<span class="GramE">,<u>However</u></span></span><u>, inasmuch Oft mid clerk of Court 
has considerable official dudes to perform, his appointment hereby made is 
provisional and shall stand only until such time as this Court appoints another 
in his stead."</u></p></blockquote>
<p>This case became moot when on May 28, 1964 receiver Ramon E. <span class="SpellE">Saura</span> resigned, and his resignation was accepted by the 
court below, which also fixed a fee of P10.000.00 for his services. Thereupon, 
defendants and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> asked that <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Ofilada</span> be made permanent 
receiver. Plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Camins</span>, on the other hand, opposed 
such appointment and. sought <span class="SpellE">Ofilada's</span> discharge on 
various grounds, primarily partiality to the other side. <span class="SpellE">Camins</span> proposed that the Philippines Veterans Bank be 
appointed receiver instead of <span class="SpellE">Ofilada</span>.</p>
<p>On <st1:date month="9" day="24" year="1964">September 24, 1964</st1:date>, 
the respondent Judge, Hon. Francisco Area, rejected the proposal to appoint the 
Bank as receiver, statingâ€” </p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"2. Petitioner Lorenzo B. <span class="SpellE">Camins</span> through counsel 
filed on <st1:date month="8" day="22" year="1964">August 22, 1964</st1:date> a 
petition for the substitution of the first receiver, the discharge of the second 
receiver, and the appointment of the Philippine Veterans Bank as receiver in 
place of the First Receiver, Ramon E, <span class="SpellE">Saura</span>, since 
discharged.</p>
<p>"The Court does not consider well taken the reasons alleged by <span class="SpellE">Camitin</span> in Ma petition and the Court believes that only one 
receiver is sufficient and will entail less expense. Consequently, the motion to 
appoint a substitute receiver in lieu of <span class="SpellE">Saura</span> is 
hereby denied and, inasmuch as the Court sees no valid and sufficient reason to 
discharge <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Ofilada</span> 
as receiver, the motion to remove him is hereby likewise 
denied."</p></blockquote>
<p>Two days later, by order dated September 26, the court below granted the 
motion to appoint <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Ofilada</span> permanent receiver upon filing of a bond of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>
<p>Failing to obtain a reconsideration, plaintiffs <span class="SpellE">Camins</span> and Normandy (the latter died during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the proceedings) resorted to this Court for a 
writ of certiorari, asking that, for the reasons set forth in the petition, the 
orders of September 24, and 26, 1964 be annulled: that the Philippine Veterans 
Bank be appointed sole receiver; and that the lower court be ordered to 
discharge <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Ofilada</span> as 
receiver.</p>
<p>A due regard for the facts appearing of record convinces, us that the 
petition should be denied. The appointment and discharge of receivers are 
matters primarily addressed to, and resting largely on, the discretion of the 
trial court, not being a matter of strict right, and a reviewing court will not 
interfere with the exercise of such discretion unless convinced that the same 
has been abused (Samson vs. <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, .64 Phil. 549; 
Lama vs. <span class="SpellE">Apacible</span>, 79 Phil. 68; De la Cruz, vs. <span class="SpellE">Guinto</span>, 79 Phil. 304; <span class="SpellE">Valiente</span> vs. 
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, 80 Phil 415; <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Macadaeg</span>, 88 Phil. 605; 
<span class="SpellE">Medel</span> vs. de <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, 92 
Phil. 895). This is all the more true of the trial court's choice between 
candidates for Receivership proposed by the contending parties, who have been 
fully heard in the matter.</p>
<p>The petitioner stresses that in 1961 this Court, in Case G.R. No. L-18359, 
has taken cognizance of the fact that as a clerk of Court Mr. <span class="SpellE">Ofilada</span> had considerable official duties to perform, and, 
for that reason, appointed him only as temporary receiver. Such action does not 
preclude a more accurate appraisal by the trial court three years later, whether 
or not the official duties of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Ofilada</span>, as the 
Clerk of that same court, impaired his efficient discharge of the functions of a 
receiver, taking into account his actuations as temporary receiver from 1961 to 
1964; and we see no evidence that in concluding that Mr. <span class="SpellE">Ofilada</span> could well perform the work of a permanent receiver, 
despite his official duties, the lower court's decision was so arbitrary and 
capricious a determination as to warrant intervention of the appellate 
court.</p>
<p>The orders complained of import also a rejection of the charges of 
incompetence and partiality <span class="SpellE">levelled</span> at receiver <span class="SpellE">Ofilada</span>. It does not appear, however, that such action of 
the court was arbitrary, since the charges were fully discussed by the parties 
and considered by the Court. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the 
conclusion made by the court below was erroneous, that <u>per se</u> does not 
render its appraisal of the facts adduced before it and grave abuse of 
discretion that would warrant the grant of a writ of certiorari (<span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos vs. Province of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, 67 Phil. 480; Tan vs. People 88 Phil. 609).</p>
<p>With regard to the impending retirement of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Ofilada</span> in March 1965; his nomination ns judge of the Court 
of First Instance; and the nomination by respondents, of former General <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ojeda</span>, brought to light 
during the hearing of this case, as well as the propriety of appointing &amp; 
neutral party as a receiver, it is not shown that these developments were called 
to the lower court's attention. <span class="GramE">it</span> is not opinion that 
the same should be first presented to the respondent Judge to give him due 
opportunity to consider and weigh them, and then decide whether such factors 
would justify a change of receiver.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for a 
writ of certiorari in G. R. No. 23754 is denied, with costs against petitioner 
Lorenzo B. Gamins.</p>
<p><span class="GramE">The former receiver, Ramon E. <span class="SpellE">Saura</span>, having resigned, and his resignation having been 
accepted, Case G.R. No.</span> L-18359 has become academic. The case is, 
therefore, dismissed, without costs.</p>
