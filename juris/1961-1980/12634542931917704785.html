				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this petition for certiorari, the <span style="">issuance </span>of <span style="">a </span><span style="">writ </span>of <span style="">execution pending appeal, primarily on the allegation that the motion
on which it was based "was not </span><span style="">sworn to and no affidavit was attached to substantiate the factual
allegations" contained therein, is sought to be quashed and set aside on
the ground that respondent Court acted with grave abuse of discretion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In
the petition dated September </span>18, 1964, it was alleged and admitted that
petitioners were defendants in a complaint for rescission of contract and
damages with attachment filed with the respondent Judge, the Hon. <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Mencias</span></span><span style="">, the other respondents namely, <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span>, Leticia Pike, </span><span style="">Francisca </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Vda</span></span><span style="">. de Pike, Norma
Pike, <span class="SpellE">Agatona</span> <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Lakambakal</span>, being
the plaintiffs, the </span><span style="">complaint being</span> filed on May 4, 1963, and the answer on August 10,
1963.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="">It was then alleged
that </span>on <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="2"><span style="">February 28, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondent Judge
conducted a hearing without sending the notice of hea</span>ring to the counsel
of defendants then, now petitioners, who were thus deprived of their day in
court.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The answer of respondents dated October 16, 1964 denied <span style="">the </span>truth of the above assertion with allegation that respondent
Judge did not hear the <span style="">case </span>on February 28, <span style="">1964,
</span>until after he was informed by a deputy clerk that notice <span style="color: windowtext;">of such trial to
petitioners were sent as early as October 15, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parenthetically it may be observed that this
issue, the pertinence of which is not so apparent in this petition for
certiorari </span><span style="color: windowtext;">being more connected </span><span style="color: windowtext;">with the case on the merits, apparently
has been abandoned in </span><span style="color: windowtext;">the </span><span style="color: windowtext;">memorandum of </span><span style="color: windowtext;">petitioners </span><span style="color: windowtext;">dated January 25, 1965, <span style="">as </span></span><span style="color: windowtext;">noted
by respondents in their</span><i style=""><span style="color: windowtext;"> </span></i><span style="color: windowtext;">reply memorandum of
February 8, 1965.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition for certiorari went on to state that the decision
was rendered by respondent Judge on March 5, 1964, that petitioners as
defendants filed a <span style="">motion to set aside
and for </span>new trial dated March <span style="">9,
1964, and that on July 21, </span>1964, the other respondents, plaintiffs <span style="">in that </span><span style="">case, </span><span style="">filed </span>an unverified motion for
issuance of a writ of execution before <span style="">the
decision was final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>The above paragraphs are admitted by
respondents with <span style="">the </span>modification that an opposition to petitioners' motion to set
aside decision <span style="">and for new trial </span><span style="">was </span>filed and that their motion for
writ of execution which was set for hearing on <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1964</st1:date> was not opposed by counsel for petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention as to why the writ of execution was improvidently
issued is based primarily on the ground that "the motion for execution was
not sworn to and no affidavit was attached to <span style="">substantiate the factual allegations therein contained."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor "was any evidence </span>presented
by the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">movants</span></span><span style=""> during </span>the hearing of said motion conducted by the respondent <span style="">court.” It was further argued that </span>it
"failed to state good and adequate reasons to justify the issuance of the
writ prayed for; that no evidence was introduced <span style="">in support </span>of the <span style="">factual allegations
</span>of said motion; that a writ of execution would disturb the <u style="">status</u> <u style="">quo</u>
and cause irreparable damage <span style="color: windowtext;">and injury </span><span style="color: windowtext;">to </span><span style="color: windowtext;">the petitioner</span><span style="color: windowtext;">."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The denial of the above allegation by respondents was predicated
on the provision of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court <span style="">which "does </span>not require that a motion for writ of <span style="">execution pending </span>appeal
should be under oath much less supported by <span style="">any affidavit."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would
suffice, </span>according to respondents that there be "good and special
reasons for the <span style="">issuance </span>of <span style="color: windowtext;">a writ of execution
which was done in the instant </span><span style="color: windowtext;">case </span><span style="color: windowtext;">on the basis of the very evidence presented and </span><span style="color: windowtext;">submitted
by [them] which became the basis of the decision * </span><span style="color: windowtext;">* *."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1964</st1:date>,
this Court gave due course to the petition for certiorari and issued a writ of
preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The motion for the issuance of a writ of execution filed by the
other respondents with the respondent Judge stated the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"That a Decision was rendered by this<i style=""><span style="color: windowtext;"> </span></i>Honorable Court in the above-entitled case dated
March 5, 1964 against [petitioners as] defendants in favor of [the other respondents
as] plaintiffs; that [petitioners as] defendants filed a 'Motion To Set Aside
Decision And For New Trial dated March 9, 1964 but <u>the same was denied</u>
by this Honorable Court; that the property in question owned by [petitioners
as] defendants was encumbered and the obli­gations thereof have not been
settled; that [petitioners as] defendants have been exhausting for their
personal use all the monthly installments being received by them from the sales
of the different lots of the Fatima Subdivision in question and they have not
constructed therein the improve­ments required by law like the construction of
roads, gutters, <span style="color: windowtext;">* * *; that the said [petitioners as] defendants do
not </span><span style="color: windowtext;">appear to
have any other properties or assets to answer not only for the aforementioned
obligations but more particularly for the obligations imposed upon them by the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> Decision of this Honorable Court in favor of
[respondents as]<span style="">&nbsp; </span>plaintiffs and that
[they] will be deprived of the right to collect the amounts due to them if this
case will drag for several years by the appeal of [petitioners <span style="">as] </span>defendants to the superior courts
for by that time <span style="">all [their] remaining </span>assets
with the said subdivision would have been completely exhausted; that by virtue
of the foregoing special reasons although the period for appeal of the
aforementioned decision has not yet expired yet this Honorable Court may <span style="">issue </span></span><span style="color: windowtext;">a
</span><span style="color: windowtext;">writ of
execution pending appeal pursuant to Sec. 2, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court;
that a writ of execution </span><span style="color: windowtext;">is </span><span style="color: windowtext;">necessary to be issued </span><span style="color: windowtext;">as
</span><span style="color: windowtext;">soon as
possible so that the remaining rights of [petitioners as] defendants to the
Fatima Subdivision in question may be accordingly levied upon by the [other
respondents </span><span style="color: windowtext;">as] </span><span style="color: windowtext;">plaintiffs to answer for their obligations * * *</span><span style="color: windowtext;"> </span><span style="color: windowtext;">pursuant
to the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> decision, which obligations
represented payments made to [petitioners as] defendants for several lots </span><span style="color: windowtext;">which the [<span style="">other respondents </span></span><span style="color: windowtext;">as] </span><span style="color: windowtext;">plaintiffs purchased from
them from the above-described subdivision."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="color: windowtext;"> </span><span style="color: windowtext;">The prayer was for a writ
of execution to be issued pursuant to Section 2 of Rule 39 <span style="">to enforce the decision of </span></span><st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="3"><span style="color: windowtext;">March 5, </span><span style="color: windowtext;">1964</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;"> <span style="">pending
its appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As
noted in the answer </span><span style="">of
respondents, the aforesaid motion <span style="">for
writ </span>of execution "was not objected to or opposed by the defendants
therein, who are now the petitioners * * *.” <span style="">Moreover, it was likewise asserted in such answer that pe­titioners
"did not file </span>in the lower court any motion for the reconsideration
of the Order of Execution * * *." <span style="">There
was no denial of such an assertion by petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should not be lost sight of either, that
neither in the petition nor in the memorandum of petitioners is there any
showing </span></span><span style="color: windowtext;">that the facts alleged in the motion for execution
were lacking in truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record is </span><span style="color: windowtext;">barren
of </span><span style="color: windowtext;">any attempt </span><span style="color: windowtext;">to refute the </span><span style="color: windowtext;">allegations therein
contained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Instead, the main thrust
of petitioners' attack <span style="">is </span>centered
on the fact that the motion for the issuance of the writ of execution filed by
the other respondents was "unverified."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no such requirement under the Rules
of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion of the prevailing
party with notice to the adverse party allows the Court to "order
execution to issue even before the expiration of the time to appeal, upon good
reasons to be stated in a special order."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> According to the late Chief Justice Moran,
"in order that discretionary execution may issue before the expiration of
the time to appeal the following three circumstances must be present:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="color: windowtext;">(a) there must be a motion by the
prevailing party with notice to the adverse party; (b) there must be good
reasons for issuing execution and (c) that the good reasons <span style="">be stated in </span></span><span style="color: windowtext;">a
</span><span style="color: windowtext;">special </span><span style="color: windowtext;">order."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">All such requisites being present, this petition must fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the action of respondent Judge could not
correctly be characterized as a grave abuse of discretion is obvious as it
finds direct support in the applicable legal provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What he did was in accordance with procedural
principles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Astraquillo</span>
v. Javier,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
is not without relevance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated in
the opinion of this Court, thru Justice J. B. L. Reyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“<span style="color: windowtext;">It <span style="">is </span>not disputed that respondents Javier filed their motion for
execution pending appeal in the trial court before petitioners <span class="SpellE">Astraquillos</span> perfected their appeal, and averred the insol­vency
of the latter as the special and good <span style="">reason
for such </span>execution specifying and citing the facts appearing in the
records of the case upon which such claim is based.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent trial judge, in granting the
motion, seemed to have been satisfied that the evidence already submitted did
warrant such execution pending appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This finding was confirmed by the Court of Appeals in its disputed
resolution." From which inevitably flowed the conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Under the circums­tances prevailing in
the case at bar, we are constrained not to disturb the disputed ruling of the
Court of Appeals."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the very least then, it could likewise be well and truly said
that this Court is "constrained not to disturb" the challenged
actuation of respondent Judge in granting the motion for the issuance of an
execution pending appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There may be
cases where undoubtedly such <span style="">a </span>discretion
vested <span style="">in </span>the lower court must
be interfered with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not one of
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To repeat, the petition must fail.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this petition for certiorari is denied and the
preliminary injunction dissolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
costs against petitioners.</p>
