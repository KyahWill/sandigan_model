				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for review by certiorari of a resolution of the Court of
Industrial Relations sitting <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Kabankalan</span> Sugar Company,
Inc., a domestic corporation, is the operator of <u>Hacienda</u> <span class="SpellE">Kalasa</span>, at <span class="SpellE">Kabankalan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, which is devoted exclusively to the
planting and cultivation of sugar cane.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Visayas</span> Workers and Farmers
Association - herein­after referred to as the PLUM - is a legitimate labor
organization, some of the members which work in said <u>hacienda</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In December, 1958, the PLUM sent collective
bargaining proposals to Petitioner, which refused to negotiate, despite the
intervention of the Conciliation Division of the Department of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of this refusal, a complaint, against
herein Petitioner, was filed with the Court of Industrial Relations -
hereinafter referred to as the CIR - for alleged unfair labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its answer to the complaint, Petitioner
assailed the jurisdiction of the CIR, upon the ground that the laborers
involved in the case are agri<span style="">cultural
workers, whose grievances are beyond the jurisdiction of said Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing of the case, the PLUM
introduced its evidence, in the absence of the representative of Petitioner
herein, which later reiterated its objection to the Court’s jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the CIR issued an order
overruling said objection, finding the Petitioner guilty as charged, and
directing the same to bargain collectively with PLUM.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reconsideration sought by the Petitioner,
was denied by the CIR sitting <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the present petition for review by
certio­rari.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The CIR declared itself
with jurisdiction over the present case upon the theory that the laborers
involved therein should be classified as industrial, not agricultural workers,
because they are not Petitioner's "tenants, " either as shareholders
or as leaseholders; because some of the aforementioned laborers are
"regular" employees and the others are "seasonal" workers,
whose services area compensated in the form of “wages;” because their work
ranges "from planting </span><span style="">sugar
</span><span style="">cane, weeding the fields,
cutting sugar cane and loading the same in cane cars, which were taken to the <span class="SpellE">Biscom</span> which supplied them, for milling in the latter's <span class="SpellE">Binalbagan's</span> Sugar Mill;" because the planter and the
miller have one common, single objective, namely, the manu­facture of sugar;
and because, pursuant to the provisions of Republic </span><span style="">Act No. </span><span style="">809 -<span style="">&nbsp; </span>otherwise known as the
Philippine Sugar Act of 1952 - the sugar planter and the miller perform
integrated functions, in </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">fulfillment of the nation's export quota for
sugar, in view of which the planter shares in the profits from derivatives of
unrefined </span><span style="">sugar </span><span style="">mill­ed out of sugar cane produced in his
plantation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At the outset, it should
be noted, however, that the Court of Agrarian Relations has been created to
enforce all laws and regulations governing the relations of capital and labor
on </span><u><span style="">all agricultural lands</span></u><span style=""> under </span><span style="">any system of cultivation.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It is not disputed </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">the Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Kalasa</span> is an agricultural land,
and that the issue between the parties here­in is one arising from the
relations between capital and labor, in connection with said agricultural land.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At </span><span style="">any rate, a theory analogous to that upheld
in the resolution appealed from had been advanced in support of the authority
of the CIR to entertain a petition for certification election of workers in a
sugar cane plantation operated by <span class="SpellE">Elizalde</span> &amp;
Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such theory was rejected by
this Court, stating:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Respondent AWA calls attention to the fact that Republic Act No.
809 and its provisions refer to the persons engaged in the ‘Sugar Industry.’
Nothing in said act, however, indicates any legislative intent to convert
agricultural laborers into industrial employees; the term ‘sugar industry’ in
said Act refers to sugar millers, planters and laborers as a whole and has no
bearing on the issue now before the Court." (<span class="SpellE">Elizalde</span>
&amp; Co. v. Allied Workers Association, G. R. No. L-20792, May 31, 1965.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Indeed, in <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling Co., Inc. vs. Court of Industrial </span><span style="">Relations </span><span style="">(G. R. No. L-17281, March 30, 1963), we declared, citing <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> Sugar Mills vs. PASUMIL Workers Union (G. R. No.
L-7668, February 29, 1956), that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is, therefore, the nature of the work which classifies a
worker as one falling under the exemp­tion as 'agricultural laborers.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The members of respondent Union are merely
agricultural laborers in petitioners haciendas, the principal work of which is
planting and harvesting sugar canes and other chores incidental to ordinary
farming operations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are agricultural
laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being agricultural workers,
and in the supposition that the milling company had committed unfair labor
practice upon them, the Court of Agrarian Relations has jurisdiction over the
case."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">One of the </span><span style="">fa</span><span style="">ctors that has seemingly influenced heavily the d</span><span style="">ecision </span><span style="">of the CIR to assume jurisdiction over the present case, is the feeling</span><span style=""> </span>that the CAR has <span style="">not, as yet, </span>perfected, or, at least,
developed sufficiently, the machinery necessary to deal effectively with labor
disputes; but we have, likewise, ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>"The fact<span style=""> </span>that
the Court of Industrial Relations has the machinery to deal with questions of
union representation does not confer upon it jurisdiction over such questions
where agricultural workers are involved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no reason why the Court of Agrarian Relations may not set up
its own organization to deal with cases within its <span style="">jur</span>isdiction as circumstances may require, making use of its
rule-making power or by calling upon the opposite government offices, as its
organic law em<span style="">powers it to
do."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Elizalde</span>
&amp; Co. v. Allied Workers Association, <u>supra.</u>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the
resolution appealed from should be as it is hereby reversed, without special
pronouncement as to costs.</p>
