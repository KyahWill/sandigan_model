<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellant is a domestic 
corporation engaged in the manufacture and sale of acetylene and oxygen. In the 
process of manufacture it uses calcium carbide purchased from the Maria Cristina 
Chemical Industries of the Philippines, a concern engaged in an industry that is 
tax-exempt under Republic Act No. 901 (which grants such exemption to new and 
necessary industries). In computing the percentage taxes on its sales of 
acetylene for the year 1954, 1955 and 1956, appellant deducted the price of the 
calcium carbide from the gross selling price of said product, but the deduction 
was not allowed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. As a result an 
assessment for deficiency taxes was made in the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,855.97</span>. Protesting the disallowance, appellant sought a 
review of the assessment in the Court of Tax Appeals, which sustained the 
Commissioner's ruling and also granted the latter's counterclaim for an amount 
erroneously credited in favor of appellant. The case is now before us on appeal 
from the Tax Court's decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The assessment made by the 
Commissioner is based on Section 186 of the Internal Revenue Code, which fixes 
the tax at seven (7%) per cent "of the gross selling price or gross value in 
money of the articles sold * * *, such tax to be paid by the manufacturer or 
producer." Appellant, on the other hand, relies on the following proviso in the 
same section, to wit: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"That where the articles subject 
to tax under this section are manufactured out of materials likewise subject to 
tax under this section and section one hundred and eighty-nine the total cost of 
such materials, as duly established, shall be deductible from the gross selling 
price or cross value in money of such manufactured 
articles."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellant's contention is that it 
bought the calcium carbide not from the tax-exempt Maria Cristina Chemical 
Industries of the Philippines but from the National Carbon Philippines, Inc., 
which, it is averred, may be presumed to have paid the corresponding percentage 
taxes in view of the usual business practice of adding the amount thereof to the 
sales price of every article sold. Appellant points to the sales invoices 
(Exhibits A-l to A-45) covering the purchases of calcium carbide made by it, 
wherein the National Carbon Philippines, Inc. appears to be the seller. However, 
this is contradicted by the statement in the stipulation of facts entered into 
by the parties, to the effect that "the calcium carbide used by the petitioner 
in the manufacture of acetylene and oxygen was purchase from a tax-exempt 
industry, the Maria Cristina Chemical Industries of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="GramE">thru</span> 
the National Carbon Philippines, Inc." <span class="GramE">In merely as an agent 
of the real seller and in that capacity issued its own receipts to cover the 
purchases.</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The proviso in Section 186 relied 
upon by appellant is intended to prevent a second assessment of the percentage 
tax on materials that go into the production of a manufactured article. Since 
the calcium carbide used by appellant had not been previously taxed because of 
the exemption admittedly granted by Republic Act No. 901 to the Maria Cristina 
Chemical Industries of the Philippines, the cost thereof cannot be allowed as a 
deduction (Tan Chiu vs. The Collector of Internal Revenue, L-15008, January 28, 
1961). And in the absence of evidence as in this case there is none that in the 
sales invoices issued by the National Carbon Philippines, Inc. the percentage 
taxes were included as part of the purchase prices paid by appellant, we cannot 
make an affirmative finding on the point. No reliance can be placed on a mere 
presumption that a "usual business practice" has been followed, the inclusion of 
such taxes as part of the prices paid by appellant being, if true, easily 
capable of positive proof. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellant next seeks refuge in 
Section 186-A of the Tax Code, which provides that "whenever a tax-free product 
is utilized in the manufacture or production of any article, in the 
determination of the value of such finished article, the value of such tax-free 
product shall be deducted." This provision does not apply to the taxes subject 
of this ca»e, because Republic Act No. 2025, which inserted Section 186-A in the 
Tax Code (and amended some other 8ections thereof), expressly states that it 
would take effect upon its approval, and it was approved only on June 22, l957, 
or after the period for which the deficiency taxes were assessed. There is 
nothing in that statute to indicate that it was meant to have retrospective 
effect. Like other statutes, tax laws operate prospectively, whether they enact, 
or repeal, unless the purpose of the legislature to give retrospective effect is 
expressly declared or may be implied from the language used (Lorenzo <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Posadas</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, G4 Phil. 353; Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue, <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. 
Filipinas <span class="SpellE">Compaña</span> de <span class="SpellE">Seguros</span> 
58 Off. <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>. No. 3, p. 460).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">With respect to <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> counterclaim, the Court of Tax Appeals, found 
that an investigating agent of the Bureau of Internal Revenue had mistakenly 
credited appellant with P364.02 as alleged overpayment of percentage taxes for 
the year 1955 and 1956. The counterclaim for this amount was properly granted by 
the Tax Court on the ground that appellant had not filed a written claim in 
order that the same might be credited to it. According to Section 309 of the Tax 
Code, before the Commissioner of Internal Revenue can exercise his authority to 
credit or refund taxes erroneously or illegally reviewed, a written claim <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> must be died with him by the taxpayer within two 
years after payment (Section 309 Tax Code). An investigating agent has no such 
authority in the first place, much less where no written claim for credit has 
been filed; and his error in crediting appellant with the amount in question 
does not place the Government in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> (Pineda vs. 
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span>, 52 Phil. 803; 
<span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span> Sugar Estate <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. Standard Alcohol Co. (Phil.), Inc.,

upon discovery thereof (<span class="SpellE">Genato</span> Commercial Corporation
