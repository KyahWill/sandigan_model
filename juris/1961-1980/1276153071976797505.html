				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.P., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>Petitioner was respondents' tenant in their four-hectares riceland in San 
Antonio, Biñan, Laguna. They filed against him a petition for ejectment on 
February 12, 1958 in the Court of Agrarian Relations. Among the grounds alleged 
was that on February 5, 1958 said tenant "made excavations by means of a 
bulldozer on a considerable portion of the land thus causing untold and serious 
injury to the property of the petitioners [respondents herein]". On March 5, 
1958 the answer was filed stating that the tenant excavated the land with the 
landowners' knowledge and consent and that the land was not damaged but 
improved. It included a counterclaim for reliquidation of harvests from 1951 to 
1957. </p>
<p>Based on the act of excavation, a prosecution for the crime of malicious 
mischief was simultaneously instituted against petitioner and the justice of the 
peace court convicted him. On appeal, the Court of First Instance of Laguna 
likewise convicted him. Appeal was further taken to the Court of Appeals and 
this was pending decision when the ejectment case was tried before the Agrarian 
Court. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dionisia Manabat-Lopez acquired the shares of her co-respondents 
and became sole owner of the land- holding. </p>
<p>On April 30, 1960 the Court of Agrarian Relations rendered judgment, thus: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered: </p>
<p>"(1) Authorizing petitioner-landholder, Dionisia Manabat-Lopez, to dispossess 
respondent-tenant, Pablo Almarinez, of the latter's landholding, consisting of a 
four-hectare riceland, situated at Barrio San Antonio, Biñan, Laguna, subject to 
the provisions of Section 22 of Republic Act No. 1199; and </p>
<p>"(2) Ordering petitioners Cresenciana Manabat-Potenciano, Dionisia 
Manabat-Lopez, Flaviana Manabat de Vera, and Hermenegildo Cariñio, jointly and 
severally to pay to respondent Pablo Almarinez the sum of three hundred 
forty-seven pesos (P347.00), with interest at 6% per annum from the date of the 
promulgation of this decision until fully paid. </p>
<p>"Without costs." </p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner has appealed before Us from this judgment and from the order of 
May 18, 1960 denying his motion for reconsideration. </p>
<p>Appellant contends that in finding he had intentionally damaged the land, the 
court <i>a quo</i> relied on his conviction for malicious mischief and not on 
the evidence adduced before it. The record, however, will show that although the 
lower court expressed in passing that despite the appeal from the decision 
convicting herein petitioner, "still the findings of fact stated therein on the 
very issues subsequently ventilated in this Court, cannot be ignored or 
disregarded," it proceeded to make an independent assessment of the evidence 
adduced in the case at bar, thus: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Independently however of said decision, we find from the evidence submitted 
before us, firstly, that the excavation of the land, by means of a bulldozer, 
was through the initiative of respondent Almarinez alone and was not known or 
consented to be beforehand by the landholders, and, secondly, said excavation 
definitely did not improve the land, but on the contrary, impaired to a certain 
degree its productive capacity." (Decision, pp. 6-7.) </p></blockquote>
<p>To show further that the lower court considered even the minute details of 
the evidence, it traced how the petitioner obtained the bulldozer which he used 
in the scrapping and excavation of the land, as can be gleaned from the 
following paragraph of the lower court's decision: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It appears from the evidence that on or about February 6, 1058, while a 
bulldozer was levelling a parcel of land belonging: to the Mereado family, 
situated on the western boundary of the land holding in question, which was 
being converted into a subdivision, respondent Pablo Almarinez approached the 
bulldozer operator and requested him to excavate, with the use of the bulldozer, 
the elevated southwestern portion of petitioners' land. The excavation resulted 
in the scrapping of about two paddies, the levelling: or removal of the 
pilapiles thereon, and the filling up of the irrigation canal separating the 
Mercado subdivision and the landholding in question. The earth scrapped by the 
bulldozer was moved to the Mercado subdivision." (Decision, pp. 3-4.) 
</p></blockquote>
<p>The lower court ruled that for the acts committed by the tenant, the latter 
could be ejected under Section 60 (f) of Republic Act 1199 which provides that 
"when the tenant <i>through negligence permits</i> serious injury to the land 
which will impair its productive capacity," the same is sufficient ground for 
his ejectment. (Italics supplied.) Obviously said section has no application in 
this case where the injury to the land was inflicted by <i>the 
tenant's</i><i>positive and deliberate act.</i> (Lao Oh Kim vs. Reyes, L-11391, 
May 14, 1958.) It is Sec. 50(b), in relation with Sec. 23, Par. 1, and Sec. 38, 
Par. 3, that governs in this case. Section 23, Par. 1, enjoins the tenant "to 
... take care of the farm . . . and other improvements entrusted to him its a 
good father of the family". Under Sec. 38, Par. 3, the tenant's duties include 
"the maintenance, repair and weeding of dikes, paddies, and irrigation canals in 
his holdings." </p>
<p>And Section 50 (b) provides that "whom the tenant violates or fails to comply 
with . . . any of the provisions of this Act," his ejectment is in order. It is 
clear that petitioner's deliberate acts against the land, specifically "the 
scrapping of about two paddies, the levelling or removal of the pilapiles 
thereon, and the filling up of the irrigation canal." are sufficient 
justification for his ejectment. (Lao Oh Kim vs. Reyes, <i>supra.</i>) </p>
<p>Petitioner presented a counterclaim nskinpr for a ralinuidation of Ihe 
harvests corresponding to the period from 1951 to 1957. Tim lower court in 
considering such counterclaim decided that the tenant was entitled under the 
Proper sharing basis to 57-1/2% of the net produce of the land tilled by him, 
and that he had received only 50% of said produce. It therefore awarded the 
tenant an additional 7-1/2% of the net produce but only corresponding to crop 
years 1956 to 1957, on the ground that respondents were not yet the landholders 
before 1955. </p>
<p>Section 9 of Republic Act 1199, on severance of relation- Ship between 
landlord and tenant, provides in its last portion, as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"....The expiration of the period of the contract as fixed by the parties, or 
the sale, alienation or transfer of legal possession of the land docs not of 
itself extinguish the relationship. In the latter case, <i>the purchaser or 
transferee shall assume the rights and obligations of the former landholder in 
relation to the tenant.</i> In case of death of the landholder, his heir or 
heirs shall likewise assume his rights and obligations." (Italics supplied.) 
</p></blockquote>
<p>We have already decided in Natividad vs. De Guzman, 111 Phil., 430, March 27, 
1961, that the tenant may proceed against the transferee of the land to enforce 
obligations incurred by the former landholder in relation to said land, for the 
reason that "such obligations . . . fall upon the assignee or transferee of the 
land" pursuant to Sec. 9 abovementioned. Since respondents arc in turn free to 
proceed against the former landholder for reimbursement, it is not iniquitous to 
hold them responsible to the tenant for said obligations. Moreover, it is the 
purpose of Republic Act 1199, particularly Sec. 9 thereof, to insure that the 
right of the tenant to receive his lawful share of the produce of the land is 
unhampered by transfers of said land from one landholder to another. </p>
<p>The evidence disclosed that for the agricultural year 1954-55 the net produce 
was 200 cavans then priced at P9.00 per cavan. The share actually received by 
petitioner was only 50% or 7-½% below his legal share of 67- ½%. He was 
therefore entitled to an additional 15 cavans valued at a total of P135.00, 
aside from the amount of P347.00 awarded by the court <i>a quo</i> under the 
reliquidation corresponding to the 1055-1957 crops. No award can be made on 
harvests before 1054 since petitioner adduced no evidence thereon. </p>
<p>WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is modified so as to raise the tenant's 
award under the reliquidation to four hundred eighty-two (P482.00) pesos, 
without prejudice to respondents' filing the proper action for reimbursement for 
the amount of one hundred thirty-five (P135.00) pesos corresponding to the 
tenant's sharp for the agricultural year 1954-5.1. In all other respects, the 
judgment is hereby affirmed, without costs. </p>
<p>SO ORDERED.</p>
