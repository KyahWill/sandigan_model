<p>As a result of the disappearance of an Oldsmobile car
      
which apparently belonged to Bulkley, Dunton Paper (Far
      
East)  Co.,  Inc.,  an  information for  qualified theft was
      
filed against Edgardo Reyes, et al.  before the Court of
      
First Instance of Quezon City  (Criminal Case No. Q-
      
4084). <br></p><p>As an aftermath, said  car was seized from  Tahimik
    
Ramirez who allegedly bought it in good faith from  Bachrach  Motor  Company  by  virtue  of  a  search  warrant
    
issued by the Municipal  Court  of Manila, presided over
    
by Judge Roman Cansino,  Jr., to Major Alfredo N. Ocampo
    
of the Special Operations Division of the Department of
    
National Defense.</p>
<p> In the meantime, Bulkley,  Dunton Paper  (Far  East)
      
Co.,  Inc., filed in the criminal case a petition praying that
      
since it is the owner  of  the stolen car and the  case has
      
already  been  decided  resulting in the conviction  of the
      
accused even if the  latter has appealed  to the Court of
      
Appeals an order be issued directing  that the car be restituted to it as owner  pursuant to Article 105 of the Revised
      
Penal  Code.</p>
<p>Ramirez  filed a written opposition claiming to  be the
        
purchaser for  value of the car under Article 559 of the
        
Civil Code and as such entitled to its possession aside from
        
the fact that the remedy sought for by petitioner is not the
        
proper one for it can secure proper relief by  filing a separate civil  action before the proper  court  wherein  its
        
ownership may be litigated. </p>
<p>The court <i>a quo</i>, after  due hearing, and after the ocular
          
inspection it had made of the car in question to determine
          
if it is the same one  siezed by virtue of the search warrant issued by Judge  Cansino, Jr. of the municipal court, on
          
November 25, 1961, issued an order ordering the restitution of the car to petitioner  Bulkley, Dunton Paper (Far
          
East)  Co., Inc.</p>
<p>In view  of the apparent  hostility of the  court <i>a  quo</i> towards Ramirez who during the hearing of the incident
            
was prevented from expressing his views in open court,
            
Ramirez  did not deem  it necessary to file  a motion  for
            
reconsideration.   Instead, he interposed the  present petition, with preliminary mandatory injunction.</p>
<p>On December 14, 1961, this Court gave due course to the petition,
giving respondent 10 days from notice within which to answer. It also
granted the writ prayed for upon petitioner's filing a bond in the
amount of P5,000.00. In issuing the writ, this Court stated: "until
further orders from the Supreme Court, you are hereby commanded to
restore or return the motor vehicle in question to petitioner Tahimik
Ramirez or to the Hon. Ramon Cansino, Jr., Judge of the Municipal Court
of Manila." </p>
<p>On December 19, 1961, in compliance with  said directive
              
Bulkley, Dunton Paper (Far  East)  Co., Inc.  chose to  deliver the stolen car to the municipal court, the same to be
              
kept there until further order from  this Court.  But on
              
December  26, 1961,  Judge  Cansino,  Jr., presiding  said
              
court directed that the  car be  delivered to Ramirez  subject to the order  of this  Court for the reason that it does
              
not have the necessary facilities for its safekeeping, aside
              
from the fact that such disposition is authorized by  the
              
very order issued by this  Court.</p>
<p>In  view of this  order, Bulkley,  Dunton  Paper  (Far
                
East, Co., Inc., filed before  this Court a motion  praying
                
that the car be returned to the Municipal Court of Manila,
                
or be placed under the custody of Major Alfredo N. Ocampo
                
who originally seized it under the warrant,  in order that
                
it may not be used or  taken  advantage of by Ramirez
                
pending  determination of this  case.  But this  Court  deferred action on the motion until after this case shall have
                
been decided on the merits.</p>
<p> The order of respondent court issued on  November  25,
                  
1961 which is now disputed by petitioner reads  as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Upon due consideration of the motion for
restitution filed by the complainant Bulkley, Dunton Paper (Far East)
Co. Inc., dated November 13, 1961, and it appearing upon ocular
inspection this morning that the car seized by Major Alfredo Ocampo by
virtue of the search warrant issued by the Hon. 'Roman Cansino Jr. of
the Municipal Court of the City of Manila, is the same car as that
which is the object of the crime in the above-entitled case, and it
appearing further that the motion is in accordance with the provisions
of Art. 105 of the Revised Penal Code;</p>
  <p> 'AS PRAYED FOR in the  motion, Major  Alfredo  N. Ocampo;
                        
Department of  National  Defense, Office  of the  Secretary,  Special
                        
Operations Group, Camp  Murphy, Quezon  City,  is hereby ordered
                        
to restore  the  motor vehicle  described  as follows:</p>
  <p> 'One (1)  Oldsmobile Model  1957,  4-door  Sedan, Motor  No.
                        
    V-200479,  Serial  No. 578M  27696,  with plate  No.  H-8108,
                        
    Manila Series of 1961.'
                        
to the complainant Bulkley, Dunton Paper  (Far  East) Co. Inc., or
                        
its duly authorized representative upon proper receipt therefor. "</p>
  <p>SO  ORDERED. </p>
  <p>"Dictated in open Court at  Quezon, this 25th  day of November,
                            
1961.</p>
  <p align="center"> (Sgd.) NICASIO YATCO<br>
  Judge</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would appear that the court <i>a quo</i> deemed it  proper
                        
to order  the restitution of the stolen  car  to the  offended
                        
party which was shown to  be Bulkley, Dunton Paper (Far
                        
East)  Co., Inc., under Article 105 of the Revised Penal Code
                        
in view of the fact that the criminal case has already been
                        
decided resulting in the conviction  of the accused.   Said
                        
article provides that  the  restitution  of the thing itself
                        
shall be made by the court  whenever possible, even though
                        
it be found  in the possession of a  third person who has
                        
acquired  it by lawful  means, saying only to the latter  the
                        
action he may have against the proper person who may
                        
be liable  to him.   The only exception  is when the thing has been acquired by a third person in a manner which
                        
bars action for its recovery.  Here there is  no claim that
                        
Ramirez falls within the exception.</p>
<p>The court <i>a quo</i> has done precisely what  it is provided
                        
for in  said  Article 105 for after deciding the criminal
                        
case convicting the accused and after satisfying itself that
                        
the offended party is the  respondent  company it ordered
                        
its  restitution subject only to  the  requirements of said
                        
article.  The fact that at  the  time the order was issued
                        
the car was under the custody  of the Municipal Court of
                        
Manila is  of no moment  considering that the car is the
                        
very subject of the case that was then being ventilated.  If
                        
the car was placed under the  custody of the Municipal
                        
Court of Manila it was merely as an incident of the search
                        
warrant issued by it in order that its possession may be
                        
retrieved and placed under the control of the authorities.
                        
But this does not deprive the court <i>a quo</i> of its jurisdiction
                        
over the car.</p>
<p>We are,  therefore, of the opinion that the Court <i>a quo</i> did  not commit  any abuse of discretion in  issuing the
                        
order in question.  As a corollary, the writ  issued by this
                        
Court should be set aside without prejudice on the part
                        
of petitioner to assert his  right of ownership in an appropriate action.</p>
<p>Wherefore, petition is denied.  The writ  issued by this
                        
Court is dissolved.  No costs.</p>
