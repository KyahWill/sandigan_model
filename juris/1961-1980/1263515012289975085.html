				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Early in the evening of October 3, 1964 the now deceased Rudy <span class="SpellE">Postrado</span> and two thirteen year old neighbors Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Ga</span>-a and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Pastera</span> went
to see a movie show at the St. Pius Institute in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Pototan</span>, Iloilo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Inside the theater while <span class="SpellE">Postrado</span> was seated
between <span class="SpellE">Ga</span>-<span class="GramE">a and</span> <span class="SpellE">Pastera</span>, three men seated immediately behind them demanded
twenty centavos from him, which he was kind enough to give them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This notwithstanding, once the show was over
and while they were on their way out of the theater, appellant Perez, who was
one of the three men who sat immediately behind them, held <span class="SpellE">Postrado</span>
by the arm and more or less forcibly dragged him towards the premises of the
Roman Catholic Church of the town, with <span class="SpellE">Postrado’s</span>
companions, appellant Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Mana</span>-ay and the other
companion of the latter who was not fully identified, following them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perez, <span class="SpellE">Mana</span>-ay and
their unidentified companion succeeded in dragging <span class="SpellE">Postrado</span>
to a place behind the church where while <span class="SpellE">Postrado's</span>
arms were held by Perez and their unidentified companion, <span class="SpellE">Mana</span>-ay
stabbed him at the back with a kitchen knife.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Perez followed suit by stabbing him with an ice pick on the left side of
the abdomen, while the third of the trio also stabbed him with a butcher’s
knife on the right side of the abdomen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After this the three ran away.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ga</span>-<span class="GramE">a and</span> <span class="SpellE">Pastera</span> reported the incident to the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Pototan</span>, but as they could not give the names of the
assailants no immediate action could be taken for their apprehension.</p>

<p class="BODY">About an hour after the assault, Dr. Felix <span class="SpellE">Catoto</span>,
a rural physician, accompanied by the municipal mayor, the Chief of Police and
several policemen went behind the church premises where they found <span class="SpellE">Postrado</span> already dead because of the two stabs and one
incised wound in­flicted upon him as above described.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two of the culprits - the appellants herein - were identified
several months later purely by accident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One clay, as <span class="SpellE">Ga</span>-<span class="GramE">a and</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pastera</span> happened to pass by the building where the
municipal jail was located they saw appellant <span class="SpellE">Mana</span>-ay
inside talking to a visitor, who turned out to be his co-appellant Perez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, <span class="SpellE">Mana</span>-ay
was in jail in connection with the killing of another person by the name of <span class="SpellE">Oris</span> <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ga</span>-<span class="GramE">a and</span> <span class="SpellE">Pastera</span> lost no time in
informing the police authorities that the person in jail and his visitor were
two of the trio who had killed <span class="SpellE">Postrado</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon the investigation regarding <span class="SpellE">Postrado's</span> death was resumed and resulted in the filing of
the corres­ponding charge for murder against them.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due trial upon a plea of not guilty, the lower court found
them guilty of murder and there being neither aggravating nor mitigating
circumstances proven, sentenced each of them "to suffer the penalty of
reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>, to indemnify, jointly and
severally, the heirs of Rudy <span class="SpellE">Postrado</span> the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for his death, and in ad­dition thereto the sum of
P7,200.00 as nominal damages for loss of earning capacity, plus moral damages
of P5,000.00 and the costs".</p>

<p class="BODY">From the above judgment both defendants appealed and urge its reversal
claiming that the trial court erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
in giving credence to the unbelievable and coached testimony of Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Ga</span>-a; (2) in finding that <span class="SpellE">Ga</span>-a
and <span class="SpellE">Pastera</span> immediately reported the killing of <span class="SpellE">Postrado</span> to the Chief of Police; and (3) in convicting both
of them.</p>

<p class="BODY">As is obvious, the two main questions raised are purely factual.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the first - the credibility of witness <span class="SpellE">Ga</span>-a, the lower court "found Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Ga</span>-<span class="GramE">a to</span> be very intelligent for
his age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He understands the nature of
his oath and of sufficient intelligence and discernment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified in a clear and satisfactory
manner, and no motive has been shown which would have impelled him to impute
the commission of such a grave felony on the accused aside from the promptings
of his conscience and of his de­sire to state the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His facial expressions, the move­ments of his
mouth and eyes, and the tone of his voice while on the stand and when answering
the questions of the defense counsel in a long, exhaustive and severe
cross-examination, fully satisfied the Court that Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Ga</span>-a
was sincere and telling the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court has no reason to doubt the veracity of the testimony of Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Ga</span>-a.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony
is worthy of full faith and credit".</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court arrived at the above conclusion <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the long and extensive cross-examination to
which <span class="SpellE">Ga</span>-<span class="GramE">a was</span> submitted by
the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course thereof,
however he remained steadfast in his narration of the facts of which he had
been an eye-witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true
that he admitted that before the trial his father and mother had reminded him
of the contents of his affidavit, this is really of little importance end
utterly insufficient to destroy his credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His admission could be reasonably construed
merely in the sense that his parents, perhaps knowing his tender age, had
occasion to remind him of the contents of his affidavit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, of course, is quite different from any
direct or indirect attempt to induce him to tell falsehoods.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the second point - chat <span class="SpellE">Ga</span>-a,
as found by the trial court, informed the Chief of Police immediately about the
commission of the crime - all We can say is that the finding is in accordance
with the evidence and particularly supported by the fact that not long after
the commission of the crime, the Municipal Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Pototan</span>,
the Chief of Police, several policemen and Dr. <span class="SpellE">Catoto</span>
arrived at the scene thereof where they found <span class="SpellE">Postrado</span>
dead.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from being in accordance
with law and the evidence, the same is hereby affirmed, with costs.</p>
