<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners have applied for a 
writ of <i>quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span></i> seeking to have 
respondents ousted as City Mayor and councilors of the City of 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Dapitan</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>; to have the respondents' appointments to said positions 
declared null and void, and have petitioners declared legally entitled to the 
post aforesaid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is undisputed that petitioner 
Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span> was elected Municipal Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> in the general elections of 1959 to hold office 
until </span><st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="12"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 31, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
With him the three other petitioners were <span class="SpellE">coetaneously</span> 
elected municipal councilors of the town. They qualified and assumed office as 
of </span><st1:date year="1960" day="1" month="1"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 1, 
1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 22, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
Republic Act No. 3811, creating the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Dapitan</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, was 
approved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="9"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 
5, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
petitioner Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span> filed his certificate of 
candidacy for the newly created office of City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span>, and his co-petitioners, while acting as municipal 
councilors, also filed certificates of candidacy for the positions of city 
councilors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="10"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 
7, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
the Secretary of Justice rendered an opinion that petitioners should be 
considered resigned from their respective municipal offices, as of the date 
their certificates of candidacy were filed; and advised that the city government 
of <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> be immediately organized. <span class="GramE">otherwise</span> the new political subdivision would not even have a 
provisional government. Thereupon, the President of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> issued a proclamation (No. 179) 
declaring </span><st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="11"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 8, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> as 
the date for the formal organization of the City of 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Dapitan</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, and appointed respondent <span class="SpellE">Germanico</span> <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span> as city mayor 
and the other three respondents as city councilors for the City of 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Dapitan</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. In the November 12, 1963 
municipal elections, <span class="SpellE">Germanico</span> <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span> and respondents <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Acaylar</span> and <span class="SpellE">Justino</span> <span class="SpellE">Saldon</span> won and were duly proclaimed, on November 27, 1963, 
City Mayor and' city councilors elect for the City of <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span>, for the terms starting on January 1, 
1964.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After the proclamation, on 
</span><st1:date year="1963" day="3" month="12"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 3, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
these <i>quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span></i> proceedings were initiated 
in this Court. On motion of petitioners, we issued a preliminary injunction; and 
pursuant thereto payment of the corresponding salaries was stopped as of the 
receipt of the Court's writ of preliminary injunction of </span><st1:date year="1963" day="6" month="12"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 6, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
until the end of that month.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners predicate their claim 
on section 86, Art. XI, of Republic Act No. 3811 (Charter of the City of 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Dapitan</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">) 
providing:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The City Government provided for 
in this Charter shall be organized upon the approval of this Act. The incumbent 
municipal mayor, vice-mayor and the members of the municipal council of the 
</span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Municipality</span></st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Dapitan</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> shall continue in office until 
the expiration of their present terms of 
office."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Respondents, upon the other hand, 
argue, in accord with the opinion of the Secretary of Justice, that the 
petitioners, were holding office as mayor and councilors of the municipality of 
<span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> when they filed certificates of candidacy for 
positions (city mayor and councilors of <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> City) 
that they were not holding at the time, and they should be considered resigned 
from the offices they were holding as of the time their said certificates were 
filed (Sept. 5, 1963), pursuant to section 27 of the Election 
Code:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Sec. 
27.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> Candidate 
holding <span class="SpellE">office.â€”Any</span> elective provincial, municipal, or 
city official running for an office, other than the one which he is actually 
holding, shall be considered resigned from his office from the moment of the 
filing of his certificate of candidacy."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The issue, therefore, hinges on 
what positions were Petitioners holding on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="9"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 5, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">; 
were they municipal or city officers on that date?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Due consideration of the terms of 
section 86 of the charter of <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> City (R.A.3811), 
previously quoted, is convincing that the petitioners were already city officers 
on 5 September 1963, because, according to said section, the city government of 
<span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> shall be organized upon approval of its 
charter (22 June 1963), and from that date it began to exist as a body 
corporate; and that its coming into being is, in turn, incompatible with the 
continued existence of the municipal government of <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span>. It needs no special argument to show that the two 
governments (</span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">municipality</span></st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Dapitan</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Dapitan</span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">), having the same territory and 
functions, could not coexist, nor is there anything in the law to indicate that 
such was the legislative intent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">If then the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> and its government ended and were superseded by 
<span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> City on the day the city charter was approved 
and became law, it is unavoidable to conclude that the petitioners then and 
there ceased to be municipal mayor and councilors of the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span>. On the other hand, the city government of <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> could not function without city officials. Hence, 
the provisions of section 86 of the <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> charter 
that "the incumbent municipal mayor, vice-mayor and the members of the municipal 
council of the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> shall continue 
in office until the expiration of their present term of office" (December 31, 
1963) <span class="SpellE">movant</span>, and can only mean, that said municipal 
officials became city mayor and councilors of <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> 
City upon approval of the city charter. They could not remain municipal mayor 
and councilors of a non-existent municipality. They could only remain in office 
as officials of the existing city of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Dapitan</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The flaw in the position of the 
respondents and in the ruling of the Secretary of Justice lay precisely in the 
failure to observe that the city of <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> became 
organized (and existing) upon the approval of its charter R.A. 8811. In 
contrast, the charter of <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> City, section 88, R. 
A. No. 170, dealt with in Mejia <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Bololong</span>, 
81 Phil. 487, expressly provided that the city government of <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> "shall be <i>organized on such a date as may be 
fixed by the President</i> of the Philippines and <i>upon the qualification of 
the City Mayor</i>" and other city officials. This fundamental difference 
between both charters renders the doctrine of Mejia vs. <span class="SpellE">Bololong</span> inapplicable to the present 
case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It follows that when the 
petitioners filed their certificates of candidacy for city mayor and councilors 
of </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Dapitan</span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, they already were such city 
mayor and councilors. They, therefore, filed their candidacy to the same and 
identical positions that they were respectively holding, and could not be 
considered resigned <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> under section 27 of the 
Election Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">PREMISES 
CONSIDERED</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the
