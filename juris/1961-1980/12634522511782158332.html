He saw Erlinda in the evening of that date.&nbsp; The two of them ate and drank at Eliza's restaurant, which was at the Iligan Supermarket, in front of which was the Laya Building.&nbsp; From the restaurant, they went to her house owned by her master, Patrolman Villondo.&nbsp; While in the house, Erlinda told him that she wanted to go with him.&nbsp; He left and Erlinda followed him to the Laya Building where he used to sleep.&nbsp; He was working there as a laborer and the building was still under construction.&nbsp; When they arrived at the Laya Building, he told Erlinda that he would go to Cagayan upon the termination of his work.&nbsp; Erlinda told him that she would go with him to Cagayan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" width="85%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">“q</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">What was your answer, if any, when she told you that she is going to Cagayan with you?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">a </div></td> <td><div align="justify">I answered, 'yes, really you love me?'<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">What was her answer, if any?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">a </div></td> <td><div align="justify">'Yes, I love you.'<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">By the way, you have stated before this Court that you are sweethearts with Erlinda, when did you become sweethearts?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">a </div></td> <td><div align="justify">While I was working at Laya building this Erlinda was selling refreshments.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Where was she selling refreshments?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">a </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Sometime she bring refreshments at Laya building.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">More or less, can you tell the Court what time when was that when your love was accepted by Erlinda?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">a </div></td> <td><div align="justify">August 2, 1968.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Did you consider that you were sweethearts, did you receive anything from her, some sort of letters or tokens?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">a </div></td> <td><div align="justify">I did not ask anything because we used to see each other and I did not ask any remembrance from her because she is poor like myself."</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>Erlinda then told appellant that she loved him.&nbsp; They slept together in a room upstairs in the Laya Building.&nbsp; In the room where they slept, there were no tenants for that particular unit of the apartment.&nbsp; But there were already electric lights inside that room.&nbsp; They slept on a bed made of plywood.&nbsp; They had two sexual intercourse, the first time from 8:00 to 9:00 o'clock p.m., and the second in the early morning.&nbsp; They had already one sexual intercourse about one week prior to November 23, 1968, also at the Laya Building.&nbsp; At that time, she was getting water.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>After a very careful review of the evidence, We affirm.&nbsp; The lower court's finding that the version of the offended party is the one that should be believed over that of the appellant.<br><br>The offended party, Erlinda, was a young provinciana, barely over 15 years of age, uncouth and almost unlettered, was a mere household helper but at the same time engaged in the selling of native bread and cakes.&nbsp; She belonged to the poor and was one of them, and was still possessed of the traditional and proverbial modesty of the Filipina, especially the provinciana.&nbsp; She would not have filed a complaint for rape and suffered the torment if not the ignominy of having to testify in a court of justice about the wrong done to her, if in truth she was not really raped.<br><br>Early in the morning of November 24, 1968, she was brought by the appellant to his father's house in Rosario Heights.&nbsp; She went with him because she was threatened with death if she would not do so.&nbsp; Patrolman Villondo was already there because he was previously informed that Erlinda failed to return to their house and that appellant was the one that brought her.&nbsp; And according to Erlinda, she did not tell Patrolman Villondo that she was raped as she was "ashamed to tell him because he is a man." And at that time, Villondo's wife was in Cebu.&nbsp; But when she arrived about six days later, she was at once informed by Erlinda that appellant raped her.<br><br>And immediately thereafter, she was brought to the medico legal officer of Iligan City, Dr. Manuel Simon, who testified that on December 2, 1968, he examined the offended party, found lacerations in her hymen, in positions 10 and 8 o'clock, which had just recently healed (a laceration heals in 7 days).&nbsp; The lacerations could not have been more than one month old "because at the edge of the lacerations, the color was reddish and therefore they have healed recently."<br><br>Physical evidence is evidence of the highest order.&nbsp; It speaks more eloquently than a hundred witnesses.&nbsp; And the physical evidence in this case strongly corroborates the testimony of the offended party that she was raped.&nbsp; They consist of the green color dress and the panty that Erlinda was wearing at the time she was raped and which show a torn portion of the left side of the dress and a torn portion of the panty.&nbsp; According to Erlinda, they were torn when appellant forcibly pulled her dress up and removed her panty shortly before she was raped.&nbsp; Surprisingly, appellant did not at all rebut the testimony of Erlinda on this point.<br><br>Francisco Bagohin, who was then also residing in the house of Patrolman and Mrs. Constancio Villondo, he being the driver of the rig owned by the latter, corroborated the testimony of the offended party, Erlinda, that Teodelita Dagondon was the one who fetched Erlinda "because the puto and bread that she is selling will all be bought by Teodelita for the next day would be her birthday."<br><br>The testimony of the appellant that he and Erlinda were sweethearts is unworthy of belief.&nbsp; Erlinda denied vehemently this testimony of the appellant and even stated that he never courted her.&nbsp; And if they were really sweethearts, Erlinda would not have filed this serious charge of rape against him.<br><br><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING,</b> the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed in its entirety with costs against the appellant.<br><br><br><i>Zaldivar, (Chairman), Fernando, Barredo, Antonio, </i>and <i>Aquino, JJ., </i>concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Art. 335, Revised Penal Code, as amended.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Judge Erlito L.
