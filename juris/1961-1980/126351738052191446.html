				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The question of power this original action for prohibition
presents is whether or not the Board of Regents of the University of the
Philippines (U.P.) may extend the tenure of a professor beyond the retirement
age by law fixed at 65 years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents answered in the negative.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners came <span style="">to </span>this
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cristino</span> <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span>
started service in U.P. on <st1:date year="1924" day="26" month="6">June 26,
 1924</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time the
present petition was filed in this Court on <st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1962</st1:date>, he was a Professor of English Language <span style="">and Literature and concurrently Head of the
University Publica­tions </span>Department.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His service had been unquestionably continuous for more than fifteen
years before he reached the age of 65 years on <st1:date year="1961" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1961</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prior thereto, on June 12, 1961, Dean (now Regent) Tomas S. <span class="SpellE">Fonacier</span> of the U.P. College of Arts and Sciences - the
imme­diate superior of Prof. <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span> having first
obtained the latter's consent, wrote U.P. President Vicente G. <span class="SpellE">Sinco</span> with the request that <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span>'
service be extended for one academic year ending April 15, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fonacier's</span> reasons
were that Prof. <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span> was <span style="">still </span>quite healthy; that he had been commissioned to write the
history of U.P. but had just finished half of it, <u>i</u>.<u>e</u>., from <span class="SpellE">U.P.'s</span> establishment to the Benton era; that he could
continue to act as Head of the University Publications until the administration
would find someone to take his place; that Dr. <span class="SpellE">Dionisia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rola</span> who would take over the courses of Prof. <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span> had been assigned to the U.P. College in <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>; and that the extension would enable the discipline
of English to adjust itself to the teaching of Prof. <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span>’
courses.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1961</st1:date>,
President <span class="SpellE">Sinco</span> favorably endorsed Dean <span class="SpellE">Fonacier's</span> request to the Board of Regents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="27" month="7">July
 27, 1961</st1:date>, said board resolved to approve the extension of Prof. <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span>' services until <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present controversy started on <st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1961</st1:date> when Auditor Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Liboro</span>, the Auditor General's representative at U.P.,
questioned the legality of the <st1:date year="1961" day="27" month="7">July
 27, 1961</st1:date> resolution of the Board of Regents just adverted to U.P.
sought reconsideration by the Auditor General.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1962</st1:date>,
Auditor General Pedro M. <span class="SpellE">Gimenez</span> affirmed the U.P.
Auditor's ruling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Auditor General,
citing Opinion 117, dated <st1:date year="1961" day="1" month="9">September 1,
 1961</st1:date>, of the Secretary of Justice, held that the Board of Regents
was without power to extend the services of U.P. professors beyond the
compulsory limit of 65 years.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) joined hands with
the Auditor General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, on <st1:date year="1962" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1962</st1:date>, GSIS wrote Prof. <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span> that his services rendered after the compulsory
retirement age were illegal; and that he (<span class="SpellE">Jamias</span>) was
not entitled to compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The GSIS
letter to Prof. <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span> concluded:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Thus, if you were paid salary for
services rendered after you became due for compulsory retirement, the same
should be refunded to the University of the Philippines; otherwise, it will be
deducted from the annuity due you under CA 186, as amended, pursuant to a
ruling of the Auditor General in a similar case and turned over to the
University of the Philippines." Prof. <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span>
sought reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>GSIS turned it
down.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then followed the directive of U.P. Auditor Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Liboro</span> that Prof. <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span>' salary
be withheld beginning with the weekly salary due on March 7, 1962.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was upon the foregoing backdrop that petitioners U.P. Board of
Regents and <span class="SpellE">Cristino</span> <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span>
came to this Court on an original petition for prohibition against respondents
Auditor General and GSIS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They seek to
stop the Auditor General and his men from withholding Prof. <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span>'
salary and to restrain GSIS from deducting any amount from his five-year lump
sum retirement annuity upon retirement on <st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="4">April 16, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
declined to issue the preliminary injunctive writ prayed for in the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">As adverted to at the start of this opinion, the core of the case
is this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>May the U.P. Board of Regents
extend the tenure of a professor beyond retirement age?</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is undisputed that
U.P. employees, including its professors, are employees of the Government.</p>

<p class="BODY">The U.P. charter entrusts the university with the duty "to
provide advanced instruction in literature, philosophy, the sciences, and arts,
and to give professional and technical training."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
This is in line with the obligation expressly imposed upon the State by the
Constitution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Intrinsically valid then is the holding <u>University</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Philippines</u>
<u>vs</u>. <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Industrial</u> <u>Relations,</u> 107 Phil.
848, 850, that U.P. performs a "legi­timate governmental function, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> is maintained by the Government,
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> declares no dividends,
and is, obviously, not a corporation created for profit but an institution of
higher education and therefore not an industrial or business
organization."</p>

<p class="BODY">As government employees, U.P. professors are com­pulsorily covered
by the Retirement Law, Commonwealth Act 186, as amended, which creates a
uniform retirement system for all members of the GSIS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not take much thought to come to this
conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The applicable retirement
law at the time Prof. <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span> reached retirement age
of 65 years on July 20, 1961 was Section 4(a), Commonwealth Act 186, as
successively amended by Republic Acts 660 (approved June 16, 1951), 1573 (approved
June 16, 1956) and 1820 (approved June 22, 1957).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 4, as amended by said Acts, then
read:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Scope</u> <u>of</u>
<u>application</u> <u>of</u> <u>System</u>. - (a) Membership in the System
shall be compulsory upon all regularly and permanently appointed employees,
including judges of the Courts of First Instance and those whose tenure of
office is fixed or limited by law; upon all teachers except only those who are
substitutes; upon all regular employees of the Philippine Tuberculosis Society,
and upon all regular officers and enlisted men of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The view that U.P. is definitely governed by Commonwealth Act
186, as amended, is not without support.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A rundown of the genealogy of the law gives this thesis a lift.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Originally, Section 4 of the law
(Commonwealth Act 186, which took effect on November 14, 1936) read:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Scope</u> <u>of</u>

shall be compulsory upon -</blockquote>

and the Govern­ment-owned or controlled business corporations; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To be noted is that in the early 1936 statute just quoted,
Congress did expressly exclude U.P. from the operation of the Retirement
Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But then Section 4(g) of the same
original law gave U.P. the option to join GSIS, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:</p>

<blockquote>"(g)<span style=""> </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <u>Provided</u>, That any provincial, city or municipal
government, or the University of the Philippines or any other corporation owned
or controlled by the Government, shall have the option of joining the System,
and if it so joins, the membership shall be compulsory upon all its permanent
and regular employees, and it shall pay its share of the contribution of three
per centum per annum of its employees' basic annual salaries or compensation, x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The option spoken of by the above-quoted provision was taken
advantage of by U.P. when it chose to participate in the GSIS.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><u>But</u> <u>as</u> <u>the</u> <u>law</u> <u>stood</u> <u>in</u>
<u>1961</u>, the provisions exempting U.P. from GSIS coverage and granting it
the option to join GSIS were eliminated by Republic Act 660 which took effect
on <st1:date year="1951" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1951</st1:date> and
succeeding acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 4(a) of
Republic Act 660 approved <st1:date year="1951" day="16" month="6">June 16,
 1951</st1:date> provided that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"(a)<span style=""> </span></span>Membership
in the System shall be compulsory upon all regularly and permanently appointed
employees, including those whose tenure of office is fixed or limited by law;
upon all teachers except only those who are substitutes; and upon all regular
officers and enlisted men of the Armed Forces of the Philippines."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It makes eminent sense to say that the deletion of the University
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
from the <u>exception</u> cannot be of de <span class="SpellE">minimis</span>
effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That omission is not elusive of
exact compre­hension either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plain
and natural impact thereof is that U.P. became covered by the System.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, the option to join or not to join
was left solely and exclusively to be exercised <span style="">by "an </span>elective official of the National Government or of a
local govern­ment that is a member of the System" – and by no other.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The ineluctable conclusion that follows is that since U.P. is not within the
limited limits of the exception, it is a compulsory member of the System.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let us now take a look at
the law decisive of the present question - the Board of Regents' power to
extend appointment of U.P. professors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It may perhaps be conducive to better analysis if we go into the history
of that law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Initially, the power to
extend service was lodged solely with the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 12(c) of Commonwealth Act 186, as amended by Republic Act
660, read as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"(c)<span style=""> </span></span>Retirement
shall be automatic and <span style="">com­pulsory </span>at
the age of sixty-five years, if he has <span style="">completed
</span>fifteen years of service, and if he has not, he shall be allowed to
continue in the service until he shall have completed fifteen years unless he
is other­wise eligible for disability retirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This clause shall not apply to members of the
judiciary and cons­titutional officers whose tenure of office is
guaranteed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon specific approval of
the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
an employee may be allowed to con­tinue to serve after the age of sixty-five
years if he possesses special qualifications and his services are needed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It shall be the duty of the employer
concerned to notify each such employee under its direction of the date of his
automatic separation from the service at least sixty days in advance
thereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">By Republic Act 728 (approved June 18, 1952) which amended
Section 12(c), that power to extend service was ex­panded to include the
President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:</p>

<blockquote>"(c)<span style=""> </span><span style="">x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Upon specific approval of the
President of the Philippines, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of<span style=""> </span>the House of Repre­sentatives, or the
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, as the case may be, an employee may be
allowed to continue to serve in the Executive, Legislative, or Judicial <span style="">B</span>ranch of the Govern­ment after the
age of sixty-five years if he pos­sesses special qualifications <span style="">and his services are </span>needed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above provision later <span style="">became
Section I2(e) because </span>Republic Act 1616 (approved <st1:date year="1957" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1957</st1:date>) added paragraphs (b) and (c) to
Section 12.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then came Republic Act 3096, effective <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1961</st1:date>, which displaced Section 12(e),
thus -</p>

<blockquote>"(e)<span style=""> </span>Retirement shall be automatic and compulsory at
the age of sixty-five years, and optional retirement at the age of sixty-three
shall be allowed with lump sum payment of present value of annuity for first
five years, and future annuity to be paid monthly, and other benefits given to
a compulsorily retired member as provided for in Republic Act Num­bered Six
hundred sixty, as amended, if he has completed fifteen years of service and if
he has not been separated from the service during the last three years of
service prior to retirement; otherwise he shall be allowed to continue in the
service until he shall have completed the required length of service unless he
is otherwise eligible for disability retirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This clause shall not apply to members of the
judiciary and consti­tutional officers whose tenure of office is guaran­teed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It shall be the duty of the employer con­cerned
to notify each such employee under its direction of the date of his automatic
separa­tion from the service at least sixty days in advance thereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not escaping notice is that the power to extend service of an
employee beyond retirement age - previously given to the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the Senate President, the Speaker, or the Chief Justice - was expressly deleted
from the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The directive that
retirement "<u>shall</u> <u>be</u> <u>automatic</u> <u>and</u> <u>compulsory</u>"
is imperative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law does not admit of
exception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Such</u> <u>was</u> <u>the</u>
<u>legal</u> <u>provision</u> <u>actually</u> <u><span style="">in</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>force</u> <u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>time</u>
<u>Prof</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Jamias</u></span> <u>reached</u> <u>65</u> <u>years</u>
<u>of</u> <u>age</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In summary, it may be said that in accordance with Republic Act
660, retirement was automatically compulsory at age 65 if the employee had
completed 15 years of service; except that upon specific approval by the
President of the Philippines, an employee might be allowed to continue to serve
after the age of 65 years if he possessed special qualifications and his
services were needed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This power given
to the Pre­sident by Republic Act 660 was granted also by Republic Act 728 to
the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Rep­resentatives and
the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>How­ever, when Republic Act 3096 (the law here applicable) took effect
on <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1961</st1:date>, <u>this</u>
<u>grant</u> <u>of</u> <u>power</u> <u>to</u> <u>extend</u> <u>the</u> <u>service</u>
<u>of</u> <u>an</u> <u>employee</u> <u>beyond</u> <u>the</u> <u>age</u> <u>of</u>
<u>65</u> <u><span style="">was</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>eliminated</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such elimi­nation operates to repeal the eliminated
provision.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no mistake as to this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both the language of the statute (Republic
Act 3096) and the express legislative intent deleted the power to grant
extension <span style="">a </span>service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>House Bill 1224 which became Republic Act
3096 specifically wrote off the power of the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and
the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to extend services of government
employees beyond the age of 65 years.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Need­less it is to deeply explore the underlying rationale of this parti­cular
amendment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The explanatory note is
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reads in part:</p>

<blockquote>"In the course of operations of the Govern­ment Service
Insurance System, it has been found that Commonwealth Act No. 186, as amended,
still requires further improvement in order that the life and retirement
insurance provided therein may be more responsive to the needs of govern­ment
employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To attain this end, the
follow­ing changes are necessary.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Taking stock of the prohibition in Republic Act 3096, the
executive department of the government made the impact of the law - which bans
extension of service after retirement age - clear to its different
agencies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was when the Office of
the Pre­sident of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
issued Memorandum Circular 30 dated <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="9">September
 15, 1961</st1:date> "enjoining against the continuance in the ser­vice of
officials and employees beyond the due date of their auto­matic and compulsory
retirement." That circular called attention to the fact that Section 12(e)
of Commonwealth Act 186, as amended by Republic Act 3096, "no longer
contains the provisions empower­ing the President of the Philippines, the
President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to continue an employee in the service in
the Executive, Legislative or Judicial Branch of the Government, as the case
may be, after reaching the automatic and compulsory retirement age of 65
years." The circular directed strict com­pliance with the last portion of
said Section 12(e) which makes it a duty on the part of the employer concerned
to notify the em­ployee of the date of his automatic separation at least 60
days in advance thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prof. <span class="SpellE">Cristino</span> <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span>
reached 65 years of age on <st1:date year="1961" day="20" month="7">July 20,

Act 3096 - enacted on <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1961</st1:date>
- was in force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No power or authority
there was <u>then</u> to extend the service of a government employee beyond 65
years of age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pro­hibition to extend is
patent and clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The retirement of
Prof. <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span> became automatic and compulsory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Board of Regents is powerless to extend
his service beyond <st1:date year="1961" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, its resolution now under consideration
is null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' trenchant claim is that the foregoing gives the
Board of Regents plenary power to deal with all aspects of service or
employment in the university.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
position is that legislative intention there is to free <span class="SpellE">U.P.'s</span>
academicians from control and interference by other bureaus and offices of the
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They aver that the board is
with power to fix con­ditions of employment "as it may deem proper."</p>

<p class="BODY">We are thus required to pit Section 6(e) of the U.P. Charter against
Section 12(e) of the Retirement Law, as amended by Republic Act 3096.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we do so, we find that the Board of
Regents' power to fix conditions of service "as it may deem proper"
is but a general statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It lacks
that illuminating specific authority to place the Board of Regents beyond the
reach of Republic Act 3096, which in letter and legislative intent proscribed
extension of service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are hard
pressed to understand how the cited provision in the U.P. charter could give
the Board of Regents power to extend where none was theretofore granted, and
given the fact that even the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
who previously had that authority was shorn of it by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Absent an express congressional direction
that the Board of Regents may so extend, we are unprepared to indulge in
unbridled expansive construction and to say that U.P. is beyond the reach of
that positive and unambiguous law, Commonwealth Act 186, as amended by Republic
Act 3096, on the retirement of government employees <u>which</u> <u>include</u>
<u>U.P.</u> <u>professors.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The cited provisions of Act 1870 (the U.P. Charter) must be
deemed restricted or limited by Commonwealth Act 186, as amended by Republic
Act 3096, which makes 65 the <u>automatic</u> and <u>compulsory</u> age for
retirement, the conditions set forth by the law being present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Board of Regents was not, by the
applicable statute, Republic Act 3096, singled out as an exception, one with
sole authority to grant extension of ser­vice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, even the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
to repeat, was <u>divested</u> of that power.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is because of this that we would rather adhere, than depart, from the
rule that courts may not introduce exceptions or conditions by construction
from con­siderations of convenience, public welfare, or for any other laudable
purpose.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This should dispose then of petitioners' contention that policy
considerations behind compulsory retirement in the government service are not
applicable to U.P. by the very nature of the conditions of the service rendered
therein - and these con­ditions are even debatable - <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>U.P. faculty members for the most part lead
sheltered, quiet lives; that owing to the leisurely pace of academic work the
faculty members normally are spared the rigors of an eight-hour day, their
duties being within their energies as a whole; that they perform their <span style="">work with like efficiency <span style="">as </span></span>before the age of 65; and
that unlike regular bureaus and offices of the government where old age
decreases efficiency by the very nature of the work, U.P. calls for special
services and qualifica­tions, not necessarily affected by age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other side of the coin, of course, is
the thought quite often expressed that no man - not even one with the learning
and wisdom of a 65-year old - is indispensable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anyway, whether or not as a rule the university professors maintain,
increase or diminish their efficiency as they reach 65 years, is a
consideration which would not give this Court a desirable approach to the
problem before us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Policy that is proper
for legislation is beyond the ambit of court powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to say that these suasions are
best addressed to Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because
courts cannot simply melt and recast a statute.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners next assert
that their theory that a retired employee may be retained in the government
beyond 65 <span style="">years
</span>of age finds support from Section 12(d) of Common­wealth Act 186, as
amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This section reads:</p>

<blockquote>"(d)<span style=""> </span>An employee separated from the service who is
receiving an annuity described under section eleven shall not be eligible again
to appointment to any appointive position or employment under any 'employer'
unless the appointing authority determines that he <span style="">is </span>pos­sessed of special
qualifications and his medical examination has been approved by the System, in
which event he shall not be entitled to payments of his annuity during the
period of his new employment:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>,
<u>however</u>, That nothing in this Act shall be so construed as to affect the
rights of the annuitant's beneficiary if the annuitant has been receiving or
had elected, and was otherwise entitled to, a reduced annuity under subsection
(a) of section eleven:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, <u>further</u>,
That upon the termination of his new appointment, the payments of the annuity
which were discontinued shall be resumed:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>And</u> <u>provided</u> <u>finally</u>, That if the annuitant's
salary in his new position is less than the annuity granted to him under this
Act, he shall be entitled to receive the difference."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To be observed <span style="">is </span>that under the above provision, an employee separated from
the service who is receiving an annuity may be eligible again to another
appointment in the government <span style="">if </span>the appointing authority determines that
he is possessed of special qualifications and his medical examination has been
approved by the GSIS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This provision of
law must be viewed in the context of other provisions of Commonwealth Act 186
and in accordance with the history of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 12(e), as we have seen, expressly exacts auto­matic and
compulsory retirement at age 65 if the conditions therein stated are met; that
while previous amendments have granted the power of extension of service of <span class="SpellE">retirable</span> employees to the four top officials of the
government, Republic <span style="">Act 3096 (the law
which </span>here governs) eliminated such power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To adopt petitioners' view then in reference
to Section 12(d) above-quoted would be to make the provisions of Section 12(e)
conflict with those of Section 12(d) of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The former would be rendered nugatory by the
latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is an effect that should be
avoided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Con­sistency in statutes is of
prime importance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All laws are presumed
to be consistent with each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
interpreting laws, courts are hidebound by the rule that theirs is to recon­cile
and to harmonize; and, if possible, to avoid inconsistency and repugnancy; to
give the laws a conjoint, not discordant, effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we said in a previous case,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
"[w<span style="">]</span>e have to take the
thought conveyed by the statute as a whole; construe the constituent parts
together; ascertain the legislative intent from the whole act; consider each
and every provision thereof in the light of the general purpose of the statute;
and <span class="SpellE">endeavour</span> to make every part effective,
harmonious, sensible."</p>

<p class="BODY">To harmonize Section 12(d) with Section 12(e) - as it stood
amended by Republic Act 3096 - <span style="">is </span>to
hold that a retired employee who is receiving annuity from the GSIS may be
reappointed to the government service <u>only</u> <u>if</u> <u>he</u> <u>has</u>
<u>not</u> <u>yet</u> <u>reached</u> <u>the</u> <u>age</u> <u>of</u> <u>65</u> <u>years</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prohibition in Section 12(e) against the
extension of the service of a <span class="SpellE">retirable</span> government
employee where the con­ditions for automatic and compulsory retirement exist is
so patent and so clear that it will not admit of any other construction that
would violate legislative intent.</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners bring in the
concept of academic freedom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
argument is that the law as we now interpret it would trench upon the academic
freedom enjoyed by the university as guaranteed by the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners refer to Section 5, Article XIV
of the Constitution, which provides that "[u]<span class="SpellE">niver­sities</span>
established by the State shall enjoy academic freedom." Petitioners
mention the concurring opinion of Justice Frank­furter, whom Justice Harlan
joins, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Sweezy</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <u>New</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Hamspshire</u></span>. 354 <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
234, 1 L. ed. 2d. 1311, 1327, 1332.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
concurring opinion quotes a passage from a report entitled "The Open
Universities in South Africa" where statement was made that academic
freedom of a university consists of four essential freedoms - "to
determine for itself on academic grounds who may teach, what may be taught, how
it shall be taught, and who may be admitted to study." Petitioners insist
that Commonwealth Act 186, as amended, would trample upon <span class="SpellE">U.P.'s</span>
freedom to decide <u>who</u> may teach.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not discern in the statute just referred to a meaning <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of <span class="SpellE">U.P.'s</span> academic
freedom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not erode the sub­stance
of the freedom in any way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be
stressed that what we are concerned with here is <u>retirement</u>, not
appointment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that the law here
involved is a reasonable regulation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is an expression by Congress of sound judgment on when an em­ployee shall,
because of age, stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose was
summed up in the explanatory note to the bill that "<u>continuance</u> <u><span style="">in</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>the</u> <u>service</u> <u>of</u> <u>those</u> <u>who</u> <u>are</u>
<u>already</u> <u>eligible</u> <u>to</u> <u><span style="">compulsory</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>retirement</u>

That law lays down the rule that at the age of 65, a person is ripe for
retirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no
discrimination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All government employees

is illuminating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was there held that
the academic freedom of a university has not been violated because the
congressional investigation into communist infiltration into the field of
education is not shown to be directed at controlling what has been taught at
the university.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pertinent is the
following passage found in said case:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The claims of academic freedom cannot be asserted unqualifiedly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The social interest it embodies is but one of
the larger set, within which the interest in national self-preservation and
enlightened and well-informed lawmaking also prominently appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When two major interests collide, as they do
in the present case, neither the one nor the other can claim a priori supremacy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is in the nature of our system of laws
that there must be demons­trable justification for an action by the Government
which endan­gers or denies the freedom guaranteed by the Constitution."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We, accordingly, hold that the constitutionally-guaranteed
academic freedom has not been here violated.</p>

<p class="NUM">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having reached the
conclusion that the Board of Regents was bereft of authority to extend Prof. <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span>' tenure for one school year, there remains for
consideration this last question:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is
Prof. <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span> to be compensated during the extended
period in which he worked?</p>

<p class="BODY">The obligation to compensate may not perhaps be fully
comprehended unless we view the case in the environment in which Prof. <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span>' service was extended.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the time Prof. <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span> reached 65
years, he <span style="">was </span>assigned a
specific job, namely, to write the history of the University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Retirement age caught him half through with
this undertaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is the
desirability of having Prof. <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span> complete this
assignment which he started. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Besides,
Prof. <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span> <span style="">was
</span>then the head of the University Publications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Retirement would create a vacuum. U.P. had
yet to find a qualified <span class="SpellE">fillup</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, also, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Dionisia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rola</span>, who was to relieve Prof. <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span>
of his teaching courses, was <span style="">still </span>assigned
to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The discipline of English had yet to adjust
itself to the teaching of the courses he handled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, Prof. <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span>
had to stay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The interests of the
students so demanded.</p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">is </span><span style="">in </span>this factual configuration that the
university authorities took it upon themselves to engage the services of Prof. <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span> until the termination of the school year, which was <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The unique and peculiar circumstances under
which Prof. <span class="SpellE">Jamias</span>' services were sought, engaged and
harnessed anew, sufficiently justified a special contract of services up to <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This the Board of Regents had authority to
do, even as it had no power to extend his original term.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The questioned resolution must be viewed in
this sense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is <span style="">thus </span>entitled to payment of his salary
up to the last named date.</p>
