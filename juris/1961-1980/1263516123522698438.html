				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In a single decision of <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="2">February
 20, 1965</st1:date> rendered by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> following joint trial of a civil case for ownership
and a land registration proceeding,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
private respondents lost their bid to establish ownership over Lots 2 and 3,
Plan Psu-129122, situate in <span class="SpellE">Dumalag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said respondents received copy of that
decision on March 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But on the same
day, herein petitioners moved to correct the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of the decision to show that the lots were located not in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Dao</st1:placename></st1:place>, but in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dumalag</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was granted in an order of March
17.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copy of that court order was
received on March 25 by aforesaid respondents who, on April 14, filed a motion
to reconsider the joint decision as thus amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On May 8, the court below denied the motion
for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copy of the order
of denial was received by private respondents on May 17.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1965</st1:date>,
private respondents filed their notice of appeal and appeal bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On May 25, they filed two separate records on
appeal: one in the civil case for ownership, and the other in the land
registration case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two records on
appeal were approved on July 7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copy of
the order of approval was received by petitioners on August 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On petitioners' motion dated August 7 - but
filed on August 9 - the court below, on September 22, ordered private
respondents to include in their record on appeal in the land registration case
"specifi­cation that this appeal is limited in scope to affect only the
lots <span class="SpellE">con­troverted</span> by them; and to incorporate
therein the order of general default, the order of the Court of July 7, 1965,
the motion of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> of August 7, (filed
August 9, 1965), and the present order of this Court."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1966</st1:date>,
petitioners moved in the Court of First Instance to dismiss the appeal for
failure to prosecute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They aver that
private respondents received the notice of the order of September 22 on Sep­tember
29, 1965, and that over three months had elapsed and nothing was done by
private respondents to redraft the record on appeal in pursuance of that
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They cite the provisions of
Section 7, Rule 41, of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1966</st1:date>,
declaring loss of juris­diction, the trial court denied the foregoing motion to
dismiss and suggested that said motion be &amp;led with the appellate court.</p>

<p class="BODY">So it is, that in a motion dated July 7, 1966 (received on July
11, 1966) petitioners pressed in the Court of Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
for the dismissal of the appeals on the grounds that they were perfected out of
time; that there was failure to prosecute the appeals; and that the records on
appeal did not comply with the rules.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Copy of this motion was sent by registered mail to private respondents'
counsel on July 7th.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On private
respondents' opposition, the Court of Appeals resolved, on <st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1966</st1:date>, to deny the motion to dismiss
the appeal. The reconsideration sought by petitioners was thwarted by said
respondent court in its order of <st1:date year="1966" day="2" month="11">November
 2, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is of interest to note that on July 13, 1966, counsel for
private respondents wrote the Clerk of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> allegedly reiterating his request that the records on
appeal be elevated to the Court of Appeals, and requesting the Clerk for a
certification that he has made "repeated personal representations and
requests" to the deputy clerk to forward said records on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that same day July 13, 1966 - the Clerk of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> issued a
certification, the text of which reads:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"This is to certify that the Records on Appeal in the
above-entitled cases [the cases herein involved] are still in this office and
will be forwarded to the Honorable Court of Appeals as soon as the required
supporting papers thereof have been finished."</p>

<p class="BODY">It was only on <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="7">July 25,
 1966</st1:date> that the records on appeal were forwarded to the Court of
Appeals where they were received on July 27.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners now come to this Court on certiorari, prohibition and
mandamus, with a prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction, to direct the
respondent Court of Appeals to dismiss the appeals and, in the interim, to
refrain from taking further action or proceeding in respect of private
respondents' appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a P1,000.00-bond, this Court issued a cease-and-desist order
on <st1:date year="1967" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case is now before us for decision on the merits.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The order of the Court of First Instance of <st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1965</st1:date> requires amendment
of the record on appeal in the land registration case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court had authority to so direct.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The amendment is substantial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, in
that order, private respondents were directed to incorporate in the record on
appeal (a) specification that the appeal is limited in scope to affect only the
lots therein <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> by them; (b) the order of
general default; (c) the order of July 7, 1965 approving the record on appeal;
(d) the motion of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> of August 7, 1965 (filed
on August 9, 1965); and (e) the lower court's order of September 22, 1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents had notice of this order
on <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since then nothing was done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not even one of the five requirements was
inserted in the record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
that private respondents' attention thereto was not called. On <st1:date year="1966" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1966</st1:date>, petitioners moved in
the Court of First Instance to dismiss the appeal for failure to pros­ecute. It
is true that, because of loss of jurisdiction, the Court of First Instance
denied that motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But these last two
events should have stirred private respondents to promptly act in the premises,
to prosecute their appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those
incidents were a warning to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
petitioners filed their motion dated <st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="7">July
 7, 1966</st1:date> before the Court of Appeals, the records on appeal still <u>had<i>
</i>not</u><i> </i><u>yet</u> <u>been</u> <u>elevated</u> to that court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only, as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>,
on <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1966</st1:date> that the
two records on appeal were forwarded to the Court of Appeals. <u>Even</u> <u>these
records</u> <u>on</u> <u>appeal</u> <u>do</u> <u>not</u> <u>show</u> <u>on</u> <u>their</u>
<u>face</u> <u>that</u> <u>they</u> <u>have</u> <u>ever</u> <u>been approved</u>
<u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>First</u> <u>Instance</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the record on appeal in the land registration case
should have been redrafted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, the
order of September 22 is a directive to private respondents to amend their
record on appeal to include therein all the matters set forth in the said
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, we repeat, was not done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that the order of September 22 did
not mention any fixed time within which the amended record on appeal should be
filed in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, by Section 7 of
Rule 41, Rules of Court, "if no time is fixed by the order" directing
the amendment, the redrafted record on appeal must be submitted "within
ten (10) days from receipt" of the order - <u>for the court's approval</u>
- "upon notice to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, in like manner
as the original draft." <u>No</u> <u>redrafted</u> <u>record</u> <u>on</u>
<u>appeal</u> <u>was</u> <u>ever presented</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In consequence, no amended record on appeal was ever approved by the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect, there is no record on
appeal to speak of in the land registration case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this score alone, the appeals should be
dismissed.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2. A rule long familiar to practitioners in this jurisdiction is
that it is the duty of the appellant to prosecute his appeal with reasonable
diligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cannot simply fold his
arms and say that ft is the duty of the Clerk of the Court of First Instance
under the provisions of Section 11, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, to transmit
the record on appeal to the appellate court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is appellant's duty to make the Clerk act and, if necessary, procure
a court order to compel him to act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
cannot idly sit by and wait till this is done.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He cannot afterwards wash his hands and say that delay in the
transmittal of the record on appeal was not his fault.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, indeed, this duty imposed upon him was
precisely to spur on the slothful.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we review the facts of this case, we find that, in reality,
delay in the transmittal of the records on appeal should not be laid at the
door of the Clerk of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record
on appeal in the land registration case is incomplete.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court's order of September 22, 196
5 addressed to private respondents requires of them the duty to complete the
incomplete record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Court
approval of the com­pleted record on appeal cannot be had anyway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, the record on appeal as originally
tendered has not been amended as directed.</p>

<p class="BODY">And then, too, the records on appeal in both cases did not comply
with the provisions of Section 10, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, which states
that "<u>upon the approval</u> of the record on appeal by the trial judge,
it shall be the duty of the clerk of the trial court to verify the correctness
of the copies of all petitions, motions, pleadings, orders and decisions
included therein, as well as the dates of filing and receipt thereof by the
parties, and to make a certificate of their correctness." Such certificate
does not appear in the records on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Oddly enough, we find a certificate of the Clerk of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> dated "25th day of July
1966."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this cer­tificate only
attests to the fact that "the <u>attached </u><span class="SpellE">document,"to</span>
wit: the records on appeal in both cases submitted to the Court of Appeals by
said Clerk had been examined by him merely "by comparing said <u>document</u>
with the copy on file in my office", and concluded with a statement that
"I have found the former to be a true copy of the latter."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This does not satisfy the requirements of
Section 10 of Rule 41.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The verification
contemplated in this section is a verification of the correctness of (1) the <u>copies
</u>of all the documents - petitions, motions, pleadings, orders and decisions
- included in the record on appeal, upon the basis of the <u>original</u>
petitions, motions, pleadings, orders and decisions as they appear in the
record of the case; and (2) the dates of filing and receipt thereof by the
parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Worse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That certification
was not made while the records on appeal were still with the lower court, and
contrary to practice does not appear at the end of the record on appeal itself
as submitted to the appellate court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was in a separate document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why?
Because, the Clerk of the Court of Appeals noted its absence, and on August 1,
1966 wrote the Clerk of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>
informing him that the lower court's approval and the clerk's certification of
correctness of the records on appeal were not with the documents forwarded to
the appellate court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This certification,
although dated 25h of July, 1966 - date of transmittal of the record on appeal
to the Court of Appeals - was nonetheless received in the Court of Appeals only
on August 12, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the lack of
certification - at the time the records were elevated - could be explained by the
fact that, as heretofore adverted to, appellants had not complied with the
order of September 22, 1965.</p>

<p class="BODY">The circumstances here present show a clear case of failure to
prosecute. Because: First.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants
(private respondents) failed, before transmittal of the records on appeal to
the Court of Appeals, to require inclusion in the records on appeal approval
thereof by the trial court and the certification of correctness exacted by
Section 10 of Rule 41. <u>Second</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondents were remiss in their duty to comply with the trial court's
order of September 22, 1965 in the land registration case requiring them to
include in their record on appeal the matters therein set forth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This order has not been obeyed up to now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The result is that there is no record on
appeal as far as that case is concerned. <u>Third</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records on appeal were not elevated to
the Court of Appeals until the lapse of a considerable length of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well to remember that between September
29, 1965 (when private respondents had notice of the order of September 22) and
<st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1966</st1:date> when the
records on appeal - defective as they are -were finally elevated to the Court
of Appeals, almost ten months had elapsed.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. But the decisive question is whether this Court should, in the
discharge of its supervisory functions, compel dismissal of the appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">By Section 3, Rule 46 of the Rules of Court, if the record on
appeal "is not received by the Court of Appeals within thirty (30) days
after the approval thereof, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> may, upon
notice to the appellant, move the court to grant an order x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> to declare the same abandoned for failure to
prosecute." Section 1, Rule 50, Rules of Court, provides that an appeal
may be dismissed by the Court of Appeals on its motion or of that of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, upon the ground of "(c) Failure of the
appellant to prosecute his appeal under Section 3 of Rule 46."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reason for this rule is not wanting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A lack of proper regard on the part of a
defeated litigant to have his case promptly sub­mitted to an appellate court
for disposal of his appeal could result in a situation where "<u>litigation
might become more intolerable than the wrongs it is intended to redress</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">It is indeed correct to say that the Rules do not impose upon the
Court of Appeals the mandatory duty to declare an appeal abandoned for failure
to prosecute.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
This brings us to the question of whether the Court of Appeals, in giving due
course to the appeals here, com­mitted such a grave abuse of discretion as
amounting to failure to perform a duty enjoined by law and calling for the
exercise of the corrective powers of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And we think it did.</p>

<p class="BODY">The negligence of private respondents in prosecuting their
appeals in these cases is palpably clear.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their failure to assist the courts of justice to dispose of these cases
with reasonable dispatch is a sufficient reason to take away from them their
right to have the alleged errors in the appealed judgment corrected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They delayed the administration of justice by
their delay in prosecuting their appeals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And this, in spite of the fact that the civil suit was commenced on <st1:date year="1951" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1951</st1:date>, and the land
registration case, on <st1:date year="1951" day="14" month="9">September 14,
 1951</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this situation, the
spirit of the Rules of Court forbids that efficacy of the administration of
justice be shackled by appellants' failure to prosecute the appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule in this respect is to be held
rigid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure of an appellant to so
prosecute must be reckoned against him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would be a travesty in the administration of justice if we are to
order now the return of the records to the lower court just to complete the
records on appeal; to procure approval of the amended record still to be
presented by private respondents in the land registration case; and thereafter
to elevate the cases once again to the appellate court for resolution of the
appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Delays in litigation have always been a bane in our judicial
system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And we have observed a growing
tendency of defeated suitors and their lawyers to disregard their duties under
the Rules of Court, in the hope that they may stall the final day of
reckoning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are the considerations
that now impel this Court to make a policy state­ment that failure to prosecute
will not be countenanced.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we conclude, we say that the attention of the Court of Appeals
was drawn by petitioners to the fact that the records on appeal are incomplete;
that the record on appeal in the land registration case has not been redrafted;
and that private respondents failed to prosecute their appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Refusal to dismiss the appeals herein, upon
the environ­mental facts, amounts to a denial of justice to <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the view we take of this case, we accordingly grant the
petition for certiorari, prohibition and mandamus herein; declare the
preliminary injunction heretofore issued by this Court final; and direct the Court
of Appeals to dismiss the appeals in Civil Case No. V-661 and Land Registration
Case No. N-50 (L.R.C. Record No. N-4778), both of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>.</p>
