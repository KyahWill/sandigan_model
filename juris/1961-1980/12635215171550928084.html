of Manila in its Civil Case No. 49705 entitled <span class="SpellE">Moy</span> <span class="SpellE">Ya</span> Lim <span class="SpellE">Yao</span>, etc. et al. vs. The
Commissioner of Immigration which, brief as it is, sufficiently depicts the
factual setting of and the fundamental issues involved in this case thus:</p>

<blockquote>"In the instant case, petitioners seek the issuance of a writ
of in­junction against the Commissioner of Immigration, 'restraining the latter
and/or his authorized representative from ordering plaintiff Lau Yuen <span class="SpellE">Yeung</span> to leave the Philippines and causing her arrest and
deportation and the confiscation of her bond, upon her failure to do so.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The prayer for preliminary in­junction embodied in the
complaint, having been denied, the case was heard on the merits and the parties
submitted their respective evidence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The facts of the case, as sub­stantially and correctly stated
by the Solicitor General are these:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-top: 0in;">'On <st1:date year="1961" day="8" month="2">February
 8, 1961</st1:date>, Lau Yuen <span class="SpellE">Yeung</span> applied for a
pass­port visa to enter the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philip­pines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as a non-immigrant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the interrogation
made in con­nection with her application for a temporary visitor's visa to
enter the Philippines, she stated that she was a Chinese residing at <span class="SpellE">Kowloon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>, and that she
desired to take a pleasure trip to the Philip­pines to visit her great (grand)
uncle Lau <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> Ping for a period of one month
(Exhibits '1', '1-a ', and '2').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
permitted to come into the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on <st1:date year="1464" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1464</st1:date> and was
permitted to stay for a period of one month which would expire on <st1:date year="1961" day="13" month="4">April 13, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the date of her ar­rival, Asher Y. Cheng
filed a bond in the amount of P1,000.00 to undertake, among others, that said
Lau Yuen <span class="SpellE">Yeung</span> would actually depart from the
Philippines or before the expiration of her authorized period of stay in this
country or within the pe­riod as in his discretion the Commissioner of
Immigration or his authorized representative might pro­perly allow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After re­peated extensions, peti­tioner Lau
Yuen <span class="SpellE">Yeung</span> was allowed to stay in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
up to <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1962</st1:date> (Exhibit
‘4’).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1962</st1:date>, she contracted marriage with <span class="SpellE">Moy</span> <span class="SpellE">Ya</span> Lim <span class="SpellE">Yao</span>
alias <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span>
Lim an alleged Filipino citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because
of the contemplated action of respondent to confis­cate her bond and order her
arrest and immediate deportation, after the ex­piration of her authorized stay,
she brought this act­ion for injunction with preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing which took place one and a
half years after her arrival, it was admitted that petitioner Lau Yuen <span class="SpellE">Yeung</span> could not write either English or <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except for <i>a </i>few<i> </i>words, she
could not speak either English or <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She could not name any Fi­lipino neighbor,
with a Filipino name except one, Rosa.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She did not know the names of her brothers-in-law, or sisters-in-law.</p>

<blockquote>"Under the facts unfolded above, the Court is of the
considered opinion, and so holds, that the instant petition for injunction
cannot be sustained for the same reasons set forth in the Order this Court,
dated March 19, 1962, the pertinent portions of which read:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'First, Section 15 of the Re­vised Naturalization Law provides:</p>

<p class="3Q">‘“<u>Effect of the natura­lization on wife and children</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Any woman who is now or may hereafter be
married to a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philip­pines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and who might her­self be lawfully naturaliz­ed shall be deemed a citi­zen of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>."</p>

<blockquote>The above-quoted provision is clear and its
import unequivocal and hence it should be held to mean what it plainly and
explicitly expresses in unmistakable terms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The clause 'who might herself be lawfully naturalized' incontestably
implies that an alien woman may be deem­ed a citizen of the Philippines by vir­tue
of her marriage to a<i> </i>Filipino citi­zen <u>only if she possesses all the
qualifications and none of the disqualifications specified in the law</u>,
because these are the explicit requisites pro­vided by law for an alien to be
natu­ralized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Lee <span class="SpellE">Suan</span>
Ay, Alberto Tan' and Lee <span class="SpellE">Chiao</span> vs. Emilio <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>, etc., G. R. No. L-11855).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, from the allegation of paragraph 3
of the com­plaint, to wit:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">‘"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That plaintiff Lau Yuen <span class="SpellE">Yeung</span>,
Chinese by birth, who might herself be lawfully natu­ralized as a Filipino
citizen (not being disqualified to be­come such by naturalization), is a
Filipino citizen by virtue of her marriage on January 25, 1962 to plaintiff MOY
YA LIM YAO alias EDILBERTO AGUINALDO LIM, under the Naturalization Laws of the
Philippines."</p>

<blockquote>it can be deduced beyond debate that
petitioner Lau Yuen <span class="SpellE">Yeung</span> while claim­ing not to be
disqualified, does not and cannot allege that she possesses all the
qualifications to be naturalized, naturally because, having been admitted as a
temporary visitor only on March 13, 1961, it is obvious at once that she lacks,
at least, the requisite length of residence in the Philippines (Revised
Naturalization Law, See. 2, Case No. 2, Sec. 3, Case No. 3).</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Were it the intention of the law that the alien woman, to be
deemed a citizen of the Philippines by virtue of mar­riage to a Filipino
citizen, need only be not disqualified under the Naturalization Law, it would
have been worded "and who herself is not dis­qualified to become a citizen
of the Philippines."</p>

<p class="2Q">'Second, Lau Yuen <span class="SpellE">Yeung</span>, a temporary
Chinese woman visi­tor, whose authorized stay in the Philippines, after repeat­ed
extensions thereof, was to expire last February 28, 1962, having married her
co-plain­tiff only on January 25, 1962, or just a little over one month before
the expiry date of her stay, it is evident that said marriage was effect­ed
merely for convenience to defeat or avoid her then impending compulsory
departure, not to say deportation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
cannot be permitted.</p>

<p class="2Q">'Third, as the Solicitor General has well stated:</p>

<p class="3Q" style="margin-left: 1.5in; text-indent: -0.3in;">'"5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That petitioner Lau Yuen <span class="SpellE">Yeung</span>,
having been admitted as a temporary alien visitor on the strength of a
deliberate and voluntary representation that she will enter and stay only for a
period of one month and thereby secured a visa, cannot go back on her
representation to stay permanently with­out first departing from the
Philippines as she had promised." (Chung <span class="SpellE">Tiao</span>
Bing, et al. vs. Commissioner of Immigra­tion, G. R. No. L-9966, <st1:date year="1956" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1956</st1:date>; <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Se <span class="SpellE">Lun</span> vs. Board of Com­missioners,
G. R. No. L­6017, <st1:date year="1954" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1954</st1:date>;
Sec. 9, last par., Phil. Immigration Law).</p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">The <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
argument of the Solicitor General is well but­tressed, not only by the decided
cases of the Supreme Court on the point mentioned above, but also on the very
provisions of Section 9, sub-paragraph (g) of the Phi­lippine Immigration Act
of 1940 which reads:</p>

<p class="3Q">‘"An alien who is ad­mitted as a non-immigrant cannot remain
in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Phi­lippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
permanently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To obtain permanent
admission, a non-immigrant alien must depart voluntarily to some foreign
country and procure from the appropriate Philippine Consul the proper visa and
thereafter undergo examination by the Officers of the Bureau of Immigration at
a Philippine port of entry for de­termination of his admis­sibility in
accordance with the requirements of this Act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(This paragraph is added by Republic Act 503).'" (Sec. 9,
subparagraph (g) of the Philip­pine Immigration Act of 1940).</p>

<p class="2Q">'And fourth, respondent Com­missioner of Immigration is charged
with the administration of all laws relating to immigra­tion (Sec. 3, Com. Act
No. 613) and in the performance of his duties in relation to alien im­migrants,
the law gives the Commissioner of Immigration a wide discretion, a quasi-judi­cial
function in determining cases presented to him (Pedro <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
So vs. Commissioner of Immi­gration CA-G. R. No. 23336-R, <st1:date year="1960" day="15" month="12">Dec. 15, 1960</st1:date>), so that his de­cision thereon
may not be disturbed unless he acted with abuse of discretion or in ex­cess of
his jurisdiction.'</p>

<blockquote>"It may also be not amiss to state that wife Lau Yuen <span class="SpellE">Yeung</span>, while she barely and insufficiently talk in broken <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span> and English, she admitted that she cannot write
either language."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The only matter of fact not clearly passed upon by His Ho­nor
which could have some bearing in the resolution of this appeal is the
allegation in the brief of petitioners-appellants, not denied in the
government's brief, that "in the hearing ….., it was shown thru the testimony
of the plaintiff Lau Yuen <span class="SpellE">Yeung</span> that she does not
possess any of the disqualifications for naturalization." Of course, as an
additional somehow relevant factual matter, it is also emphasized by said
appellants that during the hearing in the lower court, held almost ten months
after the alleged marriage of petitioners, "Lau Yuen <span class="SpellE">Yeung</span>
was already carrying in her womb for seven months a child by her husband."</p>

<p class="BODY">We need not discuss these assigned errors separately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect, the above-decision upheld the two
main grounds of objection of the Solicitor General to the petition in the court
below, <span class="SpellE">viz</span>:</p>

<blockquote>“That petitioner Lau Yuen <span class="SpellE">Yeung</span>, having
been admitted as a temporary alien visitor on the strength of a deliberate and
voluntary representation that she will enter and stay only for a period of one
month and thereby secured a visa, cannot go back on her representation to stay
permanently without first departing from the Philippines as she had promised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Chung <span class="SpellE">Tiao</span> Bing,
et al., vs. Commissioner of Immigration, G. R. No. L-9966, <st1:date year="1956" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1956</st1:date>; <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>

<blockquote>"That the mere marriage of a Fi­lipino citizen to an alien
does not automatically confer on the latter Philippine citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alien wife must possess all the qualifi­cations
required by law to become a Filipino citizen by naturalization and none of the
disqualifications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Lee <span class="SpellE">Suan</span> Ay, Alberto Tan and Lee <span class="SpellE">Chiao</span>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It is obvious from the mature of these
objections that their proper resolution would necessarily cover all the points
raised in appellants' assignments of error, hence, We will base our discussions,
more or less, on said objections.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The first objection of the Solicitor General which co­vers the
matters dealt with in appellants' second and fourth assignments of error does
not require any lengthy discussion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
matter of fact, it seems evident that the Solicitor General's pose that an
alien who has been admit­ted into the Philippines as a non-immigrant cannot
remain here permanently unless he voluntarily leaves the country first and goes
to a foreign country to secure thereat from the appropriate Philippine consul
the proper visa and thereafter undergo examination by officers of the Bureau of
Immigration at a Philippine port of entry for determination of his
admissibility in accordance with the requirements of the Philippine Immigration
Act of 1940, as amended by Re­public Act 503, is premised on the assumption
that peti­tioner Lau Yuen <span class="SpellE">Yeung</span> is not a Filipino
citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We note the same line of
reasoning in the appealed decision of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, it is but safe to assume that
were the Solicitor General and His Honor of the view that said petitioner had
become <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u> a Filipina by virtue of her marriage to her
Filipino husband, they would have held her as entitled to assume the status of
a permanent resident without having to depart as required of aliens by Section
9 (g) of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, to set this point at rest, We hereby hold that that
portion of Section 9 (g) of the Immigration Act providing:</p>

<blockquote>"An alien who is admitted as a non-immigrant cannot remain in
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
permanently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To obtain permanent
admission, a non-immigrant alien must depart voluntarily to some foreign
country and procure from the appropriate Philippine consul the proper visa and
thereafter undergo examination by the officers of the Bureau of Immigration at
a Philippine port of entry for deter­mination of his admissibility in
accordance with the requirements of this Act."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">does not apply to aliens who after coming
into the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philip­pines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as temporary visitors, legitimately become Filipino citizens or acquire
Filipino citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such change of
nationality naturally bestows upon them the right to stay in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
permanently or not, as they may choose, and if they elect to reside here, the
immigration autho­rities may neither deport them nor confiscate their
bonds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True it is that this Court has
vehemently expressed dis­approval of convenient ruses employed by aliens to con­vert
their status from temporary visitors to permanent residents in circumvention of
the procedure prescribed by the legal provision already mentioned, such as in <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiao</span> Bing vs. Commissioner
of Immigration, 99 Phil. 1020, wherein, thru Mr. Justice J. B. L. Reyes, the
Court reiterating the ruling in <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Se <span class="SpellE">Lun</span> vs. Board of Immigration Commissioners, 95 Phil. 785, said:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> It
is clear that if an alien gains admission to the Islands on the strength of a
deliberate and voluntary representation that he will enter only for a limited
time, and thereby secures the benefit of a temporary visa, the law will not
allow him subsequently to go back on his representation and stay permanently,
without first departing from the Philippines as he had promised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No officer can relieve him of the departure
requirements of section 9 of the Immigration Act, under the guise of 'change'
or 'cor­rection', for the law makes no distinctions, and no officer is above
the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any other ruling would, as
stated in our previous decision, encourage aliens to enter the Is­lands on
false pretences; every alien so permitted to enter for a limited time, might
then claim a right to permanent admission, how­ever flimsy such claim should
be, and thereby compel our government to spend time, money and effort to
examining and verifying whether or not every such alien really has a right to
take up permanent residence here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
meanwhile, the alien would be able to prolong his stay and evade his return to
the port whence he came, contrary to what he promised to do when he
entered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The damages inherent in such
ruling are self-evident."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, however, We cannot see any rea­son why an
alien who has been here as a temporary visi­tor but who has in the meanwhile
become a Filipino should be required to still leave the Philippines for a
foreign country, only to apply thereat for a re-entry here and undergo the
process of showing that he is entitled to come back, when after all, such right
has become <span class="SpellE">incon­testible</span> as a necessary concomitant
of his assumption of our nationality by whatever legal means this has been
conferred upon him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consider, for example,
precisely the case of the minor children of an alien who is naturalized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is indubitable that they become <u>ipso</u>
<u>facto</u> citizens of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Could it be the law that before they can be
allowed permanent residence, they still have to be taken abroad so that they
may be processed to determine whether or not they have a right to have perma­nent
residence here?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The difficulties and
hardships which such a requirement entails and its seeming unreasonable­ness
argue against such a rather absurd construction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In­deed, as early as 1957, in Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha v. <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>, 101 Phil. 459,
Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, our present Chief Justice,
already ruled thus:</p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> (P)<span class="SpellE">etitioners</span> allege that, upon her marriage to a Filipino, Ly
<span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha became also a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, if this conclu­sion were correct, it
would follow that, in consequence of her marriage, she had been naturalized as
such ci­tizen, and, hence the decision ap­pealed from would have to be
affirmed, for section 40(c) of Commonwealth Act 613 provides that 'in the event
of the naturalization as a Philippine citizen x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> of the alien on whose behalf the bond deposit is given, <u>the
bond shall be cancelled or the sum deposited shall be re­turned to the
depositor or his le­gal representative</u>.'" (At. pp. 462­-463)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In other words, the applicable statute
itself more than implies that the naturalization of an alien visitor as a
Philippine citizen logically produces the effect of conferring upon him <u>ipso</u>
<u>facto</u> all the rights of citizenship including that of being entitled to
permanently stay in the Philippines outside the orbit of authority of the
Commissioner of Immigration <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> aliens, if only
because by its very nature and express provisions, the Immigration Law is a law
only for aliens and is inapplicable to citizens of the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the sense thus discussed, therefore,
appellants' second and fourth assignments of error are well taken.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Precisely, the second objection of the Solicitor Ge­neral sustained
by the trial judge is that appellant Lau Yuen <span class="SpellE">Yeung's</span>
marriage to appellant <span class="SpellE">Moya</span> Lim <span class="SpellE">Yao</span>
<u>alias</u> <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span>
whose Filipino citizenship is not de­nied did not have the effect of making her
a Filipino, since it has not been shown that she "might herself be
lawfully naturalized", it appearing clearly in the re­cord that she does
not possess all the qualifications required of applicants for naturalization by
the Revised Naturalization Law, Commonwealth Act 473, even if she has proven
that she does not suffer from any of the disqualifications <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the Solicitor Gene­ral
implicitly concedes that had it been established in the proceedings below that
appellant Lau Yuen <span class="SpellE">Yeung</span> pos­sesses all the
qualifications required by the law of applicants for naturalization, she would
have been recognized by the respondent as a Filipino citizen in the instant
case, without requiring her to submit to the usual proceedings for
naturalization.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, this position of the Solicitor General is in accord

Sanchez, this Court held that for an alien woman who marries a Filipino to be
deemed a Filipina, she has to apply for naturalization in accordance with the
procedure prescribed by the Revised Naturaliza­tion Law and prove in said
naturalization proceeding not only that she has all the qualifications and none
of the disqualifications provided in the law but also that she has complied
with all the formalities required thereby like any other applicant for
naturalization,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

one almost identical to the one at bar.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha, a woman of Chinese nationality,
was a temporary visitor here whose authority to stay was to expire on <st1:date year="1956" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1956</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She filed a bond to guaranty her timely depar­ture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1956" day="8" month="3">March
 8, 1956</st1:date>, eight days before the expira­tion of her authority to
stay, she married a Filipino by the name of <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lacasta</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
March 9, 1956,her husband notified the Commissioner of Immigration of said
marriage and, contending that his wife had become a Fi­lipina by reason of said
marriage, demanded for the cancellation of her bond, but instead of acceding to
such request, the Commissioner required her to leave, and u­pon her failure to
do so, on March 16, 1956, the Commis­sioner confiscated her bond; a suit was
filed for the recovery of the bond; the lower court sustained her con­tention
that she had no obligation to leave because she had become Filipina by marriage,
hence her bond should be returned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Commissioner appealed to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the said appeal, Mr. Justice Roberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, our
present Chief Justice, spoke for the Court, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The next and most important ques­tion for determination is
whether her marriage to a Filipino justified or, at least, excused the
aforesaid fai­lure of Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha to depart from the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on or before <st1:date year="1956" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1956</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In maintaining the affirmative view,
petitioners alleged that, upon her marriage to a Filipino, Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha became, also, a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, if this con­clusion were correct, it
would follow that, in consequence of her marriage, she had been naturalized as
such citizen, and, hence, the decision appealed from would have to be affirmed,
for section 40 (c) of Com­monwealth Act No. 613 provides that 'in the event of
the natura­lization as a Philippine citizen x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> of the alien on whose behalf the bond deposit is given, <u>the
bond shall be cancelled or the sum deposited shall be returned</u> to the
depositor or his legal repre­sentative.” Thus the issue boils down to whether
an alien female who marries a male citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
follows <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u> his political status.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The pertinent part of section 15 of Commonwealth Act No. 473,

specially considering that the decision cited and footnoted several opinions of
the Secretary of Justice, the immediate superior of the Commissioner of
Immigration, the most important of which are the following:</p>

<blockquote>"Paragraph (a), section 13 of Act No. 2927, as amended, (now
section 15, Commonwealth Act No. 473), pro­vided that 'any woman who is now or
hereafter be married to a citizen of the Philippines, and who might her­self be
lawfully naturalized shall be deemed a citizen of the Philippines.' A similar
provision in the naturalization law of the United States has been construed as
not re­quiring the woman to have the qualifications of residence, good charac­ter,
etc., as in the case<i> </i>of natura­lization by judicial proceedings, but
merely that she is of the race of persons who may be naturalized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Kelly v. Owen [Dist. Col. 1868] 7 Wall 496,
57, 11, 12; ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> <span class="SpellE">Tryason</span>
[D. C. Wash. 1914] 215 F. 449, 27 Op. Atty. Gen. 507).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Op. No. 168 s.<i> </i>1940 of Justice Sec.
Jose <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In a previous opinion rendered for your Office, I stated that
the clause 'who might herself be lawful­ly naturalized', should be construed as
not requiring the woman to have the qualifications of residence, good
character, etc., as in cases of naturalization by judicial proceedings, <u>but
merely that she is of the race of persons who may be natura­lized</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Op. No. 79, s. 1940)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Inasmuch as the race qualifica­tion has been removed by the
Revised Naturalization Law, it results that any woman who married a citizen of
the Philippines prior to or after June 17, 1939, and the marriage not having
been dissolved, and on the assumption that she possesses none of the
disqualifications mentioned in Section 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, follows
the citizenship of her husband." (Op. No. 176, s. 1940 of Justice Sec.
Jose <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"From the foregoing narration of facts, it would seem that the
only material point of inquiry is as to the citizenship of <span class="SpellE">Arce</span>
<span class="SpellE">Machura</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he
shall be found to be a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
his wife, Mrs. Lily James <span class="SpellE">Machura</span>, shall likewise be
deemed a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
pursuant to the provision of Section 15, Commonwealth Act No. 473, which reads
in part as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Any woman who is now or may hereafter be married to a citizen of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and who might herself be law­fully naturalized shall be deemed a citizen of the
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Phi­lippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.'</p>

<blockquote>"The phrase 'who might herself be lawfully naturalized', as
contained in the above provision, means that the woman who is married to a
Filipi­no citizen must not belong to any of the disqualified classes enumerated
in Section 4 of the Naturalization Law (Ops., Sec. of Jus., No. 28, s. 1950;
No. 43 s. 1948; No. 95, s. 1941; Nos. 79 and 168, s. 1940).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Un­der the facts stated in the within papers,
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Machura</span> does not appear to be among the
disqualified classes mentioned in the law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It having been shown that <span class="SpellE">Arce</span> <span class="SpellE">Machura</span> or <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Guevara was
born as an illegitimate of a Filipino mother, he should be considered as a
citizen of the Philippines in conso­nance with the well-settled rule that an
illegitimate child follows the ci­tizenship of his only legally recog­nized
parent, the mother (Op., Sec. of Just., Nos. 5b, 98 &amp; 281, s. 1948; No. 96,
s. 1949).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her husband be­ing a Filipino,
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Machura</span> must necessarily be deemed as a citizen
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
by marriage (Sec. 15, Com. Act No. 473).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Op. No. 52, s. 1950 of Justice Sec. Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Nepomuceno</span>.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The logic and authority of these opinions, compel­ling as they
are, must have so appealed to this Court that five days later, on <st1:date year="1957" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1957</st1:date>, in Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Cua</span> v. The Board of Commissioners, 101 Phil. 521, Mr. Just­ice
J. B. L. Reyes, reiterated the same ruling on the basis of the following facts:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Tjioe</span> Wu <span class="SpellE">Suan</span>,
an Indonesian, arrived in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> on

turned out that her passport was forged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1953" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1953</st1:date>,
a warrant was issued for her arrest for purposes of deportation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later on <st1:date year="1953" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1953</st1:date>, she married Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Cua</span>, a Filipino, and because of said marriage, the Board of
Special In­quiry considered her a Filipina.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon a review of the case, however, the Board of Immigration
Commissioners insisted on continuing with the deportation proceedings and so,
the husband filed prohibition and mandamus proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court denied the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Al­though this Court affirmed said decision,
it held, on the other hand, that:</p>

<blockquote>"Granting the validity of mar­riage, this Court has ruled in
the recent case of Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha v. <span class="SpellE">Ga­lang</span>,
<u>supra</u>, p. 459, that the bare fact of a valid marriage to a citi­zen does
not suffice to confer his citizenship upon the wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sec­tion 15 of the Naturalization Law
requires that the alien woman who marries a Filipino must show, in addition,
that she 'might herself be lawfully naturalized' as a Fili­pino citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As construed in the decision cited, <u>this
last condition requires proof that the woman who married a Filipino is herself
not disqualified under section 4 of the Naturalization Law</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"No such evidence appearing on record, the claim of assumption
of Filipino citizenship by <span class="SpellE">Tjioe</span> Wu <span class="SpellE">Suan</span>, upon her marriage to petitioner, is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court, therefore, committed no
error in refusing to interfere with the deportation proceedings, where she can
anyway establish the requisites indispensable for her acquisition of Filipino
citizenship, as well as the alleged validity of her Indonesian passport."

Commissioners, G. R. No. L-9997, May 1957, 101 Phil. 521, 523.) [Underscoring
supplied]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">For emphasis, it is reiterated that in the above two cases, this
Court expressly gave the parties concerned opportunity to prove the fact that
they were not suffering from any of the disqualifications of the law without
the need of undergoing any judicial naturalization proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be stated, therefore, that, according to
the above decisions, the law in this country, on the matter of the effect of
marriage of an alien woman to a Filipino is that she thereby becomes a
Filipina, if it can be proven that at the time of such marriage, she does not
possess any of the disqualifications enumerated in Section 4 of the
Naturalization Law, without the need of submitting to any naturalization
proceedings under said law.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be admitted that both of the above decisions made no
reference to qualifications, that is, as to whether or not they need also to be
proved, but, in any event, it is a fact that the Secretary of Justice
understood them to mean that such qualifications need not be possessed nor
proven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then Secre­tary of Justice Jesus

foreign wife unless she "her­self may be lawfully naturalized"' and,
quoting several earlier opi­nions of the Secretary of Justice, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No. 52, s. 1950; No. 168, s. 1940; No. 95, s.
1941; No. 63, s. 1948; No. 28, s. 1950, 'this limitation of section 15 excludes
from the benefits of naturaliza­tion by marriage, those disquali­fied from
being naturalized as citizens of the Philippines under section 4 of said
Commonwealth Act No. 473." (Op. 134, s. 1962 of Justice <span class="SpellE">Undersec</span>. <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Gatmai­tan</span>.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It was not until more than two years later that, in one respect,
the above construction of the law was import­antly modified by this Court in
Lee <span class="SpellE">Suan</span> Ay, <u>supra</u>, in which the facts were as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Upon expiration of the appel­lant Lee <span class="SpellE">Suan</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ay's</span> authorized pe­riod of temporary stay in the
Philippines (25 March 1955), on 26 March 1955 the Commissioner of Immigration
asked the bonds­man to present her to the Bureau of Immigration within 24 hours
from receipt of notice, otherwise the bond will be confiscated (An­nex 1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For failure of the bonds­man to comply with
the foregoing order, on 1 April 1955 the Commissioner of Immigration ordered
the cash bond confiscated (Annex E).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, there was an order is­sued by the Commissioner of Immi­gration
confiscating or forfeit­ing the cash bond.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unlike in forfeiture of bail bonds in crimi­nal proceedings, where the
Court must enter an order forfeiting the bail bond and the bondsman must be
given an opportunity to present his principal or give a satisfac­tory reason
for his inability to do so, before final judgment may be entered against the
bondsman, (section 15, Rule 110; U. S. v. <span class="SpellE">Bonoan</span>, 22
Phil. 1.) in forfeiture of bonds posted for the temporary stay of an alien in
the Philip­pines, no court proceeding is ne­cessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once a breach of the terms and conditions of
the under­taking in the bond is committed, the Commissioner of Immigration may,
under the terms and conditions thereof, declare it forfeited in favor of the
Government." (In the meanwhile, on April 1, 1955, Lee <span class="SpellE">Suan</span>
Ay and Alberto Tan, a Fili­pino, were joined in marriage by the Justice of the
Peace of Las <span class="SpellE">Piñas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Sabino</span>
Padilla speaking for a unanimous court which included Justices <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> and Reyes who had pen­ned Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span>
Ha and Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Cua</span>, ruled thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The fact that Lee <span class="SpellE">Suan</span> Ay (a
Chinese) was married to a Filipino citizen does not relieve the bonds­man from
his liability on the bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The marriage
took place on 1 April 1955, and the violation of the terms and conditions of
the under­taking in the bond - failure to depart from the Philippines upon
expiration of her authorized period of temporary stay in the Philip­pines (25
March 1955) and failure to report to the Commissioner of Immigration within 24
hours from receipt of notice - were committed before the marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the marriage of a Filipino citizen
to an alien does not automatically confer Philippine citizenship upon the
latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She must possess the qualifications
required by law to become a Filipino citizen by naturalization.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">#</span></span></span></a> There is no showing that the appellant Lee <span class="SpellE">Suan</span> Ay pos­sesses all the qualifications and none of the
disqualifications pro­vided for by law to become a Fili­pino citizen by
naturalization."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pertinently to be noted at once in this ruling, which, to be
sure, is the one relied upon in the appealed decision now before Us, is the
fact that the footnote of the statement therein that the alien wife "must
possess the qualifications required by law to be­come a Filipino citizen by
naturalization" makes refer­ence to Section 15, Commonwealth Act 473 and
precisely, also to Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha v. <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>,
<u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As will be recall­ed, on
the other hand, in the opinions of the Secretary of Justice explicitly adopted
by the Court in Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha, among them, Opinion No.
176, Series of 1940, above-quot­ed, it was clearly held that "(I)n a
previous opinion rendered for your Office, I stated that the clause 'who might
herself be lawfully naturalized', should be cons­trued as not requiring the
woman to have the qualifications of residence, good character, etc., as in
cases of naturalization by judicial proceedings, <u>but merely that she is of
the race of persons who may be natura­lized</u>." (Op. No. 79, s. 1940)</p>

<p class="BODY">Since Justice Padilla gave no reason at all for the obviously
significant modification of the construction of the law, it could be said that
there was need for clarification of the seemingly new posture of the
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The occasion for such
clarification should have been in <span class="SpellE">Kua</span> <span class="SpellE">Suy</span> etc., et al. vs. The Commissioner of Im­migration, G.
R. No. L-13790, October 31, 1963, penned by Mr. Justice J. B. L. Reyes, who had
rendered the opinion in Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Cua</span>, <u>supra</u>,
which followed that in Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha, <u>supra</u>, but
apparently seeing no immediate rele­vancy in the case on hand then of the
particular point in issue now, since it was not squarely raised therein
similarly as in Lee <span class="SpellE">Suan</span> Ay, hence, anything said on
the said matter would at best be no more than <u>obiter</u> <u>dictum</u>,
Justice Reyes limited himself to holding that "Under Section 15 of the
Naturalization Act, the wife is deemed a citizen of the Philippines only if she
'might herself be lawfully naturalized', so that the fact of marriage to a
citizen, by itself alone, does not suffice to confer citizenship, as this Court
has previously ruled in Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha v. <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>, 54 O. G. 356, and in <span class="SpellE">Cua</span>
v. Board of Immigration Commissioners, 53 O. G. 8567; and there is here no
evidence of record as to the qualifications or absence of disqualifications of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Kua</span> <span class="SpellE">Suy</span>",
with­out explaining the apparent departure already pointed out from Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha and Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Cua</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>
who wrote a separate concurring and dissenting opinion merely lumped together
Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Cua</span> and
Lee <span class="SpellE">Suan</span> Ay and opined that both qualifications and
non-dis­qualifications have to be shown without elucidating on what seemed to
be departure from the said first two deci­sions.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was only on <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="11">November
 30, 1963</st1:date> that to Mr. Just­ice Roberto <span class="SpellE">Regala</span>
fell the task of rationalizing the Court's position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Lo San <span class="SpellE">Tuang</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>, G. R. No. L-18775, November 30, 1963, 9 SCRA 638,
the facts were simply these:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lo San <span class="SpellE">Tuang</span>, a Chinese woman, arrived in the Philippines on July
1, 1960 as a temporary visitor with authority to stay up to June 30, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She married a Filipino on January 7, 1961,
almost six months before the expiry date of her permit, and when she was
request­ed to leave after her authority to stay had expired, she refused to do
so, claiming she had become a Filipina by marriage, and to bolster her
position, she submitted an affidavit stating explicitly that she does not
possess any of the disqualifications enumerated in the Naturali­zation Law,
Commonwealth Act 473.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the case
reached the court, the trial judge held for the government that in addition to
not having any of the disqualifications referred to, there was need that Lo San
<span class="SpellE">Tuang</span> should have also possessed all the
qualifications of residence, moral character, knowledge of a native principal
dialect, etc., provided by the law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Recognizing that the issue squarely to be passed upon was whether or not
the posses­sion of all the qualifications were indeed needed to be shown apart
from non-disqualification, Justice <span class="SpellE">Regala</span> held
affirmatively for the Court, reasoning out thus:</p>

<blockquote>"It is to be noted that the peti­tioner has anchored her claim
for citizenship on the basis of the de­cision laid down in the case of Leo­nard
v. Grant, 5 <span class="SpellE">Swy</span>. 603, 5 F 11, where the Circuit Court
of Oregon, held that it was only necessary that the woman 'should be a person
of the class or, race permitted to be naturalized by existing laws, and that in
respect of the qualifications arising out of her conduct or opinions, being the
wife of a citizen, she is to be regarded as qualified for citizenship, and
therefore considered a citizen.' (In explanation of its conclusion, the Court
said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'If, whenever dur­ing the life of
the woman or after­wards, the question of her citizen­ship arises in a legal
proceeding, the party asserting her citizenship by reason of her marriage with
a citizen must not only prove such marriage, but also that the woman then
possessed all the further qua­lifications necessary to her becom­ing
naturalized under existing laws, the statute will be practically nugatory, if
not a delusion and a snare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proof of
the facts may have existed at the time of the marriage, but years after, when a
controversy arises upon the sub­ject, it may be lost or difficult to find.')</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In other words, all that she was required to prove was that
she was a free white woman or a woman of African descent or nativity, in order
to be deemed an American ci­tizen, because, with respect to the rest of the
qualifications on resi­dence, moral character, etc., she was presumed to be
qualified.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Like the law in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, our former Naturalization Law (Act
No. 2927, as amended by Act No. 3448) specified the classes of persons who
alone might become citizens of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
even as it provided who were disqualified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the pertinent provisions of that law provided:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Section 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Who may
become Philippine citizens</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-
Philippine citizenship may be acquired by (a) natives of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>

<blockquote>"Applying the interpretation given by Leonard v. Grant, <u>supra</u>,
to our law as it then stood, alien women married to citizens of the Philippines
must, in order to be deemed citizens of the Philippines, be either (1) natives
of the Philippines who were not citizens thereof under the Jones Law, or (2)
natives of other Insular possessions of the United States, or (3) citizens of
the United States or foreigners who under the laws of the United States might
become citizens of that country if residing therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the qualifications set forth
in Section 3 of the former law, they were deemed to have the same for all
intents and purposes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But, with the approval of the Re­vised Naturalization Law
(Commonwealth Act No. 473) on June 17, 1939, Cong­ress has since discarded
class or ra­cial consideration from the qualifica­tions of applicants for
naturalization (according to its proponent, the pur­pose in eliminating this
consideration was, first, to remove the features of the existing naturalization
act which discriminated in favor of the Cauca­sians and against <span class="SpellE">Asiatics</span> who are our neighbors, and are related to us by
racial affinity and, second, to fos­ter amity with all nations [<span class="SpellE">Sinco</span>, Phil. Political Law 502 - 11 ed.]), even as it
retained in Section 15 the phrase in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The result is that the phrase 'who might herself be lawfully
naturalized' must be understood in the context in which it is now found, in a
setting so different from that in which it was found by the Court in Leonard v.
Grant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The only logical deduction from the elimination of class or
racial con­sideration is that, as the Solicitor General points out, the phrase
'who might herself be lawfully naturalized' must now be understood as referring
to those who under Section 2 of the law are qualified to become citizens of the
Philippines.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is simply no support for the view that the phrase 'who
might herself be lawfully naturalized' must now be understood as requiring
merely that the alien woman must not belong to the class of disqualified
persons under Section 4 of the Revised Naturalization Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a proposition misreads the ru­ling laid
down in Leonard v. Grant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A person who
is not disqualified is not necessarily qualified to become a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
because the law treats qualifications and disqualification in separate sections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And then it must not be lost sight of that
even under the interpretation given to the for­mer law, it was to be understood
that the alien woman was not disqua­lified under Section 2 of that law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Leonard v. Grant did not rule that it was
enough if the alien woman does not belong to the class of dis­qualified persons
in order that she may be deemed to follow the citizen­ship of her husband:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What that case held was that the phrase 'who
might herself be lawfully naturalized’ merely means that she belongs to the
class or race of persons qualified to become citizens by naturalization - the
assumption being always that she is not otherwise disqualified.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We therefore hold that under the first paragraph of Section
15 of the Naturalization Law, an alien woman, who is married to a citizen of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
acquires the citizen­ship of her husband only if she has all the qualifications
and none of the disqualifications provided by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since there is no proof in this case that
petitioner has all the qualifications and is not in any way disqualified, her
marriage to a Filipino citizen does not auto­matically make her a Filipino ci­tizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her affidavit to the ef­fect that she is not
in any way disqualified to become a citizen of this country was correctly
disregarded by the trial court, the same being self-serving."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Naturally, almost a month later in Sun Peck Yong v. Commissioner
of Immigration, G.<i> </i>R. No, L-20784, December 27, 1963, 9 SCRA 875,
wherein the Secretary of Foreign Affairs reversed a previous resolution of the
preceding administration to allow Sun Peck Yong and her minor son to await the
taking of the oath of Filipino citizenship of her husband two years after the
decision granting him nationalization and required her to leave and this order
was contested in court, Justice Barrera held:</p>

<blockquote>"In the case of Lo San <span class="SpellE">Tuang</span> v.

became a naturalized citizen does not auto­matically make the wife a citizen of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must also be shown that she herself posses­ses
all the qualifications, and none of the disqualifications, to become a
citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case, there is no
allegation, much less<i> </i>showing, that petitioner-wife is qualified to
become a Filipino ci­tizen herself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, the fact that a decision was favorably made on the
naturalization petition of her husband is no assurance that he (the husband) would
become a citizen, as to make a basis for the extension of her temporary
stay."</blockquote>

citing particularly Lo San <span class="SpellE">Tuang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Kua</span> <span class="SpellE">Suy</span>, held that the marriage
of Tong <span class="SpellE">Siok</span> <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> to a

her taking her oath of Filipino citizenship before the Philippine Vice-Consul
at <span class="SpellE">Taipeh</span>, Taiwan on January 6, 1961 did not make her
a Filipino citizen, since she came here only in 1961 and obviously, she had not
had the necessary ten-year residence in the Philippines required by the law.</p>

citizen only during his minority, unless he begins to re­side permanently in
the Philippines when still a minor, in which case, he will continue to be a
Philippine citizen even after becoming of age.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Is it necessary, in order
that an alien woman who marries a Filipino or who is married to a man who
subsequently becomes a Filipino, may become a Filipino citizen herself, that,

if it is noted that the present case was act­ually submitted for decision on

in the <span class="SpellE">Burca</span> case cannot just be taken lightly and
summarily ignored, since they project in the most forceful manner, not only the
legal and logical angles of the issue, but also the imperative practical
aspects thereof in the light of the actual situation of the thousands of alien
wives of Filipinos who stay so long, even decades, consi­dered themselves as
Filipinas and have always lived and acted as such, officially or otherwise,
relying on the long standing continuous recognition of their status as such by
the administrative authorities in charge of the matter; as well as by the
courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circum­stances, and
if only to afford the Court an opportunity to consider the views of the five

decided to further reexamine the matter.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">Whether We like it or not, it is undeniably factual that the
legal provision We are construing, Section 15, <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>,
of the Naturalization Law has been taken directly, copied and adopted from its
American counter­part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be more
accurate, said provision is nothing less than a reenactment of the American
provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A brief re­view of its
history proves this beyond per adventure of doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">The first Naturalization Law of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
approved by the Philippine Legislature under American so­vereignty was that of <st1:date year="1920" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1920</st1:date>, Act No. 2927.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be­fore then, as a consequence of the Treaty
of Paris, our citizenship laws were found only in the Organic Laws, the
Philippine Bill of 1902, the Act of the United States Con­gress of <st1:date year="1912" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1912</st1:date> and later the Jones
Law of 1916.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, Act No. 2927 was
enacted pursuant to express autho­rity granted by the Jones Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For obvious reasons, the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
gained autonomy on the subjects of citizen­ship and immigration only after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Philippine Independence Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This made it practically impossible for our
laws on said subject to have any perspective or orientation of our own;
everything was Ameri­can.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Philippine Bill of 1902 provided pertinently:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That all
inhabitants of the Philippine Islands continuing to reside therein who were
Spanish subjects on the eleventh day of April, eighteen-hundred and
ninety-nine, and then resided in said Islands, and their children born
subsequent thereto, shall be deemed and held to be citizens of the Philippine
Islands and as such entitled to the protection of the United-States except such
as shall have elected to preserve their alle­giance to the Crown of Spain in
accordance with the provi­sions of the treaty of peace between the United
States and Spain signed at Paris Decem­ber tenth, eighteen hundred and
ninety-eight."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This Section 4 of the Philippine Bill of
1902 was amen­ded by Act of Congress of March 23, 1912, by adding a, provision
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Provided, That the Phi­lippine Legislature is hereby
authorized to provide by law for the acquisition of Phi­lippine citizenship by
those natives of the Philippine Islands who do not come with­in the foregoing
provisions, the natives of other insular possessions of the United States, and
such other per­sons residing in the Philip­pine Islands who would be­come
citizens of the United States, under the laws of the United States, if resid­ing
therein."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Jones Law reenacted these provisions substan­tially:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That all
inhabit­ants of the Philippine Islands who were Spanish subjects on the
eleventh day of April, eighteen hundred and ninety-nine, and then resided in
said islands, and their children born subsequent thereto, shall be deemed and
held to be citizens of the Philippine Is­lands, except such as shall have
elected to preserve their alle­giance to the Crown of Spain in accordance with
the provisions of the treaty of peace between the United States and Spain,
signed at Paris December tenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, and except
such others as have since become citizens of some other country:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pro­vided, That the Philippine Le­gislature,
herein provided for, is hereby authorized to provide by law for the acquisition
of Philippine citizenship by those natives of the Philippine Is­lands who do
not come within the foregoing provisions, the natives of the insular
possessions of the United States, and such other persons residing in the Philip­pine
Islands who are citizens of the United States under the laws of the United
States if residing therein."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">For aught that appears, there was nothing in any of the said
organic laws regarding the effect of marriage to a Filipino upon the
nationality of an alien woman, albeit under the Spanish Civil Code provisions
on citizenship, Articles 17 to 27, which were, however, abrogated upon the
change of sovereignty, it was unquestionable that the ci­tizenship of the wife
always followed that of the husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
even Act 2927 contained any provision regarding the effect of naturalization of
an alien upon the citizenship of his alien wife, nor of the marriage of such
alien wo­man with a native born Filipino or one who had become a Filipino
before the marriage, although Section 13 there­of provided thus:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Right of
widow and child­ren of petitioners who have died</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- In case a petitioner should die before the
final decision has been rendered, his widow and minor children may con­tinue
the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision rendered
in the case shall, so far as the widow and minor children are con­cerned,
produce the same legal effect as if it had been rendered during the life of the
petitioner."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It was not until <st1:date year="1928" day="30" month="11">November
 30, 1928</st1:date>, upon the approval of Act 3448, amending Act 2927, that
the following provi­sions were added to the above Section 13:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
following new sec­tions are hereby inserted between sections thirteen and
fourteen of Act Numbered Twenty-nine hundred and Twenty-seven:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'SEC. 13(a).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any woman who
is now or may hereafter be mar­ried to a citizen of the Philippine Islands and
who might herself be lawfully naturalized, shall be deemed a citizen of the
Philippine Islands.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'SEC. 13(b).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Children of per­sons
who have been duly natu­ralized under this law, being under the age of
twenty-one years at the time of the natu­ralization of their parents, shall, if
dwelling in the Philippine Islands, be considered citizens thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'SEC. 13(c).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Children of
persons naturalized under this law who have been born in the Philippine Islands
after the naturalization of their parents shall be considered citizens
thereof.'"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">When Commonwealth Act 473, the current naturalization law, was
enacted on <st1:date year="1939" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1939</st1:date>,
the above Section 13 be­came its Section 15 which has already been quoted
earlier in this decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As can be
seen, Section 13(a) above-quoted was re-enacted practically word for word in
the first paragraph of this Section 15 except for the change of Philippine Islands
to Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it could not have
been on any other basis than this legislative history of our naturalization law
that each and everyone of the deci­sions of this Court from the first Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha to Go <span class="SpellE">Im</span> <span class="SpellE">Ty</span>, discussed above, were rendered.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated earlier, in the opinion of Chief <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
in the first Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha, it was quite clear that for
an alien woman who marries a Filipino to become herself a Filipino citizen,
there is no need for any natu­ralization proceeding because she becomes a Filipina
<u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u> from the time of such marriage, provided she does not
suffer any of the disqualifications enumerated in Sec­tion 4 of Commonwealth
Act 473, with no mention being made of whether or not the qualifications
enumerated in Section 2 thereof need be shown.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was only in <u>Lee</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Suan</u></span> <u>Ay</u>
in 1959 that the possession of qualifications were specifical­ly required, but
it was not until 1963, in <u>Lo</u> <u>San</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Tuang</u></span>,
that Justice <span class="SpellE">Regala</span> reasoned out why the possession
of the qualifications provided by the law should also be shown to be possessed
by the alien wife of a Filipino, for her to become a Filipina by marriage.</p>

<p class="BODY">As may be recalled, the basic argument advanced by Justice <span class="SpellE">Regala</span> was briefly <i>as </i>follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That "like the law in the United States,
our Naturalization Law specified the classes of persons who alone might become
citizens, even as it provided who were disqualified", and inasmuch as
Commonwealth Act 473, our Naturalization Law since 1939 did not reenact the
section providing who might become ci­tizens, allegedly in order to remove
racial discrimination in favor of Caucasians and against <span class="SpellE">Asiatics</span>,
"the only lo­gical deduction . . . . is that the phrase ‘who might herself
be lawfully naturalized' must now be understood as referring to those who under
Section 2 of the law are qua­lified to become citizens of the Philippines"
and "there is simply no support for the view that the phrase 'who might
herself be lawfully naturalized' must now be under­stood as requiring merely
that the alien woman must not belong to the class of disqualified persons under
Section 4 of the Revised Naturalization Law".<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A similar line of reasoning was followed in <u>Choy</u> <u>King</u>
<u>Tee</u>, which for ready reference may be quoted:</p>

<blockquote>"The question has been settled by<i> </i>the uniform ruling of
this Court in a number of cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
alien wife of a Filipino citizen must first prove that she has all the
qualifications required by Section 2 and none of the disqualifications enume­rated
in Section 4 of the Naturalization Law before she may be deemed a<i> </i>Philippine
citizen (Lao <span class="SpellE">Chay</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>,

<st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1963</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writer of this opinion has submitted the
ques­tion anew to the court for a possible re-examination of the said ruling in
the light of the interpretation of a si­milar law in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> after which Section 15 of our
Naturaliza­tion Law was patterned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
law was section 2 of the Act of <st1:date year="1855" day="10" month="2">February
 10, 1855</st1:date> (Section 1994 of the Revised Statutes of the U.S.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The local law, Act No. 3448, was passed on <st1:date year="1928" day="30" month="11">November 30, 1928</st1:date> as an amendment to
the for­mer Philippine Naturalization Law, Act No. 2927, which was approved on <st1:date year="1920" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1920</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under this Naturali­zation Law, acquisition
of Philippine citizenship was limited to three class­es of persons, (a) Natives
of the Philippines who were not citizens thereof (b) natives of the other in­sular
possessions of the United States; and (c) citizens of the United States, or
foreigners who, under the laws of the United States, may become citizens of the
latter country if residing three.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
reference in, subdivision (c) to foreigners who may become American Citizens is
restrictive in character, for only persons of certain specified races were
qualified <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, in so far as racial restrictions were concerned there
was at the time a similarity between the na­turalization laws of the two
countries, and hence there was reason to accord here persuasive force to the
inter­pretation given in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to the statutory provision concerning the citizenship of alien women marry­ing
American citizens.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This Court, however, believes that such reason has ceased to
exist since the enactment of the Revised Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act
No. 473) on <st1:date year="1939" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1939</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The racial restrictions have been eliminated
in this Act, but the provision found in Act No. 3448 has been maintained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is logical to presume that when Congress
chose to retain the said provision - that to be deemed a Philippine citizen
upon marriage the alien wife must be one 'who might herself be lawfully
naturalized,’ the refer­ence is no longer to the class or race to which the
woman belongs, for class or race has become immaterial, but to the
qualifications and disqua­lifications for naturalization as en­umerated in
Sections 2 and 4 of the statute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise the requirement that the woman 'might herself be lawfully
naturalized' would be mean­ingless <span class="SpellE">surplusage</span>,
contrary to set­tled norms of statutory construction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The rule laid down by this Court in this and in other cases
hereto­fore decided is believed to be in line with the national policy of se­lective
admission to Philippine citi­zenship, which after all is a privi­lege granted
only to those who are found worthy thereof, and not indiscriminately to anybody
at all on the basis alone of marriage to a man who is a citizen of the
Philippines, ir­respective of moral character, ideo­logical beliefs, and identification
with Filipino ideals, customs and traditions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> here having failed to
prove that she has all the qualifi­cations for naturalization, even, in­deed,
that she has none of the disqualifications, she is not entitled to recognition
as a Philippine citi­zen.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the second Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha, the Court
further forti­fied the arguments in favor of the same conclusion thus:</p>

<blockquote>"On cross-examination, she (Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span>
Ha) failed to establish that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) she
has been residing in the Philippines for a continuous period of at least ten
(10) years (p. 27, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., id.); (2) she has a
lucrative trade, profession, or lawful occupation (p. 13, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
id.); and (3) she can speak and write English, or any of the princi­pal
Philippine languages (pp. 12, 13, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"While the appellant Immigration Commissioner contends that
the words emphasized indicate that the present Naturalization Law requires that
an alien woman who marries a Filipino husband must possess the qualifica­tions prescribed
by section 2 in ad­dition to not being disqualified un­der any of the eight
('a' to 'h') subheadings of section 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, in order to
claim our citizenship by marriage, both the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
and the court be­low (in its second decision) sustain the view that all that
the law demands is that the woman be not disqualified under section 4.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At the time the present case was remanded to the court of
origin (1960) the question at issue could be regarded as not conclusively
settled, there being only the concise pronouncement in Lee <span class="SpellE">Suan</span>

<blockquote>"Since that time, however, a long line of decisions of this
Court has firmly established the rule that the requirement of section 15 of
Commonwealth Act 473 (the Naturalization Act), that an alien woman married to a
citizen should be one who '<u>might herself be lawfully naturalized</u>’, means
not only woman free from the disqualifications enumerated in sec­tion 4 of the

2 of the Natura­lization Act, and the disqualifications enumerated in its
section 4 are not mutually exclusive; and if all that were to be required is
that the wife of a Filipino be not dis­qualified under section 4, the re­sult

gambling or bawdy houses, not previously convicted by a competent court would
not be thereby disquali­fied; still, it is certain that the law did not intend
such person to be admitted as a citizen in view of the requirement of section 2
that an applicant for citizenship 'must be of good moral character.’</blockquote>

in ra­cial supremacy, in government by certain selected classes, in the right
to vote exclusively by certain '<span class="SpellE">herrenvolk</span>', and thus
disbelieve in the principles underlying the Philip­pine Constitution; yet she
would not be disqualified under section 4, as long as she is not 'opposed to
orga­nized government', nor affiliated to groups 'upholding or teaching doc­trines
opposing all organized governments', nor 'defending or teaching the necessity
or propriety of vio­lence, personal assault or assassination for the success or

<p class="BODY">It is difficult to minimize the persuasive force of the foregoing

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main proposition, for

thereby opening the door of Filipino nationality to <span class="SpellE">Asiatics</span>

(c) citizens of the United States, or foreigners who under the laws of the
United States may become citizens of said country if residing therein."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and not only subdivision (c)
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere in this whole provision
was there any mention of race or color of the persons who were then eligible
for Philippine citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more
evident from said provision is that it reflected the inevitable subordination
of our legislation during the pre-Commonwealth American regime to the
understandable limitations flowing from our status as a territory of the United
States by virtue of the Treaty of Paris.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, Section 1 of Act 2927 was precisely approved pursuant to
express authority, without which it could not have been done, granted by an
amend­ment to Section 4 of the Philippine Bill of 1902 intro­duced by the Act
of the United States Congress of March 23, 1912 and which was reenacted as part
of the Jones Law of 1916, the pertinent provisions of which have al­ready been
quoted earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In truth, therefore, it
was because of the establishment of the Philippine Commonwealth and in the
exercise of our legislative autonomy on citizenship matters under the
Philippine Independence Act that Section 1 of Act 2927 was eliminated,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">15</span></span></a>
and not purposely to eliminate any racial discrimination contained in our
Naturalization Law. The Philippine Le­gislature naturally wished to free our
Naturalization Law from the impositions of American legislation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the fact that such
discrimination was removed was one of the effects rather than the intended
purpose of the amendment.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, the statement in
Choy King Tee to the effect that “the reference subdivision (c) (of Section 1
of Mt 2927) foreigners who may become American citizen is restrictive
character, for only persons of certain specified races were qualified <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>" fails to consider the exact import of the
said subdivision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ex­plicitly, the thrust
of the said subdivision was to con­fine the grant under it of Philippine
citizenship only to the three classes of persons therein mentioned, the third
of which were citizens of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and, <span class="SpellE">corol­larily</span>, persons who could be American
citizens under her laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The words used
in the provision do not convey any idea of favoring aliens of any particular
race or color and of excluding others, but more accurately, they refer to all
the disqualifications of foreigners for American citizenship under the laws of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact is that even as of 1906, or long
before 1920,when our Act 2927 became <i>a </i>law, the naturalization laws of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
already provided for the following disqualifications in the Act of the Congress
of <st1:date year="1906" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1906</st1:date>:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That no person
who dis­believes in or who is<i> </i>opposed to or­ganized government, or who
is a mem­ber of or affiliated with any organization entertaining and teaching
such disbelief in or opposition to organized government, or who advo­cates or
teaches the duty, necessity, or propriety of the unlawful assaulting or killing
of any offi­cer or officers, either of specific individuals or of officers
generally, of the Government of the United States, or of any other organized
government, because of his or their official character, or who is a polygamist,
shall be naturalized or be made a citizen of the United States."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and all these disqualified persons were,
therefore, ineli­gible for Philippine citizenship under Section 1 of Act 2927
even if they happened to be Caucasians.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More importantly, as a matter of fact, said American law, which was the
first "Act to Establish a Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization and to
Provide for a Uniform Rule for Naturali­zation of Aliens throughout, the United
States" contained no racial disqualification requirement, except as to Chi­nese,
the Act of May 6, 1882 not being among those expressly repealed by this law,
hence it is clear that when Act a 2927 was enacted, subdivision (c) of its
Section 1 could not have had any connotation of racial exclusion necessarily,
even if it were traced back to its origin in the Act of the United States
Congress of 1912 already mentioned above.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">16</span></span></a> Thus, it would seem that the
rationalization in the quoted decisions predicated on the theory that the
elimination of Section 1 of Act 2927 by Commonwealth Act 473 was purposely for
no other end than the abolition of racial discrimination in our naturalization
law has no clear factual basis.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">17</span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of these
considerations, there appears to be no cogent reason why the construction
adopted in the opinions of the Secretary of Justice referred to in the first Ly
<span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha decision of the Chief Justice should not
prevail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is beyond dispute that the
first paragraph of Section 15 of Commonwealth Act 473 is a reenactment of
Section 13(a) of Act 2927, as amended by Act 3448, and that the latter is
nothing but an exact copy, deliberate­ly made, of Section 1994 of the Revised
Statutes of the, United States as it stood before its repeal in 1922.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span> Before
such repeal, the phrase "who might herself be law­fully naturalized"
found in said Section 15 had a definite unmistakable construction uniformly
followed in all courts of the United States that had had occasion to apply the
same and which, therefore, must be considered as if it were written in the
statute itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It almost trite to say
that when our legislators enacted said section, they knew of its unvarying
construction in the United States and that, therefore, in adopting verbatim the
American statute, they have in effect incorporated into the provi­sion, as thus
enacted, the construction given to it by the American courts as well as by the
Attorney General of the United States and all administrative authorities
charged with the implementation of the naturalization and immigration laws of
that country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Lo <span class="SpellE">Cham</span>

Dora <span class="SpellE">Sejnensky</span> v. Robert E. <span class="SpellE">Tod</span>,
Commissioner of Immigration, Appt., 285 Fed. 523, decided <st1:date year="1922" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1922</st1:date>, 26 A. L. R. 1316 as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 1994 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. Stat. § 3948, 2
Fed. Sta. <span class="SpellE">Anno</span>. 2d ed. p. 117) provides as fol­lows:
'Any woman who is now or may hereafter be married to a citizen of the United
States, and who might her­self be lawfully naturalized, shall be deemed a
citizen.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Section 1994 of the Revised Stat is said to originate in the
Act of Congress, of February 10, 1855 (10 Stat. at L. 604, chap. 71), which in
its second section provided 'that any woman, who might lawfully be naturalized
under the existing laws, married, or who shall be married to a citizen of the
United States, shall be deemed and taken to be a citizen.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"And the American Statute of 1855 is substantially a copy of
the ear­lier British Statute 7 &amp; 8 <span class="SpellE">Vict</span>. chap.
66, § 16, 1844, which provided that 'any woman married, or who shall be
married, to a natural-born subject or person naturalized, shall be deemed and
taken to be herself naturalized, and have all the rights and privileges of a
natural born subject.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Act of Congress of <st1:date year="1922" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1922</st1:date> (42 Stat. at L. 1021, chap. 411, Comp.
Stat. § 4358b, Fed. Stat. Anna. Supp. 1922, p. 255), being 'An Act Relative to
the Naturalization and Citizenship of Married Wo­men,' in § 2, provides 'that
any wo­man who marries a citizen of the United States after the passage of this
Act, . . . shall not become a citizen of the United States by reason of such
marriage . . . .’</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Section 6 of the act also provides that 1994 of the Revised
Statutes . . .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>are repealed.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Section 6 also provides that 'such repeal shall not terminate
ci­tizenship acquired or retained under either of such sections, . . .' meaning
§§ 2 and 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So that this Act of <st1:date year="1922" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1922</st1:date>, has no appli­cation
to the facts of the present case, as the marriage of the <span class="SpellE">relator</span>
took place prior to its passage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
case, therefore, depends upon the meaning to be attached to 1994 of the Revised
Statutes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In 1868 the Supreme Court, in Kelly v. Owen, 7 Wall. 496,
498, 19 L. ed. 283, 284, construed this pro­vision as found in the Act of 1855
as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'The term, "who might
lawfully be naturalized under the existing laws," only limits the appli­cation
of the law to free white women.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
previous Naturalization Act, existing at the time, only required that the
person applying for its benefits should be "a free white per­son,"
and not an alien enemy.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This construction limited the ef­fect of the statute to those
aliens who belonged to the class or race which might he lawfully naturalized,
and did not refer to any of the other provisions of the naturalization laws as
to residence or moral charac­ter, or to any of the provisions of the
immigration laws relating to the exclusion or deportation of aliens.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In 1880, in Leonard v. Grant (C. C.) 5 Fed. 11, District
Judge <span class="SpellE">Deady</span> also construed the Act of 1855, de­claring
that 'any woman who is now or may hereafter be married to a ci­tizen of the
United States, and might herself be lawfully naturalized, shall be deemed a
citizen.' He held that 'upon the authorities, and the reas­on, if not the
necessity, of the case, the statute must be construed as in effect declaring
that an alien wo­man, who is of the class or race that may be lawfully
naturalized under the existing laws, and who marries a ci­tizen of the United
States, is such a citizen also, and it was not neces­sary that it should appear
affirmatively that she possessed the other qualifications at the time of her
mar­riage to entitle her to naturalization.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In 1882, the Act of 1855 came before Mr. Justice Harlan,
sitting in the circuit court, in <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. <span class="SpellE">Kellar</span>, 13 Fed. 82.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An alien woman, a subject of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Prussia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
came to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and mar­ried here a naturalized citizen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mr. Justice Harlan, with the concurrence of Judge Treat, held that upon
her marriage she became ipso facto a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> as ful­ly as if she had complied with
all of the provisions of the statutes upon the subject of naturalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He added:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'There can be no doubt of this, in view of the decision of the Supreme
Court of the United States in Kelly v. Owen, 7 Wall. 496, 19 L. ed. 283.’ The
alien 'belonged to the class of persons' who might be lawfully naturalized.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In 1904, in <st1:city><st1:place>Hopkins</st1:place></st1:city>
v. <span class="SpellE">Fachant</span>, 65 C. C. A. 1, 130 Fed. 839, an alien
woman came to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
from <st1:country-region><st1:place>France</st1:place></st1:country-region> and
entered the country contrary to the immigration laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The immigration autho­rities took her into
custody at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>New
  York</st1:placename></st1:place>, with the view of deporting her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She applied for her release under a writ of
habeas cor­pus, and pending the disposition of the matter she married a
naturaliz­ed American citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
circuit court of appeals for the ninth cir­cuit held, affirming the court be­low
that she was entitled to be discharged from custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court declared:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘The rule is well settled that her marriage
to a naturalized citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
enti­tled her to be discharged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sta­tus
of the wife follows that of her husband, and by virtue of her marriage her
husbands,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>. . . and <span class="SpellE">domicil</span>
became her <span class="SpellE">domicil</span>.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In 1908, the circuit court for the district of Rhode Island
in Re <span class="SpellE">Rustigian</span>, 165 Fed. 980, had before it the
application of a husband for his final decree of naturalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appeared that at that time his wife was
held by the immigration authorities at <st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state>
on the ground that she was afflicted with a dangerous and contagious
disease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel on both sides agreed that
the effect of the husband's natura­lization would be to confer citizen­ship
upon the wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of that
contingency District Judge Brown de­clined to pass upon the husband's
application for naturalization, and thought it best to wait until it was determined
whether the wife's di­sease was curable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He placed his failure to act on the express ground that the effect of
naturalizing the husband might naturalize her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the same time he expressed his opi­nion that the husband's naturaliza­tion
would not effect her naturali­zation, as she was not one who could become
lawfully naturalized. 'Her own capacity (to become naturalized),' the court
stated, 'is a prerequisite to her attaining citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If herself lacking in that capacity, the
married status cannot confer it upon her.' Nothing, however, was act­ually
decided in that case, and the views expressed therein are really nothing more
than mere dicta.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, if they can be
regarded as something more than that, we find ourselves, with all due respect
for the learned judge, unable to accept them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In 1909, in <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
ex <span class="SpellE">rel</span>. Nicola v. Williams, 173 Fed. 626, District
Judge Learned Hand held that an alien woman, a subject of the Tur­kish Empire,
who married an American citizen while visiting Turkey, and then came to the
United States, could not be excluded, although she had, at the time of her
entry, a disease which under the immigration laws would have been sufficient
ground for her exclusion, if she had not had the status of a citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was brought into this court on
appeal, and in 1911 was affirmed, in 106 C. C. A. 464, 184 Fed. 322.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, how­ever, at the time the <span class="SpellE">relators</span> married, they might have been lawfully natura­lized,
and we said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Even if we assume the
contention of the district attor­ney to be correct that marriage will not make
a citizen of a woman who would be excluded under our immigra­tion laws, it does
not affect these <span class="SpellE">relators</span>.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We held that, being citizens, they could not be excluded as
aliens; and it was also said to be inconsistent with the policy of our law that
the husband should be a citizen and the wife an alien.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The distinction bet­ween that case and the
one now before the court is that, in the former case, the marriage took place
before any or­der of exclusion had been made, while in this the marriage was
celebrated after such an order was made.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But such an order is a mere administra­tive provision, and has not the
force of a judgment of a court, and works no <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The administrative or­der is based on the
circumstances that existed at the time the order of exclusion was made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the cir­cumstances change prior to the or­der
being carried into effect, it cannot be executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example, if an order of exclusion should
be based on the ground that the alien was at the time afflicted with a
contagious disease, and it should be made satisfactorily to appear, prior to
actual deportation, that the alien had entirely recovered from the disease, we
think it plain that the order could not be carried into effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, in this case, if, after the making of the
order of ex­clusion and while she is permitted temporarily to remain, she in
good faith marries an American citizen, we cannot doubt the validity of her
marriage, and that she thereby ac­quired, under international law and under 1994
of the Revised Statutes, American citizenship, and ceased to be an alien.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There upon, the immigration authorities lost
their juris­diction over her, as that jurisdic­tion applies only to aliens, and
not to citizens.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In 1910, District Judge Dodge, in Ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kaprielian</span>, 188 Fed. 694, sustained the right of the
officials to deport a woman under the following circumstances:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She entered this country in July, 1910, being
an alien and, having been born in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Turkey</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was taken into custody by the immi­gration
authorities in the following September, and in October a warrant for her
deportation was issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pend­ing
hearings as to the validity of that order, she was paroled in the custody of
her counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ground alleged for her deportation
was that she was afflicted with a dangerous and contagious disease at the time
of her entry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the reasons
assigned to defeat deportation was that the woman had married a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> pending the proceed­ings for her
deportation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge Dodge declared
himself unable to believe that a marriage under such circumstances 'is capable
of having the effect claimed, in view of the facts shown.' He held that it was
no part of the intended po­licy of 1994 to annul or override the immigration
laws, so as to authorize the admission into the country of the wife of a
naturalized alien not other­wise entitled to enter, and that an alien woman,
who is of a class of per­sons excluded by law from admission to the United
States does not come within the provisions of that section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court relied wholly upon the dicta con­tained
in the <span class="SpellE">Rustigian</span> Case. No other authorities were
cited.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In 1914, District Judge <span class="SpellE">Neterer</span>, in
Ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> Grayson, 215 Fed. 449, cons­trued 1994 and
held that where, pend­ing proceedings to deport an alien na­tive of France as
an alien prostitute, she was married to a citizen of the United States, she
thereby became a citizen, and was not subject to deporta­tion until her
citizenship was revoked by due process of law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was his opi­nion that if, as was contended, her mar­riage was
conceived in fraud, and was entered into for the purpose of evading the
immigration laws and preventing her deportation, such fact should be estab­lished
in a court of competent jurisdic­tion in an action commenced for the
purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was appealed and the
appeal was dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>134 C. C. A. 666,
219 Fed. 1022.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is interesting also to observe the construction placed
upon the lan­guage of the statute by the Department of Justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1874, Attorney General Williams, 14 Ops.
Atty. Gen. 402, pass­ing upon the Act of February 10, 1855, held that residence
within the United States for the period required by the naturalization laws was
not necessary in order to constitute an alien woman a citizen, she having
married a citi­zen of the United States abroad, although she never resided in
the United States, she and her husband having con­tinued to reside abroad after
the mar­riage.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In 1909, a similar construction was given to the Immigration
Act of <st1:date year="1907" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1907</st1:date>, in an
opinion rendered by Attorney General <span class="SpellE">Wickersham</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appeared an unmarried woman, twenty-eight
years of age and a native of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Bel­gium</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
arrived in <st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state> and went at
once to a town in <st1:state><st1:place>Nebraska</st1:place></st1:state>, where
she continued to reside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About fifteen
months after her arrival she was taken before a United States commissioner by
way of instituting proceedings under the Immigration Act (34 Stat. at L. 898,
chap. 1134, Comp. Stat. 4242, 3 Fed. Stat. <span class="SpellE">Anno</span>. 2d
ed. p. 637) for her deportation, on the ground that she had entered this
country for the purpose of prostitution, and had been found an inmate of a house
of prostitution and practicing the same within three years after landing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appear­ed, however, that after she was
taken before the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
commissioner, but prior to her arrest under a war­rant by the Department of
Justice, she was lawfully married to a native-born citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The wo­man professed at the time of her mar­riage an intention to
abandon her pre­vious mode of life and to remove with her husband to his home
in <st1:state><st1:place>Pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:state>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He knew what her mode of life had been, but
professed to believe in her good intentions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The question was raised as to the right to deport her, the claim being
advanced that by her marriage she had become an American citizen and therefore
could not be de­ported.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Attorney
General ruled against the right to deport her as she had become an American
citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He held that the words, 'who
might herself be lawfully naturalized,' re­fer to a class or race who might be
lawfully naturalized, and that com­pliance with the other conditions of the
naturalization laws was not re­quired.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>27 Ops. Atty. Gen. 507.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Before concluding this opinion, we may add that it has not
escaped our observation that Congress, in enacting the Immigration Act of 1917,
so as to provide, in 19, ‘that the marriage to an American citizen of a female
of the sexually immoral class­es .... shall not invest such female with <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> citizenship if the marriage of such
alien female shall be solemnized after her arrest or after the commission of
acts which make her liable to deportation under this act.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Two conclusions seem irresistibly to follow from the above
change in the law:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congress deemed legislation essential to
prevent women of the im­moral class avoiding deportation through the device of
marrying an American citizen.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If Congress intended that the marriage of an
American citizen with an alien woman of any other of the excluded classes,
either before or after her detention, should not confer upon her American
citizenship, thereby entitling her to enter the country, its intention would
have been expressed, and 19 would not have been confined solely to women of the
immoral class."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, We have examined all the leading American decisions on
the subject and We have found no warrant for the proposition that the phrase
"who might herself be lawfully naturalized" in Section 1994 of the
Revised Stat­utes was meant solely as a racial bar, even if loose statements in
some decisions and other treatises and other writings on the subject would seem
to give such impression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case of
Kelly v. Owen, <u>supra</u>, which appears to be the most cited among the first
of these decisions<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">19</span></span></a> simply held:</p>

<blockquote>"As we construe this Act, it con­fers the privileges of
citizenship upon women married to citizens of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, if they are of the class of persons
for whose natu­ralization the previous Acts of Con­gress provide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The terms 'married' or 'who shall be
married,' do not refer, in our judgment, to the time when the ceremony of
marriage is celebrated, but to a state of mar­riage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They mean that, whenever a woman, who under
previous Acts might be naturalized, is in a state of marriage to a citizen,
whether his citizenship existed at the passage of the Act or subsequently, or
before or after the marriage, she becomes, by that fact, a citizen also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His citizenship, whenever it exists, confers,
under the Act, citizenship upon her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
cons­truction which would restrict the Act to women whose husbands, at the time
of marriage, are citizens, would exclude far the greater num­ber, for whose
benefit, as we think, the Act was intended.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its object, in our opinion, was to al­low her citizenship to follow that
of her husband, without the necessity of any application for naturaliza­tion on
her part; and, if this was the object, there is no reason for the restriction
suggested.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The terms, 'who might lawfully be naturalized under the
existing laws,' only limit the application of the law to free white women.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The previous Naturalization Act, exist­ing at
the time only required that the person applying for its benefits should be 'a
free white person,' and not an alien enemy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Act of <st1:date year="1802" day="14" month="4">April 14th, 1802</st1:date>,
2 Stat. at L. 153.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A similar construction was given to the Act by the Court of
Appeals of New York, in Burton v. Burton, 40 N. Y. 373; and is the one which
gives the widest extension to its provisions."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Note that while the court did say that "the terms, 'who
might lawfully be naturalized under existing laws’ only limit the application
to free white women"<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">20</span></span></a> it hastened to add that "the
previous Naturalization Act, existing at the time, x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> required that the per­son applying for its benefits
should be (not only) a 'free white person' (but also) x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> not an alien enemy." This is simply because
under the Naturalization Law of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> at the time the case was deci­ded,
the disqualification of enemy aliens had already been removed by the Act of <st1:date year="1813" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1813</st1:date>, as may be seen in the
corresponding footnote hereof anon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, if in the case of Kelly v.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Owen only the race requirement was mentioned, the reason was that there
was no other non­racial requirement or no more alien-enemy disqualification at
the time; and this is demonstrated by the fact that the court took care to make
it clear that under the previous na­turalization law, there was also such
requirement in addi­tion to race.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is important, since as stated in re <span class="SpellE">Rustigian</span>, 165
Fed. Rep. 980, "The expression used by Mr. Jus­tice Field, (in Kelly v.
Owen) the terms 'who might law­fully be naturalized under existing laws' only
limit the application of the law to free white women, must be inter­preted in
the application to the special facts and to the incapacities under the then
existing laws," (at p. 982) meaning that whether or not an alien wife
marrying a ci­tizen would be a citizen was dependent, not only on her race and
nothing more necessarily, but on whether or not there were other
disqualifications under the law in force at the time of her marriage or the
naturalization of her husband.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already stated, in Lo
San <span class="SpellE">Tuang</span>, Choy King Tee and the second Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha, the Court drew the infer­ence that because Section
1 of Act 2927 was eliminated by Commonwealth Act 473, it follows that in place
of the said eliminated section, particularly its subdivision (c), being the
criterion of whether or not an alien wife "may be lawfully
naturalized," what should be required is not only that she must not be
disqualified under Sec­tion 4 but that she must also possess the qualifications
enumerated in Section 2, such as those of age, residence, good moral character,
adherence to the underlying prin­ciples of the Philippine Constitution,
irreproachable conduct, lucrative employment or ownership of real estate,
capacity to speak and write English or Spanish and one of the principal local
languages, education of children in certain schools, etc., thereby implying
that, in effect, said Section 2 has been purposely intended to take the place of
Section 1 of Act 2927.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon further
considera­tion of the proper premises, We have come to the conclusion that such
inference is not sufficiently justified.</p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, nothing extant in the legislative his­tory, which
We have already examined above of the mention­ed provisions has been shown or
can be shown to indicate that such was the clear intent of the
legislature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, what is definite is
that Section 15 is an exact copy of Section 1994 of the Revised Statutes of the
<st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
which, at the time of the approval of Commonwealth Act 473 had already a
settled construction by American courts and administrative authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, as may be gleaned from the summary of per­tinent
American decisions quoted above, there can be no doubt that in the construction
of the identically worded provision in the Revised Statutes of the United
States, (Section 1994, which was taken from the Act of February 10, 1855) all
authorities in the United States are unani­mously agreed that the
qualifications of residence, good moral character, adherence to the
Constitution, etc. are not supposed to be considered, and that the only eligibi­lity
to be taken into account is that of the race or class to which the subject belongs,
the conceptual scope of which, We have just discussed.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">21</span></span></a>
In the very case of Leonard v. Grant, <u>supra</u>, discussed by Justice <span class="SpellE">Regala</span> in Lo San <span class="SpellE">Tuang</span>, the
explanation for such posture of the Ameri­can authorities was made thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The phrase, 'shall be deemed a ci­tizen,' in section 1994,
Rev. St., or as it was in the Act of 1855, supra, 'shall be deemed and taken to
be a citizen,' while it may imply that the person to whom it relates has not
actually become a citizen by ordinary means or in the usual way, as by the
judgment of a competent court, upon a proper application and proof, yet it does
not follow that such person is on that account practically any the less a
citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The word 'deemed' is the
equivalent of 'considered' or 'judged'; and, therefore, whatever an act of
Congress requires to be 'deemed' or 'taken' as true of any per­son or thing,
must, in law, be consi­dered as having been duly adjudged or established
concerning such person or thing, and have force and effect ac­cordingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When, therefore, Congress declares that an
alien woman shall, under certain circumstances, be 'deemed' an American
citizen, the effect when the contingency occurs, is equivalent to her being
natura­lized directly by an act of Con­gress, or in the usual mode thereby
prescribed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Unless We disregard now the long settled
familiar rule of statutory construction that in a situation like this where­in
our legislature has copied an American statute word for word, it is understood
that the construction already given to such statute before its being copied
constitute part of our own law, there seems to be no reason how We can give a
different connotation or meaning to the provision in ques­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At least, We have already seen that the views
sus­taining the contrary conclusion appear to be based on in­accurate factual
premises related to the real legislative background of the framing of our
naturalization law in its present form.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thirdly, the idea of equating the qualifications enumerated in
Section 2 of Commonwealth Act 473 with the eligibility requirements of Section
1 of Act 2927 cannot bear close scrutiny from any point of view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question that Section 2 of
Commonwealth Act 473 is more or less substantially the same as Section 3 of Act
2927.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, Section 1 of Act
2927 co-existed already with practically the same provision as Section 2 of
Commonwealth Act 473.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were true
that the phrase "who may be law­fully naturalized" in Section 13(a)
of Act 2927, as amend­ed by Act 3448, referred to the so-called racial require­ment
in Section 1 of the same Act, without regard to the provisions of Section 3
thereof, how could the elimination of Section 1 have the effect of shifting the
reference to Section 3, when precisely, according to the American ju­risprudence,
which was prevailing at the time Commonwealth Act 473 was approved, such
qualifications as were embodied in said Section 3, which had their counter-part
in the cor­responding American statutes, are not supposed to be taken into
account and that what should be considered only are the requirements similar to
those provided for in said Section 1 together with the disqualifications
enumerated in Section 4?</p>

<p class="BODY">Fourthly, it is difficult to conceive that the phrase "who
might be lawfully naturalized" in Section 15 could have been intended to
convey a meaning different than that given to it by the American courts and
administrative authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already
stated, Act 3448 which contained said phrase and from which it was taken by
Commonwealth Act 473, was enacted in 1928.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By that time, Section 1994 of the Revised Statutes of the United States
was no longer in force because it had been repealed expressly by the Act of
September 22, 1922 which did away with the automatic naturalization of alien
wives of Ame­rican citizens and required, instead, that they submit to regular
naturalization proceedings, albeit under more liberal terms than those of other
applicants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, when our
legislature adopted the phrase in ques­tion, which, as already demonstrated,
had a definite cons­truction in American law, the Americans had already aban­doned
said phraseology in favor of a categorical compul­sion for alien wives to be
naturalized judicially.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Simple logic
would seem to dictate that, since our lawmakers, at the time of the approval of
Act 3448, had two choices, one to adopt the phraseology of Section 1994 with
its set­tled construction and the other to follow the new posture of the
Americans of requiring judicial naturalization, and it appears that they have
opted for the first, We have no alternative but to conclude that our law still
follows the old or previous American law on the subject.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, when Commonwealth Act 473 was
approved in 1939, the Philippine Legislature, already autonomous then from the
American Congress, had a clearer chance to disregard the old American law and
make one of our own, or, at least, follow the trend of the Act of the U. S.
Congress of 1922, but still, our legislators chose to maintain the language of
the old law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What then is significantly
important is not that the legislature maintained said phraseology after Section
1 of Act 2927 was eliminated, but that it continued insisting on using it even
after the Americans had amended their law in order to provide for what is now
contended to be the construction that should be given to the phrase in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated dif­ferently, had our
legislature adopted a phrase from an American statute before the American
courts had given it a construction which was acquiesced to by those called upon
to apply the same, it would be possible for Us to adopt a construction here
different from that of the Americans, but as things stand, the fact is that our
le­gislature borrowed the phrase when there was already a settled construction
thereof, and what is more, it appears that our legislators even ignored the
modifica­tion of the American law and persisted in maintaining the old
phraseology.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances,
it would be in defiance of reason and the principles of Statutory construction
to say that Section 15 has a nationa­listic and selective orientation and that
it should be construed independently of the previous American posture because
of the difference of circumstances here and in VA the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is always safe to say that in the construction of a statute, We
cannot fall on possible judicial fiat or perspective when the demonstrated
legis­lative point of view seems to indicate otherwise.</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Viewing the matter from
another angle, there is need to emphasize that in reality and in effect, the so-called
racial requirements, whether under the American laws or the Philippine laws,
have hardly been considered as qualifications in the same sense as those
enumerated in Section 3 of Act 2927 and later in Section 2 of Com­monwealth Act
473.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More accurately, they have always
been considered as disqualifications, in the sense that these who did not
possess them were the ones who could not "be lawfully naturalized",
just as if they were suf­fering from any of the disqualifications under Section
2 of Act 2927 and later those under Section 4 of Common­wealth Act 473, which,
incidentally, are practically iden­tical to those in the former law, except
those in para­graphs (f) and (h) of the latter.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">22</span></span></a> Indeed, such is the clear
impression anyone will surely get after going over all the American decisions
and opinions quoted and/or cited in the latest USCA (1970), Title 8, section
1430, pp. 598-602, and the first decisions of this Court on the matter, Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha (1959) and Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Cua</span>,
citing 23 with approval the opinions of the Secretary of Justice.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">23</span></span></a>
Such being the case, that is, that the so-called racial requirements were
always treated as disqualifications in the same light as the other
disqualifications under the law, why should their elimination not be viewed or
understood as a subtraction from or a lessening of the disqua­lifications?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why should such elimination have instead the
meaning that what were previously considered as irre­levant qualifications have
become disqualifications, as seems to be the import of the holding in Choy King
Tee to the effect that the retention in Section 15 of Commonwealth Act 473 of
the same language of what used to be Sec­tion 13 (a) of Act 2927 (as amended by
Act 3448), notwithstanding the elimination of Section 1 of the latter, neces­sarily
indicates that the legislature had in mind making the phrase in question
"who may be lawfully naturalized" refer no longer to any racial
disqualification but to the qualification under Section 2 of Commonwealth Act
473?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oth­erwise stated, under Act 2927,
there were two groups of persons that could not be naturalized, namely, those
fal­ling under Section 1 and those falling under Section 2, and surely, the
elimination of one group, i.e. those belonging to Section 1, could not have
had, by any process of reason­ing, the effect of increasing, rather than
decreasing, the disqualifications that used to be before such elimination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot see by what alchemy of logic such
elimination could have converted qualifications into disqualifications, spe­cially
in the light of the fact that, after all, these are disqualifications clearly
set out as such in the law distinctly and separately from qualifications and,
as already demons­trated, in American jurisprudence, qualifications had never
been considered to be of any relevance in determining "who might be
lawfully naturalized", as such phrase is used in the statute governing the
status of alien wives of American citizens, and our law on the matter was
merely copied verba­tim from the American statutes.</p>

<p class="NUM">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition to these
arguments based on the appli­cable legal provisions and judicial opinions,
whether here or in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
there are practical considerations that militate towards the same
conclusions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As aptly sta­ted in the

of requiring alien wife to prove 'qualifications'</u> -<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<blockquote>"There is one practical considera­tion that strongly militates
against a construction that Section 15 of the law requires that an alien wife
of a Filipino must affirmatively prove that she possesses the qualifications
pres­cribed under Section 2, before she may be deemed a citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such condition, if imposed upon an alien
wife, becomes unreasonably onerous and compliance therewith manifestly
difficult.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The unreasonableness of such
requirement is shown by the following:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">"1.<span style=""> </span>One of the qualifications required of an
applicant for naturalization under Sec­tion 2 of the law is that the applicant
'must have resided in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for a con­tinuous period of not less than ten years.' If this requirement is
applied to an a­lien wife married to a Filipi­no citizen, this means that for a
period of ten years at least, she cannot hope to acquire the citizenship of her
husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the wife happens to be a
citi­zen of a country whose law declares that upon her marriage to a foreigner
she automatical­ly loses her citizenship and acquires the citizenship of her
husband, this could mean that for a period of ten years at least, she would be
state­less.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And even after having
acquired continuous residence in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for ten years, there is no guarantee that her petition for naturalization will
be granted, in which case she would remain stateless for an indefinite period
of time.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">"2.<span style=""> </span>Section 2 of the law like­wise requires of the
applicant for naturalization that he 'must own real estate in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
worth not less than five thousand pesos, Philippine currency, or must have some
known lucrative trade, profession, or lawful occupation.' Considering the cons­titutional
prohibition against acquisition by an alien of real estate except in cases of
hereditary succession (Art. X111, Sec. 5, Constitution), an alien wife desiring
to acquire the citizen­ship of her husband must have to prove that she has a
lucrative income derived from a lawful trade, profession or occupation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The income requirement has been interpreted
to mean that the petitioner herself must be the one to possess the said income.

has a lucrative income derived from sources o­ther than her husband's trade,
profession or calling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is of common
knowledge, and judi­cial notice may be taken of the fact that most wives in the
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> do
not have gainful occupations of their own.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, Philippine Law, recognizing the dependence of the wife upon the
husband, imposes upon the latter the duty of supporting the former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Art. 291, Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be borne in mind that uni­versally,
it is an accepted con­cept that when a woman marries, her primary duty is to be
a wife, mother and housekeeper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If an a­lien
wife is not to be remiss in this duty, how can she hope to acquire a lucrative
income of her own to qualify her for citizen­ship?</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">"3.<span style=""> </span>Under Section 2 of the law, the applicant for
naturalization 'must have enrolled his minor children of school age, in any of
the public schools or private schools recognized by the Office of the Private
Education of the Philippines, where Philippine his­tory, government and civics
are taught or prescribed as part of the school curriculum during the entire
period of residence in the Philippines required of him prior to the hearing of
his petition for naturalization as Philippine citizen.’ If an alien woman has
minor children by a previous mar­riage to another alien before she marries a
Filipino, and such mi­nor children had not been enrolled in Philippine schools
during her period of residence in the coun­try, she cannot qualify for
naturalization under the interpreta­tion of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason behind the requirement that chil­dren

clear that the general purpose of the first paragraph of Section 15 was

to remedy this situation that the Philippine legislature enacted Act No.

made by the Secretary of Justice in 1941 is enlightening:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'It is true that under Art­icle 22 of the (Spanish) Civil Code, the
wife follows the na­tionality of the husband; but the Department of state of
the United States on October 31, 1921, ruled that the alien wife of a Filipino
citizen is not a Filipino citizen, pointing out that our Supreme Court in the
leading case of <span class="SpellE">Roa</span> v. Collector of Customs (23 Phil.

granted to alien wives would become illusory.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is submitted that such a construction, being contrary to the
manifested object of the statute, must, be rejected.</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Choy King Tee and the
second Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha, emphasis was laid on the need for
aligning the construction of Section 15 with "the national policy of selec­tive
admission to Philippine citizenship." But the question may be asked, is it
reasonable to suppose that in the pursuit of such policy, the legislature
contem­plated to make it more difficult, if not practically impossible in some
instances, for an alien woman marrying a Filipino to become a Filipina than any
ordinary appli­cant for naturalization, as has just been demonstrated
above?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems but natural and logical
to assume that Section 15 was intended to extend special treatment to alien
women who by marrying a Filipino irrevocably de­liver themselves, their
possessions, their fate and for­tunes and all that marriage implies to a
citizen of this country, "for better or for worse".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps there can and will be cases wherein
the personal conveniences and benefits arising from Philippine citizenship may
moti­vate such marriage, but must the minority, as such cases are bound to be,
serve as the criterion for the construction of law?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it is not farfetched to believe
that in joining a Filipino family, the alien woman is somehow disposed to
assimilate the customs, beliefs and ideals of Filipinos among whom, after all,
she has to live and associate, but surely, no one should expect her to do so
even before marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it may be
con­sidered that in reality the extension of citizenship to her is made by the
law not so much for her sake as for the husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, We find the following observations
anent the national policy rationalization in Choy King Tee and Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha (the second) to be quite persuasive:</p>

<blockquote>"We respectfully suggest that this articulation of the
national policy begs the question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
avowed policy of 'selective admission' more parti­cularly refers to a case
where citizenship is <u>sought to be acquired</u> in a judicial proceeding for
naturaliza­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a case, the
courts should no doubt apply the national policy of <u>selecting</u> only those
who are worthy to become citizens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is here a <u>choice</u> between accepting or rejecting the application for
citizen­ship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this policy finds no
appli­cation in cases where citizenship is conferred <u>by operation of law.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such cases, the courts have <u>no choice</u>
to accept or reject.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the individual
claiming citizenship by operation of law proves in legal proceedings that he
satisfies the statutory re­quirements, the courts cannot do other­wise than to
declare that he <u>is</u> a ci­tizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, an individual who is able to prove that
his father is a Philippine citizen, is a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
'ir­respective of his moral character; ideological beliefs, and identifica­tion
with Filipino ideals, customs and traditions.' A minor child of a person
naturalized under the law, who is able to prove the fact of his birth in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
is likewise <i>a </i>ci­tizen, regardless of whether he has lucrative income,
or he adheres to the principles of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it is with an alien wife of a Philippine
citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She is required to prove only that
she may herself be lawfully naturalized, <span class="SpellE">i</span>. e., that
she is not one of the disqualified persons enumerated in Section 4 of the law,
in order to establish her citizenship status as a fact.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A paramount policy consideration of graver import should not
be over­looked in this regard, for it explains and justifies the obviously
deliberate choice of words.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
universally accepted that a State, in extending the privilege of citi­zenship
to an alien wife of one of its citizens could have had no other objective than
to maintain a <u>unity of allegiance</u> among the members of the family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Nelson v. Nelson, 113 <st1:state><st1:place>Neb.</st1:place></st1:state>
453, 203 N. W. 640 [1925]; see also 'Convention on the Nationality of Married
Women:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Historical Background and
Commentary.' UNITED NATIONS, De­partment of Economic and Social Affairs E/CN,
6/399, pp. 8 et seq.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Such ob­jective
can only be satisfactorily achieved by allowing the wife to acquit citizenship
derivatively through the husband</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is particularly true in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
where tradi­tion and law has placed the husband as head of the family, whose
personal sta­tus and decisions govern the life of the family group.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Corollary to this, our laws look with favor
on the unity and solidarity of the family (Art. 220, Civil Code), in whose
preserva­tion the State has a vital and endur­ing interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See Art. 216, Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it has been said that by tradition in
our country, there is a theoretic identity of person and in­terest between
husband and wife, and from the nature of the relation, the home of one is that
of the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See De la <span class="SpellE">Viña</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>, 41 Phil.
13).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should likewise be said that
because of the theoretic identity of husband and wife, and the primacy of the
husband, the nationality of the husband should be the nationality of the wife,
and the laws upon one should be the law upon the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For as the court, in <u>Hopkins v. <span class="SpellE">Fachant</span></u> (9th Cir., 1904) 65 C. C. A. 1, 130 Fed. 839,
held:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'The status of the wife follows
that of the husband, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
and by virtue of her marriage her husband's domicile became her domicile.' And
the presumption under Philippine law being that the <u>property relations</u>
of husband and wife are under the regime of conjugal partnership (Art. 119,
Civil Code), the income of one is also that of the other.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is, therefore, not congruent with our cherished traditions
of fa­mily unity and identity that a hus­band should be a citizen and the wife
an alien, and that the national treat­ment of one should be different from that
of the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it cannot be that
the husband's interests in property and business activities re­served by law to
citizens should not form part of the conjugal partnership and be denied to the
wife, nor that she herself cannot, through her own efforts but for the benefit
of the partnership, acquire such interests.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Only in rare instances should the identity of husband and wife be re­fused
recognition, and we submit that in respect of our citizenship laws, it should
only be in the instances where the wife suffers from the disqualifications
stated in Section 4 of the Revised Naturalization Law." (Motion for
Reconsideration, <span class="SpellE"><u>Burca</u></span><u> vs</u>. <u>Republic</u>,
<u>supra</u>.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With all these considerations in mind, We are per­suaded that it
is in the best interest of all concerned that Section 15 of the Naturalization
Law be given ef­fect in the same way as it was understood and construed when
the phrase "who may be lawfully naturalized", found in the American
statute from which it was borrowed and copied verbatim, was applied by the
American courts and administrative authorities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is merit, of course, in the view that Philippine statutes should
be construed in the light of Philippine circumstances, and with par­ticular
reference to our naturalization laws, We should realize the disparity in the
circumstances between the United States, as the so-called "melting
pot" of peoples from all over the world, and the Philippines as a
developing country whose Constitution is nationalistic al­most in the
extreme.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the writer of this
opi­nion cannot be the last in rather passionately insisting that our
jurisprudence should speak our own concepts and resort to American authorities,
to be sure, entitled to admiration and respect, should not be regarded as
source of pride and indisputable authority.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Still, We cannot close our eyes to the undeniable fact that the
provision of law now under scrutiny has no local origin and orien­tation; it is
purely American, factually taken bodily from American law when the Philippines
was under the do­minating influence of statutes of the United States Con­gress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is indeed a sad commentary on the work of
our own legislature of the late 1920's and 1930's that given the opportunity to
break away from the old American pat­tern, it took no step in that
direction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, even after America
made it patently clear in the Act of Con­gress of September 22, 1922 that alien
women marrying Americans cannot be citizens of the United States without
undergoing naturalization proceedings, our legislators still chose to adopt the
previous American law of August 10, 1855 as embodied later in Section 1994 of
the Revised Statutes of 1874, which, it is worth reiterating, was con­sistently
and uniformly understood as conferring American citizenship to alien women
marrying Americans <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u>, without having to submit to any
naturalization proceed­ing and without having to prove that they possess the
spe­cial qualifications of residence, moral character, adherence to American
ideals and American constitution, provided they could show they did not suffer
from any of the disqualifi­cations enumerated in the American Naturalization
Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ac­cordingly, We now hold, all
previous decisions of this Court indicating otherwise notwithstanding, that
under Sec­tion 15 of Commonwealth Act 473, an alien woman marrying a Filipino,
native-born or naturalized, becomes <u>ipso</u> <u>fac­to</u> a Filipina
provided she is not disqualified to be a citizen of the Philippines under
Section 4 of the same law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, an
alien woman married to an alien who is subse­quently naturalized here follows
the Philippine citizenship of her husband the moment he takes his oath as
Filipino ci­tizen, provided that she does not suffer from any of the
disqualifications under said Section 4.</p>

<p class="BODY">As under any other law rich in benefits for those coming under it,
doubtless there will be instances where unscrupulous persons will attempt to
take advantage of this provision of law by entering into fake and ficti­tious
marriages or <u>male</u> <u>fide</u> matrimonies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot as a matter of law hold that just
because of these possibi­lities, the construction of the provision should be
otherwise than as dictated inexorably by more ponderous relevant
considerations, legal, juridical and practical.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There can always be means of discovering such undesir­able practices and
every case can be dealt with accord­ingly as it arises.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">III.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The third aspect of this case requires necessarily a
re-examination of the ruling of this Court in <span class="SpellE">Burca</span>, <u>supra</u>,
regarding the need of judicial naturalization proceed­ings before the alien
wife of a Filipino may herself be considered or deemed a Filipino.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this case which, as already noted, was
submitted for decision in 1964 yet, had only been decided earlier, before Go <span class="SpellE">Im</span> <span class="SpellE">Ty</span>, the foregoing discussions
would have been sufficient to dispose of it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court could have held that despite her apparent lack of
qualifications, her marriage to her co-petitioner made her a Filipina, without
her undergoing any naturalization proceedings, provided she could sustain her
claim that she is not disqualified under Section 4 of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as things stand now, with the <span class="SpellE">Burca</span> ruling, the question We have still to decide is, may
she be deemed a Filipina without submitting to a naturalization proceeding?</p>

<p class="BODY">Naturally, if <span class="SpellE">Burca</span> is to be followed,
it is clear that the answer to this question must necessarily be in the
affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already stated, however,
the deci­sion in <span class="SpellE">Burca</span> has not yet become final
because there is still pending with Us a motion for its reconsideration which
vigorously submits grounds worthy of serious consi­deration by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this account, and for the reasons
expounded earlier in this opinion, this case is as good an occasion as any
other to re-examine the issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the said decision, Justice Sanchez held for the Court:</p>

<blockquote>"We accordingly rule that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) An alien woman married to a Filipino who desires to be a citizen of
this country must apply <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> by fil­ing a
petition for citizenship re­citing that she possesses all the qualifications
set forth in Section 2 and none of the disqualifications under Section 4, both
of the Re­vised Naturalization Law; (2) Said petition must be filed in the
Court of First Instance where petitioner has resided at least one year imme­diately
preceding the filing of the petition; and (3) Any action by any other office,
agency, board or official, administrative or other­wise - other than the
judgment of a competent court of justice - certifying or declaring that an
alien wife of the Filipino citizen is also a Filipino citizen, is hereby
declared null and void.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We treat the present pe­tition as one for
naturalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or, in the words of law,
a 'petition for citizenship'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is as
it should be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because a reading of the
petition will reveal at once that efforts were made to set forth therein, and
to prove afterwards, compliance with Sections 2 and 4 of the Revised
Naturalization Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court
itself apparently considered the petition as one for naturalization, and, in
fact, declared petitioner 'a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.’”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In other words, under this holding, in order for an alien woman
marrying a Filipino to be vested with Filipino citizenship, it is not enough
that she pos­sesses the qualifications prescribed by Section 2 of the law and
none of the disqualifications enumerated in its Section 4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over and above all these, she has to pass
thru the whole process of judicial naturali­zation, apparently from declaration
of intention to oath-taking, before she can become a Filipina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In plain words, her marriage to a Filipino is
absolute­ly of no consequence to her nationality <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span>
that of her Filipino husband; she remains to be the national of the country to
which she owed allegiance before her marriage, and if she desires to be of one
nationality with her husband, she has to wait for the same time that any other
applicant for naturali­zation needs to complete, the required period of ten
year residence, gain the knowledge of English or Spanish and one of the
principal local languages, make her children study in Filipino schools, acquire
real property or engage in some lawful occupation of her own independently of
her husband, file her declaration of intention and after one year her
application for natu­ralization, with the affidavits of two credible witnes­ses
of her good moral character and other qualifications, etc., etc. until a
decision is rendered in her favor, after which she has to undergo the two years
of probation, and only then, but not before she takes her oath as citizen, will
she begin to be considered and deemed to be a citizen of the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Brief­ly, she can become a Filipino citizen
only by judicial declaration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such being the import of the Court's ruling, and it being quite
obvious, on the other hand, upon a cursory reading of the provision in
question, that the law intends by it to spell out what is the "effect of
naturalization on (the) wife and children" of an alien, as plainly
indicated by its title, and inasmuch as the language of the provision itself
clearly conveys the thought that some effect beneficial to the wife is intended
by it, rather than that she is not in any manner to be benefited thereby, it
behooves Us to take a second hard look at the ruling, if only to see whether or
not the Court might have overlooked any relevant consideration warranting a conclusion
differ­ent from that contained therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is undeniable that the issue before Us is of grave importance,
considering its consequences upon tens of thousands of persons affected by the
ruling therein made by the Court, and surely, it is for Us to avoid, whenever
possible, that Our decision in any case should produce any adverse effect upon
them not contemplated either by the law or by the national policy it seeks to
enforce.</p>

<p class="BODY">AMICI CURIAE in the <span class="SpellE">Burca</span> case,
respectable and im­pressive by their number and standing in the Bar and well
known for their reputation for intellectual integrity, legal acumen and
incisive and comprehensive resourcefulness, in research, truly evident in the
quality of the memorandum they have submitted in said case, invite Our at­tention
to the impact of the decision therein thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The doctrine announced by this Honor­able Court for the first
time in the pre­sent case - that an alien woman who marries a Philippine
citizen not only does not <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u> herself become a citizen but
can acquire such citizenship only through ordinary naturalization proceed­ings
under the Revised Naturalization Law, and that all administrative actions
'certifying or declaring' such woman to be a Philippine citizen are 'null and
void' -has consequences that reach far beyond the confines of the present
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Con­siderably more people are
affected, and affected deeply, than simply Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Zita</span>
N. <span class="SpellE">Burca</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
newspapers report that as many as 15 thousand women married to Phi­lippine
citizens are affected by this de­cision of the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are women of many and diverse
nationalities, including Chinese, Spanish, British, American, Co­lumbian,
Finnish, Japanese, Chilean, and so on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These members of the community, some of whom have been married to
citizens for two or three decades, have all exercised rights and, privileges re­served
by law to Philippine citizens, They will have acquired, separately or in
conjugal partnership with their citizen husbands, real property, and they will,
have sold and transferred such property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Many of these women may be in professions membership in which is limited
to citizens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Others are doubtless
stockholders or offi­cers or employees in companies engage in business
activities for which a certain percentage of Filipino equity content is
prescribed by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these married
women are now faced with possible divestment of personal status and of rights
acquired and privileges exercised in reliance, in complete good faith, upon a
reading of the law that has been accepted <i>as </i>correct for more than two
decades by the very agencies of government charged with the administration of
that law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We most respectfully sug­gest
that judicial doctrines which would visit such comprehensive and far-reaching
injury upon the wives and mothers of Philippine citizens deserve intensive
scrutiny and re-­examination."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">To be sure, this appeal can be no less
than what this Court attended to in <span class="SpellE">Gan</span> <span class="SpellE">Tsitung</span> vs. Republic, G.<i> </i>R. No. L-20819, <st1:date year="1967" day="21" month="2">Feb. 21, 1967</st1:date>, 19 SCRA 401 - when

<blockquote>"The Court realizes, however, that the rulings in the <span class="SpellE">Barretto</span> and Delgado cases - although referring to
situations the equities of which are not identical to those obtaining in the
case at bar - may have con­tributed materially to the irregula­rities committed
therein and in other analogous cases, and induced the parties concerned to
believe, although erroneously, that the pro­cedure followed was valid under the
law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Accordingly, and in view of the implications of the issue
under consideration, the Solicitor Gene­ral was required, not only, to com­ment
thereon, but, also, to state 'how many cases there are, like the one at bar, in
which certificates of naturalization have been issued after notice of the
filing of the petition for naturalization had been published in the Official
Gaz­ette only once, within the periods (a) from January 28, 1950' (when the
decision in Delgado v. Republic was promulgated) 'to May 29, 1957' (when the <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Son Cui was decided) 'and (b) from May 29, 1957 to
Novem­ber 29, 1965' (when the decision in the present case was rendered).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After mature deliberation, and in the light of the reasons
adduced in appellant's motion for reconsideration and in the reply thereto of
the Government, as well as of the data contained in the later, the Court holds
that the doctrine laid down in the <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Son Cui case
shall apply and affect the validity of certificates of naturalization is­sued <u>after</u>,
not on or before May 29, 1957."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Here We are met again by the same problem.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Gan</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">Tsitung</span></u>, the Court had to expressly enjoin the prospec­tive

in <span class="SpellE"><u>Burca</u></span> is still under reconsideration, while
the ruling in <u>Lee <span class="SpellE">Suau</span> Ay</u>, <u>Lo San <span class="SpellE">Tuang</span></u>, <u>Choy King Tee</u> and others that followed
them have at the most become the law of the case only for the parties
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there are good grounds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, all We have to do now is to re-examine the said
rulings and clarify or modify them.</p>

<p class="BODY">For ready reference, We <span class="SpellE">requote</span> Section
15:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 15.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Effect of

</span>- Any woman who is now or may hereafter be married to a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and who might herself be law­fully naturalized shall be deemed a citizen of the
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Minor children of persons natura­lized under this law who
have been born in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
shall be con­sidered citizens thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A foreign-born minor child, if dwelling in the Philippines at
the time of the naturalization of the parents, shall automatically become a
Philippine citizen, and a foreign-born minor child, who is not in the
Philippines at the time the parent is naturalized, shall be deemed a Philippine
citizen only during his minority, unless he begins to reside permanently in the
Philippines when still a minor, in which case, he will continue to be a
Philippine citizen even after becoming of age.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A child born outside of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Phi­lippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
after the naturalization of his parent, Shall be considered a Philippine

<p class="BODY">It is obvious that the main subject-matter and purpose of the
statute, the Revised Naturalization Law or Common­wealth Act 473, as a whole,
is to establish a complete procedure for the judicial conferment of the status
of citizenship upon qualified aliens.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After laying out such a procedure, remarkable for its elaborate and
careful inclusion of all safeguards against the possibility of any undesirable
persons becoming a part of our citizenry, it carefully but categorically states
the consequence of the naturalization of an alien undergoing such procedure it
prescribes upon the members of his immediate family, his wife and children,<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">25</span></span></a>
and, to that end, in no uncertain terms it ordains that: (a) all his minor
children who have been born in the Philippines shall be "considered
citizens" also; (b) all such minor children, if born outside the
Philippines but dwelling here at the time of such naturalization "shall
automatically be­come" Filipinos also, but those not born in the
Philippines, and not in the Philippines at the time of such naturaliza­tion,
are also "deemed citizens" of this country provided that they shall
lose said status if they transfer their per­manent residence to a foreign
country before becoming of age; (c) all such minor children, if born outside of
the Philippines after such naturalization, shall also be “consi­dered"
Filipino citizens, unless they expatriate themselves by failing to register as
Filipinos at the Philippine (Ame­rican) Consulate of the country where they
reside and take the necessary oath of allegiance; and (d) as to the wife, she
"shall be deemed a citizen of the Philippines" if she is one
"who might herself be lawfully naturalized".<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">26</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">No doubt whatever is entertained, so <span class="SpellE"><u>Burca</u></span>
holds very correctly, as to the point that the minor children, falling within
the conditions of place and time of birth and resi­dence prescribed in the
provision, are vested with Philip­pine citizenship directly by legislative fiat
or by force of the law itself and without the need for any judicial pro­ceeding
or declaration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(At p. 192, 19 SCRA.)
Indeed, the language of the provision is not susceptible of any other
interpretation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is claimed that
the same expression "shall be deemed a citizen of the Philippines" in
reference to the wife, does not necessarily connote the vesting of citizenship
status upon her by legislative fiat because the antecedent phrase requiring
that she must be one "who might herself be lawfully naturalized"
implies that such status is intended to attach only after she has undergone the
whole process of judicial naturalization required of any person desiring to
become a Filipino.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated otherwise, the
ruling in <span class="SpellE"><u>Burca</u></span> is that while Section 15
envisages and in­tends legislative naturalization as to the minor children, the
same section deliberately treats the wife differently and leaves her out for
the ordinary judicial naturalization.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, it goes without saying that it is perfectly within the
constitutional authority of the Congress of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to confer or vest citizenship status by legisla­tive fiat. (U.S. v. Wong Kim

foreign religious prelates,<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">27</span></span></a> hence there is no reason it cannot
do it for classes or groups of persons under general conditions applicable to
all of the members of such class or group, like women who marry Filipinos,
whether native-born or naturalized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
issue before Us in this case is whether or not the legislature has done so in

one of the most respected authorities on political law in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region><a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">28</span></span></a>
observes in this connection thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"A special form of natura­lization is often observed by some states
with respect to wo­men. Thus in the Philippines a foreign woman married to a
Filipino citizen becomes <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u> naturalized, if she be­longs

Philippine Laws." (<span class="SpellE">Sinco</span>, Phil. Political Law

reiterated in the 1962 edition, citing Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha and
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Cua</span>, <u>supra</u>.)<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">More importantly, it may be stated, at this juncture, that in
construing the provision of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
statutes from which our law has been copied,<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">28-a</span></span></a> the American courts have held
that the alien wife does not acquire Ameri­can citizenship by choice but by
operation of law. "In the Revised Statutes the words 'and taken' are
omitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ef­fect of this statute is
that every alien woman who marries a citizen of the United States becomes
perforce a citizen her­self, without the formality of naturalization, and
regard­less of her wish in that respect." (USCA 8, p. 601,[1970 ed.],
citing Mackenzie v. Hare, 1913, 134 P. 713, 165 Cal. 766, affirmed 36 S. Ct.
106, 239 U.S. 299, 60 L ed. 297.)</p>

<p class="BODY">We need not recount here again how this provision in question was
first enacted as paragraph (a) of Section 13, by way of an insertion into Act
2927 by Act 3448 of Novem­ber 30, 1928, and that, in turn, said paragraph was
copied verbatim, from Section 1994 of the Revised Statutes of the United
States, which by that time already had a long ac­cepted construction among the
courts and administrative authorities in that country holding that under such
provi­sion an alien woman who married a citizen became, upon such marriage,
likewise a citizen by force of law and as a consequence of the marriage itself
without having to under­go any naturalization proceedings, provided that it
could be shown that at the time of such marriage, she was not disqualified to
be naturalized under the laws then in force.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To repeat the discussion We already made of these undenia­ble facts
would unnecessarily make this decision doubly ex­tensive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only point which might be reiterated for
em­phasis at this juncture is that whereas in the United States, the American
Congress, recognizing the uniform construction of Section 1994 of the Revised
Statutes to be as stated a­bove, and finding it desirable to avoid the effects
of such construction, approved the Act of September 22, 1922 explicitly
requiring all such alien wives to submit to judicial naturalization, albeit
under more liberal terms than those for other applicants for citizenship, on
the other hand, the Philippine Legislature, instead of following suit and adopt­ing
such a requirement, enacted Act 3448 on November 30, 1928 which copied verbatim
the aforementioned Section 1994 of the Revised Statutes, thereby indicating its
preference to adopt the latter law and its settled construction ra­ther than
the reform introduced by the Act of 1922.</p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, these considerations leave Us no choice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much as this Court may feel that as the
United States her­self has evidently found it to be an improvement of her na­tional
policy <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> the alien wives of her citizens to
discontinue their automatic incorporation into the body of her citizenry
without passing through the judicial scrutiny of a naturalization proceeding,
as it used to be before 1922, it seems but proper, without evidencing any bit
of colonial mentality, that as a developing country, the Philippines should
adopt a similar policy, unfortunately; the manner in which our own legislature
has enacted our laws on the sub­ject, as recounted above, provides no basis for
Us to cons­true said law along the line of the 1922 modification of the
American Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For Us to do so would be
to indulge in judi­cial legislation which it is not constitutionally
permissible for this Court to do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse,
this Court would be going precisely against the grain of the implicit
Legislative intent.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is at least one decision of this Court before <span class="SpellE"><u>Burca</u></span> wherein it seems it is quite clearly implied
that this Court is of the view that under Section 16 of the Naturali­zation
Law, the widow and children of an applicant for na­turalization who dies during
the proceedings do not have to submit themselves to another naturalization
proceeding in or­der to avail of the benefits of the proceedings involving the
husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 16 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 16.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Right of
widow and children of petitioners who have died</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- In case a petitioner should die before the
final decision has been rendered, his widow and minor children may continue the

the case shall, so far as the widow and minor child­ren are concerned, produce
the same legal effect as if it had been rendered during the life of the
petitioner."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Invoking the above provisions in their favor,
petitioners-appellants argue (1) that under said Sec. 16, the widow and minor
children are allowed to conti­nue the same proceedings and are not subs­tituted
for the original petitioner; (2) that the qualifications of the original
petitioner remain to be in issue and not those of the widow and minor children,
and (3) that said Section 16 applies whether the petitioner dies before or
after final decision is rendered, but be­fore the judgment becomes <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is force in the first and se­cond arguments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the second sentence of said Section 16 contemplates
the fact that the qualifications of the original petitioner remains the subject
of inquiry, for the simple reason that it states that 'The decision rendered in
the case shall, so far as the widow and minor children are concerned, produce
the same legal ef­fect as if it had been rendered during the life of the
petitioner.' This phrase­ology emphasizes the intent of the law to continue the
proceedings with the deceased as the theoretical petitioner, for if it were
otherwise, it would have been unneces­sary to consider the decision rendered,
as far as it affected the widow and the minor children.</blockquote>

a personal matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therein, the widow
prayed that she be allowed to take the oath of allegiance for the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, petitioner
Tan Lin merely asked that she be allowed to take the oath of allegiance and the
proper cer­tificate of naturalization, once the natu­ralization proceedings of
her deceased husband, shall have been completed, not on behalf of the deceased,
but on her own behalf and of her children, as recipients of the benefits of his
naturalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I other words, the
herein petitioner proposed to take the oath of allegiance, as a citizen of the
Philippines, by virtue of the legal provision that 'any woman who is now or may

which foreigners may acquire citizenship, but also the very power of <u>conferring
citizenship by legislative fiat</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(U.

Law of the Philippines 152 [1961 ed.]).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Constitution itself recognizes as Philippine citizens 'Those who are

Constitution).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Citizens by na­turalization,
under this provision, include not only those who are natu­ralized in accordance

ac­quire citizenship by 'derivative na­turalization' or <u>by operation of law</u>,

of her husband, or by marriage of an alien woman to a citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span> &amp; <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span>, 22. <u>op</u> <u>cit</u>. <u>supra</u>, at 152,

intent to <u>confer</u> citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Construing a similar phrase found in the old U. S. naturalization law
(Revised Statutes, <span style="">&nbsp;</span>1994), American
courts have uniform­ly taken it to mean that upon her mar­riage, the alien

<blockquote>'The phrase, "shall be deemed a citizen", in Section 1994
Revised Statute (U.S. Comp. Stat. 1091, 1268) or as it was in the Act of 1855
(10 Stat. at L. 604, Chapter 71, Sec. 2), "shall be deemed and taken to be
a citizen", while it may imply that the person to whom it relates has not
actually be­come a citizen by the ordinary means or in the usual way, as by the
judgment of a competent court, upon a pro­per application and proof, yet it
does not follow that such person is on that account practically any the less a
citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The word "deemed"
is the equivalent of "considered" or "judged", and
therefore, whatever an Act of Congress requires to be "deemed" or
"taken" as true of any person or thing must, in law, be considered as
having been duly adjudged or established concerning such person or thing, and
have force and effect accordingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When,
therefore, Congress declares that an alien woman shall, under, certain
circumstances, be "deemed" an American citizen, the effect when the
contingency occurs, is equivalent to, her being naturalized directly by an Act
of Congress or in the usual mode thereby prescribed</u>.' (Van Dyne, Citi­zenship
of the United States 239, cited in <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span>, Philippine
Citizen­ship and Naturalization 146-147 [1965 ed.]; emphasis ours).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That this was likewise the intent of the Philippine legislature
when it enacted the first paragraph of Section 15 of the Re­vised
Naturalization Law is shown by a tex­tual analysis of the entire statutory pro­vision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its entirety, Section 15 reads:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(See <u>supra</u>)</blockquote>

<blockquote>The phrases 'shall be deemed,’ ‘shall be
con­sidered,' and 'shall automatically become,' as used in the above provision,
are undoubt­edly synonymous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The leading
idea or pur­pose of the provision was to confer Philippine citizenship by
operation of law upon certain classes of aliens <u>as a legal consequence</u>,
of their relation­ship, by blood or by affinity, to persons who are already
citizens of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whenever the <u>fact of relationship</u> of
the persons enumerated in the provision concurs with the <u>fact of citizenship</u>
of the person to whom they are related, the effect is for said persons to
become ‘<u>ipso facto’</u> citizens of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
'<u>Ipso facto</u>’ as here used does not mean that all alien wives and all
minor children of Philippine citizens, from the mere fact of relationship,
necessarily become such citizens al­so.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Those who do not meet the statu­tory requirements do not <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u>
become citizens; they must apply for naturalization in order to acquire such
status.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What it does mean, how­ever, is
that in respect of <u>those persons enumerated in Section 15</u>, the
relationship to a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Phi­lippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is the operative fact which establishes the acquisition of Philip­pine
citizenship by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily, it
also determines the <u>point of time</u> at which such citizenship
commences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, under the second
paragraph of Section 15, a minor child of a Fili­pino naturalized under the
law, who <u>was born in the Philippines</u>, becomes <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u> a
citizen of the Philip­pines <u>from the time</u> the fact of rela­tionship
concurs with the fact of ci­tizenship of his parent, and the time when the
child became a citizen does not depend upon <u>the time that he is able to
prove that he was born in the Philippines</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The child may prove some 25 years after the naturalization of his father
that he was born in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and should, therefore, be 'considered' a citizen thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not mean that he became a Philip­pine
citizen only at that later time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, an alien woman who married a Philippine citizen may be able
to prove only some 25 years after her marriage (perhaps, because it was only 25
years after the marriage that her citizenship status became in question), that
she is one who 'might herself be lawfully naturalized.' It is not rea­sonable
to conclude that she <u>acquired</u> Philippine citizenship only after she had
proven that she 'might herself be lawfully naturalized.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The point that bears emphasis in this regard is that in
adopting the very phraseology of the law, the legislature could not have
intended that an alien wife <u>should not be deemed</u> a Philippine citizen <u>unless
and until</u> she proves that she might herself be lawfully naturalized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Far from it, the law states in plain terms
that she <u>shall be deemed</u> a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
if she is one 'who might her­self be lawfully naturalized.' The proviso that
she must be one 'who might herself be lawfully naturalized' is not a condition
precedent to the <u>vesting or acquisition of citizenship</u>; it is only a
condition or a state of fact necessary to establish her citi­zenship as a <span class="SpellE"><u>factum</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>probandum</u></span>, <span class="SpellE">i</span>. e., as a fact established and proved in evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The word 'might; as used in that phrase,
precisely implies that at the time of her marriage to a Philippine citizen, the
alien woman 'had (the) power' to become such a citizen herself under the laws
then in force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Owen v. Kelly, 6 DC 191
[1867], <span class="SpellE">aff'd</span> Kelly v. Owen, 76 US 496, 7 Wall 496,
19 L ed 283 [1869]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That she
establishes such power long after her marriage does not alter the fact that at
her marriage, she became a citizen.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(This Court has held) that 'an alien wife of a Filipino
citizen may not <u>acquire</u> the status of a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
<u>unless there is proof</u> that she herself may be lawful­ly naturalized'
(Decision, pp. 3-4).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under this view,
the 'acquisition' of citizenship by the alien wife depends on her <u>having
proven</u> her qualifications for citizenship, that is, she is not a citizen <u>unless</u>
and until she proves that she may herself be lawfully naturalized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear from the words of the law that
the proviso does not mean that she must <u>first prove </u>that she 'might
herself be lawfully naturalized' before she shall be deemed (by Congress, not
by the courts) a citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the
'uniform' decisions cited by this Court (at fn. 2) to support its holding did
not rule that the alien wife <u>becomes</u> a citizen only after she has proven
her qualifications for citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
those decisions ruled was that the alien wives in those cases failed to prove
their qualifications and there­fore <u>they failed to establish their claim to
citizenship</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus in <u>Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha v. <span class="SpellE">Galang</span></u>, 101 Phil.
459 [1957] the case was remanded to the lower court for determination of
whether petitioner, whose claim to citizenship by marriage to a Filipino was
disputed by the Go­vernment, 'might herself be lawfully naturalized,' for the
purpose 'of <u>proving her alleged change of political status from alien to
citizen</u>' (at 464).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Cua</u></span><u> v. Board</u>, 101 Phil. 521 [1957], the alien
wife who was being deported, claimed that she was a Philippine citi­zen by
marriage to a Filipino.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court
finding that there was no proof that she was not disqualified under Section 4
of the Revised Naturalization Law, ruled that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'No such evidence appearing on record, <u>the claim of as­sumption of
Philippine citizenship</u> by <span class="SpellE">Tijoe</span> Wu <span class="SpellE">Suan</span>, upon her marriage to pe­titioner, is untenable.' (at
523) It will be observed that in these decisions cited by this Court, the lack
of proof that the alien wives 'might (themselves) be lawfully naturalized' did
not necessarily imply that they did not become, in truth and in fact, citizens
upon their marriage to Fili­pinos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
the decisions merely held was that these wives failed to estab­lish their claim
to that status <u>as a proven fact.<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In all instances where citi­zenship is conferred by operation
of law, the time when citizenship is conferred should not be confused with the
time when citizen­ship status is established as a proven fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, even a natural-born citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
whose citizenship status is put in issue in any proceeding, would be required
to prove, for instance, that his father is a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in order to factually establish his claim to citizenship.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">#</span></span></span></a> His citizenship status commences from the
time of birth, although his claim thereto is established as a fact only at a
subsequent time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, an alien
woman who might herself be lawfully naturalized be­comes a Philippine citizen
at the time of her marriage to a Filipino husband, not at the time she is able
to establish that status as a proven fact by showing that she might herself be
lawfully naturalized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, there is
no differ­ence between a statutory declaration that a person is deemed a
citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
<u>provided his father is such citizen</u> from a declaration that an alien
woman married to a Filipino is a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Phi­lippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
<u>provided she might herself be lawfully naturalized</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both be­come citizens by operation of law;
the former becomes a citizen <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u> upon birth; the later <u>ipso</u>

<blockquote>"It is true that unless and un­til the alien wife proves that
she might herself be lawfully naturalized, it cannot be said that she has estab­lished
her status <u>as a proven fact</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
neither can it be said that on that account, she did not become a citizen of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If her citizenship status is not ques­tioned
in any legal proceeding, she obviously has no obligation to establish her
status as a fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a case, the
presumption of law should be that she is what she claims to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(U. S. v. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, S
Phil. 375 [1905]; <span class="SpellE">Hila­do</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Assad</span>,
51 O.G. 4527 [1955]). <span style="">&nbsp;</span>There is a
presumption that a representation shown to have been made is true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Aetna In­demnity Co. v. George A. Fuller,
Co., 73 A. 738, 74 A. 369, 111 ME. 321)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The question that keeps bouncing back as a con­sequence of the
foregoing views is, what substitute is there for naturalization proceedings to
enable the alien wife of a Philippine citizen to have the matter of her own
citizenship settled and established so that she may not have to be called upon
to prove it <span class="SpellE">everytime</span> she has to perform an act or
enter into a trans­action or business or exercise a right reserved only to
Filipinos?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ready answer to such,
question is that as the laws of our country, both substantive and procedural,
stand today, there is no such procedure, but such paucity is no proof that the
citizenship un­der discussion is not vested as of the date of mar­riage or the
husband's acquisition of citizenship, as the case may be, for the truth is that
the same situa­tion obtains even as to native-born Filipinos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every-time the citizenship of A person is
material or indis­pensable in a judicial or administrative case, what­ever the
corresponding Court or administrative autho­rity decides therein as to such
citizenship is gene­rally not considered as <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span>, hence it has to be threshed out
again and again as the occasion may demand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This, as we view it, is the sense in which Justice <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
referred to "appropriate proceed­ing" in <span class="SpellE">Brito</span>
v. Commissioner, <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
only the good sense and judgment of those subsequently in­quiring into the
matter May make the effort easier or simpler for the persons concerned by
relying somehow on the antecedent official findings, even if these are not
really binding.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may not be amiss to suggest, however, that in order to have a
good starting point and so that the most immediate relevant public records may
be kept in order, the following observations in Opinion No. 38, series of 1958,
of then Acting Secretary of Justice Jesus C. Barrera, may be considered as the
most appropriate initial step by the interested par­ties:</p>

<blockquote>"Regarding the steps that should be taken by an alien wo­man
married to a Filipino citizen in order to acquire Philip­pine citizenship, the
procedure followed in the Bureau of Immi­gration is as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alien woman must file a peti­tion for the
cancellation of he alien certificate of registra­tion alleging, among other
things, that she is married to a Filipino citizen and that she is not
disqualified from acquiring her husband's citizenship pursuant to section 4 of
Common wealth Act No. 473, as amended.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the filing of said petition which should be accompanied or
supported by the joint affidavit of the petitioner and her Fili­pino husband to
the effect that the petitioner does not belong to any of the groups disquali­fied
by the cited section from becoming naturalized Filipino citizen (please see
attached CEB Form 1), the Bureau of Immigra­tion conducts an investigation and
thereafter promulgates its order or decision granting or denying the petition."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Once the Commissioner of Immigration
cancels the sub­ject's registration as an alien, there will probably be less
difficulty in establishing her Filipino citi­zenship in any other proceeding,
depending naturally on the substance and vigor of the opposition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before closing, it is perhaps best to clarify that this third
issue We have passed upon was not touched by the trial court, but as the point
is de­cisive in this case, the Court prefers the matter be settled once and for
all now.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the judgment of the Court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> dismissing appellants' petition for injunction is hereby reversed
and the Commissioner of Immigration and/or his authorized representative is
permanently enjoined from causing the arrest and deportation and the confisca­tion
of the bond of appellant Lau Yuen <span class="SpellE">Yeung</span>, who is here­by

to her co-appellant <span class="SpellE">Moy</span> <span class="SpellE">Ya</span>

of this decision is a brief study of all the naturalization laws of the United
States from 1790 to 1970 showing how the matter of qualifications and
disqualifica­tions, whether racial or otherwise, have been treat­ed in the said
statutes, from which it can be readily seen that the disqualification of alien
wives from becoming citizens has not been always exclusively on racial grounds
during the period that the Act of Feb. 10, 1855 and, later, section 1994 of the
Revised Statutes were in force.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">REYES, J.B.L., <i>J.</i>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I regret not being able to assent to the opinion of Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without
prejudice to a more extended opinion and in order not to delay the release of
the decision, I am expressing here the basic reasons for my <span class="SpellE">disconformity</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pivotal problem is whether the provision of section 15 of our
Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473) requires that an alien woman,
married to a Filipino citizen, must prove that she possesses all the
qualifications and none of the disqualifications prescribed by said law, in
order to be deemed a Filipino citizen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The affirmative has been the constant doctrine of this Court since 1957,
in the first <u>Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha</u> case (101 Phil. 459)
or at the very least since 1959, in <u>Lee <span class="SpellE">Suan</span> <span class="SpellE">Sy</span></u> vs. <span class="SpellE"><u>Galang</u></span>, 106
Phil. 713.</p>

<p class="BODY">This established doctrine would now be set aside primarily on the
basis that section 15 of our Naturalization Law is a verbatim reproduction or
exact copy of section 1994 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (Act of
Congress of February 10, 1855); that because said section of the Revised
Statutes had been uniformly construed by American courts as requiring merely
that the woman marrying a citizen should not be disqualified herself from becoming
a citizen, that a similar interpretation must be given to the aforesaid section
15 of our own Naturalization Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">This view might be tenable if the Philippine statute had been <u>in</u>
<u>its</u> <u>entirety</u> a reproduction of the American model.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But where the coincidence is limited to a
section of the Philippine statute, which taken as a whole is different in
requirements and spirit I submit that the rule advocated by the main opinion
does not apply, and that our section 15 should be construed conformably to the context
and intendment of the statute of which it is a part, and in harmony with the
whole.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is worth noting that the American law of naturalization
stresses primarily the disqualifications for citizenship (see USCA, Title 8,
sec. 363 to 366 and 378).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only
positive qualifications are “bona fide intention to become a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> and to renounce for­ever all
allegiance and fidelity" to a previous sovereign (Do., sec. 372) and
residence for the specified period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is particularly true of the American law at the time the first law was enacted
concerning acquisition of citizenship by alien women married to <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
citizens (the Act of <st1:date year="1855" day="10" month="2">Feb­ruary 10,
 1855</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under such
conditions, it is understandable that the interpretation of the words “who
might herself lawfully be naturalized" should be that the marrying alien
woman should not be disqualified from becoming a citizen.</p>

<p class="BODY">But our naturalization law separates qualifications from disqual­ifications;
the positive qualifications under section 3 thereof express a policy of
restriction as to candidates for naturalization as much as the
disqualifications under section 4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
it has been shown in our decision in the second Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span>
Ha case (Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha vs. <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>,
G.R. No. L-21332, <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1966</st1:date>,
16 SCRA 416) that those not disqualified under section 4 could not necessarily
qualify under section 3, even if the residence qualification were
disregarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, by giving
to section 15 of our Naturalization Law the effect of excluding only those
women suffering from disqualification under section 3 could result in admitting
to citizenship women that section 2 intends to exclude in these circums­tances,
I do not see why the American interpretation of the words "who might
herself he lawfully naturalized” should be considered binding in this
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The spirit of the American law, decidedly favorable to the absorp­tion
of immigrants, is not embodied in our Constitution and laws, because of the
nationalistic spirit of the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">In effect, the main decision introduces marriage to a citizen as
a means of acquiring citizenship, a way not contemplated by Article IV of the
Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">I am not unaware of the fact that the decisions of this Court
have made very difficult the acquisition of citizenship by alien woman marry­ing
Filipinos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the remedy lies in a
change of the statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it is not
amiss to observe here that since 1959, when the present doctrine on the matter
was adopted, the Legislature has not expressed any dissent <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
when it could have easily altered or clarified the legal pro­visions affected
if Congress were convinced that this Court had misinter­preted its intent.</p>
