				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This action for illegal detainer began in the justice of the peace court of 
Catbalogan, Samar. It involves a parcel of foreshore land which plaintiff had 
acquired before the last war by lease from the Government thru a revocable 
permit. After liberation, defendants obtained permission from her to construct a 
building thereon for certain specified rentals.
<p>Alleging that the contract had expired, plaintiffs brought suit in 1957. In 
that inferior court she obtained judgment. On appeal to the court of first 
instance the parties submitted the case upon the following stipulation of 
facts:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol><li>That plaintiff has been in the possession of the said land since 1936 by 
virtue of RPA Permit No. 5260 (R-4155) issued by the Bureau of Lands in favor of 
Ramona Reyes; 

<p></p></li><li>That plaintiff has been paying to the aforesaid Bureau the Permit fees in 
connection with RPA Permit No. 5260. * * * 


<p></p> <p></p></li><li>That defendants was able to obtain her original possession of the said 
premises by virtue of a verbal contract with the plaintiff to occupy the same on 
a lease of month to month basis at the rate of P50.00, at the same time that she 
was considered a member of the Samar Cooperative;<p></p> <p></p></li><li>That the defendant was paying these rentals up to 2 or 3 months before the 
fire that razed Catbalogan on April 1, 1957, which fire also burned down the 
building of the Samar Cooperative Store managed by the defendant and which was 
built on the premises on question;<p></p> <p></p></li><li>That after the fire the plaintiff prevented the defendant to construct a 
building in the said premises but the defendant insisted in constructing the 
temporary shed;<p></p> <p></p></li><li>That on June 24, 1957, a formal demand to vacate the land in question was 
made by the plaintiff to the defendant as evidenced by Exhibit "E", but the 
defendant did not heed this demand;<p></p> <p></p></li><li>That the basis in which the said demand was made was due to the act that 
plaintiff was about to construct thereon her own building. * * *<p></p> <p></p></li><li>That on April 26, 1957, the defendant has filed her own application for the 
land in question with the Bureau of Lands, Manila, which is Exhibit "1" in the 
expediente;<p></p> <p></p></li><li>That defendant relies on her application for said land by virtue of a 
decision issued by the Bureau of Lands dated April 10, 1944, which is Exhibit 
"2" hereof;<p></p> <p></p></li><li>That a letter was sent by the Bureau of Lands to Arturo Reyes, who is the 
appointed administrator of the property of Ramona Reyes as evidenced by Exhibit 
"A-1", which respect to an inquiry as a result of Exhibit "2", which letter is 
Exhibit "A" of the records;<p></p> <p></p></li><li>That sometime in June 30, 1956 a decision was made by the Bureau of Lands 
with respect to the case of Andrea Uycoque, et als. <i>vs</i>. Ramona Reyes, et 
al., which forms Exhibit "E" of the records;<p></p> </li><li>That until date hereof, no decision has been made as far received from the 
Bureau of Lands with respect to the application of Maria Villaflor. * * * 
</li></ol></blockquote>
<p>The Honorable Fidel Fernandez, Judge, rendered judgment for plaintiff and 
required defendants to vacate the premises, without damages but with costs. 
Defendants appealed, and in their printed brief insist (a) that plaintiff's 
right to the possession of the land had expired upon cancellation of her permit 
during the Japanese occupation; (b) that the question should be submitted to the 
Bureau of Lands and Department of Agriculture; and (c) that plaintiff should be 
required to return to them the rentals they had paid.</p>
<p>In awarding possession to plaintiff, His Honor made these pertinent 
remarks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The only issue in a detainer case is the physical possession of the land; 
not necessarily <i>possession de jure</i> but <i>possession de facto</i>. In a 
contract of lease, the lessor temporarily transfers to the lessee the possession 
of property leased subject to its terms. The expiration of its terms puts an end 
to the contract. And the possession of the lease and the expiration of the 
terms, are the elements of an action for detainer.</p>
<p>It being admitted that there existed a contract of lease by the month, the 
plaintiff as the lessor and the defendants the lessee, and the contract having 
expired at the time of the defendants to vacate, the refusal of the defendants 
to vacate constitutes an illegal detainer as is defined in section 1, Rule 72 of 
the Rules of Court. * * *</p>
<p>The claim of the defendants that plaintiff's permit application was cancelled 
(Exhibit "2"), and that defendants submitted their application for permit to the 
land (Exhibit "1") is immaterial in the present proceedings in which only 
possession is involved. * * *."</p></blockquote>
<p>The above is sound legal reasoning. Indeed one of the conclusive presumptions 
prohibits the tenant from denying the title of his landlord at the time of the 
commencement of the relation of landlord and tenant between them<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>. The defendants here would claim that 
plaintiff <i>had no right to sublease</i> to them this parcel of land when, 
sometime in 1957, they agreed verbally to take it at P50.00 a month. They rest 
this denial on the alleged cancellation of her lease permit in April, 1944. But 
as the law says, the lease may not deny the title of his or her lessor etc., 
these defendants may not <i>now assert that in 1957</i> plaintiff <i>had no 
title</i> or right to lease such foreshore land to them<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span>.</p>
<p>This view of the case makes it unnecessary to discuss the question whether 
the dispute should be presented before the Bureau of Lands or Department of 
Agriculture. The judgment of the court <i>a quo</i> is affirmed, with costs. So 
ordered.</p><i>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Paredes, Dizon, De Leon,</i> and <i>Natividad, JJ.,</i> concur. <br><br><br>
