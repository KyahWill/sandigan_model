against a resolution of the Court of Appeals reinstating a dismissed appeal, as
having been issued in excess of jurisdiction and with grave abuse of
discretion.</p>

<blockquote>Private respondents <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Juanerio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Severa</span> <span class="SpellE">Ron­tos</span>, had through their counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> M. Rojas, filed on <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1967</st1:date>, their notice of appeal from an order of dis­missal,
for being <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>,
of the complaint filed by them as plaintiffs against respondent as defendant
issued by the <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> court of first instance.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The Manila court's dismissal order dated November 26, 1966 found that on December
3, 1964, judgment had been rendered also by the Manila court of first instance
in a previous case (Civil Case No. 39380) between the same parties and
involving ownership of the same land (co­vered by petitioner's T. C. T. No.
60920-Manila)"declaring (plaintiff) <span class="SpellE">Alegar</span>
Corporation the owner and entitled to the pos­session of the land occupied by
the defendants (spouses).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this
decision, defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals but the same was
dismissed on <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1965</st1:date>."
It therefore de­clared that the second case filed by respondents as plaintiffs
against petitioner as defendant for a declaration of ownership over the same
land "is now barred by prior judgment which has become final and <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">executory</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span>
and, therefore, <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>"
and ordered the dismissal thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>After the elevation of respondents' appeal from the dis­missal
order to the appellate court, they failed to file within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> sixty-day period after notice, which expired
on <st1:date year="1967" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1967</st1:date>,
their printed record on appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
In its resolution of <st1:date year="1966" day="20" month="12">December 20,
 1966</st1:date>, received by respon­dents' counsel on <st1:date year="1968" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1968</st1:date>, the appellate court <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">pro<span style="text-decoration: none;">­</span>prio</span></u>
accordingly dismissed the appeal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On January 22, 1968, respondents' counsel filed a so-called urgent
motion for reconsideration of the appellate court's dismiss­al of the appeal,
alleging that lie had written on November 2, 1967, prior to the expiration of
the sixty-day period a letter to respon­dents addressed to <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Juanerio</span> informing them of the deadline and requesting
them to provide the amount of P150.00 to cover the printing expenses of the
record on appeal, but that the letter "was never received by him nor his
wife, the other appellant, <u>because in the meanwhile Mr. <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Juanerio</span> had died</u> and the post office employee
charged with the custody of the letter would not give it to Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Juanerio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the letter was returned unclaimed." Counsel submitted
respondent <span class="SpellE">Severa</span> <span class="SpellE">Juanerio's</span>
affidavit of January 22, 1968, wherein she stated that she received in the first
week of November, 1967 a registry notice of counsel's letter addressed to her
late hus­band but tried to get the "<u>registered letter</u>" three
times from the Manila post-office to no avail, and that shortly after Jan­uary
5, 1968 she was surprised to receive a letter from her counsel informing her of
the dismissal of their appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>The appellate court in its resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1968</st1:date>, received by respondents' counsel
on <st1:date year="1968" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1968</st1:date>,
upheld petitioner's opposition and denied respondents' motion to reinstate the
dismissed appeal, "it appearing that the failure to file the printed
record on appeal was apparently due to counsel's negli­gence<span class="GramE">.
"</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Under date of March 6, 1968, respondents' counsel on behalf of
respondents filed a motion for reconsideration of the <span class="SpellE">appelllate</span>
court's denial of his motion to reinstate the appeal "on the ground that
plaintiff-appellant, <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Juanerio</span>,
hav­ing died, the undersigned counsel had ceased to represent him in the case
as of the time he died" and that “<u>plaintiff-appellant, <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Juanerio</span>, died around
the latter part of September, 1967</u>,"<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
prior to the deadline for filing the printed record on appeal on November 15,
1967, citing the provisions of Rule 3, section 17 on substitution of deceased
parties.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In its opposition, petitioner expressly charged that these
allegations of respondents' counsel were "misleading and fabri­cations"
and submitted to the appellate court, copy of said coun­sel's pleading entitled
"Manifestation and Motion" dated Jan­uary 26, 1967 filed in the case
with the lower court, wherein counsel expressly informed said court that <u>"on
January 3, 1967, <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Juanerio</span>,
one of the plaintiffs . . . died at the Veterans Memorial Hospital; </u>he is
survived by his wife, <span class="SpellE">Severa</span> <span class="SpellE">Rontos</span>
<span class="SpellE">Juanerio</span> who is also a party-plaintiff in this case,
and a son, Leonardo," and asked the lower court for a ten-day extension to
file a motion for reconsideration of the lower court's order of dismissal of
the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner further stated that
such fact of death of <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> as early as <st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="1"><u>January 3, 1967</u></st1:date><u> </u>indicated
the lack of merit and factual basis of respondents' first motion, for counsel
would not be addressing a letter to <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span>
"knowing him to be dead already<span class="GramE">. "</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>The appellate court nevertheless summarily ordered the reinstatement
of the appeal in its resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="15" month="3">March
 15, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On petitioner's
motion for reconsideration of <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="4">April 4,
 1968</st1:date>, urging that it had "through misrepresentations and <span class="GramE">fabrications ..</span> (<span class="GramE">been</span>) misled into
reconsidering the dismissal of the appeal and reinstating the same", it
issued its resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="17" month="4">April 17,
 1968</st1:date>, requiring the appellants to furnish this court within 10 days
from notice hereof and in the meanwhile the motion for reconsideration is held
in abeyance until the submission of the required death certificate."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondents' counsel submitted on May 10, 1968, the required death
certificate which in fact showed that <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> had
actually died on <u>January 3, 1967</u>, as well as his opposition to the
petitioner's motion for reconsideration wherein he dis­claimed any
misrepresentation and fabrication" and attributed the discrepancy in his
representations to "human limitations" as "due to pressure and
volume of work, one is left with no suf­ficient time to scrutinize voluminous
records", and asserted that "the fact of death, and not the date
thereof, is the principal issue involved in the reinstatement of the
appeal" since such death terminated his authority to represent the
deceased.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The appellate court in its resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1968</st1:date> denied petitioner's motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence,
this petition.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court finds that the above facts fully justify petitioner's
contention that respondents' counsel committed gross misrepre­sentations in
seeking the reinstatement of their appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In their first motion for reconsideration of January 22, 1968, counsel
and respondent <span class="SpellE">Severa</span> <span class="SpellE">Rontos</span>,
contrary to the actual fact of <span class="SpellE">Venancio's</span> death since
the year before on <u>January 3, 1967</u> sought to have the appellate court
understand that <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> had but re­cently died
"in the meanwhile" that counsel had written his alleged letter of
November 2, 1967 addressed to the deceased <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their second motion for reconsideration of
<st1:date year="1968" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1968</st1:date>, res­pondents'
counsel went further and flatly misstated to the appel­late court that <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> "died around the latter part of September,
1967".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other ground for setting
aside the dismissal order alleged by respondents' counsel that <span class="SpellE">Venancio's</span> death terminated his authority to represent the
deceased as counsel is likewise shown by the record itself to be untenable,
since soon after the death of <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> on January 3,
1967, counsel continued to be authorized to represent the deceased - more
accurately, the deceased's heirs<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> -
as well as the co-plaintiff spouse, as counsel did in fact represent them, both
in the case in the lower court as well as in all the proceedings in the
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel's failure to ask for the
formal substitution of the heirs of the de­ceased in his place, and counsel's
continuing the case in the name of the deceased as party plaintiff does not
serve as a valid ground for the setting aside of the dismissal order, issued by
the appellate court on the basis of counsel's negligence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Since both grounds on which the appellate court could have
conceivably based its order reinstating the appeal are shown by the record to
be palpably untrue, the Court is constrained to order the setting aside of such
reinstatement order as having been issued with grave abuse of discretion
amounting to excess of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court, in reaching this conclusion, examined the merits of respondents' appeal
on the basis of the plead­ings of the parties in the lower court and duly noted
that no ten­able ground was submitted by respondents to show error in the lower
court's ruling that their action is barred by <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>
