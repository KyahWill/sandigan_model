				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The core of the problem we are called upon to resolve - <span style="">simply s</span>tated - is whether a husband
may be deprived of his powers of administration over conjugal partnership
properties upon mere allegations of abuse of such powers.</p>

<p class="BODY">This issue came about upon facts to be narrated below:</p>

<p class="BODY">Juan <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span>, petitioner, and Maria <span class="SpellE">Aldecoa</span> de <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span>, one of the
respondents, are husband and wife.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner concedes for present purposes<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
that Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Manucao</span>-A, situate in <span class="SpellE">Hinigaran</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, is
conjugal property of said spouses.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Since 1948, the spouses have been commuting between the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Spain</st1:place></st1:country-region> where
they also own real properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the
husband shuttled more frequently between the two countries on account of the
manage­ment of the hacienda.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Manucao</span>-A had been managed by
one <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Bilbao</span>, from
1952 to 1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Juan <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span>,
however, maintained overall supervision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then in 1965, Jon <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span>, a son of the spouses,
took over as manager.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1966, Juan <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span> instructed their younger son, Jose Mari <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span>, to assist Jon <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span> in the
management of the hacienda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jon <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span> did not allow him to participate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also refused to let Jose Mari act as
Cashier of the hacienda even as the latter was so designated by the
father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dissension between the two
developed.</p>

<p class="BODY">This prompted the wife to leave <st1:country-region><st1:place>Spain</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in May of 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her mission was to iron
out the differences between the two brothers and to inquire into the affairs of
the hacienda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this purpose, she
brought with her a letter from Juan <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span> to the sons
and a list of matters she was to ascertain and report to her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Claim is made by the husband that she never
made any such report.</p>

<p class="BODY">In June of 1967, Jon <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span> resigned
from his position as manager of the hacienda in a letter addressed to his
parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resignation was accepted by
Juan <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Whereupon, <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Bilbao</span>,
who was then in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE">Spain</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE">, was designated by the husband to take his son's place.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Bilbao</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> arrived in this
country on <st1:date year="1967" day="19" month="8">August 19, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jon <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span> refused
to turn over the hacienda to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bilbao</span></st1:place></st1:city>
upon the claim that his mother already took possession and administration of
the hacienda since his resignation in June of 1967.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, the wife filed a verified petition dated <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="9">Septem­ber 5, 1967</st1:date> in the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental (<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,

sought the administration of the conjugal partnership properties, or, in the
alternative, separation of property with <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
petition that she be appointed receiver <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
grounds were that her husband was not in a position to manage the conjugal
properties directly and personally owing to his age (77 years) and his blind
left eye; and that he abandoned petitioner and their conjugal properties
without just cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent judge
granted her <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> petition on the
same day.</p>

<p class="BODY">Forthwith, the husband, through counsel, moved to set aside the
order appointing his wife receiver <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
wife opposed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1967</st1:date>,
respondent wife filed a supplemental petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She asked respondent judge to modify the <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="9">September 5, 1967</st1:date> order by appointing instead a
disinterested person, preferably the Bank of the Philippine Islands, as
receiver if said disputed order cannot be fully and immediately implemented.</p>

<p class="BODY">Answer to the petition and the supplemental petition was filed on
<st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="9">September 5, 1967</st1:date>
order was set aside by respondent judge on October 7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wife's October 14 motion to reconsider
failed of its purpose on <st1:date year="1967" day="23" month="10">October 23,
 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Juan <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span>, in his answer of October 3,
traversed the averments in his wife's petition, set up affirmative defenses and
counter­claim and sued out a third-party complaint against Jon <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same
time, Juan <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span> moved for the issuance of a writ of
prelim­inary mandatory and preventive injunction to compel his wife and son to
turn over to <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Bilbao</span>
Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Manucao</span>-A and to make them desist from
interfering with <span class="SpellE">Bilbao’s</span> administration of the
hacienda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issuance of a writ of
preliminary mandatory and preventive injunction was opposed by wife and son.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1967</st1:date>,
Jon <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span> answered Juan <span class="SpellE">Ysasi's</span>
third party complaint heretofore adverted to.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, on <st1:date year="1967" day="10" month="11">November 10,
 1967</st1:date>, the Bank of the Philippine Islands, mortgagee of the
hacienda, filed an Urgent Motion to Authorize Crop Loan Releases.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, the husband, Juan <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span>
- who earlier that same month arrived from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Spain</st1:place></st1:country-region>
- asked the court that the releases <span class="GramE">be</span> made to
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Objection thereto was registered by
the wife.</p>

<p class="BODY">The wife's Reply and Answer to the Counterclaim was filed on <st1:date year="1967" day="10" month="11">November 10, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her petition was further amended on <st1:date year="1967" day="22" month="11">November 22, 1967</st1:date> to elaborate on
her charges of fraud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Answer was made by
the husband on <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="11">November 30, 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1967</st1:date>,
respondent judge came out with the disputed order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion thereof reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations the
petition for preliminary<span style="font-size: 12pt;">
</span>mandatory injunction is hereby denied.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“With respect to the release of the crop loan lines, the Court
shall resolve this question at a later date.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the meantime the Bank of the Philippine Islands is hereby ordered to
give monthly allowance of P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>, each, to the
plaintiff and defendant, any time upon demand from receipt of this order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, it is hereby announced
that if within a period of ten (10) days from receipt of this order no serious
objection is received from any of the parties, Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Manucao</span>-A
shall be ordered placed under the receivership of the Bank of the Philippine
Islands who shall use to the opera­tion and financing of the Hacienda out of
the crop loan previously granted by said Bank, and the profits shall be
liquidated after the termination of this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, before the property is taken from the possession of the
plaintiff wife, the Bank of the Philip­pine Islands shall be ordered to pay all
expenses incurred by her in connection with the operation of the Hacienda
during the period of her possession."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's move to reconsider was rejected by respondent judge
on <st1:date year="1968" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Came</span> the present petition before this
Court. Petitioner here seeks, on certiorari, to annul the orders of December
22, 1967 and January 17, 1968; and a mandatory injunction to compel private
respondents Maria <span class="SpellE">Aldecoa</span> de <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span>
and Jon <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span> to turnover, to petitioner the
possession and control of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Manucao</span>-A.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The husband is the
administrator of the conjugal partnership.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is a right clearly granted to him by law.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
More, the husband is the <u>sole</u> administrator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wife is not entitled - as of right - to
joint administration.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The husband may even enforce right of possession against the wife who has taken
over the administration without his consent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, the wife may be punished for contempt for her refusal to deliver to
him the conjugal assets.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
She may be required to render full and complete accounting of such properties.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, it is the
wife's prerogative to ask the courts to remove administration of the conjugal
properties from the husband for her protection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This, Article 167 of the Civil Code concedes, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"<span style="">Art.</span> 167<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>In</u></span> <u>case</u>
<u>of</u> <u>abuse</u> <u>of</u> <u>powers</u> <u>of</u> <u>administration</u>
of the conjugal partnership property by the husband, the courts, on petition of
the wife, may provide for a receivership, or administration by the wife, or
separation of property."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent wife has taken advantage of this <span class="SpellE">codal</span>
provision by instituting Civil Case 8306 aforesaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her main gripe is abandon­ment and fraud
amounting to abuse of powers of administration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As if this were not enough, she asked for the appointment of a receiver <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>, that
is, before she <span style="">had </span>adduced
evidence to confirm her assertions of fraud.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent judge, at first, granted her petition in an order dated <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="9">September 5, 1967</st1:date>, only to set it
aside afterwards.</p>

<p class="BODY">But when petitioner asked, by way of a preliminary mandatory
injunction, that respondents - wife and son - be compelled to deliver the
hacienda to the manager, <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Bilbao</span>,
respondent judge refused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private
respondents' insistent assertions of fraud on the part of the husband could
have befuddled the issue, misdirected respondent judge's course of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well to remember, however, are <span class="SpellE">Tolentino’s</span> observations on this point, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:</p>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, the changes
introduced by our code <u>have</u> <u>not</u> <u>relegated</u> <u>the</u> <u>husband</u>
<u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>position</u> <u>of</u> <u>an</u> <u>ordinary</u> <u>administrator</u>
<u>of</u> <u>another's</u> <u>property</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He himself has an interest in the community property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although certain rights are now recognized in
the wife, authorizing her to intervene in and question some acts of the
husband, the code still assumes the existence of a residuary authority in the
latter with respect to the administration of community property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The grant of certain rights to the wife is
specific, and must be restrictively construed, so that all others not granted
expressly cannot be considered as enjoyed by her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right to require the husband to render an
accounting is not among those granted to her.”<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Neither may the husband be divested of his administration upon
mere assertions of fraud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These must
first be proven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law presumes good
faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We prefer to adhere to, rather
than depart from, the wise rule:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Fraus</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><u>est</u></span></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>odiosa</u></span> <u>et</u> <u>non</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>praesumenda</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Here, we have but bare
allegations of fraud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
husband, accordingly, is entitled to take over possession and management of the
hacienda.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent judge's
announced intention to place the hacienda under receivership of the Bank of the
Philippine Islands is a virtual reversal of his order setting aside the
appointment of a receiver in the person of the wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Receivership has been rightfully tagged as a
harsh remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be granted with
extreme caution.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The purpose of receivership, as a provisional remedy, is to preserve or protect
the rights of the parties during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the
main action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To apply this remedy to the
case at hand is to lose sight of its purpose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At stake here are the husband's power of administration and the wife's
right to be protected from abuse thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The wife's right rests upon proof of such abuse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Absent that proof, the wife's right does not
exist.</p>

<p class="BODY">Receivership is also aimed at the preservation of, and at making
more secure, existing rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly,
it cannot be used as an instrument for the destruction of those rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conclusion remains:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner may not be forced to surrender his
statutory right to ad­minister the conjugal properties by the simple expedient
of merely charging him with the naked averment that he has forfeited that
right.</p>

<p class="BODY">Receivership at this stage is improper.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we perceive the
necessity of protecting petitioner husband's right to management, so are we
concerned with the possible abuses that may ensue <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
and which may result in damage to the <span class="GramE">wife.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we balance in one equation the interests
of husband and wife in the premises, we feel that mandatory injunction should
issue but only upon bond.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>
