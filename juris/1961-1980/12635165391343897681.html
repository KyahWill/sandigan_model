the exception of the last, in the Finance Service of the Philippine Army, the
first as Colonel and Chief of said service, the second as Major and Chief of
the Audit and Fiscal Branch thereof, the third as Captain and Officer-in-Charge
of its Audit Section, the fourth as Captain, in charge of pre-auditing and

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="9" month="5">May 9, 1962</st1:date>,
petitioners Ramos, <span class="SpellE">Capalongan</span>, Reyes, <span class="SpellE">Joven</span>, Joaquin and <span class="SpellE">Ascueta</span>,
together with other members of the Armed Forces and some private individuals,
as well as several unknown persons, were accused, in Criminal Case No. 11440 of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, of "<span class="SpellE">malversation</span> through falsifica­tion of public and
commercial documents." The information in that case alleged that, during
the period from July 1, 1960 to June 30, 1961, and for sometime prior and
subsequent thereto, in the Munici­pality of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>,
Province of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, said defendants, conspiring with
one another and with intent of gain, did then and there commit a series of
falsifications of public documents,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
by causing it to appear that emergency purchases of lumber, aggregating 522,
634 board feet, had been made for the 501st Engineer Combat Group, HPA, Ft.
William McKinley, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
from the United Lum­ber, and delivered by the latter to the former, although
there were really no such emergency purchases that were duly authorized, no
projects requiring such purchases, and no actual deliveries of lum­ber, apart
from the fact that the United Lumber was a non-existent firm, that the alleged
payments thereto were false and that funds for allotments not intended for the
purpose were used <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, thereby defrauding the
Government in the sum of P135,805.48, to the damage and prejudice of the
Republic of the Philippines in the aforesaid amount.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ten (10) days later, or on <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1962</st1:date>, Criminal Cases Nos. 11437, and 11473 to
11490, of the same court, for "<span class="SpellE">estafa</span> thru
falsifi­cation of public or official documents", were filed against some
of petitioners herein and other persons not parties in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date, Ramos and other defendants
in these nineteen (19) cases commenced Civil Case No. 7135 of said court, for
prohibition, with preliminary injunction, to restrain the Government
prosecutors from "causing the filing of any additional information or
charges against them<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
similar to Criminal Case No. 11440 and from causing their arrest and
detention." An order of said court, presided over by Honorable Guillermo
Torres, Judge, dated <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1962</st1:date>,
missed this prohibition case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
the aforementioned nine­teen (19) cases (Nos. 11437, and 11473 to 11490) were,
on motion of the prosecution, after a re-investigation conducted by Hon. <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> P. Nicolas, the then Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, dismissed, on <st1:date year="1962" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="1">January 2, 1963</st1:date>,
Criminal Cases Nos. 12200 to 12204 of said court, charging <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>
thru falsification of public and commercial documents, were filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some of the petitioners herein were
defendants in two (2) of said cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> In an order, dated October 18,
1963, Judge <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mencias</span>
- who presided one of the branches of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> - dismissed these five (5) cases, upon the ground
that the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> therein do not conform
substantially to the prescribed form and may place the de­fendants therein in
danger of being punished five (5) times for the same offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution seems to have appealed from
said order, - upon the ground that two (2) of said cases belonged to a branch
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> presided over
by ano­ther Judge - but the record does not show what became of the appeal thus
taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1964</st1:date>,
the new provincial fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Honorable
Benjamin H. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, filed Criminal Cases Nos. 13202
to 13221 of the Court of First Instance of said Province, against Ramos and
some of his co-petitioners herein, apart from other persons, charging them with
<span class="SpellE">malversation</span> thru falsification of public and/or
commercial documents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Soon, thereafter, or on or about March 18, 1964 and subse­quently
thereto, Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> began to conduct a preliminary
inves­tigation of several other cases of <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>
thru falsification, al­legedly committed by Ramos and others, and covered by
I.S.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a>
Nos. 8238 to 8244, 8719 to 8726 and 8945 of the office of the Provincial Fiscal
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, which later became the subject-matter of
Criminal Cases Nos. 13740 to 13754 of the Court of First Instance of the same
province.</p>

<p class="BODY">These events impelled petitioners herein to file, on Septem­ber
4, 1964, the present action for prohibition, with preliminary injunction,
against the aforementioned Judge Torres and Provincial Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, as well as Hon. Emilio A. <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span>,
as Chief of the Prosecution Division, Department of Justice - who collaborated
with the Provincial Fiscal in the prosecution of said cases - and the Chief of
Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, for the al­leged purpose:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) of avoiding "multiplicity of suits
and the op­pressive exercise of legal authority"; (2) of preventing
"the ac­cused from being harassed and persecuted" by said
respondents; and (3) of preventing "excessive bail."</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of this contention, petitioners averred that the cases
of alleged <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> thru falsification of public
and com­mercial documents involved in Criminal Cases Nos. 11440, 12200 to
12204, and 13202 to 13221, "are connected and united", inasmuch as
the recitals in the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> filed therein reveal
identity of the language, the accused, the offended party, the period within
which the offenses had been committed, the fraudulent acts or omis­sions
performed and the documents falsified; that said <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
were filed without conducting the requisite preliminary investigation; that,
unless restrained by this Court, respondent prosecutors would file a number of
other identical and connected cases against petition­ers herein; that the
latter would thereby be placed in jeopardy of punishment more than once for the
same offense; that the bail recommended in each case was P30,000; and that,
considering the number of cases already filed and those which may, otherwise,
be filed after the commencement of the present action, said recom­mendation
would have the effect of denying petitioners' right to bail and, hence, of
depriving them of liberty, without due process of law, because they could not
afford to file a bond for P30,000 in each one of the cases adverted to
above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners prayed, there­fore,
that their:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction be granted by commanding
the respondent Judge Torres to desist from further proceeding with the trial of
the twenty (20) cases of <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> thru
falsification of public and commercial documents or Criminal Cases Nos. 13202
to 13221 and to regard these twenty (20) cases as closed or dismissed; to
enjoin respondents Prosecutor Emilio A. <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> or
his assistants and respondent Provincial Fiscal Benjamin H. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
or his assistants from filing in court the cases against Col. Ramos, his
co-petition­ers and his co-respondents in IS. Nos. 8238 to 8244 and IS. Nos.
8719 to 8726, IS. 8945 and other identi­cal and connected cases or any other
case or cases now filed with them by the Philippine Army or by Gen. Alfredo M.
Santos, or the SALIGA<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> against Col. <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span>
M. Ramos and the other petitioners or his co-respondents; to require the
respondents herein to pay the costs of this action; and to grant to the
petitioners such other relief as may be just and equitable under the
premises."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon urgent motion of petitioners herein, soon after the ins­titution
of this case, and the posting of a bond in the sum of P20,000, we issued, on
September 21, 1964, a restraining order enjoining the respondents to
refrain:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) "from enforcing the
warrants of arrest issued on or after September 12, 1964, in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>"; (2) from "further
proceeding with the trial of Criminal Cases Nos. 13202 to 13221" of the
same court; and (3) "from filing in court cases against herein petitioners
in connection with I.S. Nos. 8238 to 8244, and I.S. Nos. 8719 to 8726, and I.S.
No. 8945" of the office of the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would seem, however, that, before notice of this restrain­ing
order was served, Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> had filed the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> re­lative to the subject-matter of said
information sheets, which <span class="SpellE">in­formations</span> were docketed
as Criminal Cases Nos. 13740 to 13754 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the
first subdivision of the restraining order was so amended, on <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1964</st1:date>, as to expressly
prohibit the enforcement of the warrants of arrest issued in said cases Nos.
13740 to 13754.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their answer, respondents alleged, however, that the crime
charged in Criminal Case No. 11440 is distinct and separate from the offenses
charged in the other cases; that the crimes involved in the latter are
different from each other and from the one charged in Cri­minal Case No. 11440;
that each one of said cases involves different vouchers, different sums of
money, different effects, different sup­pliers, dealers or vendors or alleged
suppliers, dealers or vendors, and different projects; that the charges
preferred against petitioners herein were the result of several months of
investigation made by the National Bureau of Investigation and the Inspector
General of the Army; that the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> in said
cases were filed after the requisite pre­liminary investigations had been
conducted by the Government prose­cutors; that the filing of said charges and <span class="SpellE">informations</span> bore, also, the approval of the Secretary of
National Defense; and that the P30,000 bail originally recommended by the
prosecution had been re­duced to P500 in each case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a review of the record, we are satisfied that petitioners
herein have not established their right to the writ prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is well-settled that, as a matter
of general rule, the writ of prohibition will not issue to restrain criminal
prosecution.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a>
Hence, in Hernandez v. <st1:place>Albano</st1:place><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a>, we called attention to the fact
that:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> a
Rule -- now of long standing and frequent application -- was formulated that
ordinarily criminal prosecution may not be blocked by court prohibition or
injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Really, if at every turn
investigation of a crime will be halted by a court or­der, the administration
of criminal justice will meet with an undue setback.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the investigative power of the Fiscal
may suffer such a tremendous shrinkage that it may end up in hollow sound
rather than as a part and parcel of the machinery of crimi­nal justice."</blockquote>

<blockquote>This general rule is based, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> on
the fact that the party has an adequate remedy at law by establishing as a
defense to the pro­secution that he did not commit the act charged, or that the
statute or ordinance on which the prosecution is based is invalid, and, in case
of conviction, by tak­ing an appeal."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the rule is subject to exceptions.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> As
pointed out in the Hernandez case:</p>

<blockquote>"We are not to be understood, however, as saying that the
heavy hand of a prosecutor may not be shackled -- under all circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule is not an invariable one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Extreme cases may, and actually do, exist
where relief in equity may be availed of to stop a purported enforcement of a
criminal law where it is necessary (a) for the orderly administration of
justice; (b) to prevent the use of the strong arm of the law in an <u>oppressive</u>
and vin­dictive manner; (c) to avoid <u>multiplicity of actions</u>; (d) to
afford adequate protection to constitutional rights; and (e) in proper cases,
because the statute relied upon is <u>unconstitutional</u>, or was '<u>held
invalid</u>'.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Considering the allegations in the petition herein, as tra­versed
in respondents' answer, and the documents annexed to said pleadings, we are not
prepared to declare that the case at bar falls under any of the foregoing
exceptions, for:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the bond originally recommended for
the provi­sional liberty of the defendants in the cases adverted to above was
P30,000, it is conceded that the same has been reduced to P500 in each case.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners' allegation to the effect that no
preliminary investigations had been conducted before the filing of <span class="SpellE">informations</span> against them is emphatically denied by
respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, this is a
matter that should be, but, has not been, brought to the at­tention of
respondent Judge.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As regards the plea of double jeopardy, the
record does not show that petitioners have been placed in jeopardy, in the
legal sense, even once.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, this
question, like that of the alleged absence of a preliminary investigation,
should be, but has not been raised in the trial court.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither have petitioners shown that the
offenses charged in Cases Nos. 12200 to 12204, 13202 to 13221, and 13740 to
13754 form part of or are included in the information in Case No. 11440.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact:</p>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vouchers involved in each case are other
than those falsified in the other cases;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amount <span class="SpellE">malversed</span>
in each case is other than the amounts defrauded in the other cases;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are strong indications that, as
respondents allege in their answer, Criminal Cases Nos. 11437, 11473 to 11490
refer to the so-called "Army Retirement Pay Racket", involving
civilian and military personnel, who connived to collect the money value of
accumulated furloughs of fictitious claimants; that Criminal Case No. 11440
refers to lumber allegedly purchased for the 501st Engineer Combat Group, Fort
McKinley; that Criminal Cases Nos. 13202 to 13211 and 13216 to 13218 involve si­mulated
purchases of engineering and construction ma­terials for the <span class="SpellE">VIth</span> Engineering Combat <span class="SpellE">Batallion</span>,
at <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City;
that the objects of the offenses charged in Criminal Cases Nos. 13212 to 13215
and 13219 to 13221 were assorted quartermasters' supplies alleged­ly bought for
the Post Quartermasters Detachment of the Philippine Army; that Criminal Cases
Nos. 13740, 13741, and 13750 to 13754 refer to quartermasters supplies, cov­ered
by 302 Government vouchers, allegedly bought for the 2nd Quartermaster, II
Military Area, 2nd Infantry Division, in <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span>,
Laguna; and that Criminal Cases Nos. 13742 to 13749 involve supplies covered by
521 Go­vernment vouchers <span class="SpellE">simulatedly</span> bought for the
3rd Infantry Division in Camp <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The supplier or supposed supplier or vendor in
each case is different from the supplier or vendor in the other cases; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(e)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants are not the same in all of the
cases, We have not even found two (2) cases with iden­tical defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, there are some cases in which <u>none</u>
of the petitioners herein are accused.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, it may not be amiss to bear in mind that, in
a leading case, we had occasion to postulate:</p>

<blockquote>"In effect, it will be noted that although all the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> in the 27 falsification cases were uni­formly
worded, the numbers of the vouchers alleged to have been falsified and the
amounts thereof, are different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have
in the three (3) cases, subject of the proceeding at bar, Voucher No. 4, dated <st1:date year="1955" day="3" month="9">Septem­ber 3, 1955</st1:date>, for P2,275.00;
Voucher No. 6, dated <st1:date year="1955" day="6" month="9">September 6, 1955</st1:date>,
for P3,590.00; and Voucher No. 13, dated <st1:date year="1955" day="6" month="9">September
 6, 1955</st1:date>, for P3,410.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
other <span class="SpellE">informations</span> also show different vouchers,
dates and amounts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These undeniable
facts, alleged in the <span class="SpellE">informations</span>, evidently show
that different acts of falsification were committed on different vouchers and
covering distinct amounts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each
information did not refer to all said acts of falsifica­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is there merit in the argument that
said acts of falsification constituted a continuing of­fense, so as to have
them all prosecuted in only one information.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> "<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as respondent Judge has not been given a chance to pass
upon the questions raised in the present case, and the re­cords before us are
inadequate to permit a judicious determination of said questions, particularly
the issue of identity of the offenses charged in the different cases, we are of
the considered opinion that, without prejudice to seeking the proper remedy in
the lower court,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a>
the petition herein should be, as it is hereby dismissed, and the writ prayed

dissolved and set aside, with costs against the petitioners.</p>
