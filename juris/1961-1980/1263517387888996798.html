Defendant appealed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o’clock</st1:time>
in the night of July 17, 1962, when appellant <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Talaboc</span>, <span style="">Jr.,
</span>and four other companions, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Francisco Quiroz, Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Porcadilla</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lito</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercadal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> Sidney, were at the store of the sisters Virginia
and <span class="SpellE">Rosenda</span> <span class="SpellE">Batulan</span> in
barrio <span class="SpellE">Linao</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were drink­ing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Francisco <span class="SpellE">Bugtai</span>, a
laborer of the <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> Sugar Central, who at times
worked under the supervision of appellant <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Talaboc</span>, Jr., a <span class="SpellE">capataz</span>, passed
by.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant called <span class="SpellE">Bugtai</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The latter approached
appellant who asked him where he was going followed by an invitation to take
beer.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bugtai</span>
refused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, he told appellant,
"I have here twenty <span class="GramE">centavos,</span> you please give me
another twenty centavos so that we can buy Coca-cola." Appellant who was
already a little bit tipsy took this for an insult and threatened to harm <span class="SpellE">Bugtai</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant
accompanied this threat by placing his hand at his waist where a bladed six
inch long weapon akin to a Japanese saber was tucked.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Vivencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Labarda</span>,
sergeant of the rural police, was then on patrol in barrio <span class="SpellE">Linao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With him were <span class="SpellE">Potito</span>
Sotto, Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Medroso</span> and Roberto <span class="SpellE">Abaño</span>, all also of the rural police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon hearing the threat aired by appellant
against <span class="SpellE">Bugtai</span>, <span class="SpellE">Labarda</span>
approached the two.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He tried to persuade
appellant into foregoing with his intention to assault <span class="SpellE">Bugtai</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He identified himself as <span style="">a </span>rural policeman, showed his badge
to appellant, and asked appellant to turn over his weapon with a promise to
return the same as soon <span style="">as </span>appellant
was ready to go <span style="">home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Appellant stabbed <span class="SpellE">Labarda</span>,
the thrust finding its mark on the upper left clavicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bugtai</span> took to his
heels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant with the same weapon in
his hand then went after and tried to stab Roberto <span class="SpellE">Abaño</span>
and Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Medroso</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In retaliation <span class="SpellE">Abaño</span> gave appellant a fist
blow, hitting him on the left face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Potito</span> Sotto saw <span class="SpellE">Labarda</span> run
towards the street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter <span style="">was </span>then calling to him:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Potito</span>, I am
wounded." <span class="SpellE">Potito</span> went to his aid and later
brought <span class="SpellE">Labarda</span> to the hospital with the help of <span class="SpellE">Medroso</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abaño</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Labarda</span> however was
already dead on arrival.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Dr. </span><span class="SpellE">Eutiquiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Fiel</span> performed the
autopsy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He found a punctured wound on
the left <span class="SpellE">supraclavicular</span> region, with an entrance of
about 1 cm., directed internally downwards, pene­trating the thoracic cavity
injuring the large vessels (aorta) on the anterior portion of the heart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctor opined that <span class="SpellE">Labarda</span>
died of shock and internal hemorrhage consequent to the wound.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant pleads
self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His evidence is this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While in the store heretofore mentioned, an
unknown person touched his shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
turned around, received a fistic blow on his mouth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He fell to the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assailant ran towards the street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lito</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercadal</span>, one of appellant's companions, suggested that
they go home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant was about to
leave on his bicycle when several persons approached him, grabbed the bicycle
from him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of them gave him <span style="">a </span>fistic blow on the right
cheek.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He tried to run away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, he received several blows on the
back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He staggered to the ground face
downwards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He turned around, felt that
there was something hitting <span style="">his </span>buttocks
and back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 15 persons were ganging
up on him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of them was on top of
him, and with the use of a sharp-bladed weapon stabbed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He parried the blow with his two hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was able to twist the hand of the
assailant and succeeded in getting hold of the weapon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assailant tried to recover the weapon,
whereupon he gave a thrust on the left shoulder near the base of the neck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assailant's companions scam­pered
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He afterwards learned that his
assailant was <span class="SpellE">Vivencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Labarda</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing version deserves no credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an effort to dramatize his plight,
defendant overshot his mark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, as he
claims, he never threatened Francisco <span class="SpellE">Bugtai</span> who was
his friend, there is no reason why <span class="SpellE">Bugtai</span> should
testify against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As improbable <span style="">is </span>his <span class="GramE">version that while 15 persons were ganging up on him as he was
lying on the ground face</span> down­wards still he was able to perform the feat
of wresting the weapon from one of his 15 assailants, some of whom were armed
with wooden clubs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not even dare
present as evidence the sharp-pointed and bladed weapon with which he killed <span style="">his </span>supposed
assailant, <span class="SpellE">Vivencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Labarda</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Long familiar is the rule that in self-defense the burden of
proof rests upon the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His duty
it is to establish self-defense by evidence clear and convincing.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
He must rely on the strength of his own evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It matters not that the People's evidence is
weak. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">For, as well
expressed by this Court in the leading case of <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Ansoyon</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>75 Phil. 772, 777, such evidence
"could not be disbelieved after the accused himself had admitted the
killing."</span> Since the evidence in exculpation is notches below the
level of that which is clear and convincing, conviction <span style="">is </span>in order.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But for what
crime?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is the People's evidence
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assailant and victim were face
to face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to this attack <span class="SpellE">Labarda</span> first identified himself, asked appellant to desist
from harming <span class="SpellE">Bugtai</span> and to turn over his weapon with
the assurance that it would be returned as soon as the appellant was ready to
go home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bladed weapon was still
tucked at the waist of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
had to draw that weapon before he could stab the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the posture thus presented, we find
ourselves unable to say that treachery attended the commission of the offense.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="GramE">With the result that the crime is reduced to simple homicide.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">For the reasons given, the judgment under review is hereby
modified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find defendant-appellant <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Talaboc</span>, Jr. guilty
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of homicide and sentence him to
imprisonment for an indeterminate period ranging from 8 years and one day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span>, <u>mayor</u>, to 14 years, 8 months and one
day of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased
<span class="SpellE">Vivencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Labarda</span> in the sum
of P12, 000, without subsidiary imprisonment but with the accessories of the
law and to pay the costs.</p>
