of conviction of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>
in its Criminal Case No. 415, finding him guilty of murder and imposing upon
him the sentence of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>per­petua</u></span>,
to indemnify the heirs of one of the de­ceased in the sum of P6,000.00, without
subsi­diary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="8">August 23, 1963</st1:date>,
after proper preliminary investigation, Antonio Trinidad and Julio <span class="SpellE">Criso­logo</span> were charged before the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, with the crime of double murder as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 29th day of July, 1963, in the
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Bucay</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the above-named ac­cused, conspiring, confederating and
mutually helping one another, armed with sharp-pointed instruments, with
deliberate intent to kill without justifiable motive, and with treachery and
evident premeditation and abuse of superior strength, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously assault, attack and
stab one, <span class="SpellE">Claro</span> <span class="SpellE">Tejero</span>
inflicting upon him the follow­ing wounds, to wit:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stab wound, measuring about 1.5 cm. in length
and gaping of about 1.2 cm. located at a point just below the left clavicle and
about 5 cm. to the left from the <span class="SpellE">midsternal</span>
line.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is directed <span class="SpellE">posteriorly</span>
and inferiorly and slightly medially cutting the car­tilaginous portion of the
first rib on the left side together with the left <span class="SpellE">subclavian</span>
artery and vein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The upper extremity of
the wound was dull while the other extremity was sharp; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incised wound, at the anterior side of left
forearm, about 3 cm. in length and 0.1 cm. in width and depth, directed
superiorly and medially making an angle of about 35 to 45 degrees with the
horizontal axis of the body,</blockquote>

<blockquote>which wounds caused his instantaneous
death, and one, Jose <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span>, inflicting upon him
the following wounds, to wit:</blockquote>

umbilical region, left; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With the aggravating circumstance in the commission of the
crime, in that, accused Julio <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> is a re­cidivist
he having been convicted of the crime of Homicide and sentenced to suffer an
indeterminate imprisonment of 2 years, 4 months and 1 day of <span class="SpellE">pri­sion</span> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span> to 8 years
and 1 day of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> mayor as maximum and to
indemnify the heirs of the deceased, Simeon <span class="SpellE">Tuscano</span>
in the sum of P6,000.00"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"CONTRARY TO LAW."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1963</st1:date>,
both accused were arraigned and with the assistance of their respective
counsels <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> pleaded "not
guilty" to the charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the
prosecution had presented its first witness, upon request of his coun­sel and
without objection of the fiscal, Julio <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> was
allowed by the court to change his plea to that of "guilty" to double
homicide only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The information was thus
read again to accused Julio <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> already with
the charge reduced to double homicide and so, he pleaded "guilty",
and upon request of his counsel, he was allowed to testify in order to prove
one mitigating circumstance, presumably drunkenness.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the trial, which the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> apparently
held as to both accused, notwithstanding <span class="SpellE">Crisologo's</span>
plea of guilty, as aforesaid, the court found the two accused separately liable
for their individual acts in causing the death of <span class="SpellE">Claro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tejero</span> and Jose <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span>
and held <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> to be guilty of homicide for the
death of <span class="SpellE">Claro</span> <span class="SpellE">Tejero</span> and
of slight physical injuries for inflicting a non-fatal wound upon the other
deceased, Jose <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span>, and Trinidad to be guilty
of murder for the death of the same Jose <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent portions of the deci­sion,
dated <st1:date year="1964" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1964</st1:date>,
read thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The act of conspiracy between the ac­cused Julio <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> and Antonio Trinidad in the commission of the
crime not having been proven by the prosecution, each ac­cused is responsible
and liable, under the law, for his own act and deed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDER­ATIONS, the Court finds
the accused Julio <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> guilty beyond reasonable
doubt of the crime of homicide for the death of <span class="SpellE">Claro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tejero</span> with the aggravating circumstance of
recidivism, without any mitigating circumstance to offset the same the plea of
‘guilty' could not be considered by the court (People vs. Noble, 77 Phil. 93),
and sentences him to suffer an indeterminate penalty of from Ten (10) years and
One (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u> as minimum
to Seventeen (17) years, Four(4) months and One (1) day of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>
as maxi­mum, to indemnify the heirs of the de­ceased in the amount of P6,000.00
and to pay the costs; for having stabbed and inflicted a wound on the body of
the deceased Jose <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span> which wound have not
caused his death, the accused Julio <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> is
guilty be­yond reasonable doubt of the crime of slight physical injuries
(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Amarao</span>, et al., [CA], 36 O.G. 3462), and
he is hereby sentenced to an imprisonment of Thirty (30) days of <span class="SpellE"><u>ar­resto</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>menor</u></span>
(Art. 266, par. 1 of the Penal Code).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Court also finds the accused Antonio Trinidad guilty
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder for the death of Jose <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span>, and here­by sentences him to suffer the penalty
of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> and to indemnify
the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P6,000.00, without subsidiary
imprisonment in case of insolvency, in view of the nature of the penalty
imposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He shall also pay the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"IT IS SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Only Antonio Trinidad appealed from this decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears from the evidence adduced by the prosecu­tion at the
trial that late in the afternoon of July 29, 1963, Antonio Trinidad left his
house at <span class="SpellE">Labon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bucay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, bound for the house of his friend, Alfredo Gonzales,
to see if the latter had already arrived from Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the way, he chanced upon Julio <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> near a culvert on the side of the road and the
latter, upon learning that he was to see Alfredo Gonzalez, followed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They found out, however, that Gonzales was
not yet home; so, along with <span class="SpellE">Islao</span> <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span>, whom they encountered nearby, they proceeded farther
down the road towards the south until they reached the store of <span class="SpellE">Maestra</span> <span class="SpellE">Nena</span> <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>
whereat <span class="SpellE">Islao</span> <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span> bought
three bottles of gin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this juncture,
Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Bernar­dez</span> and one named Loreto also joined
them and all together, they partook of the wine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> had about
three glass-<span class="SpellE">fulls</span> while Antonio Trinidad had
one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon, <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>
was drunk, and so was <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place> in a lesser degree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As they went out, <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>
became unruly and started to make trou­ble - trying to go back inside the
store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His companions, principally <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>,
were able to prevail upon him and so the group left the store, broke up and
each of the members went on his way home, except the two accused who went
together.</p>

<p class="BODY">Eventually, these accused reached the crossing at <span class="SpellE">Bucay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30</st1:time> in the evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, they saw an old friend, <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> <span class="SpellE">Daquigan</span> who, upon the
invita­tion of <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place> agreed to walk with them to
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Caba­ruan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As they walked along the road, <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>
challenged everybody they met, and each time <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>
held him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Final­ly, when they came upon
the place where two young men, <span class="SpellE">Cla­ro</span> <span class="SpellE">Tejero</span> and Jose <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span>, were
standing on the edge of the road, <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> rushed
forward at the two, followed by <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place> who tried to
hold <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Coming upon <span class="SpellE">Tejero</span>, <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>
stabbed him on the left side of his breast with a bolo or dagger about six (6)
inches long.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> turned his weapon on Jose <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span>
and stabbed him at the upper portion of the breast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attack on Jose <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span>
was followed by <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place> who also rushed at the boy and
stabbed him with his bolo, about five to six (5-6) inches long, in the
abdomen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wounded <span class="SpellE">Tejero</span>
scampered away from the place and ran the distance of about one hundred (100)
meters to their house where he expired in the hands of his parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span> also ran
away from his assailants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went up the
house of Pedro Gloria not far from the scene, shouting for help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Daquigan</span> who was
left about five meters behind on the road when <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>
and <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place> chanced at <span class="SpellE">Tejero</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span> at the edge of the road was stunned at
the occurrence; and as soon as the two victims and their assailants had left
the place, <span class="SpellE">Daquigan</span> also ran home.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Bucay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, rushed to the scene of the incident soon after he
received news thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He came upon the
wounded <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span> in the hands of some people who had
come to his aid at the "<span class="SpellE">batalan</span>" of Pedro
Gloria's house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding the victim still
conscious, the Chief of Police took the victim's statement (Exhibit B), which
the latter subscribed and swore to before the Mayor of the town who had also
gone to the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span> was rushed to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Abra</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Provincial</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> where he died a few hours
after his admission (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D). Before his death,
however, the Chief of Police who accompanied the victim to the hospital took
his statement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C), which the latter subscribed
before the Mayor who was also there with them.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the morning of the follow­ing day, <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="7">July
 30, 1963</st1:date>, Dr. Jose <span class="SpellE">Buhain</span>, a resident
physi­cian of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Abra</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Provincial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
performed the post mortem examination of the body of <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His findings were set forth in his necropsy
report (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Death was attributed to "shock and hemorrhage" due to multiple
perforations in the intestines caused by the penetrating stab wound in his
abdomen which was fatal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wound on
the chest was non-penetrating and was not fatal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense submitted evidence consisting of the sole testimony
of appellant and Exhibits 1 to 1-b Translation and 2 and 2-Translation, Exhibits
1 to 1-b Translation be­ing statements, made by the lone eye-witness of the
prose­cution, which were presented for impeachment purposes, and Exhibits 2 and
2-Translation being the confession of ac­cused <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>
wherein he admitted that he "was the only one who killed <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tejero</span>" and
none of his compa­nions had any participation in said killings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Testifying as sole witness for the defense, appellant gave the
following version of what happened:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the after­noon of July 29, 1963, he saw accused <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>
near the culvert at the edge of the street in barrio <span class="SpellE">Labon</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bucay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, about ten
meters from his (Trinidad's) house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
<st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place> proceeded southward, <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>
followed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Tri­nidad</st1:place>
was then on his way to the house of Alfredo Gonzales to inquire from the
latter's parents if he had already ar­rived from <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From Gonzales' house whereat they were joined
by <span class="SpellE">Islao</span> <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span>, the three
went farther south and upon reaching the store of <span class="SpellE">Icong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>, they bought gin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> drank
three bottles and <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place> and <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span>,
one each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>
became drunk and when they came out of the store, he became unruly and
unsheathed his bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He wanted to go
back into the store, <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place> held him back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After they left the store, upon reaching a
road crossing, they saw the prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Daquigan</span> who joined them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they reached the store of a certain <span class="SpellE">Andong</span>, there were two persons named Felix <span class="SpellE">Balneg</span> and <span class="SpellE">Siok</span>, stand­ing there;
<span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> wanted to stab them, <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>
held him back; when he released him, he again wanted to stab these two, but <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>
told them to go home already, which they did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From the store of <span class="SpellE">Andong</span>, the four went to the
Bal station and then proceeded eastward.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When they reach­ed near the house of one <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pasos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> rushed at
two women whom they came across there; they were able to run away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After this, they reached the house or store
of one <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Timbreza</span>,
where <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> again asked for a drink, but they did
not give him, for which reason he wanted to make trouble, but his companions,
including <st1:place>Tri­nidad</st1:place>, were able to pull him
downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As they were going out, <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> tried to stab the government witness <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> <span class="SpellE">Daquigan</span> but desisted
when <span class="SpellE">Daquigan</span> asked him why he wanted to stab
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They proceeded on their way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the words now of <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.-<span style=""> </span>And what
happened next after that?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were on our way but when we were near the
place of Petra <span class="SpellE">Duria</span>, there were two persons standing
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He again wanted to make thrust at
them but I was able to hold him back.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With what did he thrust?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With his bolo, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did you recognize that two persons?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was not able to recognize them, sir, because
it was night.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And what happened after that?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were on our way home and I told him, "<span class="SpellE">Manong</span>, give to me your bolo, because by accident you might
hurt a person", I said to him, but he did not give me his bolo, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where did you go then?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were on our way home and I told him, "<span class="SpellE">Manong</span>, give me your bolo because you may, by accident,
hurt somebody", I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>said, but he did
not like to give to me his bolo but instead he put it inside its scabbard.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And where did you go after that?</blockquote>

your bolo", but he did not like to give me his bolo and he hated me also
and I was able to touch the blade of his bolo and since then I went away
towards him.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And towards what direction did you go next?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were on our way home but the ones who were
aiding him were <span class="SpellE">Islao</span> <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> <span class="SpellE">Daquigan</span> and I
was be­hind and when I was urinating I heard somebody complaining of pain and I
said, "Why <span class="SpellE">manong</span>, why <span class="SpellE">manong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Juling</span> (referring to Julio <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>)
what did you do with that person", I said.</blockquote>

hold him back, they were not there anymore.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were you able to recognize them?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we arrived at <span class="SpellE">Labon</span>,
I heard somebody crying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We went to
visit the place where the crying originates and it was already <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> <span class="SpellE">Tejero</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What about the other one?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not see Jose <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span>,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But did you not come to know that he was
injured also?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I only came to know that he was in­jured when
they told me that Jose <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span> was injured.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Previous to that, did you have any ill-feeling
against Jose <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Claro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tejero</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> <span class="SpellE">Daquigan</span> while testifying as a witness for the prosecution
said that you were the one who stabbed from the front Jose <span class="SpellE">Pali­gutan</span>,
what can you say about that?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time when I went to hold back Julio <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>, it was also at that time that <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> <span class="SpellE">Daquigan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Islao</span> <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span> saw me.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as a matter of fact, were you the one who
stabbed Jose <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No, sir." (T.S.N., pp. 43-45)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In other words, while the prosecution tried to prove that it was <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>
who dealt the fatal stab on the de­ceased <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span>,
the defense claimed that <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place> was not the one who
did it but <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Except as to this point which, of course, is the most vital, there is no
ma­terial variance between the version of the prosecution and that of the
defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the decision of
this case must have to rest on whether or not the evidence of the prosecution
as to this vital point can be said to have established its theory beyond
reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this basis, there
are strong reasons why this Court is not con­vinced of the alleged guilt of the
appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">To start with, the testimony of the lone eye-witness presented by
the prosecution is far from being free from doubt precisely as to the said
vital point of whether or not it was appellant and not <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>
who fatally stabbed the deceased <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While at the trial, this witness did testify
that he saw appellant stab the said deceased once after <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>
had first stabbed him, it appears that when he was investigated by the
constabulary authori­ties and his statement was taken by Corporal Marcos <span class="SpellE">Taberdo</span> of the 29th PC Company that same night of July 29,
1963 when the occurrence in question took place, he declared as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.-<span style=""> </span>Who stabbed Jose <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I

<p class="BODY">Understandably, defense counsel laid the predicate for his
impeachment thus:</p>

Philippine Constabulary on the same night, is that true?</blockquote>

Trinidad, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And where was Antonio Trinidad then when you
related that story to the grandmother and grandfather of Antonio Trinidad?</blockquote>

sir.</blockquote>

investigated you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And you did not mention that Antonio Trinidad
stabbed somebody else?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, sir, I was afraid.</blockquote>

somebody else to any person in authority?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, sir.</blockquote>

except today?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You did not even tell that to the Provincial
Fiscal?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I told him, sir, when we were in his office.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When was that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Maybe that was on the 8th of November.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But is it not true that Antonio Trinidad has
been under detention ever since three days after the incident until now?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir, he was under detention."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> (T.S.N.,
pp. 13-14.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the only explanation he gives for his clearly in­consistent
declarations is fear of Trinidad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if
his tes­timony is to be believed, this fear gripped him until Novem­ber, 1963 when,
according to him, he revealed the participa­tion of appellant to the fiscal for
the first time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is strange, however,
why he should be so afraid when Trinidad was under detention all the time.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, if he was in such fear of Trinidad, it is amazing that before the
trial, the only private person to whom he would mention Trinidad as having
stabbed <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span> were precisely the grandparents of
said accused whom he allegedly feared.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even in
court, this witness admitted that Trinidad had no weapon with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only when Tri­nidad was facing the
deceased, that he (the witness) alleg­edly saw the "weapon" of
Trinidad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In answer to questions of the
court, he declared:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.-<span style=""> </span>When did you see that Antonio Trinidad had a
weapon?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
he faced Jose <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span>, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style=""> </span>You
saw the weapon of Antonio Trinidad?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style=""> </span>When
you came from the crossing and you followed them, do you know if Julio <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> was armed already?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was already, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style=""> </span>What
about Antonio Trinidad, did you see if he has an arm or weapon at that time?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style=""> </span>Where
did he get the weapon then?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was only on that time when I saw him facing Jose to have a bolo.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style=""> </span>But
you did not see him with a weapon when you came from the crossing?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was none, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style=""> </span>What
cloth did he use on that night, a polo shirt?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
polo shirt with short sleeves, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style=""> </span>And
that polo shirt was inserted in­side his pants?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style=""> </span>When
you saw that Julio <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> ... Where was the weapon
at that time?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was holding, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style=""> </span>From
the beginning when you met him in the street crossing?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style=""> </span>Was
it in its scabbard or it was with­out scabbard?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was without scabbard, sir." (T.S.N.,
pp. 19-20)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Besides, considering that admittedly it was dark then, it is
quite difficult to believe that with all the excite­ment caused by the
incident, this witness could have really distinguished between the stab given
by <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> and that allegedly given by appellant so
as to note that <span class="SpellE">Crisologo's</span> stab landed at the
throat, as he said repeatedly, and that of appellant elsewhere, even if it is
conceded that said witness was only five meters away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On top of this, there is the indubitable
evidence consisting of the necropsy re­port and the testimony of Dr. Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Buhain</span>, the medical expert who conducted the autopsy, to
the effect that the non-fatal wound found on the body of the deceased was
"at the chest about one inch right to the <span class="SpellE">sternal</span>
<span class="SpellE">natch</span>," certainly, not the throat, and that it
is possible that the two wounds on said body, the fatal and the non-fatal,
could have been caused by only one weapon, a sharp pointed instrument.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under these circumstances, it would not be fair to appellant to
give full faith and credit to this evidence of the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And We are strengthened in this conviction by
the obvious weakness and unreliability of the corroborative evidence offered by
the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two alleged ante-mortem statements of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span>, Exhibits B and C, with their transla­tions,
wherein appellant is mentioned together with <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>
as the "two persons who assaulted us" and "they stabbed us
including my companion <span class="SpellE">Claro</span> <span class="SpellE">Tejero</span>",
deserve scant consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin
with, they are couched in general terms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then, We cannot understand why the Chief of Police and the Mayor had to
take two separate statements, which are substantially identical as to the
material facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, what is more, the
Chief of Police who took down said statements in his own hand­writing
practically admitted that the deceased never told him that <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>,
the appellant, stabbed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chief
testified thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.-<span style=""> </span>You mean to say that you investigated Jose <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span> twice?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style=""> </span>And
that on the first time he only mentioned Julio <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>
as his only assailant, is that it?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style=""> </span>But
the second time you investigated him, he told you that Antonio Trini­dad was
the companion of Julio <span class="SpellE">Cri­sologo</span>, is that it?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style=""> </span>But
as a matter of fact Jose <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span> did not
specifically mention Antonio Trinidad as one of those who stabbed him?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘Two
of them,' he said, 'who attacked us', he said.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style=""> </span>But
he did not mention that Antonio Trinidad stab him?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
did not tell." (T.S.N. p. 23)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Cojeto</span> <span class="SpellE">Paligutan</span>,
notably surnamed like the de­ceased, the then Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Bucay</span>,
before whom Exhibits B and C were allegedly subscribed and sworn to, added
nothing to, but on the contrary further weakened the cause of the
prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he was asked how the
said exhibits were sworn to before him, he gave the following incredible
testimony:</p>

how did you subscribe him?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is still another circumstance which engenders grave doubts
as to the alleged guilt of the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Extant in the records of this case is the confession of <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> wherein he owned both killings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was pre­sented as evidence by the
defense, the court admitted it over the objection of the prosecution but did
not consider it of any worth in its decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Solicitor General con­tends it is hearsay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But considering that <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>
plead­ed guilty to double homicide, without any indication what so ever of any
attempt to merely help the appellant, it is Our considered opinion that said
confession, Exhibit 2, may be taken into account in weighing the credibility of
the lone eye-witness of the prosecution, considering that his testimony is
