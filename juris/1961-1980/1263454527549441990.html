				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This proceeding for disbarment was filed by complainant Angel <span class="SpellE">Albano</span> against respondent <span class="SpellE">Perpetua</span>
Coloma, a member of the Philippine Bar.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In a letter dated <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1962</st1:date>
addressed to this Court, complainant alleged that during the Japanese
occupation his mother, <span class="SpellE">Delfina</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>,
and he retained the services of respondent as counsel for them as plaintiffs in
Civil Case No. 4147 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>
Norte.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After which came the accusation
that after liberation and long after the courts had been reorganized,
respondent failed to expedite the hearing and termination of the case, as a
result of which they had themselves represented by another lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This notwithstanding, it was claimed that
respondent intervened in the case to collect her attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">was
</span>then alleged that during the hearing they were surprised when respondent
presented in exhibit <span style="">a </span>document
showing that they as well as their co-plaintiffs in the case promised to pay
her a contingent fee of 33-1/3% of whatever could be recovered whether in land
or damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A copy of such document was
attached to the letter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The more serious
charge was that the signature therein appearing, purportedly that of the
complainant, and the writing after the name of his mother were not made by
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was further stated that the
Honorable <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> B. Flores, then Judge of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, submitted the
document in question to the National Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter
referred to as NBI) together with samples of his genuine signature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A copy of the finding of the NBI was
attached, the conclusion being that the questioned signature <span style="">"is </span>NOT in the hand of the
person whose sample signatures were received."</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant stated that being a poor man, he could hardly pay for
the services of a lawyer to assist him in the disbarment proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He added the information that respondent
Coloma <span style="">"is </span>a very
influential woman in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte</st1:placename></st1:place>" as she was
then a member of the provincial board.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The prayer was for the "kind and generous help regarding this
matter in order that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Perpetua</span> Coloma may be
made to stand before the bar of justice and disbarred from the practice of her
profession as a lawyer."</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span style="">a </span>resolution
dated <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1962</st1:date>, this
Court required respondent <span class="SpellE">Perpetua</span> Coloma to answer
the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer came on <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was <span style="">a </span>specific denial of the allegation that the complainant, was
"a victim of injustice," respondent alleging that the same was
"untrue, unfounded and imaginary." While admitting that her services
were contracted by complainant and his mother and their co-plaintiffs in Civil
Case No. 4147, she stated that there was a contingent fee of one-third (1/3) of
whatever land and damages could be obtained for the plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She denied that she did nothing to expedite
the hearing and termination of such civil case as the record would show that
she filed "more than twenty (20) papers and pleadings, went <span style="">to trial </span>for several days and with the
assistance of her sister, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span> D. Coloma,
obtained <span style="">a </span>favorable judgment
in the Court of First Instance for the petitioner and his co-plaintiffs and
filed with the Honorable Court of Appeals a thirty-five (35) page brief,
finished after careful, conscientious and exhaustive study <span style="">and </span>preparation." She attached a
copy of the favorable decision rendered by Judge Simeon Ramos of November 10,
1948;<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
the decision of the Court of Appeals promulgated on October 13, 1950,
confirming the above favorable decision, which was penned by the then Justice
Gutierrez David;<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and the dismissal of a petition for certiorari to review such decision in the
resolution of this Court of January 10, 1951.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Then <span class="GramE"><span style="">came</span></span><span style=""> </span>a reference to a decision by the
Court of Appeals in CA-G. R. No. 10563-R, the complainant as one of the
plaintiffs having appealed from an order of the lower court, sustaining her
lien upon the judgment as well as "her share of one-third (1/3) of the
lands adjudicated" which according to the lower court however would
require that the proper action be filed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the opinion of the Court of Appeals penned by Justice Sanchez, <span style="">now a member of this Court, an evaluation of
her services was made thus: "<span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> served as
plaintiffs' counsel for a period of about seven years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that she was </span>diligent
in her work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That she had rendered
valuable services cannot be doubted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, the final decision favorable to plaintiffs is almost wholly the result of
her efforts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Literally, she gambled on
the success or <span style="">failure of the
litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>She was a member of
the Bar since 1940.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Gauged by the familiar </span>rule that an
attorney shall be entitled to have reasonable compensation for his services,
with a view to the importance of the subject matter of the controversy, the
extent of the services rendered, and the, professional standing of the attorney,
* * *, we feel, as did the trial court, that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
is entitled to <span style="">one-third of all </span>the
lands and damages recoverable by plaintiffs under the judgment of the Court
below."</p>

<p class="BODY">She likewise denied that she <span style="">could have </span>been removed for <span style="">her failure to </span>comply with her obligations as counsel as <span style="">she served "faithfully, efficiently, </span>continuously
and to the <span style="">best of her </span>knowledge
and capacity." Her dismissal then, according to her, <span style="">"was </span>made without cause and
without, the consent of herein respondent and only on June 18, 1951, when the
undersigned had already won the case for them in the Court of First Instance
and in the Court of Appeals." In view of the failure of the new lawyers
retained to be at times avail­able in the <span style="">Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte </span>and as pleadings
by opposing counsel mere still sent to her and out of loyalty to her former
clients she continued "to render professional legal services <span style="">to complainant </span>and his mother."
Then <span class="GramE">came</span> the allegation "that after the case was
won in the <span style="">trial </span>court and in
the Court of Appeals, complainant and his co-plaintiffs stopped seeing the
undersigned and even dis­owned their contract with her in the trial of [her]
petition to record attorney's <span style="">lien </span>which
was granted by the trial court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals."
Copies of the decisions of the trial court and the Court of Appeals were
submitted together with the answer.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
She characterized as "false and <span style="">unjust"
</span>the averment <span style="">of </span>complainant
"that the latter and his mother did not sign Annex 'A' because they really
signed the instrument in the presence of attesting witnesses who testified to
and confirmed the signing of the same, which fact (of signing) was found and
confirmed by the trial court after and affirmed by the Court of Appeals, * *
*."</p>

<p class="BODY">Then <span class="GramE">came</span> the denial of the allegation
of complainant that due to the seriousness of the charge, Judge <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> B. Flores submitted the alleged falsified <span style="">document to the NBI </span>for examination,
the <span style="">truth </span>being that it was
complainant who did so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She likewise <span style="">"specifically denies the </span>authenticity
and veracity of the alleged findings of the <span style="">National Bureau </span>of Investigation on Annex 'A' because the
signatures therein are genuine and have been found to be so by the trial and
appellate courts after hearing the testimony of the instrumental witnesses and
comparing the signatures in Annex 'A' with signatures admitted to be genuine by
the complainant as well <span style="">as </span>upon the affirmation of complainant's sister and as
co-plaintiff in Civil Case No. 4147." She then referred to a<span style=""> </span>rule which she considered well-settled
in this jurisdiction that a question of whether or not <span style="">a </span>given document is genuine falls
within the general knowledge and competence of a judge who<span style=""> </span>may inquire into its authenticity, the
testimony of instrumental witnesses sufficing, without the court being bound
even by real experts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor could she
agree that the complainant was a poor man and could hardly afford the services
of <span style="">a </span>lawyer
because thru her efforts, he and his co-plaintiffs were richer "by about
P100,000.00 (P85,000.00 in realty and P15,000.00 in cash as damages) by winning
Civil Case No. 4147 for them notwithstanding, which ingratitude had been her
reward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent also denied the
insinuation that she was using her influence as a board member.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She stated that <span style="">from </span>1944 to 1951, when she rendered
her services for complainant, she was in private life, not having been elected
to the provincial board until 1959.<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="BODY">She concluded by saying that "during her practice of law for
more than twenty (20) years /she/<span style=""> </span>has strictly adhered to the ethics of the
profession and <span style="">has </span>always been
guided by the principles of justice, fairness and respect for individual rights
and that as <span style="">a
</span>public official, /<span style="">she/ </span>has never used her influence to corrupt public servants or
ordinary citizens, and all the people of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte
well-know that complainant has no sense of justice, no integrity to preserve,
no honor to treasure and no future to build.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, the people of said province have faithfully supported
/her/ in her aspirations, first as councilor and then <span style="">as </span>board member with overwhelming majorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said support speaks of vindication and means
full faith and credit to /her/ integrity, ability and honesty." She
further submitted as affirmative defenses, the cause of action being barred by
(1) prior judgment and (2) by the statute of limitations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She prayed for the dismissal of the complaint
against her.<b style=""><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="BODY">The matter was referred to the Solicitor General for
investigation, report and recommendation in a resolution of this Court dated
September 7, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On September 12,
1967, the report and recommendation of the Solicitor General was sub­mitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked "that this case be
dismissed." We grant such a plea.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his report, the Solicitor General noted that in the investigation
conducted on his behalf by the provincial fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>
Norte, "only the complainant appeared."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
No evi­dence was introduced by him other than the NBI report on the alleged
falsified signatures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He manifested that
all his <span style="">evidence could be found in the
records of Civil Case No. 414, of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Respondent, on her part, according to the

this Honorable Court, in their respective decisions, copies of which were
attached to her answer; that said contract was signed by petitioner and the
instrumental witnesses thereto in her presence; and that she was submitting the
case on the annexes to her answer and the transcript of the trial of the
proceedings on the recording of her attorney lien in Civil Case No. 4147 * *

<p class="BODY">The facts as found by the Solicitor General in so far <span style="">as </span>the s<span style="">e</span>rvices of respondent <span style="">as
</span>counsel for the complainant and his mother were concerned reveal the
utmost diligence and conscientiousness on her part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What she said in her answer was sustained in
all respects.</p>

<p class="BODY">The express finding was then made by the Solicitor General that
the question of the genuineness and due execution to pay respondent her
attorney's fees "had already been litigated <span style="">by </span>the parties in the course of the proceedings for the
recording and enforcement <span style="">of the
attorney's lien of respondent in Civil Case No. </span>4147 <span style="">of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte; that the plaintiffs in said case (one </span><span style="">of whom is the complain</span><span style="">ant in this case) denied the, genuineness and

the </span>trial <span style="">court </span><span style="">found said document to be genuine (pp. 43-48,

document genuine * * *."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On this point an extended excerpt from the <span style="">decision of the </span>Court
of Appeals, the opinion being, penned as noted by Justice Sanchez, was
quoted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit A, the
written contract of professional services, shows that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
as plaintiffs' attorney, is entitled to one-third of <span style="">all the lands and damages </span>which may be
awarded plaintiffs; otherwise, if the case is lost, then <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
is not entitled to compensation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That Exhibit A was duly executed is a proven fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A witness to that document, namely, Sergio
Manuel, testified that the cross after the name of <span class="SpellE">Delfina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> was placed by her and that the signature of
Angel <span class="SpellE">Albano</span>, one of the plaintiffs, is the genuine
signature of the said Angel <span class="SpellE">Albano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It <span style="">is </span>true that on the witness stand <span class="SpellE">Delfina</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> denied that she
placed a cross after the typewritten words '<span class="SpellE">Delfina</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>' in Exhibit A, and that Angel <span class="SpellE">Albano</span>
likewise denied his signature therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Suffice it to </span><span style="">say </span><span style="">that this negative
testimony will not prevail over the positive testimony of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
and her witness aforesaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span>, 41 Phil., 447, 452; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>,
<span class="GramE">44 O.G.,</span> No. 1, pp. 112, 115.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Further, <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> evidence on
this point is not limited merely to Exhibit A.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The record shows that previous thereto, there was a verbal agreement
regarding said attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this
point, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> finds corroboration in the testimony
of Rosario <span class="SpellE">Lagasca</span>, a blood relation of plaintiffs,
and <span class="SpellE">Silvina</span> Guillermo.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Plaintiffs' evidence that in 1944 <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
undertook to take up the case of plaintiffs for a stipulated contingent fee of
P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> does not merit serious consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not seem probable that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> would take the case on a win-or-lose basis, i.e.,
for the sum of P2,000.00 in case the litigation is won and nothing in case of
loss, because at that time P2,000.00 was worth only a few <span class="SpellE"><span style="">gantas</span></span><span style=""> </span>of
rice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No lawyer in his right mind would
accept such <span style="">a
</span>miserable fee.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The following testimony of <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span>
<span class="SpellE">Albano</span>, one of the plaintiffs, given in an obviously
unguarded moment, stripped plaintiffs naked of the pretense that there was no
such contract for one, third share <span style="">as </span>fees:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Q - Did you not authorize your brother, Angel <span class="SpellE">Albano</span>,
or your mother, to give one-third (1/3) of all the properties and damages?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A - We authorized them.' <span class="GramE">Tr., p. 8, <span class="SpellE">Galapon</span>.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The court below, therefore, <span style="">is </span>correct in declaring that, after weighing and considering the
evidence of both parties, Exhibit <span style="">A is </span>genuine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(pp. 61-62, rec.)"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General thus concluded that the finding of <span style="">the Court </span>of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte and of the Court of Appeals that the
questioned document "is genuine, is now <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>iudicata</u></span> and bars complainant Angel <span class="SpellE">Albano</span> (one the <span style="">pla</span><span style="">intiffs
in Civil Case No. </span>4147) from raising said question anew in these
disbarment proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As repeatedly
held, the fundamental principle of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> <span style="">applies
</span>to all cases and proceedings in whatever form they may be (<span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> vs. Castro, L-9223, <span style="">June </span>30, 1956, 99 Phil. 497; 50 C.J.S. 31, 267), and a party can
not escape the bar if a judgment against him in a new suit o<span style="">n </span>the same cause of action by varying
the form of his action or adopting <span style="">a </span>different
method of presenting his case (<span class="SpellE">Wensel</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> <span style="">Consolidated

<p class="BODY">It was noted further that there was <span style="">no </span>oral testimony <span style="">as </span>to
the alleged falsification, except the report of the NBI, lacking in <span style="">persuasive force in
that it failed </span>to state <span style="">the
reason or basis for </span>its conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The observation of the Solicitor General here made <span style="">is </span>both <span style="">pertinent and rele­</span>vant: "The
mere conclusion in the aforesaid NBI report that the signature of complainant
Angel <span class="SpellE">Albano</span> on the document <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
A <span style="">was </span>not written in the same
hand that wrote the genuine specimens of his signature, without any reason or
reasons supporting it, is, therefore, of little or no value in evidence, and
consequently, it: cannot support the present charge of falsification against
respondent, apart from the fact that, as already stated, it is inadmissible on
the ground of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> by judgment."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
On the reasonableness of the contingent fee collected by<span style=""> </span>respondent, the Solicitor General
adopted the same view found in the decision of <span style="">the Court of Appeals, </span>already referred to <span style="">being <span style="">part
of respondent's answer, that such indeed was the case.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
Solicitor General could </span>thus rightfully assert that if there was anyone
guilty o<span style="">f </span><span style="">bad faith in this
case "it is </span><span style="">complainant and his co-plaintiffs in Civil Case No. </span>4147 who,
after benefiting from the valuable services of respondent in said case, tried
to renege on their agreement for the payment of the latter's contingent
attorney's <span style="">fees by </span><span style="">dismissing </span><span style="">her as their
counsel after she had already </span>won for them said case in the trial court
and the Court of Appeals, and later, by attempting to impugn the authenticity
and genuineness of their written agreement for the payment of attorney's fees,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">He was of the opinion </span>then
that even if for purposes of said case the findings in judicial cases could not
be considered binding "it <span style="">is </span>safe
to conclude, from a review of the evidence in said court proceedings <span style="">taken </span>together with the evidence
before us in this case, that respondent may be <span style="">exone<span style="">rated </span></span>herein."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
With such a <span style="">conclusion of </span>the
Solicitor General, this Court, to repeat, is in full agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Counsel, any counsel, is
worthy of his hire, is entitled to be fully recompensed for his services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With his capital consisting solely of his
brains and with his skill, acquired at tremendous cost not only in money but in
the expenditure of time and energy, he is entitled to the protection of any
judicial tribunal against any attempt on the part of a client to escape payment
of his fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is indeed ironic if
after putting forth the best that is in him to secure justice for the party he
represents, he himself would not get his due.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such an eventuality this Court is determined to avoid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It views with disapproval any and every
effort of those benefited by counsel's services to deprive, him of his
hard-earned honorarium.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an attitude
deserves condemnation.</p>

<p class="BODY">There <span style="">is </span>this additional point to consider.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span> aptly
observed:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Reputation /in the legal
profession/ is a plant of tender <span class="GramE">growth,</span> and its
bloom, once lost, is not <span style="">easily </span><span style="">restored."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
This <span class="GramE">Court,</span> certainly is not averse to having such a
risk minimized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where, as in this case,
the good name of counsel was traduced by an accusation made <span style="">in reckless
disregard of the, truth, an action prompted by base ingratitude, the severest
censure is called for.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Certainly,
this is </span>not to say that if a case were presented showing nonfeasance or malfeasance
on the part of a lawyer, appropriate disciplinary action would not be
taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not such <span style="">a case </span>however.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent, as has been so clearly shown, was
in no wise culpable; there is no occasion for the corrective power of this
Court coming into play.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the charge against respondent <span class="SpellE">Perpetua</span> Coloma, member of the Philippine Bar, <span style="">is </span>hereby
dismissed.</p>
