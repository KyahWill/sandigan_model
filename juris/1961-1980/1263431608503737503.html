the Hearing Officer and absolved respondent City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
from any liability under the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue to be resolved in this case is whether or not the
amicable settlement of Criminal Case No. 19202 by the parents-in-law of
petitioner barred the latter from recovering benefits under the Workmen's
Compensation Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 6 of the Workmen's Compensation Act provides that -</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 6.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Liability of third parties.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- In case an employee suffers an injury for
which compensation is due under this Act by any other person besides his
employer, it shall be optional with such injured employee either to claim
compensation from his employer, under this Act, or sue such other persons for
damages, in accordance with law; and in case compensation is claimed and
allowed in accordance with this Act, the employer who paid such compensation or
was found liable to pay the sum, shall succeed the injured employee to the
right of recovering from such person what he paid:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, That in case the employer recovers
from such third person damages in excess of those paid or allowed under this
Act, such excess shall be delivered to the injured employee or any other person
entitled thereto, after deduction of the expenses of the employer and the costs
of proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sum paid by the
employer for compensation or the amount of compensation to which the employee
or his dependents are entitled under the provisions of this Act, shall not be
admissible as evidence in any damage suit or action."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The rule on this point
has been established by <span class="GramE">Us</span> in quite a number of
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the case of <u>La <span class="SpellE">Mallorca</span> (Operator of La <span class="SpellE">Mallorca</span>
Taxi) vs. WCC and <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> <span class="SpellE">Zuñiga</span></u>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the Court, in upholding the employee's right
to recover compensation from his employer, ruled that the filing of a criminal
complaint against the third person causing the injury arising out of and in the
course of employment is not such an election as would suffice to exempt an
employer from his liability under the Workmen's Compensation Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court, speaking thru Senior Associate
Justice Fernando, affirmed the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission,
thus -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It was not surprising at all then why respondent Workmen's
Compensation Commission could not yield assent to such a plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the appealed decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'The contention of respondent that when
claimant filed the physical injury case against Jesus Pinto, with whom he had
an accident, claimant had elected to claim against Jesus Pinto and the monetary
settlement between them has the effect of releasing the respondent from liability,
cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere in the
above-quoted section can we find or deduce that the filing of a criminal action
arising out of the injury caused by a third person as well as the settlement of
the same as an incident thereof would bar the recovery of compensation against
the employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is our considered view
that the settlement between Jesus Pinto and the claimant cannot be deemed an
election within the meaning of Sec. 6.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus in one case the Supreme Court ruled that the filing of a criminal
action does not bar recovery of a workmen's compensation claim, and we
quote:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'As to the alleged "amicable
settlement," it consists of an affidavit wherein, for the sum of 150
pesos, <span class="SpellE">Mamador's</span> widow promised "to forgive <span class="SpellE">Macunat</span> for the wrong committed and not to bring him before
the authorities for prosecution." Upon making such promise - petitioner
argues - she elected one of the remedies, (against the third person) <span style="">and </span>is barred from the other remedy
(against the employer).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention
may not be sustained, inasmuch as <span class="GramE">all the</span> widow
promised was to forego the offender's criminal prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not promise to waive the civil action
for damages.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In this appeal, petitioner, still unconvinced, would expect
us to reverse respondent Commission precisely for obedience to and compliance
with what we held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is optimism
carried to excess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is far from
warranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The matter has </u><u><span style="">been fully considered by us, and we have
reached the conclusion that the filing of a criminal complaint is not such an
election as would suffice to exempt an employer from his liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We adhere to it</span></u><span style="">."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> (Underscoring supplied).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Marinduque</u></span><u>
Iron Mines Agents, Inc. v. WCC</u>, 99 Phil. 480, 483 (1956), the Court, with
Justice and later Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span> as <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span>, ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"It is the
petitioner's contention </span>that Criminal Case No. 1491 and its outcome
constituted an election by the employee (or his heirs) to sue the third person,
such election having the effect of releasing the employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the Criminal Case No. 1491 was not a
suit for damages against the third person, it being alleged, without
contradiction that the heirs did not intervene therein and have not so far
received the indemnity ordered <span style="">by the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>At any rate, we have already
decided in Nava vs. <span class="SpellE">Inchausti</span> Co. that the </u></span><u>indemnity
granted the <span class="GramE">heirs in a criminal prosecution of the
"other person" does</span> not affect the liability of the employer
to pay compensation</u>." (Underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The doctrine relied upon
in these cases of <u>La <span class="SpellE">Mallorca</span></u> and <span class="SpellE"><u>Marinduque</u></span><u> Iron Mines</u>, <u>supra</u>, is in
line with the earlier cases decided by this Court in <u>Victoria Taller <span class="SpellE">Viuda</span> de Nava vs. <span class="SpellE">Ynchausti</span>

that the obligation of the employer to compensate is unaffected by the
liability of the offender in the criminal case to indemnify the heirs of the
deceased employee which is "wholly distinct from the obligation imposed by
the Workmen's Compensation Act and the latter is in no sense subsidiary to the
former."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We are not unmindful of
the cases cited by the respondent Commission of <u>Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>
vs. Hon. Cecilia <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> Palma, et al</u>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and <u>Maria Paz S.

of the Hearing Officer in favor of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <span class="SpellE"><u>Esguerra</u></span>
case, the injured employee filed a claim for permanent partial loss of the use
of his right arm with the Workmen's Compensation Commission and while these
proceedings were pending, he initiated a case in the Court of First Instance to
recover compensatory as well as moral and exemplary damages from the company
physician and the clinic nurse and to hold the employer <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span>
liable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The injured laborer was
initially free to choose either to recover from the employer the fixed amounts
set by the Compensation Law or else, to prosecute an ordinary civil action
against the <span class="SpellE">tortfeasor</span> for higher damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court concluded that "having staked
his fortunes on a particular remedy, the injured employee is precluded from
pursuing the alternate course, at least until the prior claim is rejected by
the Compensation Commission."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the <u>Alba</u> case,
five employees of the respondent employer suffered injuries and one died when
the tractor they were riding on collided with a Victory Liner bus and separate
claims were filed before the Workmen's Compensation Commission against the
employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter claimed that the
claims had been extinguished by virtue </span>of the money settlements which
the employees had concluded with the Victory Liner, Inc. after each of them had
executed a written release or waiver in favor of said Liner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The waiver, however, reserved the right to
claim against the employer in accordance with and under the Workmen's
Compensation Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In holding that the
employees were entitled to the award under the Workmen's Compensation Act, the
Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"There is no question that the Liner was a "third
party" within the meaning of section 6.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is also no question that petitioners have not sued the Liner for
damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wherefore they are not deemed
to have made the election specified in section 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the plain intent of the law is that
they shall not receive payment twice for the same injuries (from the third
party and from the employer).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence if
without suing they received full damages from the third party, they should be
deemed to have practically made the election under the law, and should be
prevented from thereafter suing the employer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Full damages means, of course, what they would have demanded in a suit
against the third party or what they would receive in <span class="GramE">a
compensation</span> as complete settlement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Needless to say, where the injured employee is offered, by the third
party, compensation which he deems insufficient, he may reject it and thereafter
litigate with such third party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or
choose instead to complain against his employer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Nevertheless there is nothing in the law to prevent him from
accepting such insufficient compensation but expressly reserving at the same <span class="GramE">time</span> his right to recover additional damages from his
employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is therefore our view that the moneys received from
Victory Liner, Inc. did not necessarily have the effect of releasing Dr. <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as
the five men were his employees, and they were injured by reason of and in the
course of their employment, he must pay compensation to be fixed in accordance
with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bearing in mind, however, the
law's intention not to give double compensation, the amounts they have received
from the Victory Liner shall be deducted from the sums so determined."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is needless to differentiate, much less reconcile, the earlier
cases with the recent rulings of this Court on the basis of the manner or
procedure of bringing the action against the third party (whether by criminal
prosecution or civil action for damages) or as to who takes the initiative,
option or choice in selecting said action (whether by the claimant personally
or by his heirs).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Substantially, the
latest ruling in the <u>La <span class="SpellE">Mallorca</span></u> case is a
boon to labor and <span class="GramE">We</span> are not minded to deny or to
detract to the wage earners and laboring class such a gain already
recognized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, for the case at bar,
We reiterate the ruling enunciated in the said <u>La <span class="SpellE">Mallorca</span></u>
case and so hold that the amicable settlement entered into by petitioner's
parents-in-law does not constitute a bar as to prevent the recovery of benefits
under the Workmen's Compensation Act for the reason that such an amicable
settlement may not be considered or deemed to be an election within the meaning
of Section 6 of the Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">By reiterating this ruling, this Court once more stresses and
emphasizes the liberal construction and interpretation of the Workmen's
Compensation Act in order to favor the laboring class and thus give to those
who have less in life more in law, to paraphrase the immortal words of a great
President.</p>
