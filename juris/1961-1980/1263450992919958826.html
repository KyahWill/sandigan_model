<p class="BODY"><span style="">On April 19 of the same
year, Jose H. <span class="SpellE">Junquera</span> filed with the Court of First
Instance of said province a petition for the probate of a one page document as
the last will left by said deceased, devising all his properties to Tomas, <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> and Amelia, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>,
in equal and undivided shares, and designating <span class="SpellE">Junquera</span>
as executor thereof (Special Proceedings No. 916-R).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The document - now in the record as Exhibit
"A" - was dated </span><st1:date year="1945" day="17" month="5"><span style="">May 17, 1945</span></st1:date><span style="">, drafted in Spanish, and allegedly signed
and thumb-marked by said deceased, in the presence of Dr. Cornelio G. <span class="SpellE">Gandionco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiluna</span> and <span class="SpellE">Feliberto</span> Leonardo
as attesting witnesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1952" day="14" month="6"><span style="">June 14,
 1952</span></st1:date><span style="">, the probate
court appointed <span class="SpellE">Junquera</span> as special administrator of
the estate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On November 14 of the
same year, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>
filed an opposition to the probate of the will based on the follow­ing
grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the formalities
required by law had not been complied with; (2) that the testator was mentally
in </span>capable of making <span style="">a </span>will
at the time of its execution; (3) that the will was procured by undue and
improper influence, on the part of the beneficiaries and/or some other person;
(4) that the signature of the testator was procured by fraud; and (5) that the
testator acted by mistake or did not intend the instrument he signed to be his
will at the time he affixed his signature thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon motion of the <span class="SpellE">abovenamed</span> <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>, on <st1:date year="1953" day="9" month="6">June
 9, 1953</st1:date>, the Court removed <span class="SpellE">Junquera</span> <span style="">as special </span>administrator and
appointed Dr. Patricio Beltran in his place.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1953" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1953</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Vitaliana</span> <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, a niece
of the deceased, filed her own opposition to the probate of the will, on the
ground that the signature "Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>"
appearing thereon was a forgery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other
oppositions were subsequently filed by <span class="SpellE">Patrocinio</span> <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> de <span class="SpellE">Tabotabo</span> (her
opposition was later withdrawn), Lilia <span class="SpellE">Morre</span> de <span class="SpellE">Tabotabo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Morre</span>, Patricia <span class="SpellE">Morre</span> de <span class="SpellE">Ranario</span>, Aurora <span class="SpellE">Morre</span> de <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isagani</span> <span class="SpellE">Morre</span> and Rosario <span class="SpellE">Morre</span>, invoking substantially the same grounds mentioned
heretofore.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, Tomas, Amelia and <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, mani­festly on behalf of <span class="SpellE">the"Cebu</span>
Arcade Company, T. L. <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>."
a duly organized partnership controlled by them, filed a motion to exclude from
the inventory of the Estate previously filed by the new special administrator,
thirteen parcels of land situated in the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
with a total area of 2,148 square meters, alleging that during his lifetime the
deceased testator had sold said lots to them, as evidenced <span style="">by the </span>do­cument now in the record as
Exhibit F-1 executed on May 17, 1945, confirming the alleged previous
sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due hearing, the <span style="">courts in its order of July 16, 1954, denied
the motion for exclusion, ruling that <span class="SpellE">movants</span>’ remedy
was to file a separate <span class="SpellE"><u>accion</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>reivindicatoria</u></span> against the administrator.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On October 28, 1955, the Republic
of the Philippines filed </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">motion for leave to intervene and join the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> in contesting the probate of the </span><span style="">will, </span><span style="">on the ground that, should the estate be adjudicated the latter by
intestacy, it stood to collect a considerable amount by way of estate and
inheritance taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its order of
December 10 of the same year, the Court allowed the intervention.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After a prolonged trial,
on May 28, 1960, the Court rendered a decision denying the probate of the will
and </span>declaring itself without jurisdiction to pass upon the question of
ownership over the thirteen lots which the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
Arcade etc. claimed as its own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the
parties appealed - the proponents of the will from the portion of the decision
denying probate, and the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> and the Republic of
the Philippines, from that portion thereof where the court refused to <span style="">decide </span>the
question of ownership of the thirteen lots already mentioned.</p>

<p class="BODY">The proponents of the disputed will, mainly with the testimony of
the three attesting witnesses, Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Gandionco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Filiberto</span> Leonardo and <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiluna</span>, sought to prove the following facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">In the morning of May 17, 1945, Tomas <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>,
complying with the request of Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, went to
the house of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Filiberto</span> Leonardo to request him
to be a witness at the execution of the latter's last will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Gandionco</span>,
who at the time happened to be in the house of Leonardo, was likewise requested
to act as such. Together, the three went to the residence of Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> at Ramos Street, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon their arrival the third
witness, <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiluna</span>,
who was living on the ground floor of the house, was asked to come
upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, in their presence,
Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> executed first, the document Exhibit
"F" (deed of confirmation of an alleged previous sale to <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Arcade Company, T. L. <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>
y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>.) witnessed by <span class="SpellE">Gandionco</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Cabiluna</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later, Vito <span class="SpellE">Bor­romeo</span>, being of sound and
disposing mind, and without pressure or influence exerted on him, dictated the
substance of his will to Tomas <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, who in turn
typewrote it in proper legal language.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The document was then read by Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>,
who later signed and <span class="SpellE">thumbmarked</span> it (Exhibit
"A") and carbon copies thereof (Exhibits "E" and
"K") in the presence of the attesting witnesses, who, in-turn, signed
the will and its copies in the presence of Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>
and of each other.</p>

<p class="BODY">Proponents also placed the Rev. Fr. Julio <span class="SpellE">Corres</span>,
a Spanish Catholic priest who was the confessor of Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>
from 1942 to 1946, the Rev. Fr. Sergio <span class="SpellE">Alfafara</span>, who
was his confessor from 1946 to 1947, and <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> <span class="SpellE">Mañacap</span>, a mid-wife who lived in the testator's house and
had served him from May 1945 up to his death on March 30, 1952, on the witness
stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The gist of their testimony is to
the effect that at the time of the execution of the will, Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> was still strong and could move around freely with
the aid of a cane; that he was still mentally alert and was a man of strong
will; that his right hand was unimpaired and he could write with it unaided;
that as a matter of fact - according to Vicente <span class="SpellE">Mañacap</span>
- he still wrote personal letters to Tomas <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>,
could eat by himself and even played the piano.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
presented several witnesses who testified that the signatures purporting to be those
of Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> on the document Exhibit
"A" and its copies were forgeries; that they were too good and too
perfect signatures and, therefore, quite impossible for the deceased <span style="">- an ailing man already 82 years old on May
17, 1945 - to write; that he was found "positive for bacillus
leprosy" by Dr. Antonio Garcia as early as 1926 or 1927, having been
treated for it con­sistently by injections of chaulmoogra oil administered by
Dr. Max <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> and Dr. Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Gandionco</span>;
that Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo’s</span> usual signatures during his
better days had always been charac­terized by certain flourishes, technically
called "rubric"; that Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> had
also reared and educated two of the <span class="SpellE">op­positors</span>,
Crispin <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> and the late <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> and there was no conceivable reason why they
were left out in the will, if any such will had really been made by him
knowingly; that the testamentary witness, Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Gandionco</span>,
is a nephew of the other witness, <span class="SpellE">Filiberto</span> Leonardo,
and was the <span class="SpellE">fiance</span> of Angeles <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>,
a sister of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, one of the insti­tuted
heirs; that the third testamentary witness, <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabi­luna</span> is the real father of <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, another instituted heir, who admittedly
grew up and was reared by Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> and his wife
Juliana Evangelista since he was barely three months; that Amelia <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, the third instituted heir, is a younger sister of
Tomas <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> and dependent upon him; that on May
17, 1945, the deceased's leprosy was so far advanced that the fingers of his
right hand were already hardened and atrophied, this making it difficult, if
not impossible, for him to write; and that on the same date, his sense of
hearing and his eyesight had been considerably impaired, his eyes being always
watery due to the progress of his leprosy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> also presented Felipe
Logan of the National Bureau of Investigation and Jose G. Villanueva, as
handwriting experts, who testified, after examining the supposed signatures of
the deceased in Exhibit "A" and comparing them with his accepted standard
signatures, that the questioned signatures were forgeries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proponents, however, presented their own
handwriting expert, Martin Ramos, who testified to the contrary.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court refused to believe the testimony of the attesting
witnesses and, as a result, denied the petition for probate, because, in its
opinion, they appeared not to be "wholly disinterested persons" and
because of the serious dis­crepancies in their testimonies with respect to the
number of copies made of the disputed document.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">The </span>court also found that
the physical condition of the deceased at the time of the execution of the
questioned document was such that it was highly improbable, if not impossible,
for him to have affixed his sig­natures on the <span style="">documents </span>Exhibits A, E and K in the spontaneous <span style="">and excellent manner they appear to have </span><span style="">been written.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Thus,
the court was also led to believe the testimony of the hand­writing experts for
<span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>, - adverse to the <span class="SpellE">genuiness</span>
of the signatures of Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> on the questioned
document more than that of the handwriting expert presented by the pro­ponents
of the will.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It seems clear,
therefore, that the main issue to be decided in the present appeal is whether
or not the evidence of record </span><span style="">is
</span><span style="">sufficient to prove the due
execution of the will in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It must be conceded that in this jurisdiction, the subscribing
witnesses to <span style="">a </span>contested will
are regarded as the best wit­nesses in connection with its due execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is
</span>similarly true, however, that to deserve full credit, their testimony
must be reasonable and unbiased, and that, as in the case of any other witness,
their testimony may be overcome by any competent evidence - direct or
circumstantial (Board etc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Shasser</span>, 10 Kan. 585;
168 Pac. 836<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>[</i>1<span style="">917<i>]</i>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is also an appellate practice of long standing in this
jurisdiction to accord great weight to the findings of fact made by the trial
court and not to disturb them unless said court had failed to consider material
facts and circumstances or had given undue weight to, or misconstrued the
testimony of parti­cular witnesses, the reason for this being that the trial
judge had full opportunity to hear and observe the conduct and demeanor of the
witnesses while testifying and was consequently in <span style="">a </span>better position than the reviewing court to determine the
question of their credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
this is not applicable to the present case because His Honor, the judge who
penned the appealed decision was not the same judge before whom the evidence of
the parties was presented, it must be stated that, judging from the carefully
written decision under review, it was only after a thorough study of the record
that His Honor arrived at the conclusion that the subscribing <span style="">witnesses </span>do not appear to be wholly
disinterested persons.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the matter of the number of copies made of the questioned will
allegedly signed by the testator and the three subscribing witnesses, His Honor
found that <span class="SpellE">Cabiluna</span> was very uncertain and confused;
that at a certain stage of his examination, he said that only <u>two</u> copies
of the will were prepared - the original and one carbon copy - while at another
stage he affirmed that he did not know whether or not there was a duplicate and
that all he could say was that he had affixed his signature three times
(Transcript, <span class="SpellE">Marquiala</span>, August 22, 1953 pp.
49-50).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In truth, however, he really
signed six (6) times - twice on the original and twice on each of the two
copies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Adding confusion to the <span style="">situation is the answer he gave when he was
asked if Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> also signed the carbon copy,
to which his answer was "I did not see" (Idem, p. 50).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the other subscribing witness, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Filiberto</span> Leonardo, testified categorically that there were
only the original and one carbon copy of the will and that the testator and all
the subscribing witnesses signed both (Transcript, <span class="SpellE">Marquiala</span>,
December 23, 1953, pp. 167, 210, and 218).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the naked and highly disturbing <span style="">fact </span>is that, contrary to what is
inferable from the vacillating testimony <span style="">of
<span class="SpellE">Cabiluna</span> and the categorical assertion of Atty.
Leonardo, the proponents of the questioned will themselves presented <u>three</u>
copies of said will:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the original, a
carbon duplicate copy and </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">carbon
triplicate copy, now in the record as Exhibits A, </span><span style="">E </span><span style="">and K, respectively.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that the testimony of these subscribing
witnesses was given around eight years after the alleged execution of the
questioned will, still we believe that the transaction in which they claim to
have taken an important part <span style="">is </span>of such character and importance that it can not be a very
easy matter for anyone of them to have a hazy recollection of the number of
copies signed by the testator and by them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Stranger still would it be for them to say something in open contradiction
with the reality on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, as
may be clearly deduced from their testimony - <span class="SpellE">Cabiluna</span>
and Leonardo's -, there was only the original and one copy signed by the
testator and the subscribing witnesses, why is it that <u>three</u> - original
and two copies - were really in existence and were produced in court during the
trial?</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of the third subscribing witness, Dr. Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Gandionco</span>, the imputation was made by two witnesses, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> and Judge
Crispin <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, that he was the fiancé of Angeles <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, sister of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>,
who is one of the three heirs instituted in the questioned will, evidently to
show that he is not a completely disinterested witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence to this effect appears to have
remained <span class="SpellE">unimpeached</span>, although the proponents of the
will could have done it by calling on Dr. <span class="SpellE">Gandionco</span>
himself or on Angeles <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> to deny the
imputation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the evidence also discloses that Dr. <span class="SpellE">Gandionco</span> was the uncle of the other subscribing witness,
Atty. Leonardo, and that, in fact, they were living together at the time of the
alleged execution of the will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
circumstance - apparently trivial - can not be taken lightly because <span style="">in view </span>of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
claim that Angeles <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> was the fiancé of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Gandionco</span>, it would not be unreasonable to entertain the
suspicion that both subscribing witnesses were not wholly disinterested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Material to this point is the fact
established by the evidence that Atty. Leonardo was the notary public before
whom the document Exhibit 4-A - which purports to convey to <span style="">a </span>partnership
con­trolled by the heirs instituted in the questioned will thirteen parcels of
land situated in the commercial center of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City -
was supposedly acknowledged by the testator on the same date May 17, 1945.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing, <span class="GramE">We</span> can
not see our way clear to holding that the trial court erred in refusing to give
full credit to the testimony of the three subscribing witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has also been held that the condition and physical appearance
of a questioned document constitute a valuable factor which, if correctly
evaluated in the light of surrounding cir­cumstances, may help in determining
whether it is genuine or forged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subscribing witnesses may forget or exaggerate what they really know,
saw, heard or did; they may be biased and, therefore, tell only half truths to
mislead the court or favor one party to the prejudice of the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This can not be said of the condition and
physical appearance of the questioned do­cument itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Both, albeit silently, will
reveal the naked truth, hiding nothing, forgetting nothing, and exaggerating
nothing.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason,
independently of the conflicting opinions expressed by the handwriting experts
called to the witness stand by the parties, we have carefully examined and
considered the physical appearance and condition of the original and two copies
of the questioned will found in the record - par­ticularly the signatures
attributed to the testator - and We have come to the conclusion that the latter
could not have been written by him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the face of the original and two copies of the con­tested
will (Exhibits A, E, and K) appear a total of six alleged signatures of the
testator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are all well written
along a practically straight line, without any visible sign of tremor or lack
of firmness in the hand that wrote them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, in the respects just adverted to, they appear better written
than the unquestioned signatures of attesting witnesses <span class="SpellE">Gandionco</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Cabiluna</span>, <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of
the fact that on the date of the alleged execution of the will (May 17, 1945)
the testator was considerably older and in a much poorer physical condition
than they.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accord­ing to the evidence,
the testator was then a sick man, eighty-two years old, with the entire left
half of his body paralyzed since six years before, while the oldest attesting
witness (<span class="SpellE">Cabiluna</span>) was around sixty-five years of age
and Leonardo and <span class="SpellE">Gan­dionco</span> were only forty-four and
forty-five years old, respectively, and were all in good health.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite the obviously very poor phy­sical
condition of the testator, Leonardo claims that he signed the alleged will
unaided, writing his name thereon slowly but continuously or without
interruption, and that, on the same occasion, he signed his name several times
not only on the original of the will and <span style="">its
copies but also on the original and several copies of the alleged confirmatory <span style="">sale </span>Exhibit F-1 and on his residence
cer­tificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering all the
attendant circumstances, we agree with the lower court that Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> could not have written the questioned signatures.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In view of what has been said heretofore, We find it unnecessary
to examine and consider in detail the conflicting testimony of the handwriting
experts presented by the parties:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Martin
Ramos by the proponents of the will, to sustain the genuineness of the
questioned signatures, and Felipe Logan and Jose G. Villanueva, by the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>, to prove that said sig­natures are
forgeries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We shall limit ourselves in
this con­nection to quoting with approval the following portion of the appealed
decision:</p>

<blockquote>"What the Court finds to be a weakness in the conclusions of
Martin Ramos, based on his comparative examination of the questioned and
standard signatures of Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, is his apparent
assumption that all the signatures were made by Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>
under equal­ity or similarity of circumstances, that is, that in all instances
Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> had normal use of both of his hands, -
the right and the left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He failed to
take into account that when Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> allegedly
affixed those signatures on May 17, 1945 on Exhibits 'A’, 'E', and IK' the left
portion of his body, including the left hand, was already paralyzed, and Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> was represented to have written his name alone by
himself and unaided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe, if he was
previously apprised of those circumstances, he would hesitate to make the
conclusion that those flawless signatures reading Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>,
written straight and in a form as good as, if not better than, the sig­natures
of three much younger attesting witnesses, were positively in the handwriting
of the 82-year old, ailing, and paralytic Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court con­sequently, finds itself not
disposed to adopt his conclusions, but on the contrary <span style="">is </span>inclined toward the views of the other two expert witnesses,
Felipe Logan and Jose G. Villanueva."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As stated at the outset, the contested will <span style="">is </span>claimed to have been signed and <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">thumbmarked</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>by the testator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An examination of the <span class="SpellE">thumbmarks</span>,
however, readily shows that, as the lower court found, the same are
"glaringly far from being distinct <span style="">and
clear"; that "they are not a possible means of identification"
nor can "They possibly be identified to be those of Vito <span class="SpellE">Bor­romeo</span>, or for that matter, of any other person
whatsoever".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is, </span>therefore, obvious, that they are
of little use in the reso­lution of the issue before <span class="GramE">Us</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We shall now consider the appeal taken by the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
and the Republic of the Philippines from that portion of the decision where the
lower court declined to decide with finality the question of who owns the
thirteen parcels of land subject-matter of the confirmatory sale Exhibit F-1
and whether or not they should be included in or excluded from the inventory of
properties of the Estate of the deceased Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on February 11, 1954 Tomas, Amelia, and <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, through
counsel, filed <span style="">a
</span>motion for the exclusion from the inventory of the Estate of the
thirteen lots therein mentioned, with a total area of 2,348 square meters,
claiming that the same had been sold by the deceased Vito <span class="SpellE">Bor­romeo</span>
during his lifetime to the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Arcade., T. L. <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion for exclusion was denied by the
lower court in its order of <st1:date year="1954" day="16" month="7">July 16,
 1954</st1:date>, and the ruling was reiterated in the appealed decision
"for the same reasons and considerations" upon which it rejected the
probate of the will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ruling on the
matter, however, was expressly made provisional in nature.</p>

<p class="BODY">We believe, and so hold, that the resolution of the lower court
on this matter is correct because said court, acting in its capacity as <span style="">a </span>probate
court, had no jurisdiction to deter­mine with finality the question of
ownership involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That such matter
must be litigated in <span style="">a </span>separate action has been the established jurisprudence in this
jurisdiction (<span class="SpellE">Ongsinco</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>,
G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-7635, 1955; <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>, G.R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-4656, </span><st1:date year="1953" day="23" month="2"><span class="GramE">February 23, 1953</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">; Garcia vs. Martin G. R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">G.R. No.</span>
L-9233, June 29, 1957; Cor­dova vs. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, 73 Phil.
661; <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>,
73 Phil. 561 and others), except where a party merely prays for the in­clusion
or exclusion from the inventory of any particular pro­perty, in which case the
probate court may pass upon, provi­sionally, the question of inclusion or
exclusion, but without prejudice to its final determination in an appropriate
separate action (Garcia vs. Garcia, 67 Phil. 353; <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span>
vs. Antonio, 70 Phil. 388; <span class="SpellE">Guinguing</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Abuton</span>, 48 Phil. 144, 147).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the decision appealed from
is affirmed, with costs.</p>
