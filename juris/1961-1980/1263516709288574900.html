				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The dominant issue raised in this appeal is whether or not the
dismissal of employees without a definite period of employ­ment - in
consequence of a retrenchment program for reasons of economy and mechanization
or modernization of operations - was for "just cause" which would
exempt the employer from giving separation pay under the Termination Pay Law,
Republic Act 1787, which took effect on June 21, 1957, Section 1 (the pertinent
portion) of which reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 1.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In cases of employment, without a definite
period, in a commercial, industrial, or agricultural establishment or
enterprise, the employer or the employee may terminate at any time the employment
with just cause; or without just cause in the case of an employee by serving
written notice on the employer at least one month in advance, or in the case of
an employer, by serving such notice to the employee at least one month in
advance or one-half month for every year of service of the employee, whichever
is longer, a fraction of at least six months being considered as one whole
year.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style=""><span style="">Three
months following the execution of the foregoing agree­ment or on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="29" month="9"><span style="">September
 29, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, petitioner
caused the circulation of a mimeographed letter which informed the employees
about the economic problems facing the company because of new taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the </span>month that followed, October
1959, the company commenced to execute a retrenchment program, dismissing
employees one after another, among them being herein private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The gratuity <span class="GramE">payments given
them was</span> based upon the agreed rates heretofore mentioned - not on
Republic Act 1787.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dis­missals, so
it is averred, affected about 600 laborers estimated to be one-fourth of
petitioner's labor force.</p>

<p class="BODY">Right here it is worth observing that the stipulated rates for
gratuity payments under the agreement just transcribed were much lower than
those specified in Section 1 of the Termination Pay Law, Republic Act 1787, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">aforequoted</span></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, in spite of the explicit warning in
Section 2 of said statute that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Any con­tract or agreement contrary to the provisions of Section 1
of this Act shall be null and void:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>,

employees or their representatives to enter into a collective bargaining
agreement with terms more <u>liberal</u> than those provided for in this Act in
favor of the employees."</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of their dismissal, 27 employees, on <st1:date year="1961" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1961</st1:date>, commenced suit against petitioner
in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental
for "recovery of termination pay, damages, and attorney's fees."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> Trial was had. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The trial court dismissed the complaint,

the case with respect to 15 of the 27 plaintiffs, namely, Isaac <span class="SpellE">Aguisando</span>, Alejandro Alameda, <span class="SpellE">Elisito</span>

<span class="SpellE">Olavia</span>; and, after deducting the amounts received in
accordance with the nullified agreement, directing petitioner to pay the 12
remaining plaintiffs (private respondents herein) the amounts opposite their
respective names, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Aronales</span> - P1,130.55; Manuel <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span>

Carlos <span class="SpellE">Penaflor</span> - P1,327.90; and Simeon <span class="SpellE">Vaflor</span> - P1,945.00, with legal interest from the filing of
the complaint, plus P500 by way of attorneys' fees, and the costs in both ins­tances.</p>

<p class="BODY">Back of these awards were the Court of Appeals' conclusions that
the retrenchment program was not made in good faith; and that the mechanization
or modernization of operations, given by petitioner as one of the reasons for
dismissal, is not one of the just causes enumerated in the Termination Pay Law.</p>

<blockquote>It is now petitioner's turn to appeal to this Court.</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">1. Quite plain is the commendable policy of Republic Act 1787, a
social legislation, to alleviate the difficulties which confront a dismissed
employee thrown into the streets to face the harsh neces­sities of <span class="GramE">life.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is for this
reason that the said statute compels the employer to dole out money, reasonable
under the circumstances, to cushion the adverse effects of sudden separation
from employ­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This gives the
employee a leeway, commensurate to his years of service, to tide him and his
family over in the meantime that he goes job hunting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To one who has been accustomed to a certain
type of job in one company, adjustment to other job oppor­tunities becomes a
problem.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Advanced age, too, may reduce
him to a low priority in the labor market.</p>

<p class="BODY">By constitutional precept, the State shall afford protection to
labor and shall regulate the relations between labor and capital in industry
and agriculture.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Republic Act 1787 then should be interpreted with the aim in view of
advancing the beneficent purpose thereof to give justifiable protection to the
laborers so dismissed and their families.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Jurisprudence holds to the line that all doubts in labor legislation
should be resolved in the laborers' favor.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> Case law
on this score is not alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our statute
books give it hefty support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article
1702 of the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
for instance, directs that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In
case of doubt, all labor legislation <span style="">and
all labor contracts shall be construed in favor of the safety and decent living
for the laborer."</span></p>

<p class="NUM">2. It is in the light of the principles just expressed that we
examine the reasons advanced by petitioner to bring it within the "just
causes" for dismissal area set forth in Republic Act 1787 and thus excuse
it from giving termination pay to its dis­missed laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reference to Section 1, Republic Act 1787,
transcribed at the start of this opinion, will readily show that, if at all,
the position taken by petitioner must have to be gauged by the terms of
paragraphs (a) and (f) of said Section 1, which give as just causes for
terminating an employment without a definite period:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"a. The closing or cessation of operation
of the establishment or enterprise, unless the closing is for the purpose of
defeating the intention of this law; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> f. Other causes analogous to any of the foregoing."</p>

<p class="BODY">A retrenchment program, we believe, does not fit into the
statutory scheme.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be underscored here
is that we are not called upon to apply the phrase "just causes" in
connection with the issue of propriety of dismissal of an employee who seeks
reinstatement and <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> upon the charge of unlawful
dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Republic Act 1787, the
element of reinstatement with con­sequent <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> is
beside the point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The just causes
enumerated in the Termination Pay Law have relevance only to the issue of
whether or not the employer is liable to the employee for separation pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The employee does not <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>
seek reinstatement to his former position.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, the just causes under Republic Act 1787 merely determine
the liability or non-liability on the part of the employer to give out
severance pay; while just causes under the general concept of the law are
decisive of the issue as to the propriety or impropriety of the dismissal and
the propriety or impropriety of the employee's action for reinstatement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The explanatory note to Senate Bill 278, Fourth Congress, which
was to become Republic Act 1787, gives the legislative intent, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"But, under existing conditions where
employment opportunities are scarce and trade unionism is yet in the develop­ment
stage, the failure of said Act [referring to Republic Act 1052, the predecessor
of Republic Act 1737] to provide and define the causes under which an employer
may properly dismiss an employee places the latter under a very different and
unpredictable situation."</p>

<p class="BODY">Unquestionably, Republic Act 1787 is a remedial measure aimed at
the employee's protection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this
guideline, we look into the law itself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, we find that retrenchment is not analogous to, but is below the
level of, closing or cessation of operation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We note with interest the restrictive provisions of the first paragraph
of Section 2 of Act 1787 that "the suspension for a period not exceeding
six months of the operation of a business or enterprise not attributable to the
fault of the employer x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
shall not ter­minate an employment," If such suspension not exceeding six
months, by the law itself, is neither closure nor cessation, much less may
economic measures of retrenchment fall under the category of closing or
cessation of operation [Section 1(a)] to bring into play the other provision
[Section 1(f)] in reference to analogous causes.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be conceded is an employer's right to follow economic policies
that would insure profit to <span class="GramE">itself</span> and, for this
purpose, to mechanize or modernize its business - resulting in the dis­missal
of a number of its employees in the process.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We do say however that such dismissal should not be interpreted in a
manner that will permit the employer to escape payment of termination pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some such situation is not envisioned in the
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It strikes at the concept of social
justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">It bears repetition to say that retrenchment policy for reasons
of economy stops short of the "closing or cessation of operation of the
establishment or enterprise." The strictness with which the Termination
Pay Law is interpreted against the employer finds expression in the recent
decision of this Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Wenceslao</u></span> <u>vs</u>.
<u>Carmen</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Zaragoza</u></span>, <u>Inc</u>. (1968), 24
SCRA 554, 558.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, speaking for
this Court, there said:</p>

<blockquote>"True, appellant's film exchange business where <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> worked was closed as of February 28, 1962, but
what the law considers as just cause for terminating an employment without a
definite period is the closing or cessation of operation of the <u>establishment</u>
or <u>enterprise</u> of the employer, and not merely the closing or cessation
of opera­tion of any particular division or department of the employer's
business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To sustain appellant's
contention in this regard would amount to reading this into the law - something
which we are not ready to do, considering its adverse effects upon the rights
of the employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it must be so, let
the law say it clearly."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find no difficulty in stating that the position here of
private respondents is well above that of the laborers involved in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Wenceslao</u></span> case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The retrenchment here may not be analogized with the "closing or
cessation of operation of any particular division or department of the
employer's business" in that case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Retrenchment could be temporary; closing or cessa­tion is final.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are therefore persuaded to state that no justification there
is why mechanization or modernization should insulate the employer from its
legal obligation to give termination pay to those dismissed by reason
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances here
presented, it was no fault of the employees that they were abruptly separated
from their jobs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To them termination pay
has become a necessity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To their
employer mechanization or modernization is a relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The employees are reduced to the state of
unemployed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, their employer may
cushion the possible impact on its economy by including in its budgetary
projections amounts from time to time to be paid laid-off em­ployees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, any adverse effect occasioned by
termination payments may yet be evened up by the savings brought about by the
proposed mechanization or modernization.</p>

<p class="BODY">We, accordingly, rule that mechanization or modernization of
operations, labor saving as they are, will not relieve an em­ployer from its
obligation to give termination pay.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. But let us assume that retrenchment for reasons of economy or
mechanization or modernization of operations may yet come as one analogous to
"closing" or "cessation" under Section 1(a) of Republic Act
1787.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, the employer may not
sidetrack his obligation to give out termination pay where the closing or
cessation of operation was "for the purpose of defeating the intention of
this law." Looming large then is the finding of the Court of Appeals that
the retrenchment program proffered by said petitioner was not made in good
faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This finding is couched in the
following language of the decision of the Court of Appeals, speaking thru Mr.
Justice <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> <span class="SpellE">Gatmaitan</span>, <span class="SpellE">viz</span>:</p>

Sr. <span class="SpellE">Ettisberger</span> de <span class="SpellE">que</span>:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">'In the light of such
developments, Insular was placed between two alternatives, -- either to close
down operations altogether as no company can sustain losses over a long period
of time; or on the other hand, there was the possibility to modernize;'."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The record does not suggest any challenge by petitioner of the
foregoing finding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is rooted in
logic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact is that petitioner was
making profits even before the retrenchment program was launched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the reduction in the labor force by 25%
and the introduction of mechanization or modernization in its operations, it is
difficult to see how petitioner could be headed for financial disaster.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, we say that petitioner may not in any manner seek shelter
in Section 1(a) in relation to Section 1(f) of Republic Act 1787 to excuse
itself from liability for termination pay as directed by the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. Petitioner further contends that in applying the law, only
those services of private respondents after <st1:date year="1957" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1957</st1:date> should be reckoned in the computation of
their termination pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, so
petitioner avers, a contrary interpretation would have the effect of giving the
law retroactive application.</p>

<p class="BODY">This theory is short of being compelling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right of em­ployees to separation pay in
the case before us attached after, not before, <st1:date year="1957" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How
separation pay is to be computed lies within the permissible prerogatives of
Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congress considered the number
of years of service of an employee as the basis in determining the amount to be
paid as separation pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could have
fixed a different criterion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That it
utilized years of service does not mean retroactive application of the law if
the time previous to <st1:date year="1957" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1957</st1:date>
were included.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The determination of the
amount is to be made after said date when right to separation pay was granted
dismissed employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There should thus
be no room for the notion that the law has been applied retroactively in this
case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">More to this.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>An idea difficult to pigeonhole is that
Republic Act 1787 was enacted in the exercise of the police power of the State.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a> And, legislative acts or measures enacted pursuant
to the police power of the State may have retroactive effect.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a> What needs stressing is the fact that in this case,
at the time of the passage of Republic Act 1787, an employer-employee
relationship existed between petitioner and private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dismissal was effected after said law came
into being.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the law, termination pay
must be given said employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The method of computation of termination pay as set forth in the
law is clear and plain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Republic Act
1787 provides, in Section 1 thereof heretofore quoted, that an employee whose
services are to be terminated without just cause must be served with notice
"at least one month in advance or one-half month for every year of service
of the employee, whichever is longer, a fraction of at least six months being
considered as one whole year"; <span class="GramE">otherwise</span>, such
employee "shall be entitled to compen­sation from the date of termination
of his employment in an amount equivalent to his salaries or wages
corresponding to the required period of notice." That this manner of
computation is just cannot be seriously disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The</span><span style="font-size: 13pt;"> </span>longer the service, the greater the benefit
given the employee; correspondingly, the bigger the termination pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court is thus duty bound to respect the law as it is
written.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot read it otherwise; we
are not permitted to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot
sidestep its inescapable impact.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner here is liable to private respondents for termination pay as
Congress wrote it.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. Deserving of serious consideration is petitioner's claim that,
in the computation of the termination pay, the time covered by the stoppage of
its operation during the war years up to the time each employee was readmitted
to its reopened factory should be excluded.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reason given is that during that period of time respondents did not
work for petitioner at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We fall back
on the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basis of termination
pay, expressed in the legal stricture, is for "every year of service of
the employee x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> a
fraction of at least six months being considered as one whole year."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 15pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It would seem to us that since termination pay is gauged by the
term "upon the length of his service", as stated in the expla­natory
note to Senate Bill 278, accent should be on actual service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, that explanatory note itself
envisions "an equitable and clear-cut policy." We do not believe it
equitable for the employer to be saddled with termination pay based on years
when the employee did not render service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would be unjust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, indeed,
it cannot be said with reason that the employer profited in any way from the
employee's work during the time that no service was rendered by the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">It thus results that a readjustment of the amounts, dec­lared by
the Court of Appeals payable, should be made in reference to those and only to
those who were in the service of the company prior to the outbreak of the war
and thereafter were by it reemployed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Fairness dictates that such deductions should be for the period starting
<u>from</u> the time during the war years when the particular employee stopped
work for petitioner and <u>until</u> the time he shall have been reemployed by
said peti­tioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Accordingly</b>, as thus modified, the judgment of the Court
of Appeals is hereby affirmed in all other respects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record is returned to the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental with instructions to
hold hearings:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>First</u>, to
ascertain who of the 12 employees - now private respondents - are not subject
to the deductions herein set forth, and who may procure execution of the
judgment of the Court of Appeals upon our decision becoming final; and <u>Second</u>,
to determine the amount deductible from the others, in line with the opinion of
this Court, and thereafter to deduct such amounts from the amounts awarded in
the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">No costs allowed in this Court.</p>
