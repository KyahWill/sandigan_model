				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The question raised in this mandamus and prohibition proceeding,
whether the filing of a motion for reconsideration with the Commission on
Appointments, without its being thereafter acted on, suffices to set at naught
a confirmation duly made of an <u>ad</u> <u>interim</u> appointment, is not a
new one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was put to us in Altarejos
v. Molo.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
As set forth in the opinion of the Chief Justice, the answer must be in the
negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The confirmation stands; it
must be given force and effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we
decided then, so we do now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
consequence, petitioner, as will be more fully explained, has made out a case
for mandamus and prohibition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is
entitled to the remedies prayed for.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are undisputed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In his suit for mandamus and prohibition filed with this Court on April
4, 1966, petitioner Felizardo S. Pacete alleged that he was appointed by the
then President of the Philippines on August 31, 1964 as Municipal Judge of
Pigcawayan, Cotabato.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He assumed office
on September 11, 1964 and discharged his duties as such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As his appointment was made during the recess
of Congress, it was submitted to the Commission on Appointments at its next
session in 1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On May 20 of that year,
he was unanimously confirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
matter of fact, two days later, he was sent a congratulatory telegram by the
then Senate President Ferdinand E. Marcos, who was likewise the Chairman of the
Commission on Appointments.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
More than nine months after such confirmation, to be exact on February 7, 1966,
the then Secretary of Justice, whom he likewise included in his petition,
through the Judicial Super­intendent, advised petitioner to vacate his position
as municipal judge, the ground being that his appointment had been
by-passed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner was taken by
surprise and sought clarification from the principal respondent, the then
Secretary of the Commission on Appointments.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
He was informed that on May 21, 1965, a day after his confirmation, one of the
members of the Commission on Appointments, the then Senator Rodolfo Ganzon,
wrote to its Chairman stating that he was filing a motion for the
reconsideration of the confirmation of the appointment of petitioner as
municipal judge of Pigcawayan, Cotabato, in view of derogatory information
which he had received.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent Secretary of the Commission on Appointments thus was led to notify
the then Secretary of Justice accordingly, following what he considered to be
the prevailing practice of such body that the mere presentation of such letter
"automatically vacated the confirmation of the appointment in question * *
*."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent Secretary of Justice through the Judicial Superintendent then
advised petitioner that he should vacate his position as municipal judge, as he
had not been duly confirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Disbursing Officer of the Department of Justice was likewise named respondent
as he had, as a consequence, withheld petitioner's salaries.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner would buttress his plea for prohibition against the
enforcement of the directive of respondent Secretary of Justice for him to vacate
his position and mandamus to compel respondent Secretary of the Commission on
Appointments to issue to him the certificate of confirmation on the ground that
the letter of the then Senator Ganzon, even on the assumption that it was a
motion to reconsider an appointment duly confirmed, was without force and
effect as it was not approved by the body as a whole.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is his contention that the confirmation of
his appointment had become final and executory upon the adjournment of the
fourth regular session of the Fifth Congress at midnight of May 21, 1965.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
He further submitted "that the power to approve or disapprove appointments
is conferred by the Constitution on the Commission on Appointments as a body
and not on the members individually.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Commission exercises this power thru the vote of the majority of the members
present at a quorum as provided by Section 10 of its Rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once an appointment is approved by that
majority, the approval becomes an act of the Commission and it cannot be
changed, voided, vacated or set aside except by the same Commission acting thru
the required majority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A mere motion to
reconsider it, unless approved by said majority, has no force and effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To contend otherwise is to make the will of a
single member prevail over the will of the Commission and to make that member
more powerful than the very Commission of which he is only a part."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated April 13, 1966, this Court required
respondents to answer such petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the answer of respondent Secretary of the Commission filed on May 18, 1966, the
dismissal of the suit was prayed for on the ground that there was a recall of
the confirmation of petitioner's appointment upon the filing of the motion for
reconsideration by Senator Ganzon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was likewise alleged as a special defense that there was no infringement of the
Constitution, the question involved being merely one of interpretation or
construction of the rules of the Commission involving its internal business
which cannot be made a subject of judicial inquiry.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The respondent Secretary of Justice as well as respondent Disbursing Officer of
the Department of Justice, in the answer filed on their behalf on May 21, 1966
by the then Solicitor General, now Associate Justice, Antonio P. Barredo,
admitted the facts, but sought the dismissal of the petition on the ground that
with the notification of respondent Secretary of the Commission on Appointments
that petitioner's appointment was not duly confirmed, respondent Secretary of
Justice had no alternative but to give it full faith and credence coming as it
did from the agency entrusted by the Constitution with the power to confirm.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing scheduled on July 20, 1966, the parties, after
arguing, were given an additional period of ten days within which to submit
memoranda of authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
petitioner's memorandum submitted on August 1, 1966, it was contended that his
confirmation became final and irrevocable upon the adjournment of the fourth
regular session of the Fifth Congress on May 21, 1965, as no rule of the
Commission as to a motion for reconsideration could have the force and effect
of defeating the constitutional provision that an <u>ad</u> <u>interim</u>
appointment is effective "until disapproved by the Commission on
Appointments or until the adjournment of the next session of the
Congress."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The memorandum submitted for the respondents squarely disputed such a
contention on the view that there could be no confirmation in the
constitutional sense until a motion for reconsideration had been turned down,
invoking at the same time the principle of the respect to be accorded the
actuation of an independent constitutional agency like the Commission on
Appointments.</p>

<p class="BODY">As was noted, the controlling principle is supplied by Altarejos
v. Molo,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
which interpreted Rule 21 of the Revised Rules of the Commission on
Appointments, which reads:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Resolution of the Commission on any appointment may be
reconsidered on motion by a member presented not more than one (1) day after
their approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a majority of the
members present concur to grant a reconsideration, the appointment shall be
reopened and submitted anew to the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Any motion to reconsider the vote on any appointment may be laid on the
table, this shall be a final disposition of such a motion." Our holding
was that the mere filing of a motion for reconsideration did not have the
effect of setting aside a confirmation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was a need for its being duly approved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, as set forth at the outset, petitioner
must prevail.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Altarejos v. Molo was an
original action for mandamus to compel respondent therein as Secretary of the
Commission on Appointments to issue a certificate of confirmation of
petitioner's appointment as Provincial Assessor of Masbate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was extended an <u>ad</u> <u>interim</u>
appointment on July 24, 1964. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>He took
his oath of office and qualified as such on August 1, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His appointment was then submitted to the
Commission on Appointments during the regular session of Congress in 1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was confirmed by the Commission on
Appointments on May 19, 1965. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>On the
same day, a member thereof, Congressman Jose Aldeguer, filed with its
Secretary, respondent Molo, a motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day, there was a motion by the then
Senator Francisco Rodrigo that all pending motions for reconsideration be laid
on the table.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was approved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then came the adjournment on May 20,
1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, about a week later,
Congressman Aldeguer withdrew his motion for reconsideration.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court gave full attention to the argument that the motion
for reconsideration of Congressman Aldeguer on May 19, 1965 had the effect of
recalling the confirmation of petitioner's appointment and that, accordingly,
it should be considered non-existent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
rejected it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chief Justice, who
spoke for the Court, explained why:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"This pretense is devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent's theory would give to the mere <u>filing</u> of a motion for
reconsideration the effect which it would have if the motion were <u>approved</u>,
and, hence, would dispense with the necessity of such approval, for which the
concurrence of a majority of the members present is necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is inconsistent with Rule 21 of the
Revised Rules of the Commission, reading:' * * * Resolution of the Commission
on any appointment may be reconsidered on motion by a member presented not more
than one (1) day after their approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>If
a majority of the members present concur to grant a reconsideration</u>, the
appointment shall be <u>reopened</u> and submitted anew to the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any motion to reconsider the vote on any
appointment may be laid on the table, <u>this shall be a final disposition of
such a motion</u>.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
His opinion continued:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Pursuant to
this provision, the vote of a majority of the members present in favor of the
motion for reconsideration is necessary to 'reopen' the appointment - and,
hence, to 'recall' its confirmation - and to require a resubmission of the
appointment for confirmation."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, in holding that this Court "cannot escape the conclusion that
petitioner's appointment as Provincial Assessor of Masbate" had been duly
confirmed, the Chief Justice likewise noted the categorical answer of the
Chairman of the Commission on Appointments to a question by Senator Almendras
as to the effect of motions for reconsideration unacted upon after adjournment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"In case of an adjournment <u>sine</u> <u>die</u>, the motions for
reconsideration are considered as not approved and therefore the motions for
reconsiderations are <u>not valid nor of any effect whatsoever</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
When the question was repeated by Senator Almendras, who did not want to leave
any doubt on the matter, this was the reply of the Chairman:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The ruling of the Chair is
reiterated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of an adjournment <u>sine</u>
<u>die</u>, the period for filing the motion for reconsideration having
expired, under Sec. 22, then the motion for reconsideration not having been
acted upon is not approved and, therefore, has no effect whatsoever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The confirmation, therefore, will stand</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nothing can be clearer, therefore, than that this Court is
committed to the principle that a mere motion for reconsideration to a
confirmation duly made which is not approved cannot have the effect of setting
aside such confirmation, a principle that is based not merely on the express
language of Rule 21, but a reflection of the settled interpretation of the
Commission on Appointments, speaking through its Chairman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While on certain aspects not material, the
facts of this case may be distinguished, from Altarejos v. Molo, there being no
motion to lay on the table and no withdrawal of such motion for
reconsideration, the principle that calls for application cannot be any
different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is decisive is that a
confirmation duly made is not nullified simply by a motion for reconsideration
being filed, without its being voted upon and approved.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Altarejos ruling
possesses the merit of interpreting Rule 21 of the Commission on Appointments
conformably to the letter and spirit of the constitutional provisions on the
appointing power of the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
first one reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The President
shall nominate and with the consent of the Commission on Appointments, shall
appoint the heads of the executive departments and bureaus, officers of the
Army from the rank of colonel, of the Navy and air forces from the rank of
captain or commander, and all other officers of the Government whose appointments
are not herein otherwise provided for, and those whom he may be authorized by
law to appoint; but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of inferior
officers, in the President alone, in the courts, or in the heads of
departments."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
The other provision is worded thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The President shall have the power to make appointments during the
recess of the Congress, but such appoint­ments shall be effective only until
disapproval by the Commission on Appointments or until the next adjournment of the
Congress."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A distinction is thus made between the exercise of such
presidential prerogative requiring confirmation by the Commission on
Appointments when Congress is in session and when it is in recess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the former the President nominates, and
only upon the consent of the Commission on Appointments may the person thus
named assume office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not so with
reference to <u>ad</u> <u>interim</u> appointments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It takes effect at once.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The individual chosen may thus qualify and
perform his function without loss of time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His title to such office is complete.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the language of the Constitution, the appointment is effective
"until disapproval by the Commission on Appointments or until the next
adjournment of the Congress."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The constitutional requirement is clear. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>There must either be a rejection by the
Commission on Appointments or non-action on its part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such thing happened in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner, as pointed out, had instead in
his favor a unanimous vote of confirmation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He could thus invoke constitutional protection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For respondents to argue that the mere filing
of a motion for reconsideration did suffice to set it aside, even in the
absence of any further action, is, as stressed by petitioner, to lose sight of
what is provided in the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That would be moreover tantamount to imparting to a move of a single
member of a collective body a decisive weight.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is bad enough if the minority were to prevail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A one-man rule, which is the effect of what
respondent Secretary of the Commission on Appointments contends, is infinitely
worse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is indefensible in principle
and pernicious in operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can find
no shelter in the constitutional prescription.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rather it makes a mockery of what is therein ordained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's stand is thus unassailable.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor does the insistence
of respondent Secretary of the Commission on Appointments, in his answer, that
the question involved is beyond the jurisdiction of this Court, elicit
approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would extend the boundaries
of the political question doctrine beyond its legitimate limits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The courts are called upon to see to it that
private rights are not invaded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus
even legislative acts and executive orders are not beyond the pale of judicial
scrutiny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, there is nothing
sacrosanct about a rule of the Commission on Appointments, especially so, when
as in this case, a construction sought to be fastened on it would defeat the
right of an individual to a public office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It certainly can be inquired into in an appropriate case, although the
utmost deference should be paid to the interpretation accorded it by the
Commission on Appointments itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the terse language of Justice Brandeis, speaking of the rules of the United
States Senate, which, under its Constitution, has the task of
confirmation:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"As the construction
to be given to the rules affects persons other than members of the Senate, the
question presented is of necessity a judicial one."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
The task becomes unavoidable when claims arising from the express language of
the Constitution are pressed upon the judiciary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it is in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a truism that under the circumstances,
what cannot be ignored is the primacy of what the fundamental law ordains.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such an approach, it is heartening to note, is implicit in the
memorandum on behalf of respondent Secretary of Justice, submitted by the then
Solicitor General Barredo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Although the Commission on Appointments
is not a power in our tripartite system of government, it is to all intents and
purposes, like the Electoral Tribunals, when acting within the limits of its
authority, an independent organ (Cf. Angara vs. Electoral Commission, 63 Phil.
139).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its actuation in the exercise of
its power to approve appointments submitted to it by the President of the
Philippines is exempt from judicial supervision and interference, except on a
clear showing of such arbitrary and improvident use of the powers as will
constitute a denial of due process (Cf. Morero vs. Bocar, 37 O. G. 445)."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
As due process is impressed with both substantive and procedural significance,
the scope of judicial inquiry is thus not unduly limited.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, petitioner is entitled to the writ of mandamus
and the Secretary of the Commission on Appointments is commanded to issue the
certificate of confirmation prayed for by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The incumbent Secretary of Justice is
prohibited from giving any further force and effect to the Department of
Justice directive of February 7, 1966 advising petitioner to vacate his
position as municipal judge in view of the communication received from the then
Secretary of the Commission on Appointments, inasmuch as the right of
petitioner to perform his functions as municipal judge of Pigcawayan, Cotabato
