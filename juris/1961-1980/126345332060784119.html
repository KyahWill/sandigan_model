				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition for review of the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals, in CTA case 1626, which set aside the income tax assessments issued by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue against John L. Manning, W.D. McDonald and E.E. Simmons (hereinafter referred to as the respondents), for alleged undeclared stock dividends received in 1958 from the Manila Trading and Supply Co. (hereinafter referred to as the MANTRASCO) valued at P7,973,660.<br><br>In 1952 the MANTRASCO had an authorized capital stock of P2,500,000 divided into 25,000 common shares; 24,700 of these were owned by Julius S. Reese, and the rest, at 100 shares each, by the three respondents.<br><br>On February 29, 1952, in view of Reese's desire that upon his death MANTRASCO and its two subsidiaries, MANTRASCO (Guam), Inc. and the Port Motors, Inc., would continue under the management of the respondents, a trust agreement on his and the respondents' interests in MANTRASCO was executed by and among Reese (therein referred to as OWNER), MANTRASCO (therein referred to as COMPANY), the law firm of Ross, Selph, Carrascoso and Janda (therein referred to as TRUSTEES), and the respondents (therein referred to as MANAGERS).<br><br>The trust agreement pertinently provides as follows:<br><br><blockquote>“1. Upon the execution of this agreement the OWNER shall deposit with the TRUSTEES, duly endorsed and ready for transfer Twenty-Four Thousand Seven Hundred (24,700) shares of the capital stock of the COMPANY, these shares being all shares of the capital stock of the COMPANIES belonging to him. . . .<br><br>“2.

National Internal Revenue Code<br><br>"SEC. 83.<i> Distribution of dividends or assets by corporations. —</i> (a) <i>Definition of Dividends —</i> The term 'dividends' when used in this Title means any distribution made by a corporation to its shareholders out of its earnings or profits accrued since March first, nineteen hundred and thirteen, and payable to its shareholders, whether in money or in other property.<br><br>"Where a corporation distributes all of its assets in complete liquidation or dissolution, the gain realized or loss sustained by the stockholder, whether individual or corporate, is a taxable income or deductible loss, as the case may be.<br><br>"(b) <i>Stock dividend. —</i> A stock dividend representing the transfer of surplus to capital account shall not be subject to tax.&nbsp; However, if a corporation cancels or redeems stock issued as a dividend at such time and in such manner as to make the distribution and cancellation or redemption, in whole or in part, essentially equivalent to the distribution of a taxable dividend, the amount so distributed in redemption or cancellation of the stock shall be considered as taxable income to the extent that it represents a distribution of earnings or profits accumulated after March first, nineteen hundred and thirteen."<br><br>B. <i>B.I.R. Regulations</i><br><br>"SEC. 251. <i>Dividends paid in property. —</i> Dividends paid in securities or other property (other than its own stock), in which the earnings of the corporation have been invested, are income to the recipients to the amount of the full market value of such property when receivable by individual stockholders . . .<br><br>"SEC. 252. Stock dividend. — A stock dividend which represents the transfer of surplus to capital account is not subject to income tax.&nbsp; However, a dividend in stock may constitute taxable income to the recipients thereof notwithstanding the fact that the officers or directors of the corporation (as defined in section 84) choose to call such distribution as a stock dividend.&nbsp; The distinction between a stock dividend which does not, and one which does, constitute income taxable to the shareholders is the distinction between a stock dividend which works no change in the corporate entity, the same interest in the same corporation being represented after the distribution by more shares of precisely the same character, and a stock dividend where there either has been change of corporate identity or a change in the nature of the shares issued as dividends whereby the proportional interest of the shareholder after the distribution is essentially different from the former interest.&nbsp; A stock dividend constitutes income if it gives the shareholder an interest different from that which his former stockholdings represented.&nbsp; A stock dividend does not constitute income if the new shares confer no different rights or interests than did the old -- the new certificate plus the old representing the same proportionate interest in the net assets of the corporation as did the old."</blockquote><br>The parties differ, however, on the <i>taxability</i> of the "treasury" stock dividends received by the respondents.<br><br>The respondents anchor their argument on the same basis as the Court of Tax Appeals; whereas the Commissioner maintains that the full value (P7,973,660) of the shares redeemed from Reese by MANTRASCO which were subsequently distributed to the respondents as stock dividends in 1958 should be taxed as income of the respondents for that year, the said distribution being in effect a distribution of cash.&nbsp; The respondents' interests in MANTRASCO, he further argues, were only 4% prior to the declaration of the stock dividends in 1958, but rose to 33 1/3% each after the said declaration.<br><br>In submitting their respective contentions, it is the assumption of both parties that the 24,700 shares declared as stock dividends were treasury shares.&nbsp; We are however convinced, after a careful study of the trust agreement that the said shares were not, on December 22, 1958 or at anytime before or after that date, treasury shares.&nbsp; The reasons are quite plain.<br><br>Although authorities may differ on the exact legal and accounting status of so-called "treasury shares,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> they are more or less in agreement that treasury shares are stocks issued and fully paid for and re-acquired by the corporation either by purchase, donation, forfeiture or other means.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Treasury shares are therefore issued shares, but being in the treasury they do not have the status of outstanding shares.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Consequently, although a treasury share, not having been retired by the corporation re­acquiring it, may be re-issued or sold again, such share, as long as it is held by the corporation as a treasury share, participates neither in dividends, because dividends cannot be declared by the corporation to itself,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> nor in the meetings of the corporation as voting stock, for otherwise equal distribution of voting powers among stockholders will be effectively lost and the directors will be able to perpetuate their control of the corporation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> though it still represents a paid-for interest in the property of the corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The foregoing essential features of a treasury stock are lacking in the questioned shares.&nbsp; Thus,<br><br>(a) under paragraph 4(c) of the trust agreement, the trustees were authorized to vote all stock standing in their names at all meetings and to exercise all rights "as owners of said shares" — this authority is reiterated in paragraphs 26 and 28 of the trust agreement;<br><br>(b) under paragraph 4(d), "Any and all dividends paid on said shares after the death of the OWNER shall be subject to the provisions of this agreement;"<br><br>(c) under paragraph 5(b), the amount of retained earnings to be declared as dividends was made subject to the approval of the trustees of the 24,700 shares;<br><br>(d) under paragraph 5(c), the choice of corporate directors was delegated exclusively to the trustees who were also given the authority to transfer qualifying shares to such directors; and<br><br>(e) under paragraph 19, MANTRASCO and its two subsidiaries were expressly prohibited from paying "dividends except as may be authorized by the TRUSTEES;" in the same paragraph mention was also made of "dividends on OWNER'S SHARES" which shall be applied to the liquidation of the liabilities of the three companies for the price of Reese's shares.<br><br>The manifest intention of the parties to the trust agreement was, in sum and substance, to treat the 24,700 shares of Reese as absolutely outstanding shares of Reese's estate until they were fully paid.&nbsp; Such being the true nature of the 24,700 shares, their declaration as treasury stock dividend in 1958 was a complete nullity and plainly violative of public policy.&nbsp; A stock dividend, being one payable in capital stock, cannot be declared out of outstanding corporate stock, but only from retained earnings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Of pointed relevance is this useful discussion of the nature of a stock dividend:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"'A stock dividend always involves a transfer of surplus (or profit) to capital stock.' Graham and Katz, <i>Accounting in Law Practice</i>, 2d ed. 1938, No. 70.&nbsp; As the court said in <i>United States vs. Siegel,</i> 8 Cir., 1931, 52 F 2d 63, 65, 78 ALR 672:&nbsp; 'A stock dividend is a conversion of surplus or undivided profits into capital stock, which is distributed to stockholders in lieu of a cash dividend.' Congress itself has defined the term 'dividend' in No. 115(a) of the Act as meaning any distribution made by a corporation to its shareholders, whether in money or in other property, out of its earnings or profits.&nbsp; In <i>Eisner vs. Macomber,</i> 1920, 252 US 189, 40 S Ct 189, 64 L Ed 521, 9 ALR 1570, both the prevailing and the dissenting opinions recognized that within the meaning of the revenue acts the essence of a stock dividend was the segregation out of surplus account of a definite portion of the corporate earnings as part of the permanent capital resources of the corporation by the device of capitalizing the same, and the issuance to the stockholders of additional shares of stock representing the profits so capitalized."</blockquote><br>The declaration by the respondents and Reese's trustees of MANTRASCO's alleged treasury stock dividends in favor of the former, brings, however, into clear focus the ultimate purpose which the parties to the trust instrument aimed to realize:&nbsp; to make the respondents the sole owners of Reese's interests in MANTRASCO by utilizing the periodic earnings of that company and its subsidiaries to directly subsidize their purchase of the said interests, and by making it appear outwardly, through the formal declaration of non­-existent stock dividends in the treasury, that they have not received any income from those firms when, in fact, by that declaration they secured to themselves the means to turn around as full owners of Reese's shares.&nbsp; In other words, the respondents, using the trust instrument as a convenient technical device, bestowed unto themselves the full worth and value of Reese's corporate holdings with the use of the very earnings of the companies.&nbsp; Such package device, obviously not designed to carry out the usual stock dividend purpose of corporate expansion reinvestment, e.g. the acquisition of additional facilities and other capital budget items, but exclusively for expanding the capital base of the respondents in MANTRASCO, cannot be allowed to deflect the respondents' responsibilities toward our income tax laws.&nbsp; The conclusion is thus ineluctable that whenever the companies involved herein parted with a portion of their earnings "to buy" the corporate holdings of Reese, they were in ultimate effect and result making a distribution of such earnings to the respondents.&nbsp; All these amounts are consequently subject to income tax as being, in truth and in fact, a flow of cash benefits to the respondents.<br><br>We are of the opinion, however, that the Commissioner erred in assessing the respondents the total acquisition cost (P7,973,660) of the alleged treasury stock dividends in one lump sum.&nbsp; The record shows that the earnings of MANTRASCO over a period of years were used to gradually wipe out the holdings therein of Reese.&nbsp; Consequently, those earnings, which we hold, under the facts disclosed in the case at bar, as in effect having been distributed to the respondents, should be taxed for each of the corresponding years when payments were made to Reese's estate on account of his 24,700 shares.&nbsp; With regard to payments made with MANTRASCO earnings in 1958 and the years before, while indeed those earnings were utilized in those years to gradually pay off the value of Reese's holdings in MANTRASCO, there is no evidence from which it can be inferred that prior to the passage of the stockholders' resolution of December 22, 1958 the contributed equity of each of the respondents rose correspondingly.&nbsp; It was only by virtue of the authority contained in the said resolution that the respondents actually, albeit illegally, appropriated and partitioned among themselves the stockholders' equity representing Reese's interests in MANTRASCO.&nbsp;
