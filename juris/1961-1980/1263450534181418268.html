Ramos was ordered compulsorily retired effective </span><st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="9"><span style="">September 22, </span><span style="">1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">for having completed thirty (30) years of service in the Armed Forces
of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">, pursuant to the Armed Forces Retirement Act
(Rep. Act 340).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said order of
retirement, dated </span><st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="10"><span style="">October 25, </span><span style="">1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">was signed by the Chief of Staff, A.F.P., for
the General Headquarters, upon authority of the President of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Several criminal cases,
however, were pending against Ramos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
this reason, payment of retirement benefits to him under said Republic Act 340
was withheld, until he ob­tains the proper clearances of these charges and of his
</span>money and property accountabilities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ramos wrote three letters to the President<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
praying for payment of said be­nefits under the Act, and on April <span style="">27, 1965, </span>the Adjutant General of the
Armed Forces, signing for the Acting Chief of Staff, wrote to Ramos<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
informing him that the Office of the President, in its 5th <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>
to the Secretary of Na­tional Defense, denied the payment of his retirement
bene­fits under the Act until he is cleared of the criminal charges against
him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="5"><span style="">May 12, </span>1965</st1:date>,
<span style="">Col. <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span>
Ramos filed before </span><span class="GramE">Us</span> the present petition for
Mandamus against Executive Secretary Raman Diaz, Secretary of National Defense <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> Peralta, Jr., Chief of Staff, A.F.P., General
Alfredo San­tos and Col. <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Jante</span>,
Chief of Finance, A.F.P., to compel the payment of retirement benefits under
Republic Act 340, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At issue is whether the
payment of benefits granted to members of the Armed Forces under the Armed
Forces Re­tirement Act, as amended, <span class="GramE">may</span> be withheld
pending resolu­tion of criminal charges against the retiree.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A reproduction of the
pertinent portion of the Act providing for compulsory retirement is in order:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Upon completion of at least thirty years of continuous <u><span style="">satisfactory</span></u><span style=""> </span>active service or upon attaining
sixty years of age with a mini­mum of fifteen years continuous active service,
retirement shall be compulsory, unless the con­tinued service of the officer or
enlisted man is, in the opinion of the President, required for the good of the
service." <span class="GramE">(Sec. 1/b/ of R.A. 340, underscoring ours).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is the position of
Ramos that the fact of his compulsory retirement itself operates as the
determination of the satisfactoriness of his service, encompassing the
fulfillment of all the conditions required by law and im­mediately vesting in
him automatically his rights to the benefits under the law; that the payment of
such benefits is mandatory under Section 2 of the Act because he is given the
option to receive a gratuity equivalent to a month's base and longevity pay on
the date of retirement for every year of service or an annual retirement pay
equivalent to 2-1/2% of the annual base and longevity pay; that such be­nefits
are under Sec. 16-A of this Act and Article 302 of the Civil Code, not subject
to attachment, levy, execution or any tax whatsoever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The provision is clear
that continuous active service during the thirty-year period must be </span><u><span style="">satisfactory</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">in
order that the benefits under the Act maybe granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, one may be compelled to retire after
thirty years of con</span>tinuous active service but it does not necessarily
follow that he automatically gets the benefits under the law es­pecially when
circumstances are such that a doubt is cast upon the satisfactoriness of his
service.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case at bar, the
letter of the Office </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the President, dated October 25, </span>1963 <span style="">ordering Ramos' retirement</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> under Republic Act No. </span>340, <span style="">as amended, was in ap­proval of the
recommendation of the General Headquarters </span>for his retirement for the
good of the service in view of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
several criminal charges against him in the courts.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Some of these cases were for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> and <span class="SpellE">mal­versation</span> <span style="">of </span>public
funds alleged to have been committed during his service in the Armed
Forces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Understandably, the letter
ordering his retirement (Annex 1) provided for the payment of benefits only
after showing satisfactori­ness of his service through the submission of <u>clearances
of his criminal charges</u> and <u>of his money and property </u><u><span style="">ac­countabilities</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>While
Ramos alleges that only one case is pending, the others having been dismissed,
a conviction in the same bears against the satisfactoriness of his service
which would be reason enough to bar him from the benefits of the Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ramos' contention that withholding of the retirement benefits is
equivalent to his conviction and in violation of the presumption of <span class="GramE">innocence,</span> is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ramos is not being presumed guilty of or punished for any offense;
hence, the presumption of innocence is not violated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ra­ther, the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the criminal charges puts in issue the satisfactoriness of his service, and
this point has first to be resolved before retirement benefits can be paid to
him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner also relies on the wording of the letter<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
from the Office of the President, signed by the Executive Secretary and
addressed to the Secretary of National De­fense which in part stated that Ramos
"x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>is hereby
retired from the Armed Forces of the Philippines in the rank of Colonel
effective September 22, 1963, the date he com­pleted 30 years of <u>creditable
service</u> and when he there­fore became due for automatic and compulsory
retirement." Ramos points out that Webster's dictionary defines "cre­ditable
service" as "that which is sufficiently good to bring esteem,
deserving of praise." He relies on the use of the phrase in claiming
automatic grant of the benefits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the same letter states that to dispel any doubt "the
payment of the corresponding gratuity and any other benefits to which subject
officer is entitled shall be held pending resolution of the satisfactoriness of
his ser­vice which shall be determined by this office only upon submittal of
clearances of his criminal charges and of his money and property
accountabilities, subject to the usual accounting and auditing
requirements." In the light of the clear terms of the letter, "creditable
service" could not have the import of Ramos' allegations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mandamus would only lie <span style="">if </span>the petitioner's right is clear and
indubita­ble.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for mandamus is hereby
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
