				<H3>CESAREO DE LEON, AS WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSIONER, PABLO SARAGINA, AND FILOMENA TAMBIS, PETITIONERS, VS. THE HON. JUDGE MACAPANTON ABBAS OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF DAVAO, AND AGUSTIN PAHAMOTANG, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for a writ of certiorari and mandamus to set aside certain 
orders of respondent, Hon. Macapanton Abbas, as Judge of First Instance of 
Davao, and to compel him to allow petitioners Pablo Saragina and Filomena 
Tambis, as defendants in Civil Case No. 2586 of said court, to appeal as 
paupers, to permit petitioner Cesareo de Leon as Workmen's Compensation 
Commissioner, likewise, as defendant in said case, to perfect his appeal from 
the decision therein rendered, without filing an appeal bond, and to certify the 
record on appeal filed in connection with said appeal.
<p>Petitioners Pablo Saragina and Filomena Tambis are the parents of Jacinto 
Saragina, driver of a truck belonging to Agustin Pahamotang and used by the 
latter in logging operations. On March 6, 1954, Jacinto Saragina died in 
consequences of injuries sustained by him as said truck fell into a ditch and 
turned turtle, somewhere in Campostela, Davao, on said date. By a communication 
dated November 21, 1955, the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner advised 
Pahamotang that the sum of P1,996.80 was due to the parents of the deceased by 
way of compensation for his death, aside from P200 as burial expenses. A 
reconsideration of this award having been denied, Pahamotang giive notice of 
appeal and then filed with this Court, on December 11, 1956, a petition for 
certiorari with preliminary injunction, which was docketed as G. R. No. L-11657, 
for a review of said award. The petition was dismissed, however, on March 8, 
1957, on motion of the respondents therein (petitioners herein), who claimed 
that said petition had been filed beyond the statutory period.</p>
<p>One year later, or on March 1, 1958, Pahamotang instituted Civil Case No. 
2586 of the Court of First Instance of Davao against petitioners herein. In the 
complaint therein filed, Pahamotang alleged that the aforementioned award of the 
Workmen's Compensation Commission had been made without complying with the 
pertinent law and in violation thereof, and, accordingly, prayed that it be set 
aside and declared null and void. In due course, the defendants therein 
(petitioners herein) filed a motion to dismiss, the consideration of which was 
eventually deferred until after the trial of the case on the merits. 
Subsequently, the defendants therein (petitioners herein) were declared in 
default, for failure to file an answer within the reglementary period, and, upon 
the evidence introduced by Pahamotang, decision was rendered on August 7, 1958, 
annulling the aforementioned award. On August 20, 1958, the defendants therein 
(petitioners herein) filed a motion to lift the order of default, upon the 
ground of accident and excusable negligence, but, the motion was denied by an 
order dated September 9, 1958. A reconsideration of this order having been, 
likewise, denied, the defendants therein (petitioner's herein) filed a notice of 
their intention to appeal and petition that the appeal of Pablo Saragina and 
Filomena Tambis be given due course as pauper's appeal. The court, presided over 
by Hon. Macapanton Abbas, Judge, "denied" the "notice of appeal and petition to 
appeal as pauper" upon the ground that it had not been "filed within the 
reglementary period". On motion of the defendants therein (petitioners herein), 
the court, by an order dated January 2, 1959, reconsidered its stand insofar as 
the timeliness of the notice of appeal, but refused to allow Pablo Saragina and 
Filomena Tambis to appeal as paupers, upon the ground that the principal 
defendant was the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner, and declared that the 
record on appeal would be certified upon the filing of defendants' appeal bond. 
The defendants therein (petitioners herein) sought a reconsideration of this 
order, insofar as it denied the appeal as paupers of Pablo Saragina and Filomena 
Tambis and required the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner to file a bond, but 
in vain. Hence the present action for certiorari and mandamus to compel 
allowance of the appeal of Pablo Saragina and Filomena Tambis as paupers, and 
certification of the aforementioned record on appeal without any appeal 
bond.</p>
<p>It is not disputed that Pablo Saragina and Filomena Tambis are poor. This 
notwithstanding, the lower court refused to allow them to appeal as paupers upon 
the ground that they are nominal defendants in said Civil Case No. 2586, that 
the principal defendant therein is the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner, with 
whom they are jointly sued, and that all defendants have filed a joint record on 
appeal and are represented by the legal counsel of the Department of Labor. If 
Pablo Saragina and Filomena Tambis, whose indigeney is admitted, were merely 
nominal parties, then this would be an added reason to exempt them from 
incurring the usual expenses entailed by an appeal, and, hence, to authorize 
their appeal as paupers. The fact is, however, that being the parties in whose 
favor the award sought to be annulled has been made, Pablo Saragina and Filomena 
Tambis are not nominal parties, but the principal parties and <i>real parties in 
interest</i>, without whom no decision on the validity of said award could 
legally be rendered. The nominal party was the Workmen's Compensation 
Commissioner.</p>
<p>With respect to the appeal taken by the latter, it is, also, patent that he 
being sued in his official capacity, aside from being a nominal party, the main 
action is in effect one against the Government which is not required to file an 
appeal bond. Accordingly, respondent Judge committed a grave abuse of discretion 
in requiring the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner to file such bond as a 
condition for the perfection of his appeal and the certification of the record 
on appeal.</p>
<p>There being now no question that the same has been seasonably filed and is 
regular insofar as its form and contents are concerned, the writs prayed for are 
hereby granted and respondent Judge is directed to allow the appeal of Pablo 
Saragina and Filomena Tambis as paupers and to certify said record on appeal 
without the usual appeal bond, with costs against respondent Agustin Pahamotang. 
It is so ordered.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Labrador, Reyes, J.B,L., Barrera, 
Paredes,</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.,</em> concur.</div>
