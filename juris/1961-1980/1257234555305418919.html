				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Appeal by certiorari from a decision of the Court of Appeals, reversing that 
of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, in the above entitled case.</p>
<p>The facts are set forth in said decision of the Court of Appeals, from which 
we quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It appears that oil January 20, 1956, appellant Quezon City approved 
Resolution No. 2496, authorizing petitioner-appellee, Loreto F. Stewart to 
operate a 'supermarket' in Project 4, Quezon City as defined therein.</p>
<p>"In operating the supermarket, it was discovered that fresh fish, meat and 
other perishable goods were sold in various stalls therein, unrefrigerated.</p>
<p>"On May 5, 1959, the respondent-appellant Quezon City Council approved 
Resolution No. 4761, withdrawing from Mrs. Stewart the privilege of selling 
unrefrigerated foodstuffs, such as fresh fish, meat, fruits, vegetables, poultry 
products and other perishable goods, on grounds stated in the Resolution. In 
this wise:</p>
<p>'Whereas, on January 20, 1956, the City Council of Quezon City approved 
Resolution No. 2496, authorizing Mrs. Loreto F. Stewart to operate a supermarket 
in Project 4, Quezon City, under certain conditions:</p>
<p>'Whereas, Mrs. Loreto F. Stewart has actually engaged in the sale of 
foodstuffs, meat, fish, fresh vegetables, poultry products, and other perishable 
goods an her supermarket which should properly be undertaken in a public 
market;</p>
<p>'Whereas, a public market within the vicinity of the Stewart Supermarket 
(formerly known as Dimaculangan Market), constructed under the authority of the 
City Council, is new open to the public and at which the sale of foodstuffs, 
meat, fish, fresh vegetables, poultry products, and other perishable goods may 
properly be undertaken;</p>
<p>'Whereas, Mrs, Loreto F. Stewart has not complied with the provisions of 
paragraph 5 of Resolution No. 2496 regarding the installation of equipment or 
machinery for the refrigeration of perishable goods in her market, Now, 
Therefore, be it </p>
<p>'RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF QUEZON CITY TO amend as it does hereby amend 
Resolution No. 2496, series of 1956 authorizing Mrs. Loreto F. Stewart to 
operate a supermarket in Project 4, Quezon City, so as to withdraw from the 
operation of the said supermarket the sale of foodstuffs and other commodities 
such as fish, fresh fruit, meat, vegetables, poultry products, and other 
perishable goods, (pp. 14-15, Rec. on Appeal.)'</p>
<p>"On June 30, 1959, petitioners-appellees filed the present petition for 
injunction, alleging that Resolution Numbered 4761 is null and void, it 
being:</p>
<p>'a) In violation of the 'due process clause' of Article II, Section 1, 
paragraph 1, of the Philippine Constitution, for it deprives, the herein 
petitioner, Kamuning Theater, Inc. of its rightful exercise of property rights, 
which under the contract executed by and between the herein petitioner, Kamuning 
Theater, Inc. and the respondent, Quezon City, the herein petitioner Kamuning 
Theater, Inc. for valuable consideration, validity acquired from the respondent 
Quezon City, the said right to sell perishable goods in its market; said 
property right, therefore, constitutes vested right in favor of the herein 
petitioner, Kamuning Theater, Inc.</p>
<p>'b) In violation, of the equal 'protection clause' of Article III, Section 1, 
paragraph 1 of the Philippine Constitution for it legislates a legitimate 
private enterprise which is the herein petitioner, Kamuning Theater, Inc. cut of 
business in favor of another privately owned enterprise engaged along the same 
line of business, which is the Dimaculangan Market, although under paragraph 3 
of Resolution Numbered 4761 the Dimaculangan Market was falsely, erroneously and 
maliciously referred to as a private market; the truth of the matter is that the 
Dimaculangan Market is a public market and not a private market, as alleged 
under paragraph 3, of Resolution Numbered 4761.</p>
<p>'c) In violation of Article II, Sestion I, paragraph 10 of the Philippine 
Constitution for it impairs the obligation of contracts.</p>
<p>'d) In violation of the generally accented principles of separaton of powers 
of the three branches of the government, namely—the executive, legislative and 
the judiciary.'</p>
<p>"On July 6, 1959, respondents resisted the action alleging that:</p>
<p>'a. There was no contract entered into between her and the City Government. 
Resolution Numbered 4761 contains certain conditions which Mrs. Stewart is at 
liberty to reject or approve; and the fact that she had paid the annual license 
fee of P3,000.00 does create an implied contract because this is not the only 
condition imposed in the said resolution.</p>
<p>'b. Assuming for the sake of argument that there is such a contract between 
Mrs. Stewart and the City Government, the sarre did not include the right to 
sell perishable goods because under the resolution, Mrs. Stewart was only 
authorized to sell grorery goods, foodstuffs, dry goods, liquor and refrigerated 
goods.</p>
<p>'c. Again, assuming for the sake of argument, that there is such a contract. 
Mrs. Stewart has consistently violated condition No. 5 of the resolution, 
consequently, she cannot violate the contract and at the same time ask for its 
enforcement.</p>
<p>'d. Family, assuming that there is such a contract, Resolution Numbered 4761 
whose enforcement is sought to be enjoined in this action is a valid exercise of 
the police power, in ths interest of the public health.'</p>
<p>"On July 31, 1959, the lower court rendered judgment declaring Resolution 
Numbered 4761 null and void and making the writ of preliminary injunction issued 
earlier permanent, on the ground that petitioners had not violated the 
conditions set forth in Resolution No. 4709, because the evidence showed that an 
adequate refrigeration system had in fact been installed by 
petitioners."</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the Court of Appeals, held that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * the decisive issue in this case is not whether there was in fact a 
refrigeration system in the supermarket of petitioner Mrs. Stewart, but whether 
or not she was authorized to undertake the sale of fresh, unrefrigerated meats, 
fish and other perishable foodstuffs, under the provisions of Resolution No. 
2496."</p></blockquote>
<p>and that the latter question should be decided in the negative. Accordingly, 
it reversed the decision of the court of first instance and dissolved the 
injunction issued by the same, as well as rendered judgment dismissing the 
petition, with costs against petitioners Kamuning Theater, Inc. and Loreto F. 
Stewart. Hence, the latter have interposed the present appeal by certiorari, and 
insist that the aforementioned Resolution No. 4761 violates the due process and 
equal protection clause, as well as impairs a contractual obligation and 
infringes Article 1191, paragraph 3, of the Civil Code of the Philippines, aside 
from asserting that the Court of Appeals had evaded the real issue in this 
case.</p>
<p>The last pretense is predicated upon the theory that the true issue is 
whether or not petitioners herein had provided their supermarket with the 
refrigeration equipment required in Resolution No. 2496. It is true that this 
was one of the issues raised in the court of first instance and the Court of 
Appeals, and that in an ocular inspection made on July 15, 1959, four (4) 
freezers—one of which was not functioning—one refrigerator and (5) coca-cola 
coolers, were found in the aforementioned supermarket. But, apart from the fact 
that this circumstance does not necessarily show that said equipment were in 
petitioners' supermarket when Resolution No. 4761 was approved on May 5, 1959, 
we find that the aforementioned statement of the Court of Appeals, as regards 
the decisive issue in the case, is correct.</p>
<p>With respect to the validity of Resolution No. 4761, the Court of Appeals 
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Resolution No. 2496 of Quezon City, authorizing Mrs. Stewart to operate a 
supermarket in Project 4, defines 'supermarket', as follows: ,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Supermarket is a place designated by municipal authorities of a city or of 
an incorporated town for the sale of grocery goods, food stuffs, dry goods, 
liquor, and other commodities such as meat, fresh fruits, poultry products, milk 
and vegetables necessary or . convenient for the subsistence of the community 
tftfit are refrigerated,' (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>"It is noted that Mrs. Stewart was authorized to operate, not a public 
market, wherein fresh meat, fresh fish and other fresh perishable food-stuffs 
are sold, .but only a 'supermarket' as defined in the Resolution. Indeed, even 
without such definition, it is a matter of common knowledge that a supermarket 
is quite different from what is commonly known as a general public market. A 
supermarket is generally understood to be an establishment wherein canned goods, 
dry goods and refrigerated meats and fish are sold. From the definition 
above-quoted, it is seen that the City Council took pains to state that what may 
be sold in said supermarket are, in addition to groceries, dry goods and liquor, 
which by their very nature need not be refrigerated, 'other commodities such as 
meat, fresh fruits, poultry products, milk and vegetables * * * that are 
refrigerated'. It is thus plain that what Mrs. Stewart was authorized to sell 
was merely refrigerated meats, and other refrigerated foodstuffs. It did not 
authorize, her to sell unrefrigerated fresh meat or fresh fish. Notwithstanding 
lack of authority, however, Mrs. Stewart actually engaged in the sale of 
unrefrigerated fresh meat, fish, vegetables and poultry products. It was 
precisely to meet the situation that Resolution No. 4761 was enacted to 
specifically prohibit Mrs. Stewart from undertaking the sale of such fresh 
perishable meats and fish, thus:</p>
<p>RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF QUEZON CITY to amend as it does hereby amend 
Resolution No. 2496, series of 1956, authorizing Mrs. Loreto F. Stewart to 
operate a supermarket in Project 4, Quezon City, so as to withdraw from the 
operation of the said supermarket the sale of foodstuffs, and other commodifies 
such as fish, fresh fruit, meat, vegetables, poultry products, and other 
perishable goods.</p>
<p>"In prohibiting her from undertaking the sale of said unrefrigerated fresh 
meat and other fresh perishable foodstuffs, Mrs. Stewart has absolutely no 
reason to complain, because, as hereinabove pointed out, the only privilege 
granted to her was to operate a supermarket wherein refrigerated meats and other 
refrigerated foodstuffs may be sold. She was never authorized to sell 
unrefrigerated fresh meat, fresh fish and other fresh perishable stuffs, the 
sale of which is properly undertaken in ordinary public markets. Hence, when 
Resolution No. 4761 was approved prohibiting her from selling unrefrigerated 
fresh meat, etc. in her supermarket, she was not being deprived, of any right 
granted her under Resolution No. 2496. </p>
<p>"Indeed, in the minutes of the session of the Quezon City Council held on May 
5, 1959, introduced by petitioners-appeliees as Exhibit 'G', the following 
remarks were made in connection with the assailed Resolution: </p></blockquote>
<p>'COUN. VELUZ:</p>
<p>
</p><center>* * * * * * *</center>

<blockquote>
<p>This is not a question of withdrawing, because, really, as contained in the 
original resolution, it is not the intention of the City Council for perishable 
goods to be sold there and it is a matter of imposing a resolution which has not 
been declared illegal. My question now is: Can the City Government just ignore 
its own resolution? If it is a matter of accommodation, I believe since the 
establishment, of this supermarket in 1954 up to the present, we have already 
given so many accommodations. * * *</p>
<p>From the very beginning, this is known already. Precisely, if the City 
Council yielded in 1954, it is because we believe that because of the expenses 
which the owner had already incurred, the City Council would be fair and 
considerate enough, and it has gone beyond the limit. If we perpetuate this, the 
city will be deprived of its legitimate earnings from the public market;</p>
<p>

<p>'Sapagkat dito naman ay hindi natin inuurong ang karapatan niyang magpalakad. 
Ang hinihingi lamang ng resolusyon na ito, para maliwanagan na at katunayan 
naman ay hindi sakop ng resolusyon ni Mrs. Stewart, ay ang 'perishable goods', 
katulad ng karne, isda, itlog, gulay, at ibapa, ay nawala na o maalis sa kanyang 
"supermarket" sapagka't hindi naman kasama sa balak o doon sa unang 
pinagkasunduan na ang 'perishable goods' ay malagay doon, kaya lamang ay 
pinagkalooban siya nang 'supermarket'." (pieza of Exhibits, pp- 25-27 and 35.) 
</p></blockquote>
<p>We fully agree with this view, with only one qualification. The Court of 
Appeals considered Resolution No. 4761 as merely prohibiting petitioners from 
selling <i>'unrefrigerated fresh</i> meat, <i>fresh </i>fish and other <i>fresh 
</i>perishable stuffs". However, the body of said resolution literally withdraws 
"from the operation of the said supermarket the sale of foodstuffs and other 
commodities such as fish, fresh fruit, meat, vegetables, poultry products and 
other perishable goods", without any qualification, and, hence, could be 
understood as prohibiting the sale of the aforementioned goods, whether 
refrigerated or not. To the extent that may be construed as excluding from 
petitioners' right the sale of said goods, <i>even if refrigerated</i>, 
Resolution No. 4761 would amount, therefore, to a denial of due process and to 
an infringement of the impairment clause, and, since, the alleged violation by 
them of the terms of Resolution No. 4761, for failure to install the requisite 
refrigeration system, has not been satisfactorily proven, we adopt the view 
taken by the Court of Appeals in the sense that petitioners may not, under 
Resolutions Nos. 2496 and 4761, sell fresh meat, fresh fish, fresh vegetables, 
poultry products, foodstuffs and other perishable goods, but only when 
unrefrigerated.</p>
<p>Petitioners invoke paragraph 3 of Article 1191 of the Civil Code of the 
Philippines providing that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The court shall decree the rescission claimed, unless there be just cause 
authorizing the fixing of a period." </p></blockquote>
<p>in support of the proposition that they should have been given a period 
within which to comply with the requirements of Resolution No. 2496. This 
pretense might have a semblance of validity if the issue were limited to whether 
or not they had failed to equip their supermarket with the refrigeration system 
required in said resolution. But, as already pointed out, the same never 
authorized the petitioners to sell foodstuff, meat, fish, vegetables, poultry 
products and other perishable goods which are not refrigerated. Hence, there 
could be no possible extension of time for the sale of unrefrigerated perishable 
goods. </p>
<p>With the aforementioned qualification that petitioners shall not be deemed 
deprived of the right to sell foodstuffs, fresh meat, fresh fish, fresh 
vegetables, poultry products and other perishable goods if refrigerated, the 
decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby affirmed, therefore, without special 
pronouncement as to the costs in this instance. It is so ordered.</p>
