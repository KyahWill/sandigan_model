				<H3>COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION, PETITIONER, VS.
HON. FRANCISCO ARCA, AS JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, BRANCH
I, SY KIB @ SY GIP, CO CHIN LUN AND BABY CO, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.P., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kib</span>, alias
<span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Gip</span>, and her two minor
children, Co Chin <span class="SpellE">Lun</span> and Baby Co, previously visited
this country as temporary visitors on May 5, 1955 up to April 6, 1956 and on
February 7, 1959 up to March 6, 1960.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon previous application, they were again admitted here on July 30,
1960 under Section 9(g) of the Immigration Act, as amended, <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kib</span>, as a pre-arranged employee for <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pao</span> &amp; Company where she
had allegedly invested $10,000 and was to work as cashier and treasurer, and
two minor children, as here dependents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their authorized stay was three years, counted from the date of their
arrival.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
This period expired on July 29, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The request for extension of their stay, filed by <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pao</span>, Manager of the Company, dated June 4, 1963, was
granted on October 12, 1964 by the Commissioner of Immigration provided that
they leave the country on or before November 30, 1964.</p>

<p class="BODY">Several months after the period last mentioned had expired,
however, <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kib</span> and her
children still remained in the country.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On March 12, 1965, Acting Commissioner of Immigration <span class="SpellE">Martiniano</span> Vivo ordered her to depart from the country with
her children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Commissioner denied
subsequent requests by the First Secretary and concurrent­ly Consul General of
the Chinese Embassy for a year's extension of their stay, on the ground that <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kib</span> has had enough time to
liquidate her business here.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kib</span> and
her aforementioned children then peti­tioned on August 7, 1965 the Court of
First instance of Manila,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
to enjoin the Commissioner of Immigration from arresting them, <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> their bonds and deporting them and to allow
their stay until Co Te, <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kib's</span>
husband and father of her children, becomes naturalized and until <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kib</span>, now allegedly an
indispensable business partner in the <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pao</span> Company, liquidates her interests in said company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their arrest and deportation was temporarily
en­joined by said court, pending hearing on the plea for pre­liminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Acting Commissioner of Immigration opposed the
petition and moved for its dismissal, alleging his discretion on extensions of
aliens’ stay in the country and that his authority to arrest them was not
subject to injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further alleged were
non-exhaustion of administrative remedies and the fact that <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kib's</span> husband, who had merely filed a declaration of
intention to file a petition for naturalization, can very well tend to her
alleged business interests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite said
opposition the Court of First Instance presided by Judge Francisco <span class="SpellE">Arca</span> denied the dismissal of the petition and enjoined, by
preliminary injunction, until further notice, the respondent from arresting and
deporting <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kib</span> and her
two children.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Commissioner of Immigration is now<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> before Us asking that We enjoin the
lower court from enforcing its own injunction, questioning its jurisdiction
over the case and re-asserting his discretion and power over the extension of
the period of an aliens' stay here.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before Us for consideration is the propriety of the lower court's
taking cognizance of the case and its is­suance of the injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The administration of immigration laws is the primary
responsibility of the executive branch of the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Extensions of stay of aliens are
discretionary on the part of immigration authorities,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a> and neither a petition for mandamus
nor one for certiorari can compel the Commissioner of Immigration to extend the
stay of an alien whose period to stay has expired.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a> Should the actuations of the Commissioner
be unsatisfactory, the parties concerned should address themselves to the
President of the Philippines who by law has the final authority on such
questions of deportation.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a> Applicable jurisprudence therefore,
plainly shows the lower court to have erred in entertaining the case and in
enjoining further actions which the Commissioner was duty bound to carry out.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kib's</span>
husband's application for naturalization or the fact of <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kib's</span> having had three other Manila-born minor
children, does not change her situation nor that of her children who came with
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In several instances, af­ter the
husband had been granted his petition for natura­lization but before his oath
as a citizen, We held that the alien wife as well as their children whose
period of stay has expired, must leave the country.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a> Their remedy is to secure
permission to re-enter permanently after having left the country.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kib's</span>
claim that they entered the country as non-quota immigrants, the record shows
them to have been accepted as non-immigrants,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a> and as such they cannot remain here
permanently without first departing and then requesting for permanent
re-entry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the order of
their admission expressly stated that their stay shall not exceed three years
from their date of ar­rival.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Knowing the
limited duration of her stay, <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kib</span>,
as well as her company, risked its non-extension and con­sequent loss of money
by supposedly engaging extensively in the business in which <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kib</span> allegedly played an indis­pensable role.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, We find tenable the Commissioner’s
argument that her business interests can be taken cared of by her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the extension of her stay for at
least a year was made as early as March 21, 1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the
present case has more than provided her wish.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no question now that she and her two children must leave the
country.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the respondent court is enjoined from car­rying
out its injunction, which is hereby dissolved, and the Commissioner of
Immigration is ordered to proceed in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
