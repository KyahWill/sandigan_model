in its Civil Case No. 58675, dismissing herein petitioner-appellant's petition
for <i>mandamus</i> with preliminary mandatory injunction upon the ground that
the court had no jurisdiction over the <span style="">ca</span><span style="">se, </span>and from the order denying the

<p class="BODY">Petitioner-appellant, <span class="SpellE">Donata</span> Luna, was
the owner of a fishing boat named M/B "PANINDA", duly registered with
the office of the Collector of Customs of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Port</st1:placetype>

Lighthouse, in Occidental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, by <span style="">the </span>crew of the RPS "<st1:place>PALAWAN</st1:place>",
for carrying <span class="SpellE">unmanifested</span> and <span style="">untaxed articles of foreign origin, consisting of blue seal cigarettes
and other articles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vessel was
thereupon escorted to </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, and both the vessel and its cargo were made the subjects of
forfeiture proceedings insti­tuted pursuant to the provisions of the Tariff and
Customs Code, under Seizure Identification Nos. 6670 and 6670-A, before the
respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>,
the Acting Collector of Customs of the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">port</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> of </span><st1:placename><span style="">Manila</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1963</st1:date>,
after hearing, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Acting Collector <span style="">or </span>Customs rendered a decision
ordering the fishing boat M/B "PANINDA" forfeited in favor of the
Govern­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision reads <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Likewise, <span style="">the </span>fishing
boat M/B 'PANIN­DA' covered by Seizure Identification No. 6670-A is declared
forfeited to the Govern­ment, the same to be treated as Government property and
turned over to the Supply Officer II, Bureau of <span style="">Customs, </span>or to any other govern­ment agency or instrumentality
which might need them, upon compliance with auditing re­quirements."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Copy <span style="">of </span>the
above-mentioned decision was furnished <span style="">the
</span><span style="">counsel </span>of the owner of the
vessel (herein appellant <span class="SpellE">Donata</span> Luna) by registered
mail, receipt of which on <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="6">June 15,
 1963</st1:date> was acknowledged by the counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 16, 1963, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Collector of
Customs re­ceived a letter of appellant's counsel, dated July 8, 1963, wherein
appellant, as owner of the M/B "PANINDA", offered to redeem said
vessel pursuant to the provisions of Section 2307 of the Tariff and Customs
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="7">July 18, 1963</st1:date>, respondent Collector of Customs, in a
letter addressed to petitioner's counsel, denied <span style="">the </span>request for redemption upon the ground <span style="">that </span>the period within which <span style="">the forfeited article </span>might be
redeemed had already lapsed <span style="">and
"that release of vessels apprehended for smuggling activities runs counter
to the existing policy of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">Government."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Herein appellant did not appeal to the Commissioner of Customs
from the decision of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Collector of Customs
which declared the vessel <span style="">and </span>its
cargo forfeited <span style="">to the government, nor
did she appeal from the decision denying her offer to redeem the vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, on October 16, 1964, appellant filed
in the Court of First Instance of Manila a petition for <i>mandamus</i> with
preli­minary mandatory injunction (ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>),
praying, among other things, that "a writ of <i>mandamus</i> issue
commanding the respondent to execute all the acts necessary to com­plete the
surrender to petitioner of the vessel in ques­tion", upon payment of the
appraised value thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1964</st1:date>,
the Court of First Instance of Manila issued an order requiring therein
respondent Collector of Customs to answer the petition, and setting the
application for the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction for hearing on <st1:date year="1964" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing, the trial court, on <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1964</st1:date>, issued an order
denying the issuance of the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction, for the
reason that the issuance of the writ would be improper under the circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1964</st1:date>,
herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed a motion to dismiss the
petition for <i>mandamus</i> upon the ground, among others, that the Court of
First Instance of Manila had no jurisdiction over the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="12">December
 12, 1964</st1:date>, appellant filed her opposition to the motion to dismiss,
and on the same pleading moved for the <span style="">reconsideration
</span>of the lower court's order of <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="11">November
 25, 1964</st1:date>, denying her application for a writ of preliminary
mandatory injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> motion to dismiss well taken, the trial court,
in an order dated <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1964</st1:date>,
dismissed <span style="">the </span>petition for <i>mandamus</i>
upon the ground that it had no juris­diction over the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="1">January
 16, 1965</st1:date>, appellant filed a motion for reconsideration of the order
of <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="12">Decem­ber 12, 1964</st1:date>, and
the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, on <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1965</st1:date>, filed <span style="">his opposition to the said motion <span style="">for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In an
order dated </span><st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="1"><span style="">January 30, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, the lower court denied ap­pellant's motion
for reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence the present appeal by herein petitioner-appellant from the
order of the lower court dismissing the <span style="">peti­tion
</span>for <i>mandamus</i> and the order denying her motion for
reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">This appeal has no merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only matter to be resolved in the present case is, whether or
not the Court of First Instance of Manila had correctly dismissed the petition
for <i>mandamus</i> because it had <span style="">no </span>jurisdiction
over the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court, in resolving this issue, aptly observed:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order to determine the jurisdiction of
this Court, we have only to refer to Republic Act No. 1155, creat­ing the Court
of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 7 of this Act
has granted to that Court ex­clusive appellate jurisdiction to review by
appeal, among others, decisions of the Commissioner of Customs in cases
involving <u>seizure</u>, <u><span style="">detention</span></u><span style=""> </span>or <u><span style="">release of property</span></u> <u>affected</u>, and this is precisely
the matter involved in this petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Collector of Customs ordered the confiscation and forfeiture of the
property of the petitioner herein, which is a vessel which was alleged­ly used
for smuggling purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is his
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any attempt to review or do
anything with that decision partakes of the nature of an appeal, and, under the
law, appeals from the said decision must be taken to the Court of Tax Appeals,
as above-mentioned, In fact, interpreting this pro­vision of <span style="">the </span>law, the Supreme Court of this
country has already sustained the jurisdic­tion of the Court of <span style="">Tax </span>Appeals in the cases of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rogaciano</span></u></span><u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Millares</span>, etc., et
</span>al. </u><u><span style="">vs. Hon. Judge Rafael
<span class="SpellE">Amparo</span>, etc., et al. (G. R. No. L-8354)</span></u><span style=""> </span>and <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Namarco</span></u></span><u><span style=""> vs. Hon. Judge <span class="SpellE">Higinio</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Macadaeg</span>, et al.
(G. R. No. L-10030</span></u><span style="">).<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is, therefore, idle for us to still discuss this question
of jurisdiction now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is already a
settled question."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, as early as <st1:date year="1955" day="30" month="6">June
 30, 1955</st1:date>, in the above-mentioned case of <span class="SpellE">Millares</span>,
etc. and David, etc., et al., (G. R. Nos. L-8351, L-8364, and. L-8365) 97
Phil., 282, this Court ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"Republic Act No. 1125, section 7, effective June 16, 1954
gave the Court of Tax Appeals <u><span style="">exclusive
appellate</span></u><span style=""> </span>jurisdiction
to review on appeal, decisions of the Commissioner of Customs, involving <span style="">'<u>seizure</u>,</span> detention or release
of pro­perty affected * * * or other matters arising <span style="">under the Customs Law or other law ad­ministered by the Bureau of
Customs'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In our opinion this provision
necessari­ly has taken away the power of the Manila court of first instance to
'review' de­cisions of the Customs authorities, 'in any case of seizure' -- as
in this case -- under section 1383 et seq. of the Revised Adminis­trative
Code."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing ruling has been consistently reiterated in
subsequent decisions of this Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What appellant should have done was to appeal to the Commissioner
of Customs from the decision of the Collector of Customs denying her offer to
redeem the vessel in ques­tion, and, in the event of an adverse decision by the
Commissioner <span style="">of </span>Customs, to
appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals; and she still had a recourse of appeal to
this Court in case of an adverse decision by the Court of Tax Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the orders appealed from should be, as they are
hereby, affirmed, with costs against petitioner-appellant <span class="SpellE">Donata</span>
Luna.</p>
