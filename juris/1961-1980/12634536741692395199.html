CANDIDATE)
<br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Pedro A. <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> of <span class="SpellE">Guindulman</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bohol</span></st1:place> filed a petition to take
the 1974 <span class="GramE">Bar</span> examinations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This petition was granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the afternoon of <st1:date month="12" day="1" year="1974">December
 1, 1974</st1:date> he was at his assigned seat no. 17, room 401, fourth floor,
<st1:place><st1:placename>Manuel</st1:placename> <st1:placename>L.</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place> on R. Hidalgo, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Bar examination that afternoon was in
Criminal Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the examination was in progress, the <span class="SpellE">headwatcher</span>
in room 401, <span class="SpellE">Lilian</span> <span class="SpellE">Mendigorin</span>,
reported that examinee <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> was found reading, at
approximately <st1:time hour="15" minute="15">3:15 o'clock</st1:time>, a piece
of paper containing notes in Criminal Law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He at first refused to surrender the paper, but later gave it to <span class="SpellE">Mendigorin</span> when she threatened to report the matter to the
authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A verbal report was relayed
to the Bar Chairman who forthwith gave instructions that no investigation be
then made in order to forestall any commotion that might disturb the other
candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Amparo</span>
was permitted to continue answering the questions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Headwatcher</span> <span class="SpellE">Mendigorin</span> thereafter submitted a special report on the
incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the following day, Clerk of Court Romeo Mendoza filed a formal
report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting thereon, the Court <i style=""><span style="">en
banc</span></i><span style="">,
</span>on December 3, 1974, unanimously resolved "to disqualify Pedro <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> from taking the Bar examinations still to be given,
namely, in the subjects of Remedial Law and Labor and Social Legislation, on
Sunday, December 8, 1974, without prejudice to allowing him to take the Bar
examinations after this year."</p>

<p class="BODY">In a letter dated <st1:date month="12" day="5" year="1974">December
 <span style="">5, 1974</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> </span>requested
that "before final action is <span style="">or
becomes effective" he</span> "be given a chance <span style="">to explain" </span>his side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December <span style="">5, 1974 </span><span style="">the Court reconsidered </span><span style="">its
prior </span>resolution and allowed <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> to take
the Bar examinations on the coming Sunday, December 8, 1974, without prejudice
to further action by the Court after a formal and more detailed investigation
of the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">As ordered, the Clerk of Court conducted an investigation on
December 9, 1974 at which the respondent <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> (a)
appeared in his own behalf, (b) cross-examined the witnesses against him, (c)
presented himself as his own witness, and (d) presented as his witnesses three
Bar candidates who in the afternoon of December 1 were seated near him in the
examination room.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the investigation, <span class="SpellE">headwatcher</span> <span class="SpellE">Mendigorin</span> identified <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> as
the Bar examinee whom she saw reading a piece of paper inside the examination
room in the course of the examination in Criminal Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The piece of paper, later marked as exhibit
C, contains handwritten notes, on both sides, on the durations of penalties and
formula of computing them, particularly <i style=""><span style="">reclusion temporal</span></i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="SpellE">Mendigorin</span>
testified that she approached <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> and asked for
the piece of paper; that he refused and put the paper in his pocket; that when
she approached him a second time, he fished the paper from his pocket and gave
it to her; that when, at the end of the examination period, <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span>
submitted his examination notebook, he told her that he really had intended to
cheat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On cross-examination, she
elaborated that <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> gave the piece of paper only
when she told him that she would bring the matter up to higher authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">Vernon B. Vasquez, a watcher under <span class="SpellE">headwatcher</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mendigorin</span> corroborated the latter's testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared that from a distance of five
meters, he saw <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> reading a piece of paper on his
lap, that he wanted to approach him but his <span class="SpellE">headwatcher</span>
was already ahead of him; and that <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> thereupon
placed the paper in his pocket, but when <span class="SpellE">Mendigorin</span> <span class="SpellE">threatended</span> to report the matter, <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span>
yielded exhibit C with a smile.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his testimony, <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> admitted having
in his possession, in the course of the examination, the piece of paper,
exhibit C, explaining that because he was perspiring, he took his handkerchief
from his pocket, and out also came the piece of paper which fell to the floor;
that the notes were not in his handwriting as they were given by a friend, and
that it was by accident that he picked up the paper to find out what is was, as
he had forgotten about it, but had no intention to use it; that while he was
reading it, the <span class="SpellE">headwatcher</span> saw him and demanded it
from him, but he refused because he thought that he might need it for
"future reference," but when the <span class="SpellE">headwatcher</span>
insisted as otherwise she would report the matter to her supervisor, <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> surrendered the paper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On cross examination, he declared that
exhibit C had been in his pocket a long time before December 1; that he had not
changed his pants for three weeks; that when the first bell rang for the
examination in Criminal Law, he was required to put "all his things"
out of the room; that he forgot about the paper inside his pocket; that when he
took out his handkerchief to wipe his perspiration, the paper fell to the
floor, and he wondered what it was and then recalled upon reading it that it
had been given by a friend; and that as he was reading it, "that diligent <span class="SpellE">headwatcher</span> came and asked for that paper." He further
admitted that he knew it is contrary to the rules to bring notes and books
inside the examination room.</p>

<p class="BODY">Bar candidates <span class="SpellE">Jovencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Fajilan</span>, Norman M. <span class="SpellE">Balagtas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> O. <span class="SpellE">Calix</span>, Sr., who
were seated near <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> in room 401, were presented
by the respondent as his witnesses, but all of them professed lack of knowledge
about the incident as they were engrossed in answering the examination
questions.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span>, in the course
of the examination in Criminal Law, had possession of the piece of paper
containing notes on the durations of penalties and that he knew that it is
contrary to the rules to bring notes and books inside the examination
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It thus results that he knowingly
violated Section 10, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court, which pertinently provides
that "Persons taking the examination shall not bring papers, books or
notes into the examination rooms."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Amparo's</span> impression that the notes had
no "material use" to him is correct, in the sense that they bore no
reference to any question asked in the examination in Criminal Law; even so he
committed an overt act indicate of an attempt to cheat by reading the
notes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His refusal to surrender the
paper containing the notes when first demanded; his eventual surrender of it
only after he was informed that he would be reported; and the facts that the
notes pertained to Criminal Law and the examination was then in Criminal Law –
all these override and rebut his explanation that he merely read the notes to
find out what they were as he had forgotten about them.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the respondent <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> guilty of
(1) bringing notes into the examination room and (2) attempted cheating.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the official report of the Bar Confidant, approved
by the Court <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> did not pass the 1974 Bar
examinations.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Accordingly</span></b>,
it is the sense of the Court that Pedro A. <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span>
should be as he is hereby disqualified from taking the Bar examinations for the
year 1975.</p>
