<p class="BODY">Petitioner Federico Aguilar as Plaintiff in Civil Case No. Q-9812
of the respondent Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City obtained a money judgment from said court on September 10, 1966 against
private respondent Rene <span class="SpellE">Knecht</span> as defendant (herein­after
referred to simply as respondent) for the sum of P10,922.50, representing the
unpaid balance of a 17th Century Flemish tapes­try entitled "The Dream of
Solomon", with interests thereon at the rate of 12% per annum from
February, 1966, P1,000.00-attorney's fees and costs of suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment having become final, upon a writ
of execution issued by respondent court, real and personal pro­perties of
respondent consisting of three polo horses stabled at the Manila Polo Club were
levied upon and attached by the sheriff's office.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the <span class="SpellE">shceduled</span> sheriff's sale of
the attached polo horses, respondent paid petitioner the sum of P13,511.65 on
account of the total <span class="SpellE">jugment</span> debt which, including
lawful expenses of execution consisting of sheriff's fees, publication and
guards' expenses totaled P14,644.20 as of April 17, 1967, leaving an un­paid
balance of P1,132.55 computed as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent questioned the sheriff's fees and expenses and filed on
April 12, 195t 7 with respondent court a motion for the lifting of the
attachment levy on the three polo horses and a cer­tain real property of his
claiming that the expenses corresponding to the attachment of the real property
should be excluded from the costs of suit and that the amount of P360.00 as
guards' fees on the attachment of the horses should be reduced.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing of the motion on <st1:date year="1967" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1967</st1:date>, respondent court held a conference in
chambers and petitioner's counsel agreed to the lifting of the attachment on
respondent's properties should respondent pay on the same day the reduced sum
of P500.00 by way of a compromise settlement, but counsel for respondent did
not accept the proposal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two days later,
however, on April 17, 1967, respondent court issued its order relating what
transpired at the conference held by it in chambers and stating further
"that this morning the counsel for the (respondent) came to see this
Presiding Judge and manifested that the (respondent) has agreed to pay the said
sum of P500.00"; it therefore ordered that "let the attachment made
on the horses and real properties of the (respondent) . . . be lifted and
cancelled upon the (respondent's) payment to the (petitioner) of the sum of
P500.00, and this case is declared terminated."</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon learning of the order, petitioner immediately filed on April
19, 1967, a motion to set aside the same stating <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> that his counsel had agreed to accept the
reduced sum of P500.00 “upon earnest suggestion" of respondent court in a "spirit
of coop­eration only to finally terminate the case" On the very day the
motion was heard on April 15, 1967, but respondent's counsel had refused the
proposal, which was therefore withdrawn and no longer binding on petitioner;
that the court's order of April 17, 1967, reducing the balance due to
petitioner to P500.00 compromise and abridge (petitioner's) rights without
(petitioner's) consent to such compromise or abridgment;" and that the
balance of P1,132.55 was practically the total amount of expenses in the sum of
P1,130.55 which petitioner had <span class="SpellE">avanced</span> the sheriff in
connection with the attachment and levy for which he was entitled to
reimbursement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner further
represented to the court that the original writ of execution dated <st1:date year="1967" day="11" month="2">February 11, 1967</st1:date> had expired and
prayed the court for the issuance of a second writ of execution for the
satisfaction of the unpaid balance of his judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="10" month="5">May 10, 1967</st1:date>,
respondent court issued its order denying petitioner's motion on the ground
that the reduced amount of P500.00 as stated in its order of <st1:date year="1967" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1967</st1:date> had already been paid
and receipted by the Sheriff and that the levy on the personal properties of
respondent had already been lifted by the sheriff.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner thereupon filed the present verified petition to annul
said orders of respondent court and for the issuance of an order for the
enforcement of the balance of his judgment credit against respondent in the sum
of P1,132.55 as of <st1:date year="1967" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1967</st1:date>
with 12% interests and costs of suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's proposal to accept a reduced sum of P500.00 in satisfaction
of his judgment credit was strictly conditioned upon respondent's acceptance
thereof and payment of the amount on the day of the conference in respondent
court's chambers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent's
non-acceptance of the offer there­fore entitled petitioner to consider the same
withdrawn.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent court under such circumstances could not consider the
rejected offer of petitioner still binding when respondent's counsel <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> belatedly manifested to it two days later that
respondent had finally agreed to pay the said reduced sum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent's allegation in his unverified
answer that his counsel's refusal of petitioner's offer to accept the reduced
sum of P500.00 was be­cause "he could not be contacted at that' time"
and "it was only on the following morning that respondent was able to give
his consent to accept the offer"<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
cannot alter or modify the condition -­- which the petitioner had a perfect
right to impose -- that his offer be accepted then and there so as to terminate
the case once and for all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not having
chosen to accept petitioner's offer within the time limit given, respondent
cannot be permitted thereafter to impose his change of mind on petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The balance due on the judgment in the sum of P1,132.55 was fully
due from respondent to petitioner by virtue of a final judgment of respondent
court, as itemized above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already
indicated, the said sum was being collected by petitioner merely by way of
reimbursement of the advances Petitioner had made in practically the same
amount to the sheriff as lawful expenses of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As between petitioner, the prevailing party
who obtained a lawful judgment for a sum fully due him, and as against
respondent who due to his default in the payment of his obligation compelled
plain­tiff to go to court and to incur the expenses in question for enforce­ment
of the judgment, respondent is clearly liable for payment of the expenses of lawful
attachment and execution and should bear the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that respondent court issued its questioned
order of April 17, 1967 reducing the balance due on the judgment to P500.00,
not on any finding that the expenses claimed by peti­tioner were no lawfully
incurred or were unreasonable as claimed by respondent, but on the mistaken
notion that petitioner had unqualifiedly agreed to such reduction, when this
was but a limited proposal of petitioner valid only on the day of the hearing
of April 15, 1967 and had been rejected then by respondent as stated in the
order itself and was therefore no longer binding.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, was entitled to recover fully the sheriff's fees he
had paid for the attachment, since as held in the early case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Macondray</u></span><u> &amp; Co., Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
"(W)<span class="SpellE">ithin</span> the aforesaid definition (of process)
fall, in our opinion, all the proceedings for the execution of the order of
attachment, with respect to personal property, from the time the sheriff
attaches and takes possession of the attached properties by virtue of the order
of the court and conserves and places the same under his custody until the
attachment is lifted or the property is sold at a public auction upon a
judgment or order of the same court which issued the attachment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sheriff's or custodian's fees for his
services from and during the attachment are consequently a part of the costs,
and the plain­tiff is entitled to recover the same." The Court reaffirmed
this ruling in <u>Martin vs. Gomez</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
where we held that "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> it is undeniable that
the storage fees (of P1,840.50) constitute reason­able expenses necessarily
incurred in caring for the automobile that was levied on execution and held by
the Sheriff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The act of the Sheriff in
having under his custody the automobile in question is 'service of any process
in action' as construed by this Court in the <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span>
case, and for this 'service' he is entitled to be paid the fees provided by
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fees of the Sheriff in having
under his custody a property that is attached or levied on execution includes
reasonable expenses in caring for the property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent court therefore exceeded its authority in reduc­ing in
effect the balance due on the final judgment from respondent to petitioner by
declaring the case terminated upon respondent's payment of the lesser sum of
P500.00 and in denying petitioner's motion to set aside its order of April 17,
1967 and to issue a second writ of execution to satisfy the balance of
P1,132.55 with the stipulated interests still due on the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the jurisdiction of the trial court over
a given case after its judgment has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
lies in the enforcement of such judg­ment and to alter or modify it for the
purpose of avoiding its full enforcement against the judgment debtor is beyond
its jurisdiction and authority.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the writ of certiorari prayed for is hereby
granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent court's orders
