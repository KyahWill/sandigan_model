				<BR><STRONG>MAKALINTAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Respondent Anita U. <span class="SpellE">Lorenzana</span> was the
successful bidder in 1953 in the public sale of a <span class="SpellE">quonset</span>
hut situated on <span style="">a </span>lot on <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
  Boulevard</st1:address></st1:street>; <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
which was part of the San <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> Estate administered
by the Director of Lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be­fore the
sale she had a contract for the lease of the <span style="">site, </span>entered into with the Manila Railroad Company, which was
then in occupancy thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lease was
impliedly recognized by the Bureau of Lands, to which the rents were being
paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">quonset</span></span> hut was destroyed by accidental fire in 1958,
and <span class="SpellE">Lorenzana</span> thereupon filed a lease application
with the Bureau of Lands, which was approved in principle<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
for an area of 700 square meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
seems, however, that a question subsequently developed because a number of
former tenants of respondent <span class="SpellE">Lorenzana</span> also filed <span style="">a lease </span>applicat<span style="">ion for an area of 360 square meters of the
same property.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1959" day="25" month="8"><span style="">August
 25, 1959</span></st1:date><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Lorenzana</span> obtained a building permit from the City Engineer
of Manila for the construc­tion of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">three-storey
building on the aforesaid lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
construction was already well-advanced when the City En­gineer, upon repeated
representations of the Bureau of Lands, sent <span class="SpellE">Lorenzana</span>
a letter dated October 5, 1959, sus­pending the construction work, with a
threat to revoke the permit altogether if she refused to comply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of suspension triggered the
original proceeding in the Court of First Instance of Manila, which was a
petition filed by <span class="SpellE">Lorenzana</span> against the City Engineer
to enjoin him "from going through with his threatened act to revoke
petitioner's building permit or to suspend the force and effect of re­spondent's
letter of </span><span style="">suspension (sic)."<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">As prayed for in the petition a writ of
preliminary injunction was issued by the Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Director of Lands intervened and asked that the order granting the
writ be reconsidered and that the suspension order be maintained "until
the suit (be­tween the petitioner and the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>)
involving the rights of petitioner to lease and occupy portion of the San <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> Estate is finally decided by the Court of First
Instance of Manila in Civil Case No. 41295 pending in Branch 2 of this
Court."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After trial judgment was
rendered for petitioner <span class="SpellE">Lorenzana</span>, respondent here,
maintaining the injunction pre­viously issued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Director of Lands appealed, but the City Engineer did not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="1"><span style="">January 31, 1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> the Court of Appeals affirmed on four
grounds, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"(1) </span>The
judgment below making <span style="">permanent the
writ of preliminary in-, junction against respondent City En­gineer of Manila
has become final with respect to said respondent who, did not appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) The case has become moot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The construction of <span class="SpellE">Lorenzana's</span> three-story
building under the building permit has been finished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And accord­ing to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
after the perfection of this present appeal, the Director of Lands had already
openly agreed and acceded to petitioner's making an additional fourth <span style="">floor to her pre</span>sent
three-story building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the issue
in this appeal had al­ready been rendered moot and abrogated by the subsequent
acts of the x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>-appellant <span style="">Director
of Lands.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) <span class="SpellE">Lorenzana</span> was at least in material
possession with the per­mission of the Bureau of Lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conflict of rights between <span class="SpellE">Lorenzana</span> and the Bureau of lands with <span style="">respect </span>to
her alleged right to build and to the improvements, which conflict <span style="">is G</span><span style="">overned by stipulation and by the Civil Code,
should be threshed out in an ordinary civil action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was no concern of the City Engineer of
Manila who has already issued the building permit.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(4) Respondent City Engineer of Manila had earlier rendered <span style="">a </span>determination, which in our opinion
is correct, that, "it is the minis<span style="">terial
duty of the City Engineer to issue a building permit when the application and
the plans are in conformity with the requirements of building laws and
ordinances;" </span><span style="">that, </span><span style="">"As long as there is no violation of
building ordinances in the pro­cess of construction, this Office has no ground
for suspending the building permit issued," and that, "suspension or
revocation of per­mit without cause would be an ar­bitrary act and abuse of
discre­tion."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The case is now before us
on a petition for review by certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We see no sufficient reason to reverse the decision of the Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the suspension
of the building permit issued by the City En­gineer of Manila should be
insisted upon is a matter that is primarily addressed to the discretion of that
official.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And his failure to appeal
shows that he was agreeable to the maintenance of said permit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment of the trial court has become
final as to him, and the effect is </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">if
he himself had set aside the order of suspension.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">From petitioner's motion for intervention presented below it
appears that his interest was to have the said order maintained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, as he now avers in the instant petition
before us, he is opposed to the prosecution of the construction work on the
building of respondent, the Court <span style="">of
Appeals is </span><span style="">correct in holding
that the </span><span style="">case has become moot in
</span><span style="">view of its finding that the
construction of the three-storey building under the building permit has been
finished.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Whether or not the construction should be demolished, as prayed
for by petitioner, is a question that cannot and should not be litigated in
this case, which concerns only the building permit issued and then suspended by
the City Engineer, but rather, as correctly held by the Court of Appeals, in a
separate action where the right of respondent <span class="SpellE">Lorenzana</span>
to lease and occupy the lot on which the building stands may be threshed out.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The judgment appealed </span><span style="">from </span><span style="">is affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
