<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"BOTH MOTIONS DENIED." 
<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The chronology of the events 
leading to these two cases follows. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The MME on January 7, 1965 filed 
a petition for certification election with the CIR (case 1459-MC), alleging that 
it is a labor union organized among the employees of <span class="SpellE">Esso</span> Standard Eastern Inc. (ESSO) <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span> Terminal, Manila; that it represents the majority 
of the non-supervisory employees of the said terminal unit; that there exists a 
collective bargaining agreement between the CLU and the ESSO, of a duration of 3 
years and 3 months, from April 8, 1963 to July 8, 1966; and that its aim in 
asking for a certification election is merely to determine which union will 
administer the contract during the remainder of the term thereof. The CLU and 
the ESSO filed motions to dismiss the petition based on several grounds, most 
important of which is that the existing collective bargaining contract is a bar 
to the holding of a certification election. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After due hearing, the CIR, thru 
the Honorable Judge <span class="SpellE">Tabigne</span>, issued an order dated 
March 6, 1965, denying the motions to dismiss the petition for certification 
election, holding that the existing collective bargaining contract is no bar to 
a certification election, and requesting the Department of Labor to conduct the 
necessary election. The CLU and the ESSO filed with the CIR en banc separate 
motions for reconsideration, to which the MMB filed its opposition. Meanwhile, 
the Department of Labor scheduled the secret ballot election for March 22, 1965 
, from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. , with notice to the parties concerned. The CLU 
and the ESSO on March 18, 1965 filed with the CIR en banc separate motions to 
suspend the certification election as set, upon the basis of their respective 
motions for reconsideration then pending, ESSO on its part alleging that the 
certification election if held would render academic its said motion for 
reconsideration. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On March 19, 1965 the CLU filed 
with this Court a petition for certiorari and mandamus with preliminary 
injunction (L-24320) This was given due course and the parties respondents 
therein as required filed their respective answers, but no writ of preliminary 
injunction was issued to direct the CIR to suspend the certification election or 
to enjoin the Department of Labor from proceeding with its scheduled secret 
ballot election. The latter proceeded with the election and the result thereof 
shows that the MME obtained votes of more than one-half of the rank and file 
employees and laborers of the ESSO <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span> Terminal 
unit eligible to vote. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The CLU on March 23, 1965 filed 
with the CIR a motion to annul the certification election on several grounds, 
among which are that the election was held illegally and irregularly as it was 
conducted on a holiday, and that it was had without participation of the CLU 
therein. The ESSO on the following March 29 also filed with the CIR a similar 
motion to annul the certification election. The MME thereafter filed its 
opposition thereto. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The CIR en banc, by resolution of 
April 2, 1965 , denied the motions for reconsideration of the order of March 6, 
1965 . From this resolution, the CLU filed a notice of appeal. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The CIR on April 26, 1965 issued 
an order denying the motions for reconsideration seeking annulment of the 
certification election held on March 22, 1965 . In the same order, on the basis 
of the result of the secret ballot election, the CIR certified the MME as the 
sole and exclusive bargaining agent of all the non-supervisory employees of the 
ESSO at its <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span> Terminal unit. The CLU and the 
ESSO filed separate motions to have this last order reconsidered. These motions 
are pending resolution. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The CLU on May 9, 1965 filed with 
this Court an urgent petition praying for issuance of a writ of preliminary 
injunction to restrain the CIR from proceeding with the enforcement of its order 
of April 26, 1965, on the ground that the issues to be heard in L-24320 which 
was set for hearing on June 16, 1965 would become moot and academic if the said 
order were enforced. The CLU on the following May 12 moved to have hearing 
advanced to May 19, 1965 . This Court on May 14, 1965 issued the injunction 
prayed for, restraining the CIR from enforcing its order of April 26, 1965 , and 
also from proceeding or taking any other action in connection with the 
certification election case. This Court also advanced the hearing to May 26, 
1965 . <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The CLU on June 10, 1965 filed 
with this Court a petition for review of the order of March 6, 1965 and of the 
CIR resolution en banc of April 2, 1965 (L-24431. The MME moved to have the 
petition dismissed on the ground that this Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain 
it as the CLU failed to file with the CIR its notice of appeal from the order of 
March 6, 1965 and the CIR resolution en banc of April 2, 1965 within the 
prescribed <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period. We gave due course to 
the petition for review and resolved further to consider it together with G.R. 
No. L-24320 (Res. of July 14, 1965). <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Pending this Court's adjudication 
of the two cases, or more precisely on October 13, 1966, the MME filed with this 
Court a "Motion for Preliminary Injunction", alleging that the ESSO and the CLU 
had extended the term of the existing collective bargaining contract to December 
31, 1966; that pursuant to its salient provisions, the CLU and the ESSO at any 
time between October 31 and December 31, 1966 will commence negotiations for a 
new collective bargaining agreement and sign the same, unless a preliminary 
injunction is issued by this Court; that a new agreement will render moot and 
academic the order of the CIR certifying the MME as the sole and exclusive 
bargaining agent of all the employees of the ESSO at its <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span> Terminal unit, and may again be alleged as a bar to 
the holding of a new certification election. The motion was opposed by the CLU 
and the ESSO, both alleging in concert that since March 22, 1965 when the secret 
ballot election was held, there has occurred a substantial change in the 
composition of the rank and file of the employees and laborers at the ESSO <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span> Terminal unit, a good number of them having left 
their employment, retired, or been compulsorily laid off with the approval of 
the CIR, resulting in a change of employee composition in the unit; that the 
ESSO will negotiate and conclude a new collective bargaining contract with the 
union that commands the majority of the present labor force, either the CLU or 
the MME, as the case may be; and that if this Court issues the restraining 
order, it will suspend the process of a new collective bargaining agreement to 
the prejudice of the workers who would be denied the economic benefits thereof. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On November 3, 1966 , we issued 
in G.R. No. L-24320 an injunction commanding the CLU and the ESSO to refrain 
from negotiating and concluding a new collective bargaining agreement until 
after this Court shall have decided the case on the merits. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We will first dispose of the 
jurisdictional objection interposed by the MME in its brief: that this Court did 
not acquire Jurisdiction over the petition for review (L-24431) on the ground 
that the CLU failed to file its notice of appeal from the order of March 6, 1965 
and the CIR resolution en banc of April 2, 1965 within the prescribed <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period. We cannot sustain this view. By giving 
due course to the petition for review (see Res. of July 14, 1965 ), we 
necessarily denied the motion to dismiss the petition for review, and 
simultaneously regarded the petition for mandamus and certiorari with 
preliminary injunction (L-24320) as a petition for review. The CLU in that 
petition in fact prayed this Court that, should the "inaction of the Respondent 
Court en banc be interpreted as a denial of the said motion to Suspend Election 
and the Motion for Reconsideration," the petition be treated as one for review 
under Rule 43 of the Revised. Rules of Court, that judgment be rendered therein 
reversing the order of March 6, 1965 , and that the petition of the MME for 
certification election be dismissed. Our resolution is in line with the ruling 
in Cruz vs. Court of Industrial Relations, et al., G.R. No. L-18277, August 31, 
1963 . We there held that <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Although as heretofore stated, 
this is an action for mandamus, prohibition and certiorari, primarily to compel 
the respondent court to act on petitioner's motion for reconsideration of 
November 29, 1960, nevertheless, in view of the inaction of the court, 
notwithstanding the repeated petitions to pass upon the motions in question 
which could be interpreted as an insistence on or adherence to the judges’ 
respective previous rulings, and therefore, a denial of the motion for 
reconsideration, and considering that we have here already before us all the 
records of the case, it is believed that the interest of justice would be better 
<span class="SpellE">subserved</span> if the present petition should be treated as 
one for review.” <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We will now define the 
diametrically opposite positions taken by the two competing unions. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In seeking the reversal and 
setting aside of the order of the CIR of March 6, 1965 and the dismissal of the 
petition for certification election filed by the MME, the concerted grounds 
relied upon by the CLU and the ESSO are that the MME was not qualified to ask 
for certification election, not having observed the legal requisites <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>; that the petition for certification election was 
made to circumvent the results of the elections held in the ESSO <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span> Terminal unit on December 4, 1964 wherein the <span class="SpellE">MME’s</span> officers were defeated; that the certification 
election is being used as a justification for unethical, illegal and immoral 
union-raiding and union-grabbing which disturb industrial peace; that a 
certification election cannot be held pending the adjudication of the unfair 
labor practice actions filed against the CLU and the MME in connection with the 
strikes staged by the said unions (Case 3943 and Charge 442 before the CIR); and 
that the certification election is barred by the "Contract-Bar Policy". 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The MME, upon the other hand, 
urges the dismissal of these two cases before us and the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the orders in question, contending that the 
CIR committed no abuse of discretion in ordering a certification election, its 
judgment in certification proceedings being entitled to almost complete finality 
in the absence of patent abuse; that the CLU can no longer be considered as the 
representative of the rank and file of the employees and laborers of ESSO at its 
<span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span> Terminal unit, because it has lost its 
majority status inasmuch as the overwhelming majority of its members have given 
up their membership therein; that the MME was conclusively established to have 
obtained the majority status as a result of the secret ballot election held on 
March 22, 1965; that the "Contract-Bar Policy" relied upon by the CLU and the 
ESSO for the non-holding of a certification election can not be applied, because 
here the existing collective bargaining agreement is not one of reasonable 
duration as it has been in existence for more than 10 years, that is from 1953 
to 1964, and moreover that the MME in its petition for certification election 
expressly bound itself not to change, modify, or contest the contract during its 
unexpired term; and that the right of the workers to elect their bargaining 
agent to represent them is paramount and should not be curtailed or restricted 
in any manner unless absolutely necessary. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We thus confront the problem of 
determining which of the competing unions should be recognized as the 
"appropriate bargaining unit" of the rank and file of the employees and laborers 
of ESSO at its <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span> Terminal unit, pursuant to 
Section 12-(a) of the Industrial Peace Act. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We must observe at this juncture, 
however, that the passage of time has removed all meaning and validity from the 
positions taken by the two competing unions. Except for the motion for 
preliminary injunction filed by the MME recently, that is, on October 13, 1966 , 
all the pleadings extant in the record are dated and were filed prior to July 8, 
1966 , the date when the life of the collective bargaining agreement in question 
expired. All that the MME seeks is that it be declared the sole and collective 
bargaining agent to "administer the contract during its remaining term (see 
order of March 6, 1965), Upon the other hand, the opposition of the CLU and the 
ESSO is grounded mainly on the existence of the collective bargaining agreement 
which, they claim, is of a reasonable duration, and therefore precludes the 
holding of a certification election by virtue of the "Contract-Bar Policy", The 
collective bargaining agreement lapsed on July 8, 1966; the positions of the two 
labor unions have therefore become academic. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">All these notwithstanding, we 
still confront the very real and fundamental problem of which union should be 
recognized as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent of all the ESSO employees 
at the <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span> Terminal unit. The extension of the 
life of the collective bargaining agreement to December 31, 1966, while 
significant, is really of little moment, because after that date, the problem 
will still be there, as big as life, unless it is resolved before then. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This Court in numerous cases has 
reaffirmed its attitude that it is a sound and unassailable labor practice for 
labor and management to conclude a new contract before the expiry date of any 
collective bargaining agreement in order to avoid a hiatus in management-labor 
relations. The Industrial Peace Act was designed primarily to promote industrial 
peace through encouragement of collective bargaining. Any undue delay in the 
selection of a bargaining representative can hardly be said to contribute to 
that end. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The CLU claims that it is the 
sole and exclusive bargaining agent on the strength of its prior collective 
bargaining history (Democratic Labor Assn. vs. <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> 
Stevedoring, G.R. No. L-10321, Feb. 28, 1958); the MME claims that it is the one 
that should be recognized on the basis of the will of the employees (Democratic 
Labor Assn. vs. <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Stevedoring, supra) manifested in 
the secret ballot election held on March 22, 1965 in favor of the MME as their 
sole and exclusive bargaining agent, which collective will should not be brushed 
aside lightly. Like the CLU, the MME claims that its majority status should be 
presumed to continue up to the present time and for as long as the question has 
not been finally resolved (NLRB vs. International Furniture Co., 212 F.2d 431; 
The Celanese Corporation of America, 95 NLRB 664). <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Against the presumption of 
continued majority status, however, is the rule that such majority status does 
not continue forever "especially in face of an assertion and offer of proof to 
the contrary" (Steward Die Casting Corp. vs. National Labor Relations Board 
[1940; CCA 8th] 114 F. 2d, 849 (writ of certiorari denied in (941), 312 US 680, 
85 L ed 1119, 61 S Ct 449), or "in view of altered circumstances which have 
likely occurred in the interim" (Reliance Mfg. Co. vs. National Labor Relations 
Board [1941; CCA 8th] 125 F. 2d, 311), or "by a change in the conditions which 
demonstrates that a shift in sentiment actually exists among the employees, and 
is caused by other factors than the employer's refusal to bargain collectively" 
(National Labor Relations Board vs. P. Lorillard Co. [1941; CCA 6th], 117 F. 2d 
921). It would seem then that the burden of coming forward with proof of 
majority status is upon the union asserting it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Against the claim of the MME that 
it represents the will of the majority of the rank and file employees at the 
<span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span> Terminal unit, is the manifestation, advanced 
with vehemence, of both the CLU and the ESSO that after the secret ballot 
election held on March 22, 1965, the employee composition has substantially 
changed because a great number of the employees and laborers in the <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span> Terminal unit have left their employment, retired, 
or been compulsorily laid off with the approval of the CIR. On its part, ESSO 
further claims that the salient facts obtaining in the two cases before us have 
been so altered by the lapse of time and by developments shaped and brought 
about by the parties themselves, that "nothing will be gained if an altered 
factual situation is compelled to await a decision applicable to an entirely 
different set of facts." (see ESSO opposition to the motion for issuance of a 
writ of preliminary injunction, filed on October 20, 1966 ). 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The above conflicting assertions 
are not based on any evidence of record, but they are nevertheless assertions 
formally and solemnly made and therefore cannot be ignored. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">But precisely because the record 
is barren of evidence upon which this Court may properly reach a definitive 
determination as to which of the two unions should be upheld, at this time, as 
the sole and exclusive bargaining agent, this Court will not even begin to 
attempt to resolve the problem in favor of one or the other labor union. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">By express mandate of law, the 
CIR is empowered to investigate controversies concerning the matter of 
representation of labor in its dealings with management, and, depending upon the 
results of its investigation, thereafter to certify to the parties the name of 
the labor organization that, in proper proceedings, has been selected to act as 
the appropriate bargaining unit (sec. 12-(b), Industrial Peace Act). 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">UPON THE FOREGOING 
PREMISES</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
this Court is constrained to remand, as it hereby remands, this case to the 
Court of Industrial Relations, with instructions that it exert and exercise, 
without delay, the powers conferred upon it by law, and take such actions and 
issue such orders as the environmental circumstances will accordingly warrant.
