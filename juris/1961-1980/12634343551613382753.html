				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for review of the decision dated <st1:date year="1973" day="18" month="7">July 18, 1973</st1:date> of the Workmen's Compensation
Commission which reversed the award of the Regional Office No. VII, Workmen's
Compensation Unit, <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
granting petitioner disability compensation benefits under Sections 13 and 14
of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1972</st1:date>,
petitioner, a Deputy Provincial Sheriff of <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, filed with the Regional
Office, a claim for compensation by way of reimbursement of his medical and
hospitalization expenses after having undergone an operation of an ulcerated <span class="SpellE">newgrowth</span> at the middle third of jejunum, second portion of
the small intestine which resulted in his incapacity for work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The referee sent a copy of said claim to the
Department of Justice which was received by the latter on <st1:date year="1972" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The then Undersecretary of Justice <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Macaraig</span>, Jr. sent a Letter of <span class="SpellE">Controversion</span>
on September 8, 1972 to the Regional Office in Iloilo City opposing the claim
on the ground that there is no causal connection between the illness of
claimant and the nature of his employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1972" day="14" month="9">September 14, 1972</st1:date>,
the Solicitor General mailed to the Regional Office a second <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> dated <st1:date year="1972" day="13" month="9">September
 13, 1972</st1:date> together with copies of the Employer's Report of Accident
or Sickness <span class="SpellE">controverting</span> the claim on substantially
the same ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(p. 104, WCC, Original
Records).</p>

<p class="BODY">The referee, finding the Notice of <span class="SpellE">Controversion</span>
by the Solicitor General as out of time, treated the claim as non-<span class="SpellE">controverted</span> and rendered an award on October 17, 1972,
granting claimant a total amount of P3,261.41 representing disability
compensation benefits and reimbursement of expenses for medical services,
appliances and supplies, and ordering respondent employer to pay P33.00 as
administration fees pursuant to Section 55 of the Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General sent by registered mail
on November 10, 1972 a "Motion to Set Aside Decision" on the
following grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the claim
was duly <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> by respondent; (2) that the
decision (award) was not supported by substan­tial evidence; and (3) that
claimant was not entitled to reimbursement of medical expenses for failure to
comply with the penultimate paragraph of Section 13 of Act 3438, as
amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said motion was denied and the
records were elevated to the Workmen's Compensation Commission for review.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent commission on <st1:date year="1973" day="18" month="7">July 18, 1973</st1:date> reversed the award and absolved the Republic
from whatever liability under the aforementioned statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claimant moved for a reconsideration of
said decision but the motion was denied by the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the instant petition for review.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first issue raised is whether the claim was properly <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> or not, notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
by the Solicitor General having been admittedly filed beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, although the Undersecretary of Justice
sent a letter of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> within the said
statutory period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the ruling of
Republic vs. Hernando<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
it would seem that the Solicitor General is the proper official to file the <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>, he being the one called upon to "act
for and represent the Government, its officers and agents in any official
investigation, proceedings or matter requiring the services of a lawyer."
However, in <span class="SpellE">Lizardo</span> vs. Republic,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
it was said that the duty to controvert the claim for compensation devolves
upon the employer, or the heads of the departments, bureaus and offices
concerned, not their counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whether ruling in the earlier case of Republic vs. Hernando has
been superseded by the recent case of <span class="SpellE">Lizardo</span> vs.
Republic, on the question of who can effectively controvert a claim for
compensation, as between the employer or the counsel, is a question We need not
now pass upon squarely, it appearing that the present petition is of sufficient
merit on the basis of the presumption of compensability which has not been
rebutted.</p>

<p class="BODY">In reversing the referee's award, the Commission ruled that
contrary to petitioner's belief, his ailment is not peptic ulcer but some kind
of a new growth of the small intestine and that his case does not fall within
the pro­tective mantle of the Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was stressed that there is yet no clear medical proof of petitioner's ailment
so much so that whether he worked or not, the new growth would have progressed,
and that the theory of presumption cannot apply in this case, considering that
the nature of work of petitioner as Deputy Sheriff cannot even remotely
contribute to the causation and/or aggravation of a new growth inside the
abdominal cavity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See Decision, p. 29, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 44
of the Act expressly provides that in the absence of substantial evidence to
the contrary, it is presumed that the claim comes within the provisions of this
Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is established in a long line of
cases, that an employee is freed from the burden of proving that his ailment
was caused or aggravated by the nature of his work, as long as death or illness
supervened in the course of employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is not, therefore, necessary for the Court to inquire into the exact
cause of petitioner's ailment, for what is important is that said ailment
occurred or was aggravated in the course of employment.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, Justice <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span> speaking for the Court,
stated, "that it has applied with pedantic rigor the aforesaid legal
presumption of compensability even in the absence of a definite finding or knowledge
of the precise medical cause of claimant's illness as long as the illness
and/or death supervened in the course of employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For precisely, the vital function of legal
presumption is to dispense with the need for proof."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Failing as it did to overturn this legal presumption of
compensability by adducing clear and convincing evidence that petitioner's
ailment was not attributable to the nature of his employment, respondent
employer may not be absolved from its liability to pay the compensation sought
by the petitioner.</p>
