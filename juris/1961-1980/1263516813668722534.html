				G.R. No. L-26868, February 27, 1969</h4>
				<H3>PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS.
REMIGIO ESTEBIA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

IN THE MATTER OF ATTORNEY LOPE E. ADRIANO, MEMBER OF THE PHILIPPINE BAR.
<br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>SANCHEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Once again, this Court is confronted with the unwanted task of
ascertaining whether certain acts and conduct of a member of the Bar deserve
disciplinary action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The problem arose because of facts that follow:</p>

<p class="BODY">One Remigio Estebia <span style="">was </span>convicted
of rape by the Court of First Instance of Samar,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and sentenced to suffer the capital punishment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His case came up before this Court on review.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 14, 1966, Lope E. Adriano, a member of the Bar, was
appointed by this Court as Estebia's counsel <u>de</u> <u>oficio</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the notice of his appointment, Adriano was
required to prepare and file his brief within thirty days from notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was advised that to enable him to examine
the case, the record would be at his disposal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Adriano received this notice on December 20, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <span style="">January
19, 1967, Adriano sought for a 30-day extension to file appellant's brief in
mimeographed form.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 18,
Adriano again moved for a 20-day extension (his second).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was followed by a third filed on March
8, for fifteen days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And a fourth on
March 27, also for fifteen days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
moved for a "last" extension of ten days on April 11.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On April 21, he even sought a special
extension of five days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these
motions for extension were granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
brief was due on April 26, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But no
brief was filed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On September 25, 1967,
Adriano was ordered to show cause within ten days from notice thereof </span>why
<span style="">disciplinary action should not be taken
against him for failure to file appellant's brief despite the lapse of the time
therefor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Adriano did not bother to give
any explanation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For failing to comply with the September 25, 1967 resolution,
this Court, on October 3, 1968, resolved to impose upon him a fine of P500
payable to this Court within fifteen days from notice with a warning that upon further
non-compliance with the said resolution of September 25, 1967 within the same
period of fifteen days, "more drastic disciplinary action will be taken
against him." Still, counsel paid no heed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, on December 5, 1968, this Court ordered Adriano to show
cause within ten days from notice thereof why he should not be suspended from
the practice of law "for gross misconduct and violation of his oath of
office as attorney." By express order of this Court, the resolution was
personally served upon him on December 18, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He ignored the resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the facts just
narrated, we now </span>pass <span style="">judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By specific authority,
this Court may assign an attorney to render professional aid to a destitute
appellant in a criminal case who is unable to employ an attorney.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Correspondingly, a duty is imposed upon the
lawyer so assigned "to render the required service."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
A lawyer so appointed "as counsel for an indigent prisoner," our
Canons of Professional Ethics demand, "should always exert his best
efforts" in the indigent's behalf.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">No excuse at all has been offered for non-presentation of
appellant's brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, between
December 20, 1966, when he received notice of his appointment, and December 5,
1968, when the last show-cause order was issued by this Court, more than <span style="">sufficient time was afforded counsel to
prepare and file his brief <u>de</u> <u>oficio</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The death sentence below imposed was upon a
plea of guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record of the
proceedings leading to the lower court's sentence consists of but 31 pages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel had the record since January 19,
1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, in his third motion for
extension of time, he manifested that the drafting of appellant's brief
"is more than half-way through" and that "additional time is
needed to review, effectuate the necessary corrections, put in final form and
print the said brief." In his motion for fourth extension, he intimated
that the preparation of the brief "is almost through" and that
"additional time </span>is <span style="">needed
to redraft and rehash some significant portions of said brief and have the same
stencilled and mimeographed upon completion of a definitive text." His
motion for last (fifth) extension of time came with the excuse that he
"suddenly got sick (influenza) in the course of redrafting and rehashing
some significant portions of said brief, which ailment hampered and interrupted
his work thereon for sometime." Finally, in his "Special Extension of
Time" to file brief, he claimed that he needed only five days from April
21, 1967 to put said brief in final form and have the same stencilled and
mimeographed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the face of the fact that no brief has ever been filed,
counsel's statements in his motions for extension have gone down to the level
of empty and meaningless words; at best, have dubious claim to veracity.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that he is a court-appointed counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we do say that as such counsel <u>de</u> <u>oficio</u>,
he has as high a duty to the accused as one employed and paid by defendant
himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, as in the case of the
latter, he must exercise his best efforts and professional ability in behalf of
the person assigned to his care.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His is
to render effective assistance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused defendant expects of him due diligence, not mere perfunctory representation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not accept the paradox that
responsibility is less where the defended party is poor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been said that courts should
"have no hesitancy in demanding high standards of duty of attorneys
appointed to defend indigent persons charged with crime."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
For, indeed, a lawyer who is a vanguard in the bastion of justice is expected
to have a bigger dose of social conscience and a little less of
self-interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of this, a lawyer
should remain ever conscious of his duties to the indigent he defends.</p>

<p class="BODY">Worth remembering is the 1905 case of <u>In</u> <u>the</u> <u>matter</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Jose</u> <u>Robles</u> <u>Lahesa</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>He was counsel <u>de</u> <u>oficio</u>
before the Supreme Court in two cases: one for <u>robo</u> <u>en</u> <u>cuadrilla</u>
and the other for homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He failed to
take any action in behalf of the defendants in <span style="">both cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court imposed
upon him a fine of P200.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Signifi­cant is
the pronouncement we there made that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"This court should exact from its officers and subordinates the
most scrupulous per­formance of their official duties, especially when
negligence in the performance of those duties necessarily results in delays in the
prosecution of criminal cases and the detention of accused </span>persons
pending appeal." The validity of the foregoing observation remains to the
present day.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
It applies to the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Here, appellant was without brief since December 20, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The effect of this long delay need not be
essayed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We, therefore, find that
Attorney Lope <span style="">E. </span>Adriano has
violated his oath that he will conduct himself as a lawyer according to the
best of his "know­ledge and discretion".</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An attorney's duty of
prime importance is "[t]o observe and maintain the respect due to the
courts of justice and judicial officers."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The first Canon of the Code of Ethics enjoins a lawyer "to maintain
towards the Courts a respectful attitude, not for the sake of the temporary
incumbent of the judicial office, but for the maintenance of its supreme
importance." By his oath of office, the lawyer undertook to "obey the
laws as well as the legal orders of the duly constituted authorities." In <u><span style="">People</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>vs</u>. <u><span style="">Carillo</span></u><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>this Court's pointed observation was
that as an officer of the court, it is a lawyer's "sworn and moral duty to
help build and not destroy unnecessarily that high esteem and regard towards
the courts so essential to the proper administration of justice."</p>

<p class="BODY">Here, we have a clear case of an attorney whose acts exhibit
willful disobedience of lawful orders of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A cause sufficient is thus present for
suspension or disbarment.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Counsel has received no less than three resolutions of this Court requiring com­pliance
of its orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be recalled is that on
September 25, 1967, this Court directed him, in ten days from notice, to show
cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against him for his failure
to file appellant's brief despite the lapse of the time therefor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing was done by counsel for over a
year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To impress upon counsel the
gravity of his repeated failure to obey this Court's orders, on October 3,
1968, a fine of P500 was clamped upon him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was directed to pay that fine in ten days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was in that order also required to file
his brief in fifteen days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was warned
that more drastic discip­linary action would be taken upon his failure to do
either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still he <span style="">remained unmoved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, this
Court issued the peremptory order of December 5, 1968 commanding him to show
cause within ten days from notice thereof why he should not be suspended from
the practice of law for gross misconduct and violation of his oath of
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court made it certain that
this order would reach him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He personally
acknowledged receipt thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has not
paid the fine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has done nothing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This is 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No brief has
as yet been filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, inspite of
the fact that as early as March 27, 1967, when <span style="">he </span>moved for a fourth extension of time to file his brief <u>de</u>
<u>oficio</u>, he repre­sented to this Court that all that was needed was to
redraft and to rehash some significant portions of the brief which was almost
through and to have the same stencilled and mimeographed upon completion of a
definitive text.</p>

<p class="BODY">Disrespect is here present.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Contumacy is as patent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dis­ciplinary
action is in order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Controlling here is the 1961 decision <u>In</u> <u>the</u> <u>Matter</u>
<u>of</u> <u><span style="">Atty.</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>Filoteo</u> <u><span style="">Dianala</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>Jo</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
There, as here, counsel failed to file appellant's brief (in a criminal case)
despite extensions of time granted him by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, this Court issued a show-cause
order why disciplinary action should not be taken against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The explanation was considered
unsatisfactory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court imposed a
fine of P50 payable in ten days from notice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Attorney Dianala Jo did not pay that fine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Came the subsequent resolution of this Court
advising him to pay the fine, otherwise, he would be arrested and confined to
jail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This warning was not heeded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 18, 1960, the Court resolved to
give him ten days from notice within which to explain why he should not be
suspended from the practice of law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Despite receipt of this notice, he did not care to explain his behaviour
which this Court considered as "contumacy and unwillingness to comply with
the lawful orders of this Court of which he is an officer or to conduct himself
as a lawyer should, in violation of his oath of office." He was suspended
from the practice of law for three months.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, counsel's pattern of conduct, it would seem
to us, reveals a propensity on the part of counsel to benumb appreciation of
his obligation as counsel <u>de</u> <u>oficio</u> and of the courtesy and
respect that should be accorded this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>For the reasons given</b>, we vote to suspend Attorney Lope E.
Adriano from the practice of law throughout the Philippines for a period of one
(1) year.</p>

<p class="BODY">Let a copy of this resolution be attached to the personal record,
in this Court, of Lope E. Adriano as member of the Bar.</p>
