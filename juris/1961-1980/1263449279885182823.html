				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., Acting C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On 12 May 1960, the Court of First Instance of Manila, in <span class="GramE">its</span> Civil Case No. 38451, granted the petition for
naturalization of the above-named appellant, <span class="SpellE">Ao</span>
San.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on motion of the Solicitor
General, the court, on 11 January 1963, issued an order, the <span class="SpellE">dis­positive</span> portion of which is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing, the decision is hereby set aside,
and the petition to allow the petitioner to take his oath as citizen of the
Philippines is here­by DENIED and the petition DISMISSED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in view of the fact that the
evidence does not show that the petitioner suffers from any disqualification
and on the other hand, the deficiency in the peti­tion and in the evidence may
be remedied, the DISMISSAL is hereby declared to be WITHOUT PREJUDICE."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The present case is an appeal from the foregoing order.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The original decision
granting the appellant's petition for naturalization was promulgated on 16 May
1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a period of two (2) years,
appellant filed a petition alleging compliance with the requirements of
Republic Act 530 and praying that after hear­ing, he <span class="GramE">be</span>
admitted to Philippine citizenship upon taking the oath of allegiance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before this petition could be heard, however,
the Solicitor General filed a motion to vacate the decision and opposition to
oath-taking, alleging defects in the amended petition for naturalization, lack
of jurisdiction of the trial court, lack of qualification of the applicant to
become a citizen of the Phil­ippines and unreliability of the vouching
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting there­upon, the court
issued the appealed order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The assigned error that
the lower court erred in setting aside the decision because it had become <span class="GramE">final,</span> is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The established doctrine in naturalization proceedings is that the deci­sion
rendered therein does not become final until after the issuance of the
naturalization certificate and compliance with Republic Act No. 530 (<span class="SpellE">Pe</span> vs. Republic, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-20375, </span></span><st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="1"><span class="GramE"><span style="">31 Jan. 1966</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="">; <span class="SpellE">Gan</span> <span class="SpellE">Tsitung</span> vs. Republic, G.R. No.</span></span><span style=""> L-20819, </span><st1:date year="1967" day="21" month="2"><span style="">21 Feb. 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Until then, the only vested right is that of the Republic to see to it
that only applicants fully qualified should be admitted to membership in the
body politic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his petition,
appellant gave his address as 1001 Interior 9, Felipe II, <span class="SpellE">Binondo</span>,
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, but according to his alien certificate of
residence, he resides at 742 Alvarado and in his immigrant certificate of
residence, at 546 <span class="SpellE">Azcarraga</span>, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
latter two were not mentioned in his petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This failure is fatal to the petition and Affects the jurisdiction of
the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Keng</span> <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> vs. Republic, G.R. No.</span>

No. L-20910, </span><st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="11"><span style="">27 Nov.
 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This defect in petitioner's application is
all the more serious on account of his not having filed a notice of intention
to apply for citizenship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his petition for
naturalization, dated </span><st1:date year="1958" day="19" month="6"><span style="">19 June 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, the appellant stated that he had five (5)
children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He amended this petition on </span><st1:date year="1958" day="15" month="12"><span style="">15
 December 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">
stating he had eight (8) children, but has given no explanation for this
startling difference.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This applicant's supposed
children are Vicente, <span class="SpellE">Alejandra</span>, Gloria, Elisa, Mary,
<span class="SpellE">Edita</span>, William and Henry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They bear different surnames, either "<span class="SpellE">Ao</span>" or "San".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some of them have "<span class="SpellE">Ang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Yie</span>" as their mother; the others, "<span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Yee".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
use names in school entirely different from their registered names; thus,
Alejan­dro <span class="SpellE">Ao</span> is known in school as "<span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Lian</span> <span class="SpellE">Hui</span>";
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Ao</span> uses "<span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Lian</span> Hong"; Mary <span class="SpellE">Ao</span> as
"Mary <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>"; Gloria <span class="SpellE">Ao</span>
as "<span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Siok</span> Be";
and <span class="SpellE">Edita</span> <span class="SpellE">Ao</span>, as
"Elisa <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The birth certificates of Vicente and Gloria show that they were born on
</span><st1:date year="1938" day="3" month="1"><span style="">3 January 1938</span></st1:date><span style="">
and </span><st1:date year="1937" day="9" month="7"><span style="">9 July 1937</span></st1:date><span style="">,
respectively.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The foregoing
circumstances throw a grave doubt that these are all the petitioner's
children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parenthetically, they make out
an attempt, reflective of a reproachable character, to turn all these children
into Filipino citizens, should the petition be suc­cessful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a poor excuse that the petitioner
simply made a mistake in his original petition when he stated that he had five
(5) children, instead of eight (8).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Add
this to the confusion of given names and surnames, registered names and school
names.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The interval of the dates of birth
between Vicente and <span class="GramE">Gloria,</span> is five (5) months and
twenty-five (25) days only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While a <span class="SpellE">utero­gestation</span> period like this is possible, it is so rare
an oddity (Herzog, Medical Jurisprudence, Sec. 973-975) that the doubt becomes
graver still that all these children are those of the peti­tioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In itself, this aspect of petitioner's case
betrays lack of good moral character.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The dismissal of the
petition as "without prejudice" by the lower court because it found
that petitioner not suffering from any disqualification, is not justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of welcoming the oppor­tunity to submit
frank and credible explanation for the discrepan­cies pointed out by the
Government counsel, as applicant should have done, had he the true interest of
the country at heart, applicant has sought refuge in technicalities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The preceding discussion
makes it unnecessary to discuss the other objections raised by the Government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">For the foregoing reasons</b><span style="">, the appealed order is hereby affirmed, with
the modification that the dismissal shall be with prejudice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against appellant <span class="SpellE">Ao</span> San.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
