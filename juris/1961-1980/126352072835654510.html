<p class="BODY">The appealed decision states the case and the facts to be as

<blockquote>"On July 1, 1920, Mateo <span class="SpellE">Balicudiong</span>,
while his wife <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Alcoba</span>
was still living, bought from the Bureau of Lands through its Friar Lands
Agency at <span class="SpellE">Imus</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, Lot
No. 5547 of the <span class="SpellE">Imus</span> Friar Lands Estate on
installment basis for the sum of P433.00 plus interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Sale</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"> Certificate No. 6612 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> 'E')

which certificate states that the sale is effective from <st1:date year="1920" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1920</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As stated above, <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Alcoba</span>
died on September 23, 1923, but Mateo <span class="SpellE">Balicudiong</span>
continued paying the installment price of the lot in question until the
purchase price together with the interest was fully paid on June 1, 1931, as
shown by the Installment <span style="">Record
Certificate No. 6612 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'F').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1931" day="4" month="6"><span style="">June 4, 1931</span></st1:date><span style="">, Mateo <span class="SpellE">Balicudiong</span>
executed a deed of assignment of Sale Certificate No. 6612 in favor of his son,
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Balicudiong</span> in consideration of the sum of
P300.00, which was duly acknowledged before Notary Public Isidro <span class="SpellE">Fojas</span> in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> and approved by the Director of Lands."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It was also undisputed that "when
Mateo <span class="SpellE">Balicudiong</span> purchased the lot in question, his
wife <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Alcoba</span> was
still living, while the spouses were enjoying the use of the conjugal
funds" and "there is no proof that the lot in question was acquired with
the exclusive money of one of the spouses only<span class="GramE">, .</span>………",
for which reason the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> held that the lot is conjugal
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the court also found that
the deed of assignment in favor of the son, Antonio, is valid, for it was duly
acknowledged before a notary public and the assignor Mateo <span class="SpellE">Balicudiong</span>
was not then senile, since he was only 61 years old and not mentally sick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> rejected the
infirmities of the transaction averred by plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>,
such as its having been entered into between father and son, and the
consideration being only P300.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
court found no evidence that Mateo possessed the lot from the time he acquired
it until his death in 1945 but found contrary proof that as early as 1927 or
1928 assignee Antonio <span class="SpellE">Balicudiong</span> was already in
possession and that "it was under his administration that the lot was
converted from pasture land into agricultural land and that <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Parales</span> was the one working for him".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It held that even though Mateo was not the
absolute owner of the whole lot, being <span class="GramE">conjugal</span>, his
possession was in good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> thus rendered judgment, as stated at the beginning of this de­cision,
that the assignment by Mateo to Antonio was valid only as to one-half (1/2) of
the property.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant heirs of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Balicudiong</span>
(Mateo's assignee) assign as errors the lower court's declaration of nullity of
the deed of assignment with respect to a half-portion of the lot, its ordering
the partition of half of the lot among the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alcoba</span> and its refusal to dismiss the complaint
notwithstanding prescription in favor of Antonio.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants first urge that the lot is the exclusive property
of <span style="">Mateo, </span>and not in community
with his wife <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span>, because his right to
purchase the lot, based upon entry and occupation under the Friar Lands Act,
Act No. 1120, is a personal one; and that such right descended to him through
succession from his ancestors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
immemorial occupation of the lot of Mateo <span class="SpellE">Balicudiong's</span>
ancestors is claimed to be within judicial notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument is without basis; there is nothing <span style="">in </span>the record establishing Mateo's
alleged <span class="SpellE">successional</span> rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, such alleged <span class="SpellE">successional</span>
rights to purchase by reason of occupation from time im­memorial contravenes
the historical fact that friar lands were bought by the Government of the
Philippine Islands, pursuant to an Act of Congress of the United States,
approved on 1 July 1902, not from individual persons but from certain
companies, a society and a religious order; and that under the Friar Lands Act,
only "actual settlers and occupants at the time said lands are acquired by
the Government" were given preference to lease, purchase, or acquire their
holdings, in disregard of the settlement and occupation of persons <u>before</u>
the government acquired the lands.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
And since Mateo admittedly bought the land from the Government, he would be <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from claiming that his rights were derived from
his ancestors, and his successors in interest are likewise in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the defendants-appellants, the right of a deceased
holder of a certificate, under Section 16 of Act 1120, as amended, is inherited
by his or her surviving spouse, and, in the event that said holder does not
leave a surviving spouse, such rights descend to his or her children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is claimed that the right of a surviving
spouse excludes that of the children and that the children would have had the
right to inherit the lot had <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span> died without a
surviving spouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants are in
error in this respect.</p>

<p class="BODY">When on <st1:date year="1920" day="1" month="7">1 July 1920</st1:date>
Mateo <span class="SpellE">Balicudiong</span> bought the lot from the Government,
he acquired the beneficial and equitable title thereto even before completion
of payment of the purchase price, with the bare and naked title remaining in
the Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reservation of title
in the Government, pursuant to Section 15 of the Act, is merely for its own
protection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it has been held that
an accretion to a lot before payment of the last installment of the purchase
price belongs to the purchaser, not to the government, because the moment the
purchaser paid the first installment and was given a certificate of sale, the
bene­ficial and equitable title went to the purchaser.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
To the same effect is Alvarez vs. <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
where it was reiterated that ownership is vested upon issuance of the sale
certificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since, in the present case,
the sale certificate was issued on <st1:date year="1920" day="1" month="7">1
 July 1920</st1:date>, the beneficial and equitable title to the lot passed to
Mateo <span class="SpellE">Balicudiong</span> as of that moment, even if the
purchase price had not then yet been paid in full; and, since said title was
acquired during <span class="SpellE">coverture</span>, it is <span class="GramE">conjugal</span>
in nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presumption, under the
civil law, being that all property acquired by onerous title during the
marriage is conjugal,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
a pre­sumption that here stands <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants argue that upon the death of <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alcoba</span> in 1923 the transmission of her inchoate share
in the beneficial and equitable title to the lot is not <u>directly</u>
governed by the Civil Code but by the Friar Lands Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They invoke <span class="SpellE">Arayata</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Joya</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
where it was held:</p>

<blockquote>"The provisions of the Civil Code referring to conjugal
property cannot be applied in this case, as was done by the trial court,
because the law re­gulating the acquisition, disposition and transmission of
rights to the friar lands acquired by the Insular Gov­ernment, lays down rules
in conflict with the aforesaid provisions of the Civil Code; and as the said
Code is <span style="">of a general character, while
Act No. 1120 is a special law, the latter should prevail."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">They now seek to have applied in their favor the special rule of
succession with respect to friar lands, as provided for in Section 16 of Act
1120, enacted in 1904, to wit:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 16.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the event of the death of a holder of a
certificate the issuance of which is provided for in section twelve hereof,
prior to the execution of a deed by the Government to any purchaser, his widow
shall be entitled to receive a deed of the land stated in the certificate upon
showing that she has complied with the require­ments of law for the purchase of
the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case a holder of a
certificate dies before the giving of the deed and does not leave a widow, then
the interest of the holder of the certificate shall descend and deed shall
issue to the persons who under the laws of the Philippine Islands would have
taken had the title been perfected before the death of the holder of the
certificate, upon proof of the holders thus entitled of compliance with all the
requirements of the certificate. . . . . . . ."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Unfortunately for the appellants, Section 16 of Act 1120, copied
above, was amended when Act 2945 took effect upon its approval on <st1:date year="1921" day="16" month="2">16 February 1921</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As amended by Act 2945, said Section 16 of Act 1120 provides as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In the event of death of a holder of a certificate the
issuance of which is provided for in section twelve hereof, prior to the
execution of a deed by the Government to any purchaser, the in­terest of the
holder of the certificate <u>shall descend</u> and deed shall issue <u>to the
persons who under the laws of the Philippine Islands would have taken had the
title been perfected before the death of the holder</u> of the certificate,
upon proof of compliance with all the requirements of the certificate. . . . .
."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A check of all laws passed since <st1:date year="1921" day="16" month="2">16 February 1921</st1:date> until <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alcoba's</span> death on <st1:date year="1923" day="23" month="9">23 September 1923</st1:date> does not show a further amendment to the
amendment introduced by Act 2945; the foregoing amendment was, therefore, the
governing law at the time of <span class="SpellE">Anastacia's</span> death.</p>

<p class="BODY">Comparing the first part of the original Section 16 and its
amendment, it is seen that while under the original provision the interest of a
deceased certificate holder passed to his widow (or widower), it is not so
under the amendment, which provides that his interest shall descend "to
the persons who under the laws of the Philippine Islands would have taken had
title been perfected before the death of the holder of the certificate, . . ."
and these persons are no other than his or her heirs under the Civil Code of
1889.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Article 657 of the said
Code, the children of <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span>, namely, Isabel,
Antonio, <span class="SpellE">Cirila</span> and <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span>,
inherited their mother's inchoate share in the lot, while Mateo, the surviving
spouse, inherited, under Article 834, only a <span class="SpellE">usufructuary</span>
right for life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cases of Alvarez, et
al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
relied upon by the trial court, Lorenzo vs. Nicolas,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
and <span class="SpellE">Pugeda</span> vs. Tries<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
are not applicable in the present case insofar as the descent of the share of a
deceased wife in a sale certificate is concerned, because these cases were not
decided on the issue of the applicability of the amendment injected in Act 1120
by Act 2945.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon receiving the title deed to the land in controversy, Mateo
assigned not the one-half but the whole of the lot to his son, Antonio, on <st1:date year="1931" day="4" month="6">4 June 1931</st1:date>, for the sum of
P300.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assignment as to the share
pertaining to his deceased wife is void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">initio</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
the alienation having been made after <st1:date year="1924" day="24" month="11">24
 November 1924</st1:date>, when Act 3176 took effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Previous to this date, a surviving husband
could encumber or alienate the half belonging to the other spouse,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
as statutory liquidator of the conjugal partnership; but after Act 3176, such
surviving spouse could no longer do so.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
As Mateo assigned the half-share of his wife after 24 November 1924, then to
the extent of his predeceased wife's interest the assignment is void, except as
to Antonio's own share in her estate (1/4 of her half in­terest in the entire
lot), he being one of her four children.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That Mateo, after the death of his wife, continued paying the installments
did not affect the conjugal nature of the property for, pursuant to the law in
effect at the time of death of <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span> in 1923
(i.e., before the amendment of Act 190 by Act 3176), it became Mateo's duty to
pay said installments because he was then the liquidator of the conjugal
partnership properties, independently of his wife's administrator or executor,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
and the obligation to pay the remaining installments was an obligation of the
partnership, having been contracted during the marriage.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But with regard to the share of the other heirs of <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Alcoba</span> (Isabel, <span class="SpellE">Cirila</span> and <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span>), <span class="GramE">We</span> find that appellants’ claim of acquisition thereof
through prescription in favor of their father Antonio <span class="SpellE">Balicudiong</span>
is meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deed of assignment
of the disputed lot was executed by Mateo <span class="SpellE">Balicudiong</span>
in favor of Antonio on 4 June 1931; the deed of convey­ance by the Director of
Lands was registered in the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>
on 28 September 1931 and, on the same date, a certificate of title to the property
was issued in the name of Antonio.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Antonio has been in possession of the lot since 1927 or 1928, as found
by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alcoba</span> died on <st1:date year="1923" day="23" month="9">23 September 1923</st1:date>, yet plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
filed their complaint only on <st1:date year="1952" day="6" month="12">6
 December 1952</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the
court <u>a quo</u> found that the assignment was real and not fictitious, and
Antonio's certificate of title was issued to him on 28 September 1931,
plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' action to set the transfer
aside is now barred by prescription, since the ten-year period within which the
same could have been filed started to run from the date of issuance of the
certificate of title.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
From 1931 to 1952 is an interval of twenty-one years.</p>

<p class="BODY">The net result is that Antonio acquired his father's half of Lot
5547 by purchase, while the shares of his sisters and brother in the other half
that formed part of their mother's estate became also his by prescription, and
upon his (Antonio's) death, passed to his own heirs, appellants herein.</p>
