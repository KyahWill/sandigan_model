				<BR><STRONG>MAKALINTAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This is an appeal by plaintiffs from the order of the Court of First Instance 
of Pampanga in its civil case No. 1853, dismissing their complaint for damages 
upon motion to dismiss filed by defendants. </p>
<p>The complaint recites: that defendant Abelardo G. Tinio was the owner of a 
cargo truck with trailer which, on February 14, 1960, while being driven by 
defendant Estanislao Luat in A pal it, Pampanga, hit a horse-drawn rig 
(carretela) owned and driven by plaintiff Nicolas Lorenzo, the other plaintiffs 
being then his passengers: that the accident was caused by the negligence of 
truck driver Luat; that as a result the horse was killed, the rig totally 
wrecked and all of the plaintiffs sustained injuries; and that demands made upon 
defendants for the payment of damages were refused. </p>
<p>It appears that a criminal case for damage to property with serious physical 
injuries through reckless imprudence was filed against Estanislao Luat in the 
Court of First Instance of Pampanga. Herein plaintiffs, as the offended parties 
in that case, were represented by counsel, who entered their appearance as 
private prosecutors. Upon arraignment the accused entered a plea of guilty and 
was accordingly sentenced to suffer a term of imprisonment and to pay a fine. 
The Court, however, made no pronouncement on the matter of pecuniary damages 
suffered by plaintiffs. Indeed no claim therefor was put forward; nor was a 
reservation made of the right to institute a separate civil action. The decision 
became final, the accused having started to serve his sentence immediately.</p>
<p>The civil action was filed thereafter against both the driver and the owner 
of the truck, obviously on the theory of quasi-delict and specifically on the 
basis of Article 33 of the Civil Code, which states that in cases of defamation, 
fraud and physical injuries, a civil action for damages, entirely separate and 
distinct from the criminal action may be brought by the injured party, and the 
same shall proceed independently of the criminal prosecution and shall require 
on1y a preponderance of evidence. </p>
<p>Defendant's motion to dismiss was predicated and upheld on the ground that 
the action was barred by the judgment in the criminal case, on the authority of 
our decision in Maria C. Roa <i>vs.</i> Segundina de la Cruz, et al, 107 Phil., 
8, promulgated February 13, 1960. In that case we said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the instant case, it is not disputed that plaintiff Maria C. Roa — upon 
whose initiative the criminal action for defamation against the defendant 
Segunda dela Cruz was filed did not reserve her right to institute an 
independent civil action. Instead, she chose to intervene in the criminal 
proceedings as private prosecutor through counsel employed by her. Such 
intervention, as observed by the court below, could only be for the purpose of 
claiming damages or indemnity, and not to secure the conviction and punishment 
of the accused therein as plaintiff now pretends. This must be so because an 
offended party in a criminal case may intervene personally or by attorney, in 
the prosecution of the offense, only if he has not waived the civil action or 
expressly reserved his right to institute it, subject, always, to the direction 
and control of the prosecuting fiscal. (Section 15 in connection with section 4 
of Rule 106, Rules of Court; Lim Tek Goan <i>vs</i>. Yatco, 94 Phil., 197. The 
reason of the law in not permitting the offended party to intervene in the 
prosecution of the offense if he had waived or reserved his right to institute 
the civil action is that.. such action her interest in the criminal case has 
disappeared. It prosecution becomes the sole function of the public prosecutor. 
(Gorospe, et al., <i>vs.</i> Gatmaitan et al., 98 Phil., 600). The rule, 
therefore, is that the right of intervention reserved to the offended party is 
for the sole purpose of enforcing the civil liability born of the criminal act 
and not of demanding punishment of the accused (People <i>vs.</i> Orais, 65 
Phil. 744; People <i>vs.</i> Veles 77 Phil. 1026; People <i>vs</i>. Flores et 
al., G. R. No. L-7528; December 1057; see also U.S. vs. Malabon, 1 Phil. 731; U. 
S. vs. Heery, 25 Phil. 600)." </p></blockquote>
<p>In a number of cases decided prior to Roa vs. De la Cruz. it had been held 
that upon the institution of a criminal action for physical injuries the 
offended party need no reserve his right to file a separate civil action arising 
op the same injuries, for the reason that the law itself (Art. 33 of Civil Code) 
already makes the reservation and the failure of the offended party to do so 
does not bar W from bringing such action. (See Estrada vs. Briones, 56 Off. Gaz. 
No. 12, p. 2041, Aug. 28, 1959, and cases cited.) In those instances, of course, 
the offended parties did not intervene actively in the criminal prosecution 
through private counsel. </p>
<p>The issue now before us is whether or not the rule laid down in the Roa case 
should govern this one. We are of the opinion that there is a demonstrable 
material difference between the circumstances of the two cases. In the first not 
only was the offended party represented by a private prosecutor in the criminal 
action but the action went through trial on the merits. In fact it was the 
private prosecutor who actually handled the case. He there- fore had sufficient 
opportunity to claim and prove damages, for which purpose alone, according to 
the decision of this Court, his active intervention was allowed. For if that had 
not been the purpose, or if the offended party had reserved the right to file a 
separate civil action, such intervention would not have been justified. </p>
<p>In the instant case the criminal action against defendant Luat did not 
proceed to trial, as he pleaded guilty upon arraignment. The mere appearance of 
private counsel in representation of the offended party did not constitute such 
active intervention as could only import an intention to press a claim for 
damages in the same action. It is as reasonable to indulge the possibility that 
the private prosecutors appeared precisely to be able to make a seasonable 
reservation of the right to file a separate civil action which, even if 
unnecessary at the time,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> would 
nevertheless have been the prudent and practical thing to Jo for the purpose of 
better protecting the interests of their clients. But as matters turned out, the 
accused leaded guilty upon arraignment and was immediately sentenced. </p>
<p>Thereafter there was no chance to enter such a reservation in the record. 
</p>
<p>We do not believe that plaintiffs' substantive right to claim damages should 
necessarily be foreclosed by the fact — at best equivocal as to its purpose — 
that private prosecutors entered their appearance at the very inception of the 
proceeding, which was then cut short at that stage. It cannot be said with any 
reasonable certainty that plaintiffs had thereby committed themselves to the 
submission pf their action for damages in that action. The rule laid down in Roa 
vs. De la Cruz, supra, does not govern this case. The ends of justice will be 
better served if plaintiffs are given their day in court. </p>
<p>The order appealed from is set aside and the case remanded for further 
proceedings, with costs. </p><i>Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L. 
Barrera, Paredes, Regala, Bengzon, J. P.</i> and <i>Zaldivar, JJ.</i> concur.
