				<H3>ASSOCIATED TRADE UNIONS-ATU (ATU-KILUSAN), PETITIONER, VS. HON. CARMELO G.

				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Apparently mindful of the state of the law on the subject,
petitioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place>, in this <i>certiorari</i> proceeding,
took pains in a rather elaborate pleading to justify its claim that there was a
denial of procedural due process when respondent Director of the Bureau of
Labor Relations affirmed the actuation of a Med-Arbiter ordering a
certification election.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Its labored effort, as will be shown, was none too successful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did try to impress on this Court that the
Med-Arbiter was quite arbitrary in granting respondent <st1:place>Union</st1:place>'s
plea for a certification election alleging that there was neither "prior
inquiry nor investigation of whatever kind."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
There was nothing in the order of such official, annexed to its <span class="GramE">petition, that</span> would support such a contention.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, its main reliance was the operation of a contract-bar rule, but
unfortunately for petitioner, the Med-Arbiter ascertained that petitioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place>,
without waiting for the expiration of the existing contract, and with the end
in view of avoiding a certification election, was able to persuade management
to renew it.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
It ought not to have been surprised, therefore, when respondent Director
affirmed the order for the holding of a certification election on appeal and at
the same time decertified the new collective bargaining contract which was
tainted by pre-maturity and, therefore, not entitled to respect.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Comment of the public respondent, filed by Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span> P. Mendoza,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
objectively clarified the relevant facts in the following manner:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"On <st1:date year="1977" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1977</st1:date>, the local chapter of the Federation of
Free Workers (Synthetic Marketing and Industrial Corporation Chapter) filed a
petition for certification election among the regular rank and-file employees
of the Synthetic Marketing and Industrial Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition alleged, among others, that it
commands the great majority of the rank-and-file employees of the bargaining
unit, and that more than 30% of the total work force supported its petition,
attaching the signatures of said union members.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petition admitted the existence of another union in the
establishment, the Associated Trade Unions (ATU-KILUSAN) and the existence of a
CBA to expire on <st1:date year="1977" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was further alleged that there has been no
certification election in the company for the last twelve months preceding the
filing of the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both the Company
and the Associated Trade Unions opposed the petition on the ground that it is
contract-barred by virtue of the existence of a duly registered CBA with the
BLR entered into between the parties on <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="5">May
 10, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioning union,
on the other hand, assailed the validity of the said CBA on the ground that the
same had been executed five (5) months and twenty-one (21) days prior to the
expiration of the old CBA which was supposed to expire October 31, 1977 and was
not ratified by the members of the bargaining unit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1977" day="9" month="1">January
 9, 1977</st1:date>, the Med-Arbiter assigned to the case issued an Order
calling for a certification election * * *.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From the aforesaid Order of the Med-Arbiter, the Associated Trade Unions
(ATU-KILUSAN) appealed to the Bureau of Labor Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a resolution dated May 29, 1978, BLR
Director <span class="SpellE">Carmelo</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Noriel</span>
affirmed the Order of the Med-Arbiter calling for an election, at the same time
setting aside its certification of the CBA concluded between the Synthetic
Marketing and Industrial Corporation and the Associated Trade Unions * *
*.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not satisfied with the last-mentioned
resolution of the BLR Director, the Associated Trade Unions (ATU-KILUSAN) filed
the instant petition for review with prayer for preliminary injunction."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The lack of merit of this petition is thus quite manifest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It calls for dismissal.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. It is true that where the challenged order of labor officials
could be shown to be tainted by unfairness or arbitrariness, whether in the
procedural or substantive sense, a due process question arises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, then, the corrective power of this
Tribunal to assure that an administrative agency adheres to such cardinal
primary right<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
comes into play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is equally
undeniable that this Court has never allowed itself to be a party to any
scheme, however ingeniously devised, to thwart the clear intendment of the New
Labor Code<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
to facilitate the holding of a certification election, the democratic means to
ascertain in a manner definitive and certain which labor organization will be
chosen to represent the workers in a collective bargaining unit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is quite futile then for petitioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
to hope that this Tribunal, contrary to a long line of decisions<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
notable for their unanimity, would now gratify an aspiration devoid of
legitimacy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ought to have been
cautioned likewise by a realization that the matter sought to be litigated as
to the requisite number of signatures being factual, its chances of having a
determination by the administrative agency concerned were less than minimal.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2. The point was likewise made that the contract-bar rule would
preclude a certification election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
was to ignore the decertification of the collective bargaining agreement which
was hastily and prematurely entered into precisely for the purpose of avoiding
the holding of the certification election.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This aspect of the case was extensively gone into in the Comment of
Solicitor General Mendoza.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The only issue to be determined in the
instant case is whether or not the renewed CBA forged between the respondent
company and petitioner union constitutes a bar to the holding of a
certification election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows
that the old CBA of petitioner ATU-KILUSAN with respondent Synthetic Marketing
and Industrial Corporation was to expire on <st1:date year="1977" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, 5 months and 21 days before its expiry date, or on <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="5">May 10, 1977</st1:date>, ATU-KILUSAN renewed the
same with the consent and collaboration of management.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The renewed CBA was then submitted to the Bureau
of Labor Relations for certification on <st1:date year="1977" day="8" month="7">July
 8, 1977</st1:date>, or approximately 3 months prior to the expiration of the
outgoing CBA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, on <st1:date year="1977" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1977</st1:date> (48 days before
the expiration of the old CBA on <st1:date year="1977" day="31" month="10">October
 31, 1977</st1:date>), a petition for certification election was filed by
respondent union, the Federation of Free Workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, the renewed CBA between petitioner
ATU-KILUSAN and respondent company was certified on <st1:date year="1977" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1977</st1:date> or twenty-eight days before their
old CBA was to expire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the
foregoing facts, it is quite obvious that the renewed CBA cannot constitute a
bar to the instant petition for certification election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, the said GBA was
certified after the instant petition for certification had been filed by herein
respondent union, and its certification was conditioned upon the fact that
there was no pending petition for certification election with the Bureau of
Labor Relations * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second
place, the new CBA was entered into during the lifetime of the old CBA which
was to expire on <st1:date year="1977" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, said new CBA was not yet in existence
when the instant petition for certification election was filed on <st1:date year="1977" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said new CBA was to become effective on <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="11">November 1, 1977</st1:date> after the old CBA
expires on <st1:date year="1977" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1977</st1:date>,
and <span class="GramE">this,</span> if no representation issue had arisen in the
meantime, which is not the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly, therefore, the contract-bar rule does not apply to the case at
bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, it is indubitably clear
from the facts heretofore unfolded that management and petitioner herein
proceeded with such indecent haste in renewing their CBA way ahead of the
'sixty-day freedom period' in their obvious desire to frustrate the will of the
rank-and-file employees in selecting their collective bargaining representative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To countenance the actuation of the company
and the petitioner herein would be <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the
employees' constitutional right to self-organization.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is dismissed for lack of
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The temporary restraining order
issued by resolution of this Court of August 7, 1978 is hereby lifted and
declared to be of no force and effect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The certification election should be conducted as soon as possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
