				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Antonio Fausto y Tomas, appeals from the decision of the Court of First 
Instance of Manila (in Crim. Case No. 40937), convicting him of murder 
(qualified by evident premeditation) for the killing of Dr. Antonio Casal, and 
sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>; to indemnify the 
deceased's heirs in the sum of P5,000.00; and to pay the costs.
<p>The undisputed facts of the case are: At around 11:00 o'clock in the morning 
of August 7, 1957, Fernando Gonzales, while working as a <i>bodeguero</i> at the 
Pujalte Warehouse, situated at Pelaez and Balmes Streets, Manila, heard someone 
moaning. Thinking that it came from inside the warehouse, he looked for it 
there, but found nothing. He then went outside and there saw appellant stabbing 
Dr. Antonio Casal, who was lying with face up on the ground. Being unarmed, 
Gonzales rushed inside the bodega to get his night stick. At about the same 
time, Detective Benito Carasco of the Manila Police Department, who was then 
investigating one M. Santiago at St. Joseph Hospital located nearby, heard a nun 
calling for a policeman, at the same time pointing to the hospital's entrance. 
Responding to the call, he rushed out to the entrance and there saw appellant 
armed with a knife (Exh. G), shouting "Napatay ko siya" (referring to Dr. 
Antonio Casal). Drawing his pistol, Detective Garasco ordered appellant to drop 
the knife. After shouting once more napatay ko siya", appellant dropped the 
knife. Detective Carasco then approached appellant, arrested him, and picked up 
the knife. The victim, Dr. Casal, was sprawled on the ground, covered with 
blood.</p>
<p>Detective Carasco then told the nun to call a doctor, while he took appellant 
behind the hospital driveway, there they waited until an MPD mobile patrol car 
arrived. Thereafter, Detective Villarta, who investigated him by question and 
answer method (See Exh. E). Later, appellant was taken to the scene of the 
incident. There, with the aid of police officers, he re-enacted the commission 
of the crime. He pointed to the place (near a post at Balmes St.) where he sat 
waiting for Dr. Casal (Exh. F). He also demonstrated his position when he 
approached the victim, as the latter walked towards his car (Exh. F-2), as well 
as his position and that of the victim, after the latter fell to the ground 
(Exh. F-1).</p>
<p>The autopsy report (Exh. A) of Dr. Mariano B. de Lara, Chief MPD Medical 
Examiner, discloses that the deceased sustained 18 stab wounds, the fatal ones 
being those described in Nos. 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 of said report and shown in the 
sketch (Exh. B) and the photographs (Exhs. D and D-1). According to the report, 
death was due to "profuse exsanguinating hemorrhage" and "shock due to multiple 
slashing stab wounds."</p>
<p>At the trial, the defense owned appellant's authorship of the crime. It 
claimed, however, that criminal liability, because before and on the occasion of 
the execution of the crime, he was insane. To establish insanity, the defense 
presented evidence showing that appellant was confined at the National Mental 
Hospital from June 27 to July 9, 1956, i.e., 1 year and 1 month before the crime 
was committed, during which period, he was observed and diagnosed as suffering 
from schizophrenia of the paranoid type (See Exhs. 1 to 3), but treatment was 
stopped when appellant was discharged against the advice of hospital 
authorities.</p>
<p>On October 28, 1958, the trial court, upon the defense's motion, ordered 
appellant's confinement at the National Mental Hospital, for observation and 
diagnosis. Appellant stayed in said hospital until March 9, 1959. Dr. Carlos 
Vicente, who attended to appellant in said hospital reported that appellant was 
suffering from schizophrenia with brain syndrome, and that said illness existed 
prior to, and after the commission of the crime in question (See Exh. 6).</p>
<p>The defense also presented the testimony of Fr. George Haggenburg, 
parish priest of Guimba, Nueva Ecija, regarding his impressions of appellant's 
mental condition, when the latter was employed as laborer by him in 1956, as 
well as the reasons for his letter (Exh. 5) sent to Dr. Francisco Santos of the 
Bureau of Hospitals.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the defense is insanity, the only question to be determined in 
this appeal is, whether or not appellant was insane at the time of the 
commission of the crime charge.</p>
<p>As a rule, when a defendant in a criminal case interposes the defense of 
mental incapacity, the burden of establishing such fact rests upon him (U.S. vs. 
Martinez, 34 Phil. 305; U.S. vs. Hontiveros, 18 Phil. 62; people vs. Bascos, 44 
Phil. 204). The legal presumption is that a person who commits a crime is in his 
right mind (U.S. <em>vs</em>. Guevara, 27 Phil. 547; U.S. <em>vs</em>. Zamora, 
32 Phil. 218), because the law presumes all acts and omissions punishable by law 
to be voluntary (Arts. 1 and 4[1]. Revised Penal Code), and if there is no 
sufficient or satisfactory evidence that the accused was mentally incapacitated 
when he committed the crime, the conclusion of fact must be the same presumption 
established by law, i.e.., that he was in his right mind, and the conclusion of 
law must be that he is criminally liable. The primary inquiry is, whether there 
has been presented sufficient convincing evidence, direct or circumstantial, to 
a degree that satisfies the judicial mind insane at the time of the perpetration 
of the offense. In order to ascertain a person's mental condition at the time of 
the act, it is permissible to receive evidence of the condition of his mind a 
reasonable period both before and after that time (People <em>vs</em>. Bonoan, 
64 Phil. 87).</p>
<p>After a careful and thorough examination and review of all the evidence 
presented in this case, we find, as did the trial court, that appellant was not 
mentally incapacitated when he committed the crime in question and is, 
therefore, criminally liable for the offense committed by him.</p>
<p>(1) It appears that appellant was confined at the National Mental Hospital, 
for a period of 13 days, from June 27 to July 9, 1956 (1 year, 1 month, and 2 
days prior to the commission of the crime). He was not insane during said 
confinement. On this point, the trial judge made the following findings, to 
which we fully agree:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Examining the evidence of record, we find first that the defendant had been 
confined in the National Mental Hospital for a period of 13 days from June 27 to 
July 9, 1956. According to the defense witnesses, the defendant was found then 
to be suffering from schizophrenia of the paranoid type. It is alleged that the 
defendant claimed hearing voices and having hallucinations. It will be observed 
that the defense witnesses presented to substantiate the alleged insanity are 
not alienists but psychiatrists. The Court, without the least intention of 
casting doubt on the knowledge or integrity of the witnesses who testified in 
this case, is inclined to doubt the diagnosis. Within such a limited period of 
13 days, the Court doubts that proper and accurate diagnosis could have been 
arrived at, considering that in the case of mental disease, constant observation 
of the symptoms and behavior of the patient are necessary. That the patient 
claimed to have heard voices or having had hallucinations is certainly a 
difficult matter to ascertain or verify. One could easily feign moodiness, 
isolate himself from the other patients or inmates, and claim having heard 
voices or seeing people. On the other hand, the defense witness Dr. Leonida 
Mariano affirmed that in her first interview of the patient (the accused), the 
latter, not only gave his full name, but also, the place where he came from, his 
civil status, and his employment at San Miguel Brewery, and that he was neat in 
appearance and coherent in his answers. In the second interview, the patient 
gave the full name of his wife and his children and his parents. He gave 
information about his age, the town and province of his birth, street and number 
of his residence in Manila, and gave the further statement that while there had 
been no tragic eyents in his family, he was, however, worried by the fact that 
his wage of P6.50 was not sufficient to feed and maintain his seven (7) 
children. The witness Dr. Mariano also affirmed that the answer given by the 
patient to her questions were coherent and relevant, showing that he was 
intelligent; that he greeted and recognized his wife on the several occasions 
that she visited him, and even asked her to secure his immediate discharge; and 
that he attended to his own physical needs. Considering the above testimony of 
Dr. Mariano, the Court is of the opinion that the accused, at the time of his 
first confinement in the National Mental Hospital, was not insane. In fact, in 
his statement, Exhibit E, the defendant, relating his first confinement, 
revealed that he did not want to go, but finally consented, because he was not 
Mentally ill. If the accused was insane then, it can hardly be expected of him 
to remember what had transpired then. The defense, to bolster its theory, also 
presented the testimony of Fr. George Haggenburg, parish priest of Guimba, Nueva 
Ecija. The witness affirmed that sometime in 1957, the defendant handed him a 
letter wherein he promised to give P30,000.00 if the witness would pray for him; 
that one day the defendant went to see him and told him a story that at first 
was unintelligible, but which during his conversation with the defendant, turned 
out that he wished to return to his job and needed a certificate. The fact that 
the defendant had promised P30,000.00, if the good father would pray for him, is 
not and cannot be considered, either by itself alone, or in conjunction with the 
fact of the confinement, as sufficiently indicative of the allegedly impaired 
mental condition of the defendant. The latter may have made such promise in a 
moment of religious excitement or fervor. And as to his story that at first was 
not understood by the priest, the latter himself admitted that it was due to the 
attempt of the defendant to convey his ideas in English, of which language, the 
defendant is not conversant. It should be borne in mind, that from the time the 
defendant was released from the National Mental Hospital in July 9, 1956, up to 
the date of the commission of the crime, he must have been in contact with many 
persons. Aside from the testimony of Fr. George Haggenburg, however, there is no 
other evidence in record showing that during that interval of time, the 
defendant had acted as one deprived of his reason. If he had been mentally 
deranged, certainly such a condition could not have escaped the persons, friends 
and strangers alike, his wife and members of his family." </p></blockquote>
<p>(2) The findings of Dr. Carlos Vicente, who attended the appellantduring his 
second confinement (by court order) at the National Mental Hospital, On October 
31, 1958 (1 year, 2 months, and 24 days after the commission of the crime ), do 
not indicate the defensant was deprived of reason. The trial court correctly 
observed: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The defense also relies on the testimony of Dr. Carlos Vicente who took 
charge of the accused when he was confined in the National Mental Hospital on 
October 31, 1958, upon order of this court. But even accepting the findings of 
Dr. Vicente on their face value, the court is of the opinion that they do not 
support the theory of the defense that at the time of the commission of the 
crime, the accused was deprived of his reason. Aside from the fact that the 
findings of Dr. Vicente were made more than one year after the commission of the 
crime, it will be remembered that the accused has always been detained. During 
that period, was practically without contact with friends and relatives, he was 
troubled by his conscience and the realization of the gravity of the offense 
committed by him, plus the thought of the bleak future of his children. All 
these may have produced in the defendant morbid disposition and moodiness, that 
could have been interpreted as signs of mental illness. But the very report of 
Dr. Vicente clearly indicate that the accused was not mentally deranged. In 
fact, the two psychiatrists, Dr. Vicente and Dr. Mariano, affirmed that 
defendant's illness affected only his personality but not this 
brain."</p></blockquote>
<p>(3) Appellant's signed statement (Exh. E, pp. 49-51, Records) taken by 
Detective Nemesio Villarta, barely 3 hours after the killing, clearly shows that 
appellint was mentally sound. In said statement, he narrated in detail how, 
after waiting for more than one year after his separation from his work at the 
San Miguel Brewery plant, he made up his mind the day before the killing to see 
the victim (Dr. Casal) once more, this time either to get the certification 
(that he was mentally sane) or to kill him. He narrated how the following 
morning, he boarded a Pantranco ' Bus from Guimba, Nueva Ecija; that once in 
Manila, he boarded a taxi to the St. Joseph Hospital, where he knew the victim 
would be at the time visiting his patients; that he saw the victim's car parked 
and waited for the latter to come out; that as soon as the victim came out of 
the building, he approached him (victim) and made a last appeal that he be given 
the certification; that when the doctor refused and became angry with him, he 
decided then to kill him on the shoulder, pulling him towards himself 
(appellant), at the same time thrusting at him with the knife (Exh. G).</p>
<p>(4) Appellant's re-enactment of the crime at its scene only a few hours after 
he committed it, leaves no room for doubt as to his sanity, both during and 
after its (the crime) execution. </p>
<p>(5) Appellant had a strong motive to kill the deceased Dr. Casal, as he did. 
He was a laborer at the Magnolia Power Plant of the San Miguel Brewery, earning 
P6.50 a day. This was the sole support of his wife and 7 children. Then suddenly 
he found himself out of work and committed to the National Mental Hospital on 
June 27, 1956, at the instance of the deceased, Dr. Casal. Several entrieties by 
appellant after his release from said Hospital on July 9, 1956, and convince 
said deceased that he was well, and to give him the necessary certification 
pre-requisite to re-employment at said company, proved unavailing and futile. 
He, therefore, decided to liquidate the deceased whom he believed was the cause 
of his unemployment.</p>
<p>In the circumstances, we find appellant guilty, as did the trial court, of 
the crime of murder, qualified by evident premeditation (as he reflected or 
meditated on, and planned the killing, and pursued) his plan to a successful 
conclusion).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The Aggravating 
circumstance of treachery was present in the commission of the crime, as the 
attack on the deceased, although frontal, was too sudden and unexpected, giving 
the latter no chance to offer any defense whatsoever (People <em>vs</em>. 
Noble, 77 Phil. 93), but this is offset by the mitigating circumstance of 
voluntary surrender (People vs. Fontabla, 61 Phil. 589) and, therefore, cannot 
be taken into account for the purposes of aggravation or increase of the 
penalty.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the judgement of the court <em>a quo</em> is hereby affirmed 
<em>in toto</em>, with costs againsts the defendant-appellant.</p>
<p>So ordered.</p><em>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes,
