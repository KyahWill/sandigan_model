thereafter set the case for pre-trial on <st1:date month="2" day="22" year="1967">Feb­ruary 22, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On motion of both parties, upon the ground that they were
"exploiting the feasibility of settling the case amicably," the court
issued, on February 5, 1968, an order granting them up to Feb­ruary 29, 1968,
"within which to submit their amicable settlement or a negative
manifestation," and, "in the event of the latter," resetting the
case for hearing on April 8, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
this date, both parties ap­peared before the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon inquiry by the same about the
"status of the amicable settlement, (c<span class="GramE">)<span class="SpellE">ounsel</span></span> for the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>

immediately.</p>

alleged that "there are negotia­tions for the amicable settlement" of
the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same was several times,
thereafter, set for hearing, which was, just as often, post­poned, mostly upon
the same ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After thirteen (13)

postponed for the reason "that the parties are still exploring the
possibility of settling this case amicably." Considering, however, that
the case had been pending for over six (6) years, the court ordered the case
dismissed "for failure to prosecute." A reconsideration of this order
was later denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As to what constitutes an "unreasonable length of

that it "depends upon the circumstances of each particular case,"
that "the sound discretion of the court" in the determination of said

<p class="BODY">Let us now examine the cases under consideration, in the light of
the foregoing precedents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs-appellants in L-27187 assail the order of dismissal
appealed from upon the ground:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a) that
the duty to serve summons upon the defendants devolves upon the clerk of court,
not upon the plaintiffs; and 2) that service of summons by publication is not
feasible in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first ground
is clearly untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no cogent
reason <span style="">to depart from the position
taken in Smith Bell &amp; Co. vs. American President Lines, in which this Court
ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The appellants contend that under sections 1, 2, and 3, of Rule
31, Rules of Court, it is the duty of the clerk of court and not of the
plaintiff to include a case in the trial calendar after the issues are joined
and that it is also the duty of the clerk of court and not the plaintiff to fix
the date for trial and to cause a notice to be served upon the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the duty imposed upon the clerk in these
sections of the Rules does not relieve the plaintiff of his own duty to
prosecute the case diligently, for the non-per­formance of that duty by
plaintiff is by section 3 of Rule 30 made an express ground for dismissing the
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the clerk, therefore, in the
present cases had been negligent, <span style="">it
was plaintiff's duty to call the court's attention to that fact so that the
administration of justice would not suffer delay."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The second ground did not justify plaintiffs' inaction for three
(3) years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there was no means of
summoning any of the defendants, plaintiffs should have so informed the court
and moved for their ex­clusion from the complaint, within a reasonable period
of time, so that the case could be disposed of one way or another, instead of
being left pending indefinitely, thus contributing to the clogging of our court
dockets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, plaintiffs could have
asked that the defendants be summoned by publication, pursuant to sections 16
and 17 of Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, the action being one for partition of
real properties in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant in L-29098
alleges that the failure of his counsel to appear at the pre-trial, on January
4, 1968, was due to the fact that he then had to attend the trial of another
case; that he had filed, on Decem­ber 27, 1967, a motion for postponement of
said pre-trial upon such ground; and that, although the motion was denied on
December 29, 1967, notice of the order to this effect was not received by him
until January 12, 1968, or eight (8) days after the scheduled pre-trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These reasons are insufficient to warrant a
reversal of the order appealed from.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant was represented by the "<span class="SpellE">Achacoso</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Simbulan</span>"
Law Firm, on behalf of which Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sabino</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Palomares</span>, Jr. had appeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If Atty. <span class="SpellE">Palomares</span>
had another case set for trial on January 4, 1968, any of the three (3) members
of the law firm could have and should have appeared at the pre-trial of the
case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in the absence of
an order granting said motion for postponement, appellant's counsel was not
justified in assuming that the motion would be granted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The fact that the plaintiffs had filed a motion for
continuance x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> does not
entitle the plaintiffs to presume that their motion for continuance would be
granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Motions for postponement are
left to the sound discretion of the trial court and unless there <span class="GramE">be</span> an abuse of such discretion this Court will not interfere
with the exercise of that discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As regards L-29373, having been rendered pursuant to a com­promise
between plaintiff Bolivar and defendant <span class="SpellE">Bandayrel</span>,
who has not assailed the validity of said compromise, the judgment of the City
Court was not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Regardless of whether or not <span class="SpellE">Bandayrel</span> had failed to
exercise reasonable diligence in the prose­cution of his appeal, the same was,
therefore, dismissed properly.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering, with respect to L-29454, that from March 24, 1961,
when the case was set for trial, to December 8, 1966, when it was dismissed,
over five (5) years and eight (8) months had elapsed, during which plaintiff
had done nothing to prosecute the case, and that, in its order of March 17,
1964, the lower court had already warned the parties "that no further
postponement shall be granted," it is clear that the order of dismissal
therein appealed from was fully justified.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither has appellant in L-29542 shown that there was a patent
abuse of discretion in dismissing the case for failure on his part, as
plaintiff therein, to prosecute it for over eleven (11) months, considering
that the subject matter of the litigation was a small sum of money<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
and that appellant's claim <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> had <span style="">been found by the city court to be
groundless.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In L-30711, both parties
were notified, on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="8"><span style="">August 8, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, that the record of the appeal taken by the
plaintiff therein - from the judgment of dismissal rendered <span class="GramE">by</span>
the municipal court of General Santos - had been received by the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cota­bato</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, up to </span><st1:date month="1" day="30" year="1969"><span style="">January 30, 1969</span></st1:date><span style="">, when the case was ordered dismissed, or for
about two (2) years and a half, plaintiff-appellant had taken no step
whatsoever to prosecute its claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
excuse given by counsel for the plaintiff is that he was waiting for the clerk
of the court of first instance to issue the proper notice of pre-trial, without
which the case would not be ready for trial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This excuse is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
language of the Smith Bell case:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>(T)he duty
imposed upon the clerk x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
does not relieve the plaintiff of his own duty to prosecute the case
diligently, for the non-per­formance of that duty by plaintiff is by section 3 <span style="">of Rule 30 made an express ground for
dismissing the action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the clerk,
therefore, in the present cases had been negligent, it was plaintiff's duty to
call the court's attention to that fact so that the administration of justice
would not suffer delay."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Similarly, the order of
dismissal for the inaction of plaintiff in L-30744, from </span><st1:date month="8" day="14" year="1967"><span style="">August
 14, 1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> - when she
filed her reply, with an answer to the defendant's counterclaim - to </span><st1:date month="1" day="23" year="1969"><span style="">January
 23, 1969</span></st1:date><span style=""> - or for
over seventeen (17) months - when said order was issued - was, likewise,
justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's argument to the
effect that the case was not ready for trial, no pre-trial having as yet been
held, is - for the reasons adverted to in relation to L-30711 - devoid of
merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">So is the appeal in
L-30933, more than five (5) years having elapsed from the submission of
appellants' record on appeal on April 14, 1962, to August 11, 1967, when the
appeal was dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants
maintain that their duty to see to it that the record on appeal was transmitted
and certified to the appellate court starts only from its approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is their duty as appellants to exercise
due diligence in the prosecution of their appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, this duty includes that of
securing the approval of the record on appeal and its transmittal to the
appellate court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the mistake allegedly committed by the office secret­ary
of appellant's counsel in L-31072, in making the entry for the hearing of the
case on <st1:date month="2" day="6" year="1969">February 6, 1969</st1:date>, in
the space for <st1:date month="2" day="11" year="1969">February 11, 1969</st1:date>,
in his new pocket calendar, is too flimsy to warrant a reversal of the order of
dismissal complained of, apart from being difficult to believe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the sworn statement of appellant
<span class="SpellE">Olilang</span>, attached, by way of affidavit of merit, to
his motion for relief, does not satisfy the requirements <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
it being no more than a general, abstract assertion of a conclusion that he has
"a valid and meritorious cause of action against the respondents"
therein, without any fact in support thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the orders appealed from in each one of these
nine (9) cases are hereby affirmed, with costs against the respective
appellants, except appellant in L-30711, which is the Government.</p>
