a deci­sion of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
dismissing petitioner's complaint.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 13, 1961, petitioner Geronimo G. <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>
— hereinafter referred to as <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> — and
respondent Isidro de Guzman — hereinafter referred to as De Guzman — the latter
acting in his own behalf and in that of a corporation (Institute of
Electronics) he then intended to organize — which eventually was not organized
— entered into a contract whereby <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> leased to
De Guzman a portion of the <span class="SpellE">Esguerra-Gueco</span> building,
belonging to <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> and his wife, Cristina <span class="SpellE">Gueco</span> — hereinafter referred to collectively as the <span class="SpellE">Esguerras</span> — and located at Torres <span class="SpellE">Bugallon</span>
Street, <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> City, for a term of ten (10) years,
beginning from July 12, 1961, at a monthly rental of P300.00, up to July 11,
1962, and P400.00 thereafter, payable in advance within the first 10 days of
each month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as De Guzman had
failed to pay the rental from February to August, 1962, aggregating P1,800.00,
in addition to the sum of P300.00, representing the balance of the purchase
price of equipment bought by him from the <span class="SpellE">Esguerras</span>,
on August 6, 1962, respondent's mother, <span class="SpellE">Segunda</span> de
Guzman — hereinafter referred to as Mrs. De Guzman — executed, in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Esguerras</span>, a promissory note for P2,100.00, payable as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P1,000.00, not later than Aug­ust
12, 1962, and the balance of P1,100.00 not later than August 31, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The promissory note further stipulated that:</p>

<blockquote>"If the first payment of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as
stated above is not paid on the date it falls due, <st1:date year="1962" day="12" month="8">Aug­ust 12, 1962</st1:date>, this note or the entire value
there­of becomes immediately due and demandable."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">None of the aforementioned payments having been made when due,
the <span class="SpellE">Esguerras</span> commenced, on September 11, 1962, Civil
Case No. 1074 of the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> City,
against Mrs. De Guzman, for the collection of said sum of P2<span class="GramE">,100.00</span>,
with interest thereon from August 6, 1962, plus interest, at the legal rate, on
the aggregate amount due on September 11, 1962, and P520.00 as and for
attorney's fees and expenses of litigation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Three (3) days later, <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> instituted
Civil Case No. 1075 of the same court, against De Guzman, to recover:</p>

<blockquote>“(a) The sum of P160.00 representing the unpaid rentals in arrears
for the period from July 12, 1962 to August 12, 1962, with interest thereon at
the legal rate from and after August 17, 1962, the date of the formal demand;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(b) The amount of P400.00 monthly rental from and after <st1:date year="1962" day="12" month="8">August 12, 1962</st1:date>, until defendant
finally vacates the leased premises;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(<span class="GramE">c</span>) The sum of P2,000.00, as liquidated
damages, as stipulated in the lease agreement Annex 'A' and its corresponding
interest, at the legal rate, from the filing of this complaint;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“(d) The sum of P400.00, as and for attor­ney's
fees."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the same date, writs of attachment were issued in the two
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon thereafter, or on <st1:date year="1962" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1962</st1:date>, the parties
therein reached a compromise agreement to the effect that:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 22.5pt; text-indent: -0.9pt;"><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"1.
That both defendants in the above-entitled cases admit, jointly and severally,
liability to plaintiffs in the amount of TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY
PESOS (P2,260.00) which they promise to pay on or before November 26, 1962;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">"2. That should defendants fail to
perform their respective undertakings in the first two foregoing paragraphs
hereof:</p>

<p class="2Q">“(a) Defendant <span class="SpellE">Segunda</span> D. de Guzman
agrees and urges the Honorable Court to render judgment immediately against her
for the total amount claimed by plaintiffs-spouses in Civil Case No. 1074 now
pending before this court;</p>

<p class="2Q">“(b) Defendant Isidro de Guzman agrees and urges the Honorable
Court to immediately cause the promulgation of judgment against him for all the
amounts claimed by the plaintiff, Geronimo G. <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>,
in his complaint in Civil Case No. 1075;</p>

<p class="2Q">“(c) That upon failure of any or both of defendants herein to
perform their respective undertakings under this compromise agreement, they
agree and urge the Honorable Court to cause immediate execution of the judgment
against them upon their respective properties which have been attached under
process in connection with the pro­ceedings in the above-mentioned civil
cases;" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">"E",
pp. 38-39, Record on Appeal.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">This compromise agreement was approved by Judge Felipe M.
Villanueva, of the aforementioned municipal court, in a judg­ment dated <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1962</st1:date> the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding the said compromise agreement not to be
contrary to moral, public policy and law, the same is hereby approved and
judgment is rendered in these two cases accord­ingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, the parties are hereby enjoined to
abide with the terms and conditions of the same compromise agreement."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Admittedly, the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,260.00</span> was not
paid or delivered to the <span class="SpellE">Esguerras</span> on or before <st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On motion of the <span class="SpellE">Esguerras</span>,
Judge Villanueva issued, therefore, on <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="12">December
 14, 1962</st1:date>, the corresponding writs of execution in cases Nos. 1074 and
1075.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alleging that De Guzman had,
through his counsel, deli­vered to <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> P800.00,
on December 13, 1962, and P1<span class="GramE">,460.00</span>, on January 5,
1963, and that the receipt of said sums by the <span class="SpellE">Esguer­ras</span>
constituted full satisfaction of the aforementioned judgment by compromise, De
Guzman and his mother, Mrs. De Guzman — hereinafter referred to as the
respondents – filed, on February 4, 1962, a joint motion for the release of the
properties seized pur<span style="">suant to the writs
of attachment above referred to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion
was, on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="2"><span style="">February 11, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, granted by Judge Villanueva.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A reconsideration of the order to this effect having been denied,
on <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1963</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Esguerras</span> instituted, against respondents herein, the
provincial sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> and Judge Villanueva,
on <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1963</st1:date>, the
present action for certiorari, prohibition and mandamus, with preliminary
injunc­tion, which was docketed as Civil Case No. D-1450, of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, to annul the orders of Judge
Villanueva of February 11, and 23, 1963; to restrain Judge Villa­nueva from
enforcing said orders; and to compel him to issue an <u>alias</u> writ of
execution for the satisfaction of the unpaid balance of the judgment in said
Civil Cases Nos. 1074 and 1075.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
appropriate proceedings, the Court of First Instance rendered the decision
appealed from, dismissing the petition herein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Hence this appeal by the <span class="SpellE">Esguerras</span>.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents maintain, and the lower court held, that the
"receipt" of said sums of P800.00 and P1, 400.00 by the <span class="SpellE">Esguerras</span> constituted "acceptance" of the
incomplete and irregular perform­ance of respondents' obligation under the
judgment in cases Nos. 1074 and 1075, and that, this "acceptance"
having been made with­out any "protest or objection" on the part of
the <span class="SpellE">Esguerras</span>, said obligation must be "deemed
fully complied with," pursuant to Article 1235 of the Civil Code of the
Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">This theory is based upon the premise that "receipt" of
a partial payment is necessarily an "acceptance" thereof, within the
purview of said provision, and that the <span class="SpellE">Esguerras</span> had
not pro­tested or objected to <span class="GramE">said</span> payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such premise is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The verb "accept," as used in
Article <span class="GramE">1235,</span> means to take as "satisfactory or
sufficient," or to "give assent to," or to "agree" or
"accede" to an incomplete or irregular performance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstances obtaining in the case at
bar clearly show that the <span class="SpellE">Esguerras</span> had neither
acceded or assented to said payment, nor taken the same as satisfactory or
sufficient compliance with the judgment aforementioned.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the <u>day immediately following</u> that of the first
pay­ment of P800.00, or on <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="12">December
 14, 1962</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Esguerras</span> asked Judge
Villanueva to issue the corresponding writs of execution in the two (2)
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the <span class="SpellE">Esguerras</span>
patently manifested their dissatisfaction with ­­­- which necessarily implied
an objection or protest to — said partial payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Judge Villanueva must have so
understood the reaction of the <span class="SpellE">Esguerras</span> to the same
payment, for he <u>was present when it w</u><u><span style="">as </span>made</u>, and <u>still he caused the writs to be issued</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, the <u>respondents evidently
had the same impression</u>, for, otherwise, they would not have paid the
additional sum of P1<span class="GramE">,460.00</span> on <st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then, again, the insistence of the <span class="SpellE">Esguerras</span> in
causing the attached properties of respondents herein to be disposed of,
pursuant to the writs of execution, despite said additional payments, leave no
room f<span style="">or </span>doubt that the former
had never regarded the partial payments as satisfactory compliance with the
latter's obligation under said judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">After all, the law does not require the protest or objection of
the creditor to be made in a particular manner or at a particu­lar time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So long as the acts of the creditor, at the
time of the in­complete or irregular payment by the debtor, or within a reason­able
time thereafter, evince that the former is not satisfied with or agreeable to
said payment or performance, the obligation shall not be deemed fully
extinguished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the <span class="SpellE">Esguerras</span> had performed said acts within such time.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from should be, as it is
hereby, reversed, and another one shall be entered direct­ing respondent
Municipal Judge to issue the corresponding <u><span style="">al</span>ia</u><u><span style="">s</span></u><span style=""> </span>writs of execution, with costs against
respondents Isidro de Guz­man and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Segunda</span> de
Guzman.</p>
