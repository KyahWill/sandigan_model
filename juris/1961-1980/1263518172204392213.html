<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BARREDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A special civil action for prohibition seeking to declare
Resolution No. 1497 of the Board of Trustees of the respondent Government
Service Insurance System of August 9, 1963 to the effect that petitioner
"Mr. (<span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span>) <span class="SpellE">Beronilla</span>
be considered compulsorily retired from the service (as Auditor of the
Philippine National Bank) effective January 14, 1963" as null and void for
having been issued, in the words of the petition, "in excess of the powers
granted to it by law, a want on abuse of discretion, violation of contracts,
removal or forced retirement without due process of law and to declare all acts
heretofore taken in implementation thereof also void, and to prohibit said
respondent and its representatives from carrying out or implementing the
aforesaid resolution." Acting on petitioner's prayer for preliminary injunction,
on <st1:date year="1963" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1963</st1:date>, this
Court issued the writ prayed for upon petitioner's filing an injunction bond in
the amount of P1,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the time of the filing of the present petition on <st1:date month="8" day="23" year="1963">August 23, 1963</st1:date>, petitioner was
acting as and performing the duties of Auditor of the Philippine National
Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before that, he had occupied many
other positions in the government and had been a member of the GSIS during all
times required by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his application for employment, his applications for life and
retirement insurance as well as his application to be allowed to take civil
service examinations, ten times from 1917 to 1925, petitioner uniformly
indicated that his date of birth is <st1:date month="1" day="14" year="1898">January
 14, 1898</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also indicated
the same date of birth in his Member's Service Record which he submitted to the
GSIS on <st1:date month="10" day="29" year="1954">October 29, 1954</st1:date>
pursuant to the provisions of Section 13-A, Republic Act No. 660.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="9" day="29" year="1959">September 29, 1959</st1:date>,
he requested the Commissioner of Civil Service, thru the Auditor General, that
his date of birth indicated in the records be changed to <st1:date month="1" day="14" year="1900">January 14, 1900</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the petition, it was only in
1955, before the demise of his mother that petitioner discovered that his true
date of birth is January 14, 1900; that his mother told him that in 1916, his
uncle, Alvaro <span class="SpellE">Beronilla</span>, purchased a <span class="SpellE">cedula</span> for him showing in the same that he was already 18
years old for the reason that his uncle wanted to take advantage of his being
able to vote for him in La Paz, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span> in 1919, when he
would be already twenty-one years of age and the uncle a candidate for
vice-president of the municipality; that since then he had been looking for
people who could attest to his true date of birth and it was only in September,
1959 that he came upon two old persons of their town, Felix <span class="SpellE">Alberne</span>
and Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Lalin</span> who could do so; that the former
had been a member of the provincial board and the latter is a retired justice
of the peace; and that his letter to the Civil Service Commissioner was
supported by the affidavits of these two persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This letter was endorsed by the Commission to
the GSIS for action "without the intervention of the Civil Service
Commission."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the GSIS, petitioner's letter-request was referred to the
Legal Counsel who, on <st1:date month="10" day="22" year="1959">October 22,
 1959</st1:date>, denied the same since "all official records point to <st1:date month="1" day="14" year="1898">January 14, 1898</st1:date> as the birthday of
Mr. <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> <span class="SpellE">Beronilla</span>."
Upon learning of this denial, petitioner submitted additional evidence to
support his request.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This evidence
consisted of <span class="SpellE">photostat</span> copies of the yearbooks of the
Philippine Institute of Accountants in 1954 and 1958 wherein his date of birth
is shown as <st1:date month="1" day="14" year="1900">January 14, 1900</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This additional evidence notwithstanding, on <st1:date month="3" day="21" year="1960">March 21, 1960</st1:date> the Legal Counsel
reiterated his former denial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon,
on <st1:date year="1960" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1960</st1:date> petitioner
appealed to the General Manager of the System who at that time was Mr. Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Andal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
favorable recommendation of the 2nd Assistant General Manager, Mr. F. G. <span class="SpellE">Ara√±a</span>, in a memorandum dated <st1:date month="5" day="30" year="1960">May 30, 1960</st1:date>, on <st1:date month="6" day="2" year="1960">June
 2, 1960</st1:date>, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Andal</span> placed "OK."
at the foot thereof over his initials, thus indicating approval of the
requested change.</p>

<p class="BODY">Based on this action of the General Manager, notes of the
adjustment of the date of birth of petitioner to <st1:date month="1" day="14" year="1900">January 14, 1900</st1:date> were sent to the Auditor General and
the Commissioner of Civil Service and the proceeds of petitioner's policy was
re-computed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Legal Counsel whose
title and rank had been meanwhile changed to Assistant General Manager for
Legal Affairs later communicated the aforesaid decision of the General Manager
to the Philippine National Bank on <st1:date month="11" day="2" year="1962">November
 2, 1962</st1:date> and the Deputy Auditor General on <st1:date month="11" day="12" year="1962">November 12, 1962</st1:date>, by letter and <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As emphasized by petitioner, in the letter to the Philippine National
Bank, it is stated that "his date of birth has been adjusted by this
office, after careful study and deliberation." On the other hand, in the
2nd <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> to the Deputy Auditor General, it was
made clear that relative to petitioner's life insurance policy No. N-2065 which
had matured on <st1:date year="1957" day="30" month="11">November 30, 1957</st1:date>,
corresponding adjustment or <span class="SpellE">recomputation</span> of the
maturity value had been effected on the basis of his changed date of
birth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, upon application
of petitioner, on <st1:date month="10" day="1" year="1960">October 1, 1960</st1:date>,
he was issued a new life policy No. 335778 indicating his date of birth as <st1:date month="1" day="14" year="1900">January 14, 1900</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regarding his above-mentioned policy No.
N-2065, on <st1:date month="7" day="7" year="1960">July 7, 1960</st1:date>,
demand was made upon petitioner to pay the System additionally the sum of
P131.09, due to the adjustment of his date of birth, which demand, petitioner
promptly complied with.</p>

<p class="BODY">Almost three years after Mr. <span class="SpellE">Andal</span>
approved the change of petitioner's date of birth, more specifically, on May 6,
1963, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Ismael</span> <span class="SpellE">Mathay</span>,
then Auditor of the Central Bank detailed to the Philippine National Bank,
wrote the Board of Trustees of the GSIS about the service of petitioner and
stated that "in the course of the audit of the transactions of the
Philippine National Bank, it was found that Mr. <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span>
<span class="SpellE">Beronilla</span> has been continuously paid since January
15, 1963, his salary allowances and other fringe benefits as Auditor of said
Bank notwithstanding the fact that Mr. <span class="SpellE">Beronilla</span> has
attained his sixty-fifth (65th) birthday last January 14, 1963, the date of his
automatic and compulsory retirement from the government service as fixed under
Republic Act No. 3096 approved June 16, 1961." Acting on this letter, the
Board referred the same to Assistant General Manager and Actuary, Dr. Manuel <span class="SpellE">Hizon</span>, then in charge of the Claims Department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter submitted a memorandum on August
6, 1963 stating the facts and evidence in the GSIS records concerning the
determination of the date of birth of petitioner, including the actions
aforementioned taken thereon by Mr. <span class="SpellE">Andal</span> and the
Legal Counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="8" day="9" year="1963">August 9, 1963</st1:date>, the Board adopted the disputed
resolution without even notifying petitioner of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Mathay's</span>
letter and without giving him any opportunity to be heard regarding the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon these facts, it is the theory of petitioner that the
approval by General manager <span class="SpellE">Andal</span> of his request for
the change of the date of his birth in the official records of the GSIS from
January 14, 1898 to January 14, 1900, after the same had been previously denied
by the Legal Counsel, could not be legally altered or modified by the Board of
Trustees, not only because the power to decide such matter finally is legally
lodged in the General Manager and not in the Legal Counsel, nor in the Board,
but also because even if the Board were assumed to have authority to review the
acts of the General Manager, it was either guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>
or <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from revising the same; and, furthermore,
in approving the resolution in dispute, the Board of Trustees had denied due
process to petitioner and impaired the obligations of the contract between
petitioner and the GSIS regard¬≠ing his retirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the main issue before Us in
this case is one of power and does not call for Our determination of whether
petitioner's real date of birth is <st1:date year="1898" day="14" month="1">January
 14, 1898</st1:date> or <st1:date year="1900" day="14" month="1">January 14,
 1900</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, all We
have to decide is whether or not the GSIS Board of Trustees acted within its
power when it reversed the approval by General Manager <span class="SpellE">Andal</span>
of petitioner's request for the change of his date of birth, taking all
circumstances into account including peti¬≠tioner's allegations of <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">adjudicata</span>, <span class="SpellE">laches</span>, <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, denial of due
process and unconstitutional impairment of contractual obligations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After carefully going over the facts on
record and considering all pertinent legal principles and statutory provisions,
particularly Commonwealth Act 186, the Charter of the GSIS, as amended,
together with the relevant resolutions of the Board of Trustees, We have
decided to uphold the superior autho¬≠rity of the Board over the General Manager
and to dismiss this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not deem it necessary to pass upon petitioner's initial
proposition, pressed vigorously, to be sure, to the effect that as between the
previous denial by the Legal Counsel and the subsequent approval by General
Manager <span class="SpellE">Andal</span> of his request for the change of his
date of birth in the records, the latter, which was precisely the action on his
appeal from the Legal Counsel's denial, should prevail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even granting it to be true that, pursuant to
what is generally the practice and the rule, applications for retirement
annuities in the GSIS are sub¬≠ject to final approval by the General Manager
after its being approved by one of the Assistant General Manager‚Äôs and/or one
or two Department Managers,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
it is clear to Us that under the GSIS charter, the General Manager's approval
is not beyond review and reprobation by the Board of Trustees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be borne in mind that under Section
16 of said charter, the System "shall be managed by the Board of Trustees
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù and Section 17 adds that the Board "shall have the following powers
and authority:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) to adopt by-laws,
rules and regulations for the administration of the System and the transaction
of its business." On the other hand, the extent of the functions and
powers of the General Manager are defined in Section 18 as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 18. Personnel. - The Board shall
have the power to appoint a general manager, who shall be a person of
recognized experience and ca¬≠pacity in the subject of life and social
insurance, and who shall be the chief executive officer of the System, one or
more assistant general managers, one or more managers, a medical director, and
an actuary, and fix their compensation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The general manager shall, subject to the approval of the Board, appoint
additional personnel whenever and wherever they may be necessary to the effective
execution of the provisions of this Act, fix their compensation, remove,
suspend, or otherwise discipline them, for cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He shall have the power to prescribe their
duties, grant leave, prescribe certain qualifications to the end that only competent
persons may be employed, and appoint committees:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, <u>however</u>, That said
additional personnel shall be subject to existing Civil Service laws, rules and
regulations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is thus obvious that by express statutory autho¬≠rity, the
Board of Trustees directly manages the System and the General Manager is only
the chief executive offi¬≠cer of the Board.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the exercise of its power to adopt rules and regulations for the
administration of the Sys¬≠tem and the transaction of its business, the Board
may lodge in the General Manager the authority to act on any matter the Board
may deem proper, but in no wise can such conferment of authority be considered
as a full and complete delegation resulting in the diminution, much less
exhaustion, of the Board's own statutorily-based prerogative and responsibility
to manage the affairs of the System and, accordingly, to decide with finality
any matter affecting its transactions or business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, even if the Board may entrust
to the General Manager the power to give final approval to applications for
retirement annuities, the finality of such approval cannot be understood to
divest the Board, in appropriate cases and upon its attention being called to a
flaw, mistake or irregularity in the General Manager's action, of the authority
to exercise its power of supervision and control which flows naturally from the
ultimate and final responsibility for the proper management of the System
imposed upon it by the charter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Incidentally, it may be added that the force of this principle is even
more true insofar as the GSIS is concerned, for the fiduciary character of the
management of the System is rendered more strict by the fact that the funds
under its administration are partly contributed by the thousands upon thousands
of employees and workers in all the branches and instrumentalities of the
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is indeed well to
remember at all times that the System and, particularly, its funds do not
belong to the government, much less to any administration which may happen to
be temporarily on the saddle, and that the interests of the mass of its members
can only be duly safeguarded if the administrators of the System act with
utmost fidelity and care.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not for
nothing is its controlling and managing board called the Board of
Trustees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It results, therefore, that
the first contention of petitioner cannot be sustained and We hold that any
authority conferred upon the General Manager by the Board of Trustees
notwithstanding, the said Board may in appropriate cases and in the exercise of
its own sound discretion review the actions and decisions of the General
Manager.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere fact that the re¬≠solution
granting the authority expressly gives the character of finality to the General
Manager's acts does not constitute such a representation to third persons
dealing with the System that such finality is definite even <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span>
the Board as to create any <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, for the simple
reason that it is not legally possible for the Board to divest itself of an
authority which the charter of the System places under its direct
responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From another point of
view, since the law clearly vests the management in the Board and makes the
General Manager only its chief executive officer, all parties dealing with the
System must be deemed to be on guard regarding the ultimate authority of the
Board to modify or reverse any action of the General Manager and they cannot
complain should the Board exercise its powers in the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner posits, however, that even assuming that the Board may
have the power to reverse or modify any action of the General Manager in the
exercise of his authority, because of the failure of the Board to act from June
2, 1960, when General Manager <span class="SpellE">Andal</span> acted favorably
on his request to August 9, 1963, when the Board approved the herein impugned
Resolution No. 1497, or for more than three years, during which time
corresponding adjustments were made in his GSIS records, payment and life
insurance policies and due notices were served by the GSIS itself on all
parties concerned on the basis of his changed date of birth, respondent should
be considered as guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> or held in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> to change or alter the action of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Andal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
petitioner's posture is not entirely without logic, it falls short of the
requirements for the successful invocation of the pleas of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>
and <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have carefully considered the lengthy and rather impressive
discussion by petitioner of these points in his petition, memorandum and reply
to respondent's memorandum as well as the equally detailed and
authority-supported contrary arguments in the answer and memorandum of the
respondent, and We have arrived at the conclusion that petitioner's position
cannot be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be stated at the outset that petitioner's twin points of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> and <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> actually boil
down in this particular case to nothing more than <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
by silence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this clarification, it
is meet to recall that "mere innocent silence will not work <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There must
also be some element of turpitude or negligence con¬≠nected with the silence by
which another is misled to his injury" (Civil Code of the Philippines by <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Vol. IV, p. 600) and that "the doctrine of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> having its origin in equity and therefore being
based on moral and natural justice, its applicability to any particular case
depends, to a very large extent, upon the special circumstances of the
case." (<span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span> v. Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Tabaco</span>, 43 Phil. 610, 614) Important also it is not to
overlook that as regards the actuations of government officials, the general
rule is that their mistakes and omissions do not create <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Republic vs. Philippine Long Distance
Telephone Co., L-18841, January 27, 1969, citing Pineda vs. Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span>, 52 Phil. 803, 807; and <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> Consolidated Mining Co. vs. Pineda, 98 Phil. 711,
724. See also: Republic vs. Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc., L-26862, <st1:date month="3" day="30" year="1970">March 30, 1970</st1:date>, and the cases therein
cited.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, in computing the period of alleged silence or inaction
of the Board, what is relevant is not the actual or, what petitioner calls,
imputable knowledge of said Board of the favorable action of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Andal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if such
knowledge had come earlier than <st1:date month="5" day="6" year="1963">May 6,
 1963</st1:date>, the date of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Mathay's</span> letter,
what is decisive is that it was only thru Mr. <span class="SpellE">Mathay's</span>
letter that the Board got notice of the error in Mr. <span class="SpellE">Andal's</span>
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely be¬≠cause it was not
incumbent upon the Board, as petition¬≠er himself alleges, to spontaneously or
in the ordinary course review the action of the General Manager, any knowledge
thereof by the Board, whether actual or imputable, could not, in logic and
conscience, have placed the Board on notice of any error or irregularity
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the immediate
steps taken by the Board to have the facts alleged in Mr. <span class="SpellE">Mathay's</span>
letter verified are inconsistent with the charge of unreasonable delay, much
more of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The compulsory retirement of government officials and employees
upon their reaching the age of 65 years is<i> </i>founded on public policy
which aims by it to maintain efficiency in the government service and at the
same time give to the retiring public servants the opportunity to enjoy during
the remainder of their lives the recompense, inadequate perhaps for their long
service and devotion to the government, in the form of a comparatively easier
life, freed from the rigors of civil service discipline and the exacting
demands that the nature of their work and their relations with their superiors
as well as<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the public would impose upon
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say, therefore, the
officials charged with the duty of implementing this policy cannot be too
careful in insuring and safeguarding the correctness and integrity of the re¬≠cords
they prepare and keep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case, all
that the Board has done is to set aside what it found to be an erroneous
decision of the General Manager in approving the change of date of petitioner's
birth, because from the evidence before it, the Board was convinced that the
originally recorded date of birth should not be disturbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot see where the charged inequity of
such action of the Board could lie.</p>

<p class="BODY">Above all, it is a must consideration whenever principles of
equity are invoked that for such invocation to succeed, it must appear that if
the plea is not heeded, the party making the plea will suffer, in truth and in
fact, inequity and injury, whether pecuniary or moral or, at least, in a
juridical sense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is not the case
with petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Examining the
circumstances of this case, We see nothing <span class="SpellE">inequitous</span>
to petitioner in the questioned resolution of the Board of Trustees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For decades back, re¬≠peatedly and uniformly,
petitioner made it appear in all material government and public records and in
all his representations to respondent System that his date of birth is <st1:date month="1" day="14" year="1898">January 14, 1898</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His rather belated request for a change of
said date to January 14, 1900 which would unquestionably favor his interests, <span class="SpellE">pecuniarily</span> or otherwise, and correspondingly adversely
affect those of the System and, of course, its members, was duly investigated
and found not to be sufficiently grounded to merit favorable action by the
Legal Counsel in whom is lodged the authority to evaluate such request.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True this negative action was reversed by the
General Manager, albeit by virtue of a procedure not strictly in accordance
with the established one as outlined in footnote 1 of this opinion, but on the
other hand, the favorable action of the General Manager was in turn reversed by
the Board of Trustees, the final legal authority in the System, upon its being
informed of the error thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to
be noted that, after all, it was always the petitioner who made representations
to the respondent System as to his date of birth, and not the other way around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that the System did was to take his
representations for what they were worth.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was not believed by the Legal Counsel, but the General Manager did;
on the other hand, the authority higher than the General Manager found the
action of the General Manager erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under these circumstances, how could the System be in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, where the conflicting representations are of the
petitioner rather than of the System?</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent petitioner's contention that he was denied due process when
the Board of Trustees acted on the letter of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Mathay</span>
without notifying him thereof or hearing him thereon, suffice it to say that
since there is no showing that under the procedure established in the GSIS,
such notice and hearing are required, considering that the System operates as a
business corporation and generally notice and hearing are not indispensable for
due process in corporations, and in any event, inasmuch as what was considered
by the Board was nothing more than petitioner's own conflicting
representations, and if petitioner really believed he should have been heard,
he could have filed a motion for reconsideration or reopening, it cannot be
said that indeed he had not had due opportunity to pre¬≠sent his side.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, as regards petitioner's argument that the Board's
resolution in question constitutes an impairment of the obligations of his
contract of insurance, it is obvious that the constitutional injunction that is
evidently the basis of such argument refers to the legislature and not to
resolutions even of government corporations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, petitioner's life insurance policy, apart from not having any
real relevance in this case, what is involved being his retirement, contains
specific provisions contemplating the correction of any error or mistake in the
date of birth of the insured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, the retirement of government employees is imposed by law and is not
the result of any contractual stipulation.</p>

With respect to the procedure for approval of applications for retirement, the
Board of Trustees has from time to time approved the following resolutions:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">On </span><st1:date year="1952" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1952</st1:date>, Resolution No. 15 providing:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: 0.25in;">"In order
to expedite action on applications for retirement annuities, the Board resolved
to authorize the <u>Manager of the Administrative Department of the System to
process and approve such applications, subject to final approval of the General
Manager and Actuary</u>." (Emphasis supplied)</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0in;">2. On <st1:date year="1954" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1954</st1:date>, Resolution No. 145 as follows:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: 0.5in;">"2. <u>Retirement
Applications<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: 0.25in;">"Retirement
applications shall be approved by the General Manager, Administrative
Department, the Assistant General Manager, and the Associate Actuary and Acting
Manager, Production Department.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: 0.25in;">"In the
following cases, approval of the following officials shall also be required in
addition to those named hereinabove:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">a. No beneficiary or where there is
legal problem involved - By the Legal Officer.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">b. No premium payments - By the
Mana¬≠ger, Accounting Department."</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0in;">3. On <st1:date year="1954" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1954</st1:date>, Resolution No. 627 reading:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: 0.25in;">"Retirement
applications shall be approved by the 3 officials as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Manager, Claims Department, either one of the
Assistant General Managers, and either the Actuary or Associate Actuary.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: 0.25in;">"In the
following cases, approval of the following officials shall also be required <u>in
addition to those named hereinabove</u>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">a. No beneficiary or where there is
legal problem involved - By the Legal Officer.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">b. No premium payments - By the
Manager, Accounting Department."</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0in;">4. On <st1:date year="1957" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1957</st1:date>, Resolution No. 1591 thus:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: 0.25in;">"Where the
records show conflicting dates of birth of an applicant for retirement and no
birth or baptismal certificate can be submitted due to its loss or destruction,
the matter is referred to the Corporate Counsel of the System, together with
all secondary evidence in relation to the date of birth of the applicant. <u>The
Corporate Counsel in turn determines the correct date of birth, for purposes of
retirement and life insurance, after evaluating the relative evidentiary value
of the documents submitted</u>, in accordance with the Rules of Court."
(Underscoring Supplied)</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: 0.25in;">It is the theory
of petitioner that Resolutions Nos. 627 and 1591 must be understood as subject
to the condition in Resolution No. 15 that the approval of the other
subordinate managers or officials referred to therein must be approved by the
General Manager whose action shall be final. Respondents deny this, specially
as regards Resolution No. 1591 which they claim makes the Corporate Counsel of
the System the final authority on the matters therein mentioned, which include
controversies or discrepancies as to the date of birth of any applicant for
retirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court sees no necessity,
as stated in the above opinion, of passing on this secondary issue, the same
being subordinate, after all, to the main proposition that the General
Manager's decision is subject to the review and final action of the Board of
Trustees.</p>
