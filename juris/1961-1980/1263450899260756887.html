DAVID P. AVILA, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF COTABATO,

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">From the order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> dismissing its Criminal Case No. 4760 for lack <span style="">of </span>jurisdiction,
therein accused-appellant Antonio T. <span class="SpellE">Esperat</span> filed
the present petition <span style="">for </span>certiorari
and mandamus raising the issue of whether the courts of first instance have
appellate jurisdiction over grave coercion-cases tried and decided by the
municipal <span style="">or
city </span>courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 15, 1965, <span class="SpellE">Esperat</span>, then
Deputy Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> City, was charged
before the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> of the crime of
grave coercion (<span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No. 3911), allegedly <span style="">for having grabbed a certain <span class="SpellE">Zoe</span> Cordero by the waistline and, against the latter's
will, dragged him from the ramp of the <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> City
Air­port to the PAL terminal in said airport, on or about June 28, 1965.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Having been found guilty as charged and sentenced by the City
Court to imprisonment for one month and one day of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span>
<u><span style="">mayor</span></u><span style="">, </span>in its minimum period, and payment
of <span style="">a fine </span>of
P100.00, the ac­cused appealed <span style="">to the </span>Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> where the case was
docketed as Criminal Case No. 4760.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
prosecution, however, objected to the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of
First Instance, on the allegation that the offense of grave coercion <span style="">falls within the concurrent jurisdiction of
the Court of First Instance and the City Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, it argued that appeal from the de­cision of the latter
tribunal in such a case should be filed directly in the Court of Appeals, conformably
to section 87 of the Judiciary Act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sustaining this objection, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> issued the order of dismissal, dated March 25,
1966, now sub­ject of the present proceeding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue in this case, that is, whether or not the court of
first instance and the city or municipal courts have concurrent orig­inal
jurisdiction over grave coercion-cases, calls for a construction of sections
44(f) and 87(c) of the Judiciary Act of 1948 (Rep. Act 296), as amended.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 44(f), which has never been amended to date since the
enactment of the Judiciary Act of 1948,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Said section was amended by Republic Act 2613 (on August <span style="">19, 1959), by </span>enlarging the
jurisdiction exercised by the justices of the <span style="">peace and judges of municipal courts in </span>the capitals of provinces,
concurrently with the court of first instance, to cover offenses where the
penalty provided by law does not exceed <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner contends that
although under the original provision of section 87(b) of Republic </span>Act <span style="">296, as well as in Republic </span>Act 2613, <span style="">the original jurisdiction of </span>the
justices of <span style="">the peace and municipal
courts was</span><span style=""> confined </span><span style="">to cases
punishable by imprisonment for not more than six months, or a fine of not more
than P200.00 or both, this </span><span style="">jurisdiction was enlarged by Republic Act 3828 when
it was extended to cases where the penalty provided by law is imprisonment not
ex­ceeding 3 years or fine of not more, than P3,000.00, or both imprison­ment and
fine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since under the Revised Penal
Code, the crime of grave coercion, of which he was charged before and found
guilty by the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, is punishable
by <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span> <u>mayor</u> and a fine not ex­ceeding
P500.00, petitioner claims that the original jurisdiction of the said court is
exclusive, and the decision is, consequently, <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
to the Court of First Instance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fallacy in petitioner's argument lies in his failure to cons­ider
section 44(f) of the same Judiciary Act of 1948, in conjunction with its
section 87(c).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Note that notwithstanding
the various amend­ments received by section 87, section 44(f) remained
unaltered, there­by indicating the intention of the legislators to retain the
original jurisdiction of the court of first instance in certain cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the jurisdiction of the
municipal or city courts was enlarged in virtue of the amendment of section 87
(c), cannot be taken <span style="">as a </span>re­peal or withdrawal of the jurisdiction conferred on the
court of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only is
implied repeal disfavored by the law, but also, it is a cardinal principle that
<span style="">a </span>statute
must be so construed <span style="">as </span>to harmonize all apparent conflicts, and give effect to all
its provisions whenever possible.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Actually, there is nothing irreconcilable between sections 44(f)
and 87(c) of the Judiciary Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">As therein provided, the court of first instance was given
original jurisdiction over cases where the penalty prescribed by law is
imprisonment for <u>more than 6 months</u> or fine of <u>more than P200.00</u>;
the jus­tices of the peace and municipal or city courts of chartered cities,
over cases where the penalty is imprisonment for <u>not more than 3 years</u>, <span style="">and fine of <u>n</u></span><u><span style="">ot </span></u><u><span style="">more than P3,000.00</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, where the pre­scribed penalty
is imprisonment for more than 6 months, but not exceeding 3 years, or fine of
more than P200.00 but not exceeding P3,000.00,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the justice of the
peace or municipal court only has concurrent (and not exclusive) original
jurisdiction with the court of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, it may be stated that this concurrent juris­diction between the
inferior courts and the court of first instance was not provided for the first
time in Republic Act No. 3828.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
Republic Act 2613, crimes the penalties for which do not exceed 6 years, or fine
for not more than P3,000.00, were specifically placed within the jurisdiction
of the justice of the peace and municipal courts, concurrent with the court of
first instance.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It follows, therefore, that the <u>exclusive</u> original
jurisdiction of the justice of the peace and municipal courts is confined only
to cases where the prescribed penalty is imprisonment for <u>6 months or, less</u>
or fine of <u>P200.00 or less</u>, whereas, the <u>exclusive</u> original
jurisdiction of the court of first instance covers cases where the pe­nalty is
incarceration for more than 3 years (or 6 years in the case of city courts and
municipal courts in provincial capitals), or fine for more than P3,000.00 (or
P6,000.00 in proper cases), or both such imprisonment and fine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Between these exclusive jurisdictions lies a
zone where the jurisdiction is concurrent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is the proper construction to be placed on the provisions involved
herein, regard­less of what may have been the prior rulings on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to state, in an appropriate case
where the <span style="">jurisdiction </span>of the
justice of the peace, municipal or city court is concurrent with that of the
court of first instance, appeal from the decision of the former tribunal lies
directly to the Court of Appeals, or the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the crime of grave coercion is punishable with <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span><u> mayor </u>(imprisonment from one month
and one day to six months) and fine not exceeding P500.00, said offense comes
within the area of concurrent jurisdiction of municipal or city courts and
courts of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the
sentence of the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> con­victing
wherein <span style="">petitioner was in </span>fact <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the Court of Ap­peals and not to the Court of
First Instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">One last point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
foregoing pronouncement is made on the assumption that the proceedings in the <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> City Court <span style="">in
</span>which <span style="">petitioner was </span>convicted
have been regularly conducted and recorded <span style="">and the stenographic </span>notes have been taken of the testimony submit­ted
to the trial Court, for there is nothing <span style="">in </span>the records before us to show otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, should the evidence not have been
recorded (or transcribed) as required by the last part of section 87(c) of the
Judiciary law, then the trial of the criminal case would be an entire nullity,
as held <span style="">by </span>this Supreme Court in
<span class="SpellE"><u>Aquino</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Estenzo</span>,
et al</u>., G.R. No. L-20791, <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="5">May<span style=""> </span>29, 1965</st1:date>, for the reason
that "the Court of Appeals cannot review the findings of fact of the trial
Court if there is no record of the <span style="">evidence </span>taken during the trial of the
case."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such absence of recorded
evidence, the decision<span style=""> </span>of the
trial Court would be equally void and no question of propriety <span style="">or timeliness </span>of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> appeal could properly arise, there being <span style="">no <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> </span>de­cision.</p>
