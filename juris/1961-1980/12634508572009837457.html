				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">The individual
petitioners, now <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, were unlicensed crew
members employed in vessels owned and operated by respondent Adriano Chua Joy,
doing business under the name South Sea Shipping Lines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent United Seamen's </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style=""> of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> was the representative of the employees, and
had a collective bargaining agree­ment with the employer executed on </span><st1:date year="1957" day="28" month="6"><span style="">June 28,
 1957</span></st1:date><span style="">, to last for a
period of two years, which agreement contained a closed shop clause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners, while still members of
respondent union, affiliated with a rival organization, the General Maritime
Stevedores Union of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">As </span><span style="">members of the latter union they joined with
others in filing, on </span><st1:date year="1958" day="30" month="4"><span style="">April 30, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, a petition for certification </span>election
with the Court of Industrial Relations to deter­mine which of the two
organizations should represent the unlicensed crew members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In May 1958, upon being apprised of the
filing of said petition, the United Seamen's <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
demanded of the employer that the services of the peti­tioners be terminated,
allegedly pursuant to the terms of the closed shop agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Faced with the threat of expulsion, the
petitioners </span>went <span style="">to the Court of
First Instance of Manila for declara­tory relief with preliminary injunction,
specifically asking that the pertinent provision of the closed shop agreement </span><span style="">re</span>lied upon
by the respondents <span class="GramE">be</span> declared illegal and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court granted the injunction on <st1:date year="1958" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1958</st1:date>, directing the
respondents to "refrain from terminating the services of the petitioners
and ousting them from their lawful employments and positions as unlicensed
members of the crew of the vessels of the South Sea Shipping Lines."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1959</st1:date>,
after trial, the court granted the relief asked for in the petition and made
the injunction permanent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case came
up to this Court on appeal from that decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime the petition for certification election filed in
the Court of Industrial Relations was dismissed on the ground that there was
still an existing collective bargaining agreement with the United Seamen's <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An appeal was interposed from the order of
dismissal <span style="">(G. R. </span>No. <span class="GramE">L-14689) which this Court decided on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="26" month="7"><span class="GramE">July 26, 1960</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of that
decision this Court issued a reso­lution in the present case on <st1:date year="1967" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1967</st1:date>, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In L-19373 (Felix <span class="SpellE">Asejo</span>, et al. vs.
Adriano Chua Joy, etc. et al.) considering that in CIR Case No. 546-MC, later
numbered 547-MC, appealed to this Court and docketed <span style="">as </span><span style="">G. R. </span>No.
L-14689 (General Maritime Stevedores' Union, etc. vs. South Sea Ship­ping
Lines, et al.), this Court in its decision promulgated July 26, 1960, ordered
that a certification election be held to determine which of the <span style="">two </span>contending unions involved in this
case should be the proper bargaining representative of the employees of the
said shipping line; and considering further that such certification election
may have already rendered the issues in the instant case moot:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the parties are hereby required to show cause
within fifteen (15) days from receipt hereof why the petition should not be
dismissed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Both parties duly received notice of the resolution, but until
now have failed to show cause as directed therein.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is hereby dismissed, without
pronouncement as to costs.</p>
