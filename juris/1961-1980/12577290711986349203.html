				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These are petitions for a &nbsp;writ &nbsp;of certiorari filed on &nbsp;18 October 1960 and 7 November 1960 to review an amended judgment rendered on 30 January 1960 &nbsp;by the &nbsp;Court &nbsp; of Appeals (CA-G.R. No. 8114-R; Annex E-l) &nbsp;holding that Faustina &nbsp;Lauchang is &nbsp;entitled to &nbsp;acquire by purchase the whole of &nbsp;Lot No. &nbsp;10, Block &nbsp;2, &nbsp;of the Tambobong Estate. As the judgment sought to be &nbsp;reviewed deals with or includes &nbsp;petitioners &nbsp;in &nbsp;both cases &nbsp;but docketed separately, this &nbsp;Court will render an opinion and judgment on both. In this &nbsp;Court the petitioners in &nbsp;G.R. No. L-17598 assign two &nbsp;errors claimed to have &nbsp;been &nbsp;committed by &nbsp;the Court of Appeals, to wit: <blockquote> <p>(1) &nbsp;In applying1 the order of &nbsp;succession established in Santiago vs. Cruz (98 &nbsp;Phil., 168), promulgated December &nbsp;29, 1955, and in not finding that in the instant case there are good and &nbsp;compelling reasons &nbsp;to depart from said &nbsp;order of &nbsp; succession; &nbsp;and</p> <p>(2) &nbsp;In not &nbsp;declaring the appellants &nbsp;herein &nbsp;as &nbsp;having the preferential right to buy the portions they respectfully &nbsp;&nbsp;have been occupying &nbsp;and still do occupy for twenty (20) &nbsp;years, in the &nbsp;least, and thus in revoking by its second decision (Annex E to petition) the grant it made in its first decision in favor of herein &nbsp;petitioners.</p> </blockquote> <p>The petitioner in G.R. No. &nbsp;L-17694 assigns the following errors allegedly committed by the Court of Appeals:</p> <blockquote> <p>I. The Honorable Court of Appeals &nbsp;erred in &nbsp;rigidly and strictly applying to the instant &nbsp;case the order &nbsp;of preference &nbsp;enumerated In the cases of Fernando &nbsp; Santiago, et &nbsp;al., <span style="font-style: italic;">vs. </span>Realeza Cruz, et &nbsp;al., <span style="font-style: italic;">supra.</span></p> <p>II. The Hon. &nbsp;Court of &nbsp;Appeals &nbsp;erred in &nbsp;not &nbsp;holding that the order of preference, if ever there &nbsp;is such &nbsp;an order of preference, appearing in Section &nbsp;1 of Commonwealth Act No. 539, is not mandatory but merely presuasive and &nbsp;directory, &nbsp;add in &nbsp;not applying the doctrine laid down in the cases of Olimpio Gutierrez &nbsp;<i>vs</i>. Miguel Santos, et al., 107 Phil., &nbsp;419 and Pascual, et &nbsp;al.,<i> vs</i>. Lucas, 51 Off. Gaz. Nos. 5, 2429.</p> <p>III. The &nbsp;Honorable Court &nbsp;of Appeals erred in not holding that herein petitioner has &nbsp; preferential right to buy that 82 square meters lot because of compelling reason.</p> <p>IV. The &nbsp;Honorable Court &nbsp;of Appeals erred in not applying the Supreme Court decision in the cases of &nbsp;Marukot <i>vs.</i> Jaeinto, et al., 98 Phil., 123.</p> <p>V. The Honorable &nbsp;Court of Appeals &nbsp;erred in not applying the doctrine &nbsp;of &nbsp;exhaustion of &nbsp;administrative remedies.</p> </blockquote> <p>The findings of &nbsp;the Court of Appeals are, &nbsp;as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>"It appears that Lot No. 10, Block No. 2 of &nbsp;the Tambobong Estate in the Municipality of Malabon, Province of Rizal, Phlippine Islands, was formerly leased &nbsp;by the &nbsp;Archbishop of &nbsp;Manila to &nbsp;one &nbsp;Matea Suarez. &nbsp;The lot contains &nbsp;an aggregate area of 480 meters.</p> <p>On September 11, 1906, &nbsp;Matea Suarez sold her leasehold interest in the land for the &nbsp;sum of P20O.0O to Anacleto Lauchang, father of &nbsp;the &nbsp; plaintiff-appellee &nbsp;and &nbsp;appellant &nbsp;Faustina &nbsp;Lauchang. When Anacleto died &nbsp;in &nbsp;1923, &nbsp;his daughter, the &nbsp;plaintiff, took over and since then has been &nbsp;occupying &nbsp;said property paying rents therefor to the Roman Catholic Archbishop &nbsp;of Manila &nbsp;up to &nbsp;August 31, 1927 when further payment of rents was suspended because the Archbishop of Manila sold &nbsp;the Tambobong Estate &nbsp;to the Government &nbsp;of the &nbsp; Commonwealth of the &nbsp;Philippines.</p> <p>The &nbsp;evidence &nbsp;further &nbsp;shows &nbsp;that &nbsp;&nbsp;Asuncion Hizon &nbsp;had been occupying &nbsp;82 square &nbsp;meters &nbsp;of the lot in question &nbsp;in &nbsp;the north-western portion since 1929; &nbsp;Jaeinto Tiangco, 91 square meters &nbsp;in the &nbsp;southwestern &nbsp;portion since 1938; and &nbsp;Jose Lazaro, &nbsp;113 square meters &nbsp;in &nbsp;the northeastern &nbsp;portion since &nbsp;1940. &nbsp;Plaintiff &nbsp; appellee and appellant is occupying the southwestern part of the lot containing an area of 194 &nbsp;square meters. &nbsp;All of the &nbsp;claimants-occupants have their respective &nbsp;houses on the lot in question.</p> <p>We entertain no doubt &nbsp;that Asuncion &nbsp;Hizon is a sub-lessee &nbsp;of Faustina Lauchang, the &nbsp;plaintiff (Exhs. D-2 and D-3). The finding of the &nbsp;trial court &nbsp;in this &nbsp;regard is correct.</p> <p>With respect to Jacinto, the evidence shows that at first &nbsp;he used to pay Faustina Lauchang P1.00 per month until he connected plain- tiff's water pipe with his main water pipe in the middle of the year 1938. &nbsp;Since &nbsp;then Tiangco has not been paying any rental to the plaintiff.</p> <p>As to Jose Lazaro, his testimony is to the effect &nbsp;that he had been occupying the portion of 113 square meters &nbsp;upon an annual &nbsp;rent of P12.00.</p> <p>We cannot give credence to plaintiff's testimony that &nbsp;she merely tolerated the stay of Hizon, Tiangco and Lazaro out of &nbsp;charity for she is not in a position so to act. &nbsp;We conclude that all of the three are &nbsp;sub-lessees of the plaintiff Faustina Lauchang, Now, under the law &nbsp;do the parties &nbsp;before us &nbsp;have preferential rights to &nbsp;purchase the portion which they respectively occupy?</p> <p align="CENTER">* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>* &nbsp;* * Subsequent &nbsp;study has revealed that both awards &nbsp;are &nbsp;violative of &nbsp;the legislative intent and the &nbsp;decision &nbsp;of our Honorable Court in &nbsp;the case of Fernando &nbsp;Santiago, &nbsp;et al., &nbsp;<i>vs</i>. Realeza Cruz, et al., G.R. Nos. L-8271-8272, promulgated on &nbsp;December 29, &nbsp;1955, which case is &nbsp;on all fours with &nbsp;the &nbsp; instant case.</p> <p align="CENTER">* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>And, in the case of Santiago, et al., <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Realeza Cruz, et al., supra, our &nbsp;Hon. Supreme &nbsp;Court said: </p> <p>"The lots &nbsp;herein litigated &nbsp;are &nbsp;portions of the &nbsp;Tambobong Estate &nbsp;situated in the municipality of &nbsp;Malabon, &nbsp;province of Rizal. &nbsp;They &nbsp;were &nbsp;originally &nbsp;leased &nbsp;to Mrs. &nbsp;Elisa E. Cayco up to January &nbsp;14, 1944 when, for valuable &nbsp;consideration, she sold her leasehold &nbsp;rights over the lots &nbsp;to Realeza Cruz. Prior to &nbsp;this &nbsp;transfer &nbsp;Fernando &nbsp;Santiago &nbsp;already had his house erected on a portion of Lot No. 1, Block No. &nbsp;19, while Francisco Samonte had &nbsp;his &nbsp; house erected on another portion of Lot 19, Block &nbsp;No. 16, &nbsp;and both were sub-lessees &nbsp; of &nbsp;Mrs. &nbsp;Cayco to whom they had been paying nominal rentals. &nbsp;&nbsp;After the transfer, both sub-lessees kept on paying the rentals to Realeza Cruz, except Fernando Santiago who stopped paying when the Government acquired &nbsp;the &nbsp;Tambobong &nbsp;Estate.<br> </p> <p align="CENTER">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>&nbsp;The next &nbsp;question to be determined &nbsp;refers &nbsp;to the preference that &nbsp;should be &nbsp;observed in the allocation &nbsp;of the lots in dispute among &nbsp;their different &nbsp; claimants &nbsp;which &nbsp;constitutes &nbsp;the &nbsp;root cause of the present controversy. &nbsp; In approaching this &nbsp;problem the first thing &nbsp;to &nbsp;be &nbsp;considered &nbsp;is &nbsp; the meaning and &nbsp;scope of the law &nbsp;which &nbsp;governs the administration &nbsp;and &nbsp; disposition &nbsp;of the Tambobong Estate in favor of those whom the law contemplates to extend its beneficent provisions. &nbsp;This law is Commonwealth Act No. 539. Section 1 of this Act provides that the home lots &nbsp;into which the &nbsp;lands acquired thereunder are to &nbsp;be subdivided &nbsp;to promote its objective shall be resold at reasonable prices &nbsp;and under &nbsp;such &nbsp; terms and conditions as &nbsp;may &nbsp;be fixed 'to &nbsp;their <span style="font-style: italic;">bona fide </span>&nbsp;tenants &nbsp;or &nbsp;occupants &nbsp;or &nbsp;private &nbsp;individuals who will work the &nbsp;lands themselves and who are &nbsp;qualified &nbsp;to acquire and own lands &nbsp;in the Philippines. <i>An analysis of this provision would at &nbsp;once reveal that the intendment &nbsp;of the law is to award the lots to &nbsp;those who &nbsp;may apply in the &nbsp;order mentioned. &nbsp;This enumeration denotes the preferential &nbsp;rights the law wishes to accord to them. &nbsp;Thus, &nbsp;the first choice &nbsp; is given to the &nbsp;bona fide 'tenants', the second to the &nbsp;'occupants' and the last to 'private &nbsp;individuals'. And this enumeration &nbsp;undoubtedly has been adopted considering the existing &nbsp;social problem and the different situations &nbsp;in which &nbsp;the &nbsp; claimants may be &nbsp;found.</i> This is the &nbsp;order &nbsp;of preference &nbsp;followed by the &nbsp;Director &nbsp;of Lands &nbsp;in awarding &nbsp;the &nbsp;lots to appellant whose status as a <i>bona fide</i> tenant is not disputed, and since this action is in accordance with the intendment and purpose of the law, &nbsp;we see no plausible reason for disturbing it as we are now urged by the appellees. </p> <p>The &nbsp;foregoing interpretation &nbsp;is further justified &nbsp;by &nbsp;a comparison of &nbsp;the &nbsp;provisions of Commonwealth Act No. &nbsp;539, under which &nbsp;the &nbsp;Tambobong &nbsp;Estate was &nbsp;acquired, with those &nbsp;of Commonwealth Act No. 20, which provided &nbsp;for &nbsp;the resale &nbsp;of home sites acquired thereunder &nbsp;at the time &nbsp; of the approval &nbsp;of the former Act. &nbsp;Note &nbsp;that while under &nbsp;Commonwealth &nbsp; Act No. 20 the &nbsp;home lots are to be resold only to <i>bona fide</i> occupants, the Act &nbsp; that had &nbsp;superseded it, &nbsp;Commonwealth &nbsp;Act No. &nbsp;539, modified &nbsp;this provision &nbsp;by &nbsp;providing &nbsp;three &nbsp;groups &nbsp;of &nbsp;persons who may purchase &nbsp;the &nbsp;lots is &nbsp;indicative of &nbsp;the clear intent &nbsp;of Congress with regard to the preferential rights &nbsp;to be &nbsp;accorded to tenants, &nbsp;occupants and private individuals." &nbsp;(Italic supplied.)</p> <p align="CENTER">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>IN&nbsp; VIEW OF&nbsp; ALL&nbsp; THE FOREGOING, we find ourselves constrained to modify &nbsp;the &nbsp; decision &nbsp;appealed &nbsp;from &nbsp;by &nbsp;(1) &nbsp;declaring plaintiff-appellee and appellant Faustina Lauchang to have the &nbsp;preferential right &nbsp;to buy the whole &nbsp;of Lot No. 10 &nbsp;of Black &nbsp;No. &nbsp;2 of the Tambobong Estate &nbsp;and &nbsp;(2) ordering the &nbsp;Division &nbsp;of Landed &nbsp;Estates of the Bureau &nbsp;of Lands, successor of the &nbsp; Rural Progress Administration which was abolished by Executive &nbsp;Order No. &nbsp;376, the Land Tenure Administration, or &nbsp;the agency or &nbsp;instrumentality &nbsp;of the Government concerned &nbsp;to sell said lot to her." </p> </blockquote> <p>The question raised by the parties was correctly decided by the Court of Appeals in its amended decision or judgment sought to be reviewed wherein the pertinent parts of the opinion of this &nbsp;Court rendered in Santiago, et al., <i>vs. </i> Cruz, et al., supra are quoted.</p> <p>The proposition advanced &nbsp;by the petitioners that this Court should depart from the strict application of the order of preference laid down in the cases decided by it can not be sustained, because unlike in this case &nbsp;where &nbsp;the &nbsp;respondent owns no &nbsp;other realty &nbsp;except an &nbsp;inchoate right over the lot in litigation, &nbsp;in the case of &nbsp;Gutierrez &nbsp;<i>vs</i>. Santos, supra the lessee had four (4) &nbsp; lots the total area of which was 3,279 square meters, &nbsp;aside from the then litigated lot, which was &nbsp;more than sufficient to answer for the needs of the lessee and his family. &nbsp; Furthermore, the 480 square meters lot being inadequate for the needs of an already growing family &nbsp;of the &nbsp;respondent (consisting of 7 children &nbsp;all of &nbsp;age and 7 grandchildren), &nbsp;petitioners Lazaro and Tiangco bought or became co-owners of lots in Malabon, Rizal, as evidenced by TCT &nbsp;No. 58148 and 61615, issued by the Register &nbsp;of Deeds in and for &nbsp; the province of Rizal.</p> <p>The contention of the petitioners that the action brought in the &nbsp; Court of First Instance of Rizal (Civil Case No. 911) &nbsp;should have &nbsp;been dismissed for &nbsp;lack of cause of action, in view of &nbsp;respondent's failure to exhaust &nbsp;all &nbsp; administrative remedies is untenable. &nbsp;&nbsp;It is well to recall that the &nbsp;lot, subject of &nbsp;the litigation, is not a part of the public domain, but of private ownership acquired &nbsp;by &nbsp;the Government &nbsp;for &nbsp;resale to private persons, and for &nbsp;that reason any aggrieved party &nbsp;may bring an &nbsp;action in court without the need of exhausting all administrative remedies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </p> <p>The amended decision or judgment under review is affirmed, without pronouncement &nbsp;as &nbsp;to costs.</p> <p><i>Bengzon, C.
