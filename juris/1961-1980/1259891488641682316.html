				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner seeks Philippine citizenship in a petition filed before the Court 
of First Instance of Camarines Sur. His petition is supported by character 
witnesses Jose P. Rodriguez, Mayor of Goa, Camarines Sur, and Teofilo B. Padua, 
a merchant and proprietor. After presenting his evidence, testimonial as well as 
documentary, the court found him to possess all the qualifications and none of 
the disqualifications prescribed by law and, accordingly, ordered that he be 
issued a certificate of naturalization. The government has appealed.
<p>In its appeal, the government disputes the finding of the trial court that 
petitioner has all the qualifications prescribed by law for it contends that, as 
the record shows, he has a child, named Betty, who was born on May 28, 1948, and 
as such already of school age long before he sought to become a Filipino 
citizen, and yet he has not sent her to any school recognized by our government 
as required by our law. It appears, however, that Betty has not attended school 
because she is a deaf-mute. This appears in a corrected copy of the transcript 
of the notes submitted by the official stenographer of the court. This also 
appears in the decision of the trial court. Considering tliat petitioner is 
residing in a place where there is no school for deaf and mute children, such 
failure may be considered justified.</p>
<p>Another contention of the government is that the school where petitioner 
placed his other child of school age, named William, is not recognized by the 
Office of Private Education, and so he should be deemed also to have failed to 
comply with the law regarding educational requirement. In tins respect we find 
that the record, as corrected, shows that the school referred to, which is the 
Anglo-Chinese School, is one recognized by the Office of Private Education, and 
so the contention of the government is also devoid of merit.</p>
<p>We notice, however, that while the school adverted to is recognized by the 
Ofiice of Private Education it does not appear that it is one where Philippine 
history, government and civics are taught or prescribed as part of ita 
curriculum, as required by section 2, paragraph 6, of Commonwealth Act No. 473. 
This is a requirement that must be duly established, and since petitioner has 
failed to do so, he should be deemed to have failed to comply with this 
educational requirement. Moreover, it appears that said school is denominated 
"Anglo-Chinese School" which conveys the impression that it is a school 
exclusively open to foreigners. If this surmise is correct it would appear that 
petitioner has chosen to place his child in a school not run by Filipinos but in 
one where those studying therein are not associated with Filipino children. This 
affects the sincerity of his intention to become a Filipino citizen.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed, with costs against 
petitioner.</p><em>Bengzon, Acting C.J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, 
J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes,</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.,</em> concur.</div>
