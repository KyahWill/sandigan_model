<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Direct appeal from a judgment on 
the merits of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, 
in its Civil Case No. 1694, dismissing the amended and supplementary complaints 
for <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> and for over P600,000 in 
damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The parties in this case are both 
producers and exporters of logs and hold separate but adjacent forest 
concessions which are located in the municipalities of <span class="SpellE">Parang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pigcawayan</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Nuling</span> </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">province</span></st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Cotabato</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. Parcel No. II of the 
plaintiff-appellant's ordinary timber license No. 325-59 adjoins that of 
defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> ordinary timber license No. 
201-57, their common boundary line running from south to north, along which are 
points and corners corresponding to the technical description in each license 
which have, as their common reference survey, the forest zone corner indicated 
in the control map of the Bureau of Forestry known as Land Classification Map 
No. 1809. No visible boundary, however, exist on the 
ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On the first cause of action, 
which refers to a logging operation by the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in 1958 somewhere along the aforesaid border, both 
the litigating companies claim that the logging took place within its respective 
licensed area.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="2" day="11" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">11 
February 1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Timberland Company, Inc., brought the matter to the 
attention of the district forestry office and requested for a verification. Upon 
receipt of the said complaint, the assistant district forester, <span class="SpellE">Ebad</span> <span class="SpellE">Ulangkaya</span>, personally 
inspected the area, and found the <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> Lumber 
Company, Inc., logging thereon; but <span class="GramE">Nothing</span> definite 
was established. To whom the logging pertained remained 
undecided.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After several months' delay, 
characterized by many communications to forestry officials, including the 
director, urging prompt action, intra-office correspondence on the complaint, 
particularly on the designation of the forestry personnel to undertake an 
investigation, and when chosen, the postponements at the behest of the 
defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, forester <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> Tobias, at last authorized and made a survey of the 
common boundary of the concession and inventoried the stumps found in the course 
thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After establishing on the ground 
a one-meter wide cut of the underbrush of what Tobias believed to be the 
boundary line, he identified, counted, and measured the stumps (561 in number, 
fully located in his sketch) and computed the volume of logs that were taken, 
based on a standard table for the species of trees cut.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On the second cause of action, 
the plaintiff-appellant prays for damages in the total amount of P57,381.60, 
representing the commercial value of 756.17 cubic meters of logs (stated in the 
amended complaint) and 496.43 cubic meters (stated in the supplementary 
complaint), or for their delivery. These logs were allegedly taken by the 
defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in a second encroachment within the 
aforesaid Parcel No. II, from November, 1959 to February, 
1960.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">About one-third 
of the western portion of this Parcel No.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> II is occupied by many <span class="SpellE">Edcor</span> settlers. To reach one of its timber concessions, the 
<span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> Lumber Company started in November, 1959 the 
construction of a road, at the request of the settlers, and then continued it in 
an easterly direction beyond the settlement and traversing entirely the said 
Parcel No. II, without, however, notifying the licensee, the <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Timberland Company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> Lumber Company had requested for the road 
right-of-way from the District Forester, Samuel <span class="SpellE">Fortich</span>, on </span><st1:date month="5" day="23" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">23 May 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and 
on </span><st1:date month="12" day="21" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">21 December 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. It 
knew that the road had to pass through a licensed area. The said official 
authorized, on </span><st1:date month="1" day="15" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">15 January 
1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
road construction, including the hauling of logs already cut, but limiting the 
cutting of more trees along the surveyed road right-of-way. Then, over the 
protests of the appellant-licensee, and without the hearing which it had 
requested, the Director of Forestry, on </span><st1:date month="2" day="17" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">17 February 
1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
granted the right-of-way permit tinder the condition that the grantee shall turn 
over all trees cut along the approved right-of-way to the <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Timberland Company, unless it is not ready to 
receive them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> admits having hauled and removed 600,000 board feet 
of timber from along the road.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The answer filed by the <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> Lumber Co., Inc. denied the alleged invasion of the 
lumber concession of the plaintiff, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> 
Timberland Co., Inc., and pleaded that the trees cut along the common boundary 
claimed by the latter were within the forest concession of defendant; and that 
the cutting of logs in 1950-1960, alleged in the complaint's second cause of 
action, was done by defendant with proper authorization from the corresponding 
administrative authorities. Defendant <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> further 
counter-claimed for damages and attorneys' fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After requisite trial, the Court 
of First Instance found the complaint unsupported by evidence, and consonantly 
dismissed the original action as well as the counterclaim; whereupon, plaintiff 
<span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Timberland Company appealed directly to this 
Court in view of the amount involved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Our review of the evidence on 
record compels us to agree with the trial court that the resurvey of the common 
boundary by Forester <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> Tobias, Jr., was not 
accurate, and in fact it was disapproved by the Bureau of Forestry authorities 
(Exhibits "10" and "10-A"). The result is that the inventory of stumps and 
computation of logs taken <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, <span class="SpellE">coetaneously</span> made by the aforesaid forester, does not 
furnish adequate support for the damages claimed by plaintiff-appellant 
company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We can not close our eyes to the 
fact that the boundary resurvey by Forester Tobias, upon which appellant rests 
its case, started at the junction of the Big <span class="SpellE">Patot</span> 
Creek and Small <span class="SpellE">Patot</span> Creek as Corner No. 6 of the 
<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> timber license No. 201-57; but Corner No. 6 
is identical to Corner No. 43 of Land Classification Map No. 1809 (Exhibit 
"D-3-a"), which is a <span class="SpellE">Pls</span> concrete monument. From this 
indefinite junction of creeks, he proceeded to Corner No. 7, which, according to 
him, was indicated by a "<span class="SpellE">mayapis</span>" tree, but which, on 
the map, is, and should be, a <span class="SpellE">Pls</span> monument. Along the 
zigzagging line from Corner No. 42 to 18 of the said control map, which 
correspond with, or are identical to, specified points in the timber license, 
are 25 other <span class="SpellE">Pls</span> monuments, and, therefore, known 
points on the ground, yet Tobias failed to hit any one of 
them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It would seem unnecessary to 
stress that the duty of Tobias, in making his resurvey, was to follow as closely 
as possible the footsteps of the original surveyor who located and placed the 
<span class="SpellE">Pls</span> monuments in the corners of the original line. It 
is an established rule that in regard to boundaries "monuments control courses 
and distances as well as the calculated area" (<span class="SpellE">Gov't</span>. 
of P. I. vs. <span class="SpellE">Abad</span>, 47 Phil. 573; <span class="SpellE">Higuera</span> vs. U.S., 18 Law Ed. (US) 469; <span class="SpellE">Cornelison</span> vs. Hammond, 224, N.C. 757, 32 S.E. 2d, 326), and 
in the course of his resurvey Tobias relied almost exclusively on courses and 
distances.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The appellant claims that the 
computations of Tobias should prevail over the monuments because the latter 
could be moved. But there is no evidence that the location of the <span class="SpellE">PLs</span> monuments indicated in the control map has been changed. 
And as the interference with, or removal of land survey monuments is made a 
criminal act, and penalized by statute (Adm. Code, Act 2711, sec. 2753), such 
removal or alteration is not to be assumed without adequate evidentiary support, 
which, in the present case, does not exist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It may be added that if 
plaintiff-appellant believed that the Tobias resurvey of the common boundary of 
its timber concession and that of the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was erroneously or improperly refused confirmation 
by the officials of the Bureau of Forestry, it could have had their action 
reviewed and corrected by the Department Secretary. As it failed to take steps 
to do so, the rejection of the Tobias report is final against appellant <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Timberland Co., Inc., and its case can not be built 
thereon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The plaintiff-appellant, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Timberland Company, Inc., stands on a more solid 
ground in its second cause of action. It is not seriously <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> that, as previously narrated, the defendant, 
<span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> Lumber Co., Inc., entered and started 
building a road across Parcel II of plaintiff's concession on November 1959, 
continued it entirely across the said parcel, and subsequently cut, hauled, and 
removed around 600,000 board feet of timber along the road, besides using it for 
hauling its own forest products. <span class="GramE">All of this was done without 
previous notice" to the licensee of the area, plaintiff-appellant <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Timberland Company.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">That this intrusion by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> Lumber Company, 
was illegal is self-evident. <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> sought to excuse 
its depredations, relying on the authorization it secured from District Forester 
Samuel <span class="SpellE">Fortich</span> on </span><st1:date month="1" day="15" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">15 January 
1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> to 
build the road, and an alleged request of the settlers, through the <span class="SpellE">Edcor</span> area on the western side of appellant's Parcel II. The 
Court of First Instance upheld this defense and exonerated defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> from liability. Plainly this was error. The request 
of the <span class="SpellE">Edcor</span> settlers and administrators did not 
constitute valid authority for <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> upon the 
territory of another licensee without its previous knowledge and consent; nor 
was this invasion validated by the District Forester's permit, since the latter 
was secured only on January, 1960, months after the defendant's illegal 
entry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is true that, over protests of 
appellant, the Director of Forestry, on </span><st1:date month="2" day="17" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">17 February 
1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
granted <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> a right-of-way permit, subject to the 
condition that the grantee would turn over all trees cut along the right-of-way, 
to the <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Timberland Company, unless the latter 
was not ready to receive them. But this grant of right-of-way obtained when the 
road was nearly completed, like that of District Forester <span class="SpellE">Fortich</span>, could in no way cure the prior unauthorized entry, 
<span class="SpellE">roadbuilding</span>, and removal of logs inside <span class="SpellE">Cotabato's</span> timber concession. Nothing in the permit 
indicates that it was intended to have such retroactive 
effect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The law is clear that— 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Where a license is issued for 
the taking of forest products and a person other than the license unlawfully 
enters or operates without license in the territory covered thereby and cuts, 
gathers or removes any forest products contrary to the terms of said license, or 
attempts to remove any products so cut or gathered, the same may he seized and 
delivered to the proper licensee, upon the payment of the regular charges 
thereon, free from any claim on the part of the offended person. * * *" (Sec. 
1837, Rev. Adm. Code)<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Considering the quoted legal 
provision and the condition imposed by the Director of Forestry that logs cut 
along the right-of-way authorized .should be turned over to the rightful 
concessionaire, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Timberland Company, the 
liability of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> for the value of an said 
logo, which it did <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">not</span></em> so 
turn over, is beyond question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Referring to the logs that were 
taken inside the <span class="SpellE">Edcor</span> settlement, which is also 
inside the concession in question, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> claims 
that the appellant has no right to them because the farm lot owners have been 
issued homestead titles; and under the appellant's license, it is not allowed to 
gather forest products on private lands without express authority. This argument 
is untenable because the condition in the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> 
road right-of-way permit from the Bureau of Forestry obligates the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to turn over the logs to the appellant, and the 
permit did not exempt the logs that were taken inside the <span class="SpellE">Edcor</span> settlement. Note that the appellant's license preceded 
the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> permit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The court <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">a quo</span></em> found that the 
plaintiff-appellant was not entitled to the trees cut along the approved road 
because it was not ready to receive them for lack of a road of its own. We 
disagree. Lack of a road does not necessarily connote <span class="SpellE">unpreparedness</span> to receive the logs; and, even assuming that 
the appellant was unprepared, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> certainly 
contributed thereto by cutting and hauling logs within a licensed area without 
previously notifying the license of its operation and without having offered to 
deliver or turn over the logs. The lack of a road does not exclude other 
possibilities or remedies that the appellant, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> 
Timberland Company, could have taken in order to receive, remove, or dispose of 
the logs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">That the plaintiff-appellant 
herein was justified in seeking judicial relief without further ado is 
emphasized by the circumstances of the case. The defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, when told to stop by forestry officials in the 
field, refused to obey; it continued its road construction and hauling of logs 
although it did not have the proper permit to construct, <span class="GramE">nor</span> the proper license to gather forest products in the area. 
Neither the Director of Forestry nor the Department Head could have given relief 
to the appellant because the Director authorized, on 22 January 1960 (the 
Present case was filed on 9 February 1960), the release of the 600,000 board 
feet of timber to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> on a measly bond of 
P7,200.00 to answer for damages to the licensee. <span class="GramE">And upon the 
release of the logs, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> no time in exporting 
them to </span></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Japan</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 'hereby 
terminating these officials' administrative control over the disputed lots and 
rendering futile further administrative processes, including an 
appeal.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The failure of a litigant to 
exhaust his administrative remedies does not bar an action for damages where the 
circumstances of the case are such that he is excused from exhausting such 
remedies, as where the exhaustion of administrative remedies would be completely 
futile and meaningless." (73 CJS 359)<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Of the 600,000 board feet 
released to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> Lumber Company, the plaintiff-appellant admitted 
receipt of 169.68 cubic meters (Exhibit "O"; <span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>. p. 
355) and 38.66 cubic meters (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>., p. 665), or a total 
of 208.34 cubic meters, which is equivalent to 88.3336.16 board feet of timber. 
What has not been turned over, <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, amounts to 
551,663.84 board feet, which commands an export value in the sum of P61,399.66, 
at the price of P120.00 per thousand board feet (Exhibit 
"O").<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The original unauthorized 
intrusion of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> Lumber Company into the land covered by the license 
of appellant was aggravated by <span class="SpellE">Plaridel's</span> subsequent 
defiance of the forestry officers that vainly sought to stop it from 
constructing its road and bar it from committing further acts on dispossession 
(L-1) pending approval of its right-of-way application; and the record reveals a 
deplorable tendency on the part of said defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to further its economic interest in utter disregard 
of the rights of other licensees. This rebellious disregard of administrative 
authority and reckless pretermission of appellant's rights are incompatible with 
a healthy respect for the rule of law. If <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> 
believed that the acts of the forestry officials were unjust or illegal, it 
should have availed of the corresponding administrative and judicial remedies, 
instead of taking the law in its hands and recording to forcible defiance of the 
orders received. In our opinion, to discourage repetition of such brave conduct, 
an award is required of exemplary damages, under section 5, chapter 3, Book IV, 
of our new Civil Code, in the amount of P10,000.00 over and above the value of 
the logs to be paid by said defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to 
plaintiff-appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">And because appellant was forced 
by <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> conduct to institute court proceedings 
to protect itself, in view of <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> Lumber 
Company's open defiance of its rights and of the orders of administrative 
officials, the defendant company should be sentenced further to pay attorney's 
fees to the plaintiff-appellant in the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> 
(Article 2208, pars. 1, 2 and 11, Civil Code).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision appealed from is 
reversed, and the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> Lumber Company, Inc., is sentenced to pay to the 
appellant <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Lumber Company, Inc., the sum of 
P61,399.66 as compensatory damages, plus P10,000.00 exemplary damages, and, in

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellee</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> Lumber Co., Inc. has moved to reconsider our 
decision of February 26, 1965, on the ground that the damages awarded to 
appellant <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Timberland Co., Inc., are excessive 
in that the cost of production of the 551,663.84 board feet that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> failed to turn over to appellant should be deducted 
from the export price. Otherwise, it is claimed, appellant would be unjustly 
enriched.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The motion is without merit, for 
the following reasons:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">1. The right of way permit issued 
to <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> by the forestry authorities provides for 
the turn over of the logs cut to <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Timberland 
Co., Inc., subject to only one condition: that it is ready to receive them. Said 
permit does not provide for the deduction of the cost of 
production.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">2. The law expressly frees the 
offended licensee from any claim (which should include the cost of production) 
when forest products which have been unlawfully gathered from his licensed area 
are seized and delivered to him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Where a license is issued for 
the taking of forest products and a person other than the licensee unlawfully 
enters or operates without license in the territory covered thereby and cuts, 
gathers, or removes any forest products contrary to the terms of said license, 
or attempts to remove any products so cut or gathered, the same may be seized 
and delivered to the proper licensee, upon the payment of the regular charges 
thereon, free from any claim on the part of the offended person. <span class="GramE">* * * (Sec. 1837, Rev. Adm. Code).</span> (Italics supplied: quoted 
on p. 8, main decision)<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">3. There is no evidence on either 
the cost of the road construction or the cost of production of the logs. In 
fact, the log-production was but a consequence of <span class="SpellE">Plaridel's</span> road-building.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">4. It would be <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span>, not <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cotabato</span></span><span class="GramE">, that</span> would be 
unjustly enriched if cost of production, if any, is deducted from the 
compensatory damages because <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> would have built 
its road to the double prejudice of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>: (a) the 
invasion of its licensed area; (b) with <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> 
bearing the expenses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the motion to reconsider is 
denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
