				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal to the Court of Appeals but certified to the Supreme Court
as a case involving questions purely of law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This appeal was interposed against a decision of the Court of First
Instance of Manila, in its Civil Case No. 39025, denying a petition for prohibition
against the herein respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, Commissioner
of Immigration, for ordering the deportation of herein petitioner-appellant Lam
<span class="SpellE">Sok</span> <span class="SpellE">Kam</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was submitted for decision before the trial court upon a
stipulation of facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In resume, these facts
are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On 21 January 1958, petitioner-appellant Lam <span class="SpellE">Sok</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kam</span>, a Portuguese woman, filed with the Philippine
consulate general in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> a non­-immigrant
application for passport visa for the Philippines, "for the purpose of
visiting a friend" and "to remain in the Philippines for a period of
30 days", according to her applications.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She also therein stated that she was married to one Tan <span class="SpellE">Pio</span>, a resident of <st1:place>Macau</st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">She arrived in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on <st1:date year="1958" day="19" month="4">19 April 1958</st1:date> and was
admitted as a temporary visitor for a limited stay up to <st1:date year="1958" day="18" month="5">18 May 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1958" day="7" month="5">7 May 1958</st1:date>, she
petitioned for, and was granted, an extension of her temporary stay up to <st1:date year="1958" day="17" month="11">17 November 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1958" day="17" month="10">17
 October 1958</st1:date>, however, she married one Jose Yap Joaquin, a Filipino
citizen, in a wedding solemnized by the Justice of the Peace of <span class="SpellE">Siniloan</span>, Laguna.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Four (4) days after the marriage, she applied for the cancellation of
her alien registry on the ground of having acquired Philippine citizen­ship by
reason of her marriage to Joaquin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
application was granted in an order, dated <st1:date year="1958" day="21" month="10">21 October 1958</st1:date>, by Associate Commissioner of Immigration
Francisco de la Rosa, and she was issued an identification certificate
recognizing her as a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon further investigation, however, Immigration Commissioner
Emilio L. <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> discovered that Lam <span class="SpellE">Sok</span> <span class="SpellE">Kam</span> was not a divorcee, as
she had stated in her marriage contract with Joaquin, because the document of
divorce by mutual consent that she had presented was defective and irregular on
its face and, therefore, she had no right to contract another marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commissioner sought the opinion of the
consul of Portugal on the force and validity of a "<span class="SpellE">Divorcio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Por</span> Muto <span class="SpellE">Consentimento</span>"
and its effect upon the marriage of Lam <span class="SpellE">Sok</span> <span class="SpellE">Kam</span> to Tan <span class="SpellE">Pio</span>, and the consul
replied that he considered the document not valid for the lack of the signature
of Lam <span class="SpellE">Sok</span> <span class="SpellE">Kam</span>; the
document was supposed executed in Macau on 19 July 1958, when Lam <span class="SpellE">Sok</span> <span class="SpellE">Kam</span> was already in the
Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither had the consul
issued to petitioner any certificate of legal capacity to marry, required by
Article 66 of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon,
respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Commissioner revoked, on <st1:date year="1959" day="15" month="1">15 January 1959</st1:date>, the previous order
of <st1:date year="1958" day="21" month="10">21 October 1958</st1:date> of
Associate Commissioner de la Rosa, and ordered her to leave the country within
five (5) days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commissioner further
denied her request for stay of execution of the order, pending action by the
President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on her request for additional extension of her stay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commissioner, likewise, for­feited her
bond for having changed her residence without giving notice and obtaining a
previous written consent of the Bureau of Immigration.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="21" month="1">21 January 1959</st1:date>,
petitioners-appellants filed a petition for prohibition against the
Commissioner of Immigration to prohibit him from enforcing his deportation
order.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meanwhile, two (2) daughters, <span class="SpellE">Lita</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Cita</span>, had been born, on <st1:date year="1960" day="20" month="1">20 January 1960</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1961" day="26" month="3">26 March 1961</st1:date>, respectively, to the petitioner appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered its
decision, subject of the present appeal, denying the petition for prohibition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The power of the Commissioner of Immigration to determine the
validity of a marriage for the purpose of deporting aliens was upheld in <span class="SpellE">Brito</span>, et al. vs. Commissioner of Immigration, 106 Phil.
417, in the following language:</p>

<blockquote>"The pivotal issue is whether or not the respondent
Commissioner of Immigration has the power to determine the validity of the
marriage contracted by the petitioners for the purpose of arresting and
deporting Tan <span class="SpellE">Soo</span> alias So <span class="SpellE">Wa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question that the power to deport
is limited to aliens, that the citizenship of the respondent in deportation
proceedings is determinative of the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of
Immigration, and that the power to deport carries that of determining the
respondent's nationality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But if the
question of nationality is dependent upon the validity of the respondent's
marriage, may the Commissioner of Immigration pass judgment thereon?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The lower court rules against appellant Commissioner of
Immigration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter, however, drew a
distinction between a <span class="SpellE">voidable</span> marriage and one which
is void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">initio</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He argues that in the first case the court
may be correct, but in the second, where the marriage is void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">initio</span></u>, the
Commissioner of Immigration may pass upon the validity of said marriage - - - -
- no judicial decree being necessary to establish its nullity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is true that in relation to the marriage of petitioners no
assumption can arise or should be made from the mere discovery of a marriage
contract between <span class="SpellE">Olegario</span> <span class="SpellE">Brito</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> Maya executed in 1943, without proof that
the first wife was still alive or that said first mar­riage was otherwise
subsisting in 1954.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact,
it is to be supposed that the marriage between the herein petitioners in 1954
is valid although this is only a <u>prima facie</u> presumption which may be
overcome by evidence that it was contracted during the lifetime of <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> Maya and before the first marriage of <span class="SpellE">Olegario</span> <span class="SpellE">Brito</span> was annulled or
dissolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, these
considerations going into the validity of the marriage of petitioners are not
an obstacle to the preliminary proceedings to be conducted in this particular
case by the appellant Commissioner of Immigration pursuant to Section 37(a) of
the Philippine Immigration Act, as amended, to determine whether or not a <u>prima
facie</u> case exists against <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Tan <span class="SpellE">Soo</span> alias So <span class="SpellE">Wa</span> to warrant her
deportation."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="">Though the decision in the aforecited
case was subsequently set aside, the ground <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
was new relevant evidence (See <span class="SpellE">Brito</span>, et al. vs.
Commissioner of Immigration, G.R. No. L-16829, 30 June 1965; 14 SCRA 539) which
did not reject or alter the ruling or opinion <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
upholding the power of the Commissioner to determine the validity of a
marriage, in the exercise of his jurisdiction to deport aliens, where such
marriage is claimed as a ground for non-<span class="SpellE">alienage</span> or
citizenship.</p>

<p class="BODY">But even assuming, for the sake of argument, that the divorce
from her first husband and her second marriage were both valid, peti­tioner Lam
<span class="SpellE">Sok</span> <span class="SpellE">Kam</span> is plainly
deportable because her marriage to Joaquin did not excuse her from her failure
to depart from the country upon the expiration of the extended period of her
temporary stay, which was on 17 November 1958, because her marriage did not i<u>pso
facto</u> make her a Filipino citizen (Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> Ha, et
al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-10760, </span><st1:date year="1957" day="17" month="5"><span class="GramE">17 May 1957</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 101 Phil. 459; </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Moreno</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"> vs. Vivo, G.R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-22196, </span><st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="6"><span class="GramE">30 June 1967</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 20 SCRA 562; Commissioner of Immigration vs. Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span>, et al., G.R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-22581, </span><st1:date year="1969" day="21" month="5"><span class="GramE">21 May 1969</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 28 SCRA 237).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners oppose consideration of the foregoing issue on the
ground of its being <span class="GramE">raised</span> for the first time on
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The opposition is unacceptable;
petitioners themselves raised the issue in their fourth assignment of error
(Brief, 32) by citing Section 15 of the Revised Naturalization Law, providing
that:</p>

<blockquote>"Any woman who is now or may hereafter be married to a citizen
of the Philippines and who might herself be lawfully naturalized shall be
deemed a citizen of the Philippines."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the circumstances shown by the record before us are
convincing that the marriage was not entered into in good faith but only or the
purpose of evading Lam <span class="SpellE">Sok</span> <span class="SpellE">Kam's</span>
promise to leave the country upon expiration of her temporary stay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her case is identical to that dealt with in
De <st1:country-region><st1:place>Austria</st1:place></st1:country-region> vs. <span class="SpellE">Conchu</span>, G.R. No. L-20716, 22 June 1965, 14 SCRA 336,
wherein this Court held the temporary visitor to be deportable, notwithstanding
her marriage to a natural born Filipino citizen some forty days before expiration
of her permit to remain in the Islands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such devious maneuvers to circumvent our immigration laws and confront
the authorities with a "fait accompli" must be firmly discouraged if
the country is not to be flooded by illegal entrants, abetted by unthinking
citizens devoid of regard for the country's higher interests.</p>

<p class="BODY">That Lam <span class="SpellE">Sok</span> <span class="SpellE">Kam</span>
now has children by her second husband, and that her deportation would tear her
apart from them, is not a ground that would bar exclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In Vivo vs. <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>, G.R. No.</span> L-25411, <st1:date year="1968" day="26" month="10">26 October 1968</st1:date>, 25 SCRA 616, this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"It is contended that two-year old res­pondent <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Siong</span>
cannot, under Article 363 of the Civil Code, be separated from his mother
-----------; and that to make said wife depart from the Philippines is
destructive of family solidarity (Articles 218-221).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These arguments are beside the point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said laws govern the relations -------
between private persons, not the relations between visiting aliens and the
sovereign host-country.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>--------------------."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS</b>, the appealed decision is hereby
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs
