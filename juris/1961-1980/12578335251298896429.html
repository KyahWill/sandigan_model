				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First 
Instance of Rizal finding Guillermo I. Ventura guilty of illegal practice of 
medicine under Section 770 in connection with Section 2678 of the Revised 
Administrative Code, and sentencing him, this being his second offense, to pay a 
fine in the sum of P500.00, with the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in 
case of insolvency and to pay costs.<p></p>
<p>Appellant, the accused, was charged with the above offense in an information 
which alleges that in February 1955, he did,
</p><blockquote>
<p>"willfully, unlawfully and feloniously and for compensation and reward, 
practice medicine in the said City (Pasay) by treating and applying electrical 
appliances to patients for the purpose of curing them with their ailments, 
diseases, pains, and physical defects from which they are suffering and by 
holding out himself to the public by means of signs, advertisements, and other 
means, to be a Doctor of Medicine."</p></blockquote>
<p>The lower court found, as facts, the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * in the year 1949, the accused herein, Guillermo I. Ventura, was 
convicted by the court of First Instance of Rizal of a 'similar offense' or 
illegal practice of medicine in the municipality of Pasay, now Pasay City and 
sentenced to pay a fine of P200.00 under the same legal provisions, or Section 
770 in connection with Section 2678 of the Revised Administrative Code.</p>
<p>"* * * by reason of certain complaints the National Bureau of Investigation 
had received from the President of the Philippine Federation of Private Medical 
Practitioners and from the Chairman of the Board of Medical Examiners, the 
National Bureau of Investigation on December 16, 1955, sent its morgue attendant 
Jose Natayan to the clinics of the accused at No. 2454 M. de la Cruz Street, 
Pasay City. Natayan was at that time suffering from pains in his back and he 
asked the accused to see his sickness. The accused attended to Natayan; wrote 
something on a piece of paper; and then he told him that he (Natayan) 'was sick 
of lumbago'. Thereupon, the accused asked Natayan to pay P5.00 and then asked 
him to pay the amount to a lady employee in the clinic which Natayan did. At the 
request of the accused, Natayan, then went around the other side of the clinic 
where he was given an enema of hot water by a male attendant. Then Natayan was 
asked to lie down on a table where his back was exposed to a big bulb for around 
fifteen minutes and afterwards to a red colored bulb for another ten minutes. 
Thereafter Natayan went back to the accused, who told him to come back to his 
clinic for six consecutive days. After that Natayan went back on the same day or 
December 16, 1955 to his office in the National Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p>The following day, Natayan returned to the clinic of the accused with the 
National Bureau of Investigation raiding party composed of two agents, two 
attorneys and one photographer. After he was dropped by the National Bureau of 
Investigation agents about seven meters away from the clinic of the accused, 
Natayan proceeded to the office of the accused, who then and there told him that 
another treatment would be applied to him and that he would pay P3.00. After 
paying this amount and while Natayan was lying on a table about to be given 
treatment the National Bureau of Investigation agents raided the place.</p>
<p>The accused herein, Guillermo I. Ventura, is not a duly registered masseur or 
a physician qualified to practice medicine."</p></blockquote>
<p>Appellant seeks a reversal here of aforementioned judgment 
of conviction on the grounds: (1) that the offense charged in the information 
had already prescribed; (2) that the laws involved are unconstitutional and 
void; (3) that granting that the said laws are valid the accused should not have 
been prosecuted thereunder because he was not engaged in the practice of 
medicine (4) that Congress, in passing House Bills Nos. 2405 and 357 recognized 
and believed in the efficacy of the drugless systems of healing and although 
said bills were vetoed by the President of the Philippines and thereby did not 
become regular statutes, they may be considered as concurrent resolutions 
formally establishing the drugless system of healing as a separate and distinct 
profession, not covered by Section 770 of the Medical Law; (5) that the 
complainants and the Government are estopped from prosecuting the accused under 
Section 770 because they were the ones who induced him to practice drugless 
healing after his conviction in 1949; and (6) that the accused has an implied 
license to practice drugless healing from the people of the Philippines and the 
Chairman of the Medical Board of Examiners.</p>
<p>Appellant, testifying on his behalf admitted that for 
the past 35 years, he had been practicing as a naturopathic physician, "treating 
human ailments without the use of drugs and medicines" and employing in his 
practice "electricity, water and hand", without a license to practice medicine; 
that during this time he had treated 500,000 patients, more or less, about 90% 
of whom were healed, and that he had studied drugless healing in the American 
University, Chicago, Illinois for about four years.</p>
<p>Invoking prescription, he argues that in view of the fact that he had begun 
the alleged practice of medicine thirty-five years ago without the required 
license, the crime charged in the information had already prescribed.<sup><font color="#ff0000">[1]</font></sup></p>
<p>The records reveal that the accused begun practicing his method of drugless 
healing 35 years ago. This practice was first discovered by the authorities in 
1949. He was prosecuted and convicted therefore the same year. Sometime after he 
again set up a clinic. He had a lucrative clientele and nobody bothered him.</p>
<p>However, at about February, 1955, the President of the Philippine Federation 
of Private Medical Practitioners, complained to the National Bureau of 
Investigation that appellant was advertising himself as capable of treating 
human ailments without drugs. Upon investigation, apellant was found to be 
without certificate of registration to practice such profession either from the 
Board of Medical Examiners or from the Committee of Examiners of Masseurs. So, 
this prosecution started in 1956. It is clear that the four-year period of 
prescription of the offense charged should be computed from February, 1955 when 
the National Bureau of Investigation discovered appellant's alleged illegal 
practice of Medicine.</p>
<p>Appellant also questions the constitutionality of Section 770 in relation to 
Section 775 of the Revised Administrative Code. It is appellant's theory that to 
require, of any person whose business is merely to stimulate by mechanical means 
the nerves of the body, many years of study in medical schools, taking up 
obstetrics, general surgery, gynecology, bacteriology and many other sciences, 
is curtailment of the exercise of one's calling, a violation of the 
constitutional principle that all men have the right to life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness and are entitled to the equal protection of the law. It is 
furthermore theorized that inasmuch as drugless healing is not taught in any 
of the medical schools prescribed, how could the members of the Medical Board of 
Examiners pass on the competence of these drugless healers?</p>
<p>This same contention was presented to and settled by this Court in the case 
of People vs. Buenviaje who was convicted of illegal practice of medicine for 
practicing chiropractor.<sup><font color="#ff0000">[2]</font></sup> It held:</p>
<blockquote><p>"There is very little force in this argument. The subjects in which an 
examination is required relate to matters of which a thorough knowledge seems 
necessary for the proper diagnosis of diseases of the human body and it is 
within the police power of the State to require that persons who devote 
themselves to the curing of human ills should possess such knowledge."</p></blockquote>
<p>In the instant case, we must again uphold those immutable concepts of the 
police power of the State. Under this power, the State may prescribe such 
regulations as in its judgment will secure or tend to secure the general welfare 
of the people, to protect them against the consequences of ignorance and 
incapacity as well as of deception and fraud. As one means to this end, it has 
been the practice of different States, from time immemorial to exact in any 
pursuit, profession or trade, a certain degree of skill and learning upon which 
the community may confidently rely, their possession being generally ascertained 
in an examination of parties by competent persons, or inferred from a 
certificate to them in the form of a diploma or license from an institution 
established for instruction on the subjects, scientific and otherwise, with 
which such pursuits have to deal.<sup><font color="#ff0000">[3]</font></sup></p>
<p>Appellant claims that his act of stimulating the affected nerves of the 
patients without use of any drug or medicine is not practice of medicine; that 
"practice of medicine" is confined only to the systems taught by the medical 
schools, namely, the regular, the homeopathic and the electric schools or 
systems.</p>
<p>Section 770 of the Revised Administrative Code in no uncertain terms covers 
appellant's acts. The statutory definition as to what acts constitute illegal 
practice of medicine as provided in said Section 770 includes the acts and 
practices performed by appellant. By his own statements, he admitted to have 
continuously diagnosed aad treated more or less 500,000 instances of different 
kinds of human ailments and to have prescribed remedies therefor.</p>
<p>As regards the contention that there are at least two concurrent resolutions 
declaring formally that Congress has recognized the drugless methods of healing, 
we need not elaborate further than to say that not until such recognition is 
actually embodied in a statute, shall we extend consideration of such 
method.</p>
<p>Appellant pleads that the lower court erred in not holding that the 
complainants and the government are estopped from prosecuting him because they 
were the ones who induced him to practice drugless healing after his conviction 
in 1949. He tried to show that medical practitioners, members of Congress, 
provincial governors, city mayors and municipal board members wrote to him 
requesting his help for persons suffering from all kinds of ailments; that 
municipal ordinances and resolutions were also passed authorizing him not only 
to practice his method of healing hut also to put up clinics in some 
municipalities; that he was even extended free transportation facilities to work 
in the Central Luzon Sanitarium in Tala, Caloocan, Rizal.</p>
<p>Above plea cannot be sustained by this Court. The doctrine of estoppel does 
not apply to the government.<sup><font color="#ff0000">[4]</font></sup> It is 
never estopped by mistakes or errors on the part of its agents, even assuming 
without conceding that said municipalities had encouraged appellant's practice. 
We cannot allow the bargaining away of public health and safety for the 
semblance of benefit to a few government officials, people or even 
municipalities.</p>
<p>Similarly, there is no such thing as implied license to practice drugless 
healing by the mere fact that the Chairman of the Board of Medical Examiners had 
permitted appellant to serve free in the Central Luzon Sanitarium in Tala, 
Caloocan, Rizal, or that countless people persisted in engaging his services. 
For one thing, these people might have contracted his services on the mistaken 
notion that he was duly licensed to practice his profession; for another, a 
repetition of illegal acts can never make them legal.</p>
<p>As additional argument, appellant urges acquittal under the new Medical Act 
of 1959<sup><font color="#ff0000">[5]</font></sup> wherein the practice of 
physiotherapy is recognized as a distinct science. He claim coverage of said law 
on the ground that he practices physiotherapy by massage through physical 
devices and upon the recommendation of duly registered physicians.</p>
<p>The above argument has no merit because there is strong evidence to the 
effect that appellant alone diagnoses his patients' ailments and applies that 
remedies therefor<sup><font color="#ff0000">[6]</font></sup> without written order 
or prescription by a registered physician.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed 
in all parts and respects. Costs against appellant.</p> <i>Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, Paredes, 
Dizon,</i> and <i>De Leon, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup><font color="#ff0000">[1]</font> </sup>SEC. 1 (Act 3673). — Violations
