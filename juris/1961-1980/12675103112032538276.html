<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is an appeal from the 
decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila in its Criminal Case No. 
53242, which questions the correctness of the penalty imposed by the trial court 
upon the appellant. This case was originally appealed to the Court of Appeals, 
but because the question involved in the appeal relates purely to a question of 
law the Court of Appeals forwarded to this Court the records of this case 
pursuant to the provisions of Sections 17 and 31 of the Judiciary Act of 1948, 
as amended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the Court of First Instance of 
Manila Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Layog</span> y <span class="SpellE">Cadayday</span>, Segundo Marquez y Castro and <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Caiña</span> y del <span class="SpellE">Mundo</span> were charged of the crime of theft, for having stolen 
equipments, materials and tools belonging to the Manila Electric Railroad &amp; 
Light Co. (<span class="SpellE">Meralco</span>), valued at P3<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>. Upon arraignment the three accused entered a plea of 
not guilty, but on the day set for the hearing of the case the said accused 
asked .permission from the court to withdraw their former plea of not guilty and 
to substitute the said plea with the plea of guilty as accessories to the crime 
of theft as alleged in the information. This plea of guilty to less serious 
offense was not objected to by the prosecution, and, as a matter of fact, the 
prosecution recommended that the minimum penalty prescribed by law for the 
offense to which the accused had pleaded guilty be imposed upon said accused. 
Thereafter, the trial court declared the said accused guilty as accessories 
after the fact of the crime of theft as charged in the information, and thereby 
sentenced each of them to suffer the penalty of four (4) months and one (1) day 
of <span class="SpellE"><i>arresto</i></span><i> mayor</i> and each to pay 
one-third of the costs. The properties stolen having been recovered, the same 
were ordered returned to their owner. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Only the defendant Segundo 
Marquez y Castro appealed from the decision of the trial court. He was allowed 
to appeal as a pauper. In his lone assignment of error the appellant maintains 
that the lower court erred in imposing on him the penalty of four (4) months and 
one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><i>arresto</i></span><i> mayor</i> and not the 
penalty of <span class="SpellE">destierro</span>, pursuant to the provisions of 
Article 309, par. 3, in relation to Articles 53 and 27, paragraph 4, of the 
<span class="GramE">Revised Penal Code.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is the contention of the 
appellant that inasmuch as the value of the properties stolen is more than two 
hundred pesos, (P200.00) but does not exceed six thousand Pesos (P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>),. the penalty for the commission of the offense as 
charged in the information should be <span class="SpellE"><i>prision</i></span><i> 
<span class="SpellE">correccional</span></i> in its minimum and medium periods, or 
an imprisonment of from six (6) months and one (1) day to four (4) years and two 
(2) months pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 3 of Article 309 of the 
Revised Penal Code; and that since the appellant, along with his co-accused, had 
pleaded guilty to a lesser offense—that of accessory after the fact—the penalty 
that should be imposed on each of them should be "lower by two degrees than that 
prescribed by law for the consummated felony", as provided in Article 53 of the 
Revised Penal Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The contention of the appellant 
finds support in the ruling of this Court in the case of Jose <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> vs. The People of the Philippines, 84 Phil, 473; 
(47 Off. <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>., 711), which resolved a question that 
was more or less identical to the one now before <span class="GramE">Us</span>. 
The pertinent portion of the decision reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"* * * The penalty provided by 
Article 309, paragraph 3, of the Revised Penal Code where the value of the 
property stolen is more than P200 but does not exceed P6,000 is <span class="SpellE"><i>prision</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">correcional</span></i> 
in its minimum and medium periods. <span class="GramE">The penalty lower by two 
degrees than this should be imposed upon the accused as accessory to the 
commission of a consummated felony (Art. 53).</span> Two degrees lower than 
<span class="SpellE"><i>prision</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span></i> in its minimum and medium periods is <span class="SpellE">destierro</span> in its maximum period to <span class="SpellE">arresto</span> mayor in its minimum period. (See article 61, par. 
5, in relation to article 71, Revised Penal Code, as amended by Com. Act No. 
217). The medium degree of this penalty should be imposed, there being neither 
aggravating nor mitigating circumstances. <span class="SpellE">Destierro</span> in 
its maximum period is from four years, two months, and one day to six years of 
banishment; while <span class="SpellE">arresto</span> mayor in its minimum period 
is one month and one day, to two months of imprisonment. There is no medium or 
middle ground between these two penalties. So we think one month and one day of 
<span class="SpellE"><i>arresto</i></span><i> mayor</i> is preferable or more 
favorable to the accused."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Solicitor General agrees with 
the appellant that the penalty imposed by the trial court on the appellant and 
his co-accused was above the legal range, and he recommends that instead the 
penalty to be imposed be that of one (1) month and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><i>arresto</i></span><i> mayor</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We find that the appeal of the 
appellant, Segundo Marquez y Castro, is well-taken, and that the recommendation 
of the Solicitor General for the reduction of the penalty imposed is in 
accordance with law and the applicable decision of this 
Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: Verdana;">Wherefore</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision appealed from is 
modified in so far as the appellant Segundo Marquez y Castro is concerned, in 
the sense that the penalty to be imposed on said appellant be one (1) month and 
one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><i>arresto</i></span><i> mayor</i>, and not 
four (4) months and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE">arresto</span> mayor as 
imposed by the lower court. No pronouncement as to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Bengzon</span></i></span><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, C. J., Bautista Angelo, Reyes,
