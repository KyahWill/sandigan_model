				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal taken by Septemio and Abelardo Cebedo from a decision of the Court of 
First Instance of Misamis Occidental dismissing their petition for prohibition 
with preliminary injunction against the Hon. Director of Lands, the District 
Land Officer, Marciano Aldemita, Mariano Paculaba, Arcadio Pescadero, Lucio 
Enriquez and Laureano Retiza. The case was decided upon an agreed stipulation of 
facts which showed the following:
<p>On February 15, 1951 Septemio Cebedo and Abelardo Cebedo filed their 
respective Free Patent Application in connection with different portions of Lot 
No. 2012 of the Cadastral Survey of Tangub, Misamis Occidental. Pursuant thereto 
aid after the proceedings provided by law, Free Patent No. V-1637 was issued to 
Septemio Cebedo and Original Certificate of Title No. RP-68 was entered in the 
book of the Register of Deeds of Occidental Misamis in his name on May 30, 1952, 
while Free Patent No. V-1635 was likewise issued to Abelardo Cebedo and Original 
Certificate of Title No. RP-67 was entered in the same register in his name on 
the same date, the respective owner's duplicate copies of their original 
certificates of title having been issued to them.</p>
<p>On August 27, 1953, Arcadio Pescadero, Lucio Enriquez and Laureano Retiza 
(respondents herein), claiming to be the actual occupants and owners of 
different portions of the lot covered by the Free Patent Title of Septemio 
Cebedo, filed Civil Case No. 1586 in the Court of First Instance of Misamis 
Occidental against the latter, the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural 
Resources and the Director of Lands, for the annulment of Septemio's title on 
the ground that it was secured through fraud. On the same date Marciano 
Aldemita, Arcadio Pescadero and Mariano Paculaba (other respondents herein), 
filed in the same court a similar case against Abelardo Cebedo, the Secretary of 
Agriculture and Natural Resources and the Director of Lands (Civil Case No. 
1585), claiming to be the owners of separate portions of the lot covered by 
Abelardo's Free Patent Title. Both cases were dismissed by the court on May 21, 
1954 upon the ground that the therein plaintiffs had not exhausted the 
administrative remedies available, and the motions for reconsideration filed by 
the plaintiffs were denied on July 3, 1954.</p>
<p>On July 30, 1954, the herein appellees (except the Director of Lands and the 
District Land Officer) filed a protest with the Director of Lands against the 
Free Patent Titles of appellants. In connection therewith, the Director of Lands 
issued an order dated January 31, 1955, the dispositive part of which reads as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Conformably herewith, <i>steps shall be taken in the proper court</i> 
(Italics supplied) for the cancellation of Free Patents Nos. V-1635 and V-1637 
and the corresponding certificates of title issued therefor to Abelardo Cebedo 
and Septemio Cebedo, respectively. Mariano Paculaba, Marciano Aldemita, Laureano 
Retiza and Lucio Enriquez shall within a period of sixty (60) days from receipt 
of their copies hereof, file separate applications for the respective portion 
adjudged to them; otherwise, they shall lose their preferential right thereto. 
The Homestead Application No. 140276 (E-79072) of Arcadio Pescadero shall be 
given further due course as soon as the aforesaid patents have been 
cancelled".</p></blockquote>
<p>Appellants filed on May 21, 1955 a motion for reconsideration arid on June 24 
of the same year a supplementary motion for the reconsideration of the above 
order, alleging lack of a previous investigation in connection therewith; lack 
of jurisdiction on the part of the Director of Lands to issue the order and the 
want of legal personality of Arcadio Pescadero and his co-protestants to attack 
the free patents issued in their favor, invoking the ruling in the case of 
Sumail <i>vs</i>. Court of First Instance of Cotabato, et al., 96 Phil., 946; 51 
Off. Gaz., (5) 2413 but on December 15, 1955, the Director of Lands, without 
deciding squarely the question of jurisdiction, issued aiorder directing the 
District Land Officer at Iligan City to conduct an investigation of the case in 
accordance with Section 6 and 7 of Lands Administrative Order No. 6, and the 
latter had subpoenas served upon herein appellants informing them, besides, that 
the investigation of the protest of Pescadero and others would be held on May 
28, 1956. This order gave rise to the filing of the present petition for 
prohibition with preliminary injunction by Septemio and Abelardo Cebedo to 
prohibit the Director of Lands from proceeding with the investigation.</p>
<p>In their answer to the petition for prohibition appellees alleged that in 
accordance with Article 91 of the Public Land Law, Commonwealth Act No. 141, the 
Director of Lands has not only the authority but the duty to investigate the 
facts that had led to the issuance of a free patent for the purpose of 
ascertaining whether the same were true, or whether they continue to exist and 
are maintained and preserved in good faith, and that in such investigation the 
existence of bad faith, fraud, concealment or fraudulent and illegal 
modification of essential facts may be inquired into.</p>
<p>Upon the undisputed facts, we are constrained to affirm the decision appealed 
from.</p>
<p>In the first place, appellants could have first appealed to the Secretary of 
Agriculture and Natural Resources from the orders of the Director of Lands 
complained of before commencing the present action. Their failure to resort to 
such remedy not having been satisfactorily explained, prohibition can not lie, 
it being settled in this jurisdiction that said writ may be issued only in the 
absence of an appeal or any other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the 
ordinary course of law.</p>
<p>In the second place, when the respondent Director of Lands issued his order 
of January 31, 1955, appellants moved to have it set aside claiming that no 
investigation had been conducted before its issuance and, if there was any, they 
had not been notified in connection therewith. Finding their allegation to this 
effect to be well founded, the Director of Lands, in his order of December 15 of 
the same year, precisely directed the district land officer at Iligan City to 
conduct an investigation of the case, and said officer fixed a date for said 
investigation and sent proper notice thereof to appellants. The latter, 
therefore, have no reason to complain.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is clear from the facts that the investigation complained of is 
merely preliminary, its purpose being to determine whether steps should be taken 
in the proper court for the annulment of the titles issued to appellants. We 
agree with the position taken in this connection by the Director of Lands that 
it is not only his right but his duty to conduct the investigation complained of 
and to file the corresponding court action for the reversion of the properties 
to the State, if the facts disclosed in the course of the investigation so 
warrant.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs.</p><i>Bengzon, 
C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Paredes, De 
Leon,</i> and <i>Natividad, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
