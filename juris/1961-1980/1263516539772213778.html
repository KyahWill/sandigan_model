appeal from the decision of <span style="">the Court
of First Instance of Manila, Civil Case No. 41845, declaring null and void the
sheriff's sale of <u>two</u> certificates of public convenience in favor of
defendant <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> E. <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>
and the subsequent sale thereof by the latter to defendant <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
Transportation Co., Inc.; declaring the plaintiff Villa <span class="SpellE">Rey</span>
Transit, Inc., to be the lawful owner of the said certificates of public
convenience; and ordering the private defendants, jointly and severally, to pay
to the plaintiff, the sum of P5,000.00 as and for attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case against the PSC was dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The rather ramified
circumstances of the instant case can best be understood by a chronological
narration of the essential facts, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Prior to 1959, Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> was an operator of a bus transportation, under the
business name of Villa <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> Transit, pursuant to
certificates of public convenience granted him by the Public Service Commission
(PSC, for short) in Cases Nos. 44213 and 104651, which authorized him to
operate a total of thirty-two (32) units on various routes or lines from <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> to Manila, and vice-versa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 8, 1959, he sold the
aforementioned <u>two</u> certificates of public convenience to the <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> Transportation Company, Inc. (otherwise known as
<span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>), for P350,000.00 with the condition, among
others, that the seller (<span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>) "shall not
for a period of 10 years from the date of this sale, apply for any TPU service
identical or competing with the buyer."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Barely three months
thereafter, or on March 6, 1959, a corporation called Villa <span class="SpellE">Rey</span>
Transit, Inc. (which shall be referred to hereafter as the Corpora­tion) was
organized with a capital stock of P500,000.00 divided into 5,000 shares of the
par value of P100.00 each; P200,000.00 was the subscribed stock; <span class="SpellE">Nati­vidad</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> (wife of
Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>) was one of the incorporators, and
she subscribed for P1,000.00; the balance of P199,000.00 was subscribed by the
brother and sister-in-law of Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>; of
the subscribed capital stock, P105,000.00 was paid to the treasurer of the
corporation, who was <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In
less than a month after its registration with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (March 10, 1959), the Corporation, on April 7, 1959, bought <u>five</u>
certificates of public convenience, forty-nine buses, tools and </span><span style="">equipment from one <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span>
Fernando, for the sum of P249,000.00, of which P100,000.00 was paid upon the </span><span style="">signing of the
contract; P50,000.00 was payable upon the final approval of the sale by the
PSC; P49,500.00 one year after the final approval </span><span style="">of the sale; and the balance of P50,000.00
"shall be paid by </span><span style="">the BUYER to the different suppliers of the
SELLER."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
very same </span><span style="">day that the
aforementioned contract of sale was executed, the parties thereto imme</span><span style="">diately applied
with the PSC for its approval, with </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">prayer for the issuance of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">provisional authority in favor of the vendee
Corporation to operate the service therein involved.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">On May 19, 1959, the PSC granted the
provisional permit prayed for, upon the condition </span><span style="">that "it may
be modified or revoked by the Commission at any time, shall be subject to
whatever action that may be taken on the basic application and shall be valid
only during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of said
application."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the PSC could
take final action on said application for approval of sale, </span><span style="">however, the Sheriff of Manila, on July 7,
1959, levied on <u>two of the five certificates of public convenience</u>
involved therein, namely those issued und</span><span style="">er </span><span style="">PSC </span><span style="">cases Nos. 59494 and 63780, pursuant </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">a writ of execution issued </span><span style="">by
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> in Civil
Case No. 13798, in favor of <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>, plaintiff, judgment creditor, against <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> Fernando, defendant, judgment debtor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Sheriff made and entered the levy in the
records of the PSC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1959" day="16" month="7"><span style="">July 16,
 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, a public sale
was conducted by the Sheriff of the said <u>two</u> certificates of public
convenience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fer­<span style="">rer</span></span></span><span style=""> was the highest
bidder, and a certificate of sale was issued in his name.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thereafter,
<span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> sold the <u>two</u> certificates of public
convenience to <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>, and jointly submitted </span><span style="">for approval their corresponding contract of
sale to the PSC.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> therein prayed that it be </span>autho­rized <span style="">provisionally to operate the service involved
in the said two certificates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The applications for
approval of sale, filed before the PSC, by Fernando and the Corporation, Case
No. 124057, and that of <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>, Case No. 126278, were scheduled for a joint
hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, to </span><span style="">wit, on July 22,
1959, the PSC issued an order disposing </span><span style="">that during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the cases and
before a final resolution on the aforesaid applications, the <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> shall be the one to operate provisionally the
service under the <u>two</u> certificates embraced in </span><span style="">the contract bet­</span><span style="">ween <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Corporation took issue with this particular ruling of the PSC and elevated the
matter to the Supreme Court,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> which decreed, after deliberation, that
until the issue on the ownership of the </span><span style="">disputed certificates shall have been finally settled by the proper
court, </span><span style="">the Corporation should be
the one to operate the lines provisionally.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On November 4, 1959, the
Corporation filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila, a complaint for the
</span>annulment of the sheriff's sale of the aforesaid <u>two</u> certificates
of public convenience (PSC Cases Nos. 59494 and 63780) in favor of the
defendant <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>, and the sub­sequent sale thereof by
the latter to <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>, against <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> and <span style="">the
PSC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff </span>Corporation
prayed therein that all the orders of the PSC relative to the parties' dispute
over the said certificates be annulled.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In separate answers, the
defendants <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> and </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pan­tranco</span></span><span style=""> averred that the
plaintiff Corporation </span><span style="">had no valid title to </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">certificates in question because the </span><span style="">contract pursuant
to which it acquired </span><span style="">them from
Fernando was subject to a <span class="SpellE">suspensive</span> condition - the
approval of the PSC - which has not yet been fulfilled, and, therefore, </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">Sheriff's levy and the consequent sale at public auction of the
certificates referred to, as well as the sale of the same by </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ferrer</span></span><span style=""> to <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>, were valid and regular, and vested </span><span style="">unto <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>, a
superior right thereto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>, on <span style="">its </span>part, filed a third-party com­plaint against Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Villarana</span>, alleging that <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>
and the Corporation, are one and the same; that <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>
<span style="">and/or the Corporation was disqualified
from operating the two certificates in question </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">virtue of the afore­mentioned
agreement between said <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>, which stipulated that <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>
"shall not for a period of 10 years from the date of this sale, apply for
any TPU service identical or competing with the buyer."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of the issues in both the complaint and third-party
complaint, the case was tried, and there­after decision was rendered in the
terms as above stated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As stated at the beginning, <span style="">all </span>the parties involved have appealed from the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They submitted a joint record on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> disputes the correctness of
the decision <span style="">insofar as it holds that
Villa <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> Transit, Inc. (Cor­poration) is </span><span style="">a </span>distinct and separate entity from
Jose <span style="">M. </span><span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>;
that the restriction clause in the contract of January 8, 1959 between <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> <span style="">is </span>null and void, that the Sheriff's
sale of July 16, 1959, <span style="">is </span>likewise
null and void; and the failure to award da­mages in its favor and against <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>, for his part, challenges the <span style="">decision insofar as it </span>holds that the
sheriff's sale is null and void; and the sale of the <u>two</u> certificates in
question by <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> Fernando to the Corporation, is
valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also assails the award of
P5,000.00 as attorney's fees in favor of the Corporation, and the failure to
award moral damages to him as prayed for in his counterclaim.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Corporation, on the other hand, prays for a review of that
portion of the decision awarding only P5,000.00 as attorney's fees, and
insisting that it is entitled to an award of P100,000.00 by way of
exemplary<span style="">&nbsp; </span>damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful study of the facts obtaining in the case, the
vital issues to be resolved are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
Does the stipulation between <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>, as contained in the deed of sale, that the
former "SHALL NOT FOR A PERIOD OF <span style="">10
</span>YEARS FROM THE DATE OF THIS SALE, APPLY FOR ANY TPU SERVICE IDENTICAL OR
COMPETING WITH THE BUYER", apply to new lines only or does it include
existing lines?; (2) Assuming that said stipulation covers all kinds of lines,
is such stipulation valid and enforceable?; (3) In the affirmative, that <span style="">said stipulation is </span>valid, did it bind
the Corporation?</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For convenience, We
propose to discuss the foregoing issues by <span style="">starting </span>with the last proposition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The evidence </span><span style="">has </span><span style="">disclosed that <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>, albeit was not an
incorporator or stockholder of the Corporation, alleging that he did not become
such, </span><span style="">because </span><span style="">he did not have sufficient funds to invest, <span style="">his wife, however, was an incorporator with
the least subscribed number of shares, and was elected treasurer of the
Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The finances of the
Corporation </span>which, under all concepts in the <span style="">law, are </span>supposed to be under the control and administration of
the trea­surer keeping them as trust fund for the Corporation, were,
nonetheless, manipulated and disbursed as if they were the private funds of <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>, in such </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">way and extent that <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Villarama</span></span><span style=""> appeared to be the actual owner-treasurer </span>of
the <span style="">business without regard to the
rights of the stockholders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
following testimony of <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>,</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">together<span style=""> </span>with the other evidence on record, attests to that effect:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Q. - Doctor, I want to go back <span style="">again </span>to the incorporation of the <span style="">Villa </span><span class="SpellE">Rey</span> Transit, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You heard the testimony presented here by <span style="">the bank re­garding the initial opening
deposit of ONE HUNDRED FIVE </span>THOUSAND PESOS, of which amount Eighty-Five
Thousand Pesos was a check drawn by yourself personally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the direct examination you told the Court
that the reason you drew a check for Eighty-Five Thousand Pesos was because you
and your wife, or your wife, had spent the money of the stockholders given to
her for incorporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Will you please
tell the Honorable Court if you knew at the time your wife was spending the
money to pay debts, you personally know she was spending the money of the
incorporators?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A. - You know my money and my <span style="">wife's </span>money are one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
never talk about those things.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q. - Doctor, your answer then is that since your money and
your wife's money are one money and you did not know when your wife was pay­ing
debts with the incorporator's money?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A. - Because sometimes she uses my money and sometimes the
money, given to her she gives to me and I deposit the money.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q. - Actually, aside from <span style="">your wife, </span>you were also the custodian of some of the
incorporators here, in the beginning?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A. - Not necessarily, they give to my wife and when my wife
hands to me I did not know it belonged to the incorporators.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q. - It supposes then your wife gives you some of the money received
by her in her capacity as trea­surer of the corporation?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A. - Maybe.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q. - What did you do with the money, deposit in a regular
account?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A. - Deposit in my account.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q. - Of all the money given to your wife, she did not receive
any check?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A. - I do not remember.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q. - <span style="">Is </span>it
usual for you, Doctor, to be given Fifty Thousand Pesos without even asking
what <span style="">is </span>this?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>JUDGE:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reform the question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q. - The subscription of your brother-in-law, Mr. Reyes, <span style="">is </span>Fifty-Two Thousand Pesos, did your
wife give you Fifty-Two Thousand Pesos?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A. - I have testified before that sometimes my wife gives me
money and I do not know exactly for what."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The evidence further show
that the initial cash capitalization of the corporation of P105,000.00 was
mostly financed by <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the P105,000.00 de­posited in the First
National City Bank of </span><st1:state><st1:place><span style="">New York</span></st1:place></st1:state><span style="">, representing the initial paid-up capital of the Cor­poration,
P85,000.00 was covered <span style="">by <span class="SpellE">Villarama<span style="">'</span><span style="">s</span></span> </span>per­sonal
check.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deposit slip for the <span style="">said amount of P105,000.00 was admitted in
evidence as <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 23, which </span></span><span style="">shows on its face that P20,000.00 was paid in
cash and </span>P85,000.00 thereof was covered by Check No. F-50271 of the
First National City Bank of <st1:state><st1:place><span style="">New </span>York</st1:place></st1:state>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testi­monies of Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Sancho</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>

<span style="">both employees of said bank, have
proved that the drawer of the check was Jose <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>
himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Another witness, <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> Rivera, accountant of the Corporation, testified that
while in the books </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the corporation there
appears an entry that the treasurer received P95,000.00 as second installment
of the paid-in subscriptions, and, subsequently, also P100,000.00 as the first
installment of the offer for second subscriptions worth P200,000.00 from the
original subscribers, yet <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Villarama</span></span><span style=""> directed </span>him
(Rivera) to make vouchers liquidating the sums.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Thus, it was made to appear that the
P95,000.00 was delivered to <span class="SpellE">Villa­rama</span> in payment for
equipment purchased from him, and the P100,000.00 was loaned as advances to the
<span style="">stockholders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The said accountant, however,
testified that he was not aware of any amount of money that had act­ually
passed hands among the parties involved,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and actually the only money of the
corporation was the P105,000.00 covered by the deposit slip <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
23, of which, as mentioned above, P85,000.00 was paid by <span class="SpellE">Villarama<span style="">'</span>s</span> personal check.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Further, the evidence show that when the Corpo­ration was in its
initial months of operation, <span class="SpellE">Villa­rama</span> purchased and
paid with his personal checks Ford trucks for the Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibits 20 and 21 disclose that the said
purchases were paid by Philippine Bank of Commerce Checks Nos. 992618-B and
993621-B, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These checks
have been sufficiently <span style="">established by <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> <span class="SpellE">Abad</span>, Assistant Accountant
of Manila Trading &amp; Supply Co., from which the trucks were purchased</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and <span class="SpellE">Aristedes</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Exhibits 6 to 19 and <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 22, which are <span class="SpellE">photos­tatic</span>
copies of ledger entries and vouchers showing that <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>
had co-mingled his personal funds and transactions with those made in the name
of the Cor­poration, are very illuminating evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> has
assailed the admissibility of these exhibits, contending that no evidentiary
value whatsoever </span>should be given to them since "they were merely <span class="SpellE">photo­static</span> copies of the originals, the best evidence be­ing
the originals themselves."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to him, at the time <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>
offered the said exhibits, it was the most likely possessor of the originals
thereof be­cause they were stolen from the files of the Corpora­tion and only <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> was able to produce the alleged <span class="SpellE">photostat</span> copies thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 5 of Rule 130 of the Rules of Court provides for the
requisites for the admissibility of secondary evidence when the original is in
the custody of the adverse party, thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) opponent's possession of the original; (2) reasonable notice to
opponent to produce the original; (3) satisfactory proof of its existence; and
(4) failure or refusal of opponent to produce the original in court.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> has practically admitted the second and

owner of Villa <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> Transit, a single

from <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> for the sale of the two certificates
and one unit,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <span style="">it </span>becomes difficult to accept <span class="SpellE">Villarama's</span> explanation that </span><span style="">he </span><span style="">and his wife, after consultation,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> spent the money of

</span>And there is no evidence adduced that the said amount of P350,000.00</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">was all spent or

light of the stipulation in the deed of sale between <span class="SpellE">Villa<span style="">rama</span></span></span><span style=""> and <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> that
P50,000.00 of the selling price was earmarked for the payments of accounts due

his having paid for purchases by the Corporation of trucks from the Manila

since he had loaned money to the Corporation, this would be set-off by the

thru transfer or sale from a previous operator, thus defeating the intention of
the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For what would prevent the

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Analyzing the characteristics </span><span style="">of the </span><span style="">questioned stipula­tion, We </span><span style="">find that although it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">in the nature of an agreement suppressing competition,

P350,000.00 for just two certificates of </span><span style="">public convenience, and considering, furthermore, that the disputed

the preponderance of the evidence have shown that Villa <span class="SpellE">Rey</span>

We hold, as prayed for in <span class="SpellE">Pantranco's</span> </span>third
party complaint, that the said Corporation should, until the expiration of the

the pro­hibition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To avoid any
misunderstanding, it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">here to be emphasized
that the 10year prohibition upon <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">not against his application for, or purchase
of, certificates of public convenience, but merely the ope­ration of TPU along
the lines covered by the certifi­cates sold by him to <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the </span><span style="">sale </span><span style="">between Fernando and the Corporation is
valid, such that the rightful ownership of the disputed certifi­cates still
belongs to the plaintiff being the prior purchaser in good faith and for value
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the ancient rule of <u>caveat</u>
<u>emptor</u> prevailing in this jurisdiction, what was acquired by <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> in the sheriff's sale was only the right which

acts" of defendants (<span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Fer­rer</span>) in acquiring the certificates of public
convenience in question, despite constructive and actual knowledge on their
part of a prior sale executed by Fernando in favor of the said corporation, which
ne­cessitated the latter to file the action to annul the sheriff's sale to <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> and the subsequent transfer to <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>,
it is entitled to collect actual and compensatory damages, and attorney's fees
in the amount of P25,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
evidence on record, however, does not clearly show that said defendants acted
in bad faith in their acquisition of the certificates in ques­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They believed that because the bill of sale
has yet to be approved by the Public Service Commission, the transaction was not
<span style="">a </span>consummated sale, and, there­fore,
the title to or ownership of the certificates was </span><span style="">still </span><span style="">with the seller.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The award by the lower court of attorney's
fees of P5,000.00 in favor of Villa <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> Transit, Inc.
is, therefore, without basis and should be set aside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Eusebio</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Ferrer's</span> charge
that by reason of the filing of the action to annul the sheriff's sale, he had
suffered and should be awarded moral, exemplary damages and attorney's fees,
cannot be entertained, in view of the conclusion herein reached that the sale
by Fernando to the Corporation was valid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pantranco</span></span><span style="">, on the other hand, justifies its claim for
damages with the allegation that when it purchased <span class="SpellE">Villarama's</span>
business for P350,000.00, it intended to build up the traffic along the lines
covered by the certificates but it was not afforded an opportunity to do so
since barely three months had elapsed when the contract was violated by <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> operating along the same lines in the name of
Villa <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> Transit, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is further claimed by <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>
that the underhanded manner in which <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> vio­lated
the contract is pertinent in establishing puni­tive or moral damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its contention <span style="">as </span>to the pro­per measure of damages is that it should be the
pur­chase price of P350,000.00 that it paid to <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While We are fully in accord with <span class="SpellE">Pantranco's</span> claim of entitlement to damages it suffered as
a result of <span class="SpellE">Villarama's</span> breach of his contract with
it, the record does not sufficiently supply the necessary evidentiary materials
upon which to base the award and there is need for further proceedings in the
lower court to ascertain the proper amount.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
