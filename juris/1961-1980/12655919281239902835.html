<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In a decision rendered on 
December 24, 1935, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> declared Jose A. Arches owner of a portion of Lot No. 
3150 of the <span class="SpellE">Panay</span> cadastre containing an area of 2,250 
square meters and ordered that Original Certificate of Title No. 17104 covering 
said lot be cancelled and a now certificate be issued annotating on the back 
thereof the portion adjudicated to Arches. Subsequently, Original Certificate of 
Title No. 17104 was cancelled and in lieu thereof Transfer Certificate of Title 
No. 3906 was issued on </span><st1:date year="1939" day="26" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 26, 
1939</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> in 
the names of <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span> <span class="SpellE">Espi</span> 
and <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span> <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> at the 
back of which the interest of Arches was annotated pursuant to the aforesaid 
decision. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Then, the following transfers 
took place concerning Lot No. 3150; on December 29, 1915, spouses <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span> <span class="SpellE">Espi</span> and <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span> <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> sold the lot to 
<span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguilos</span>; on March 
15, 1946, <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguilos</span> 
sold" it to spouses <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Bibit</span> and Petra <span class="SpellE">Obligar</span>; and on 
January 2, 1947, the latter spouses in turn sold the lot to Aurora <span class="SpellE">Billanes</span>. Since the original of Transfer Certificate of 
Title No. 3906 was destroyed during the last war and only the owner's duplicate 
thereof was <span class="GramE">existing</span>, said title was administratively 
reconstituted by the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> on 
</span><st1:date year="1947" day="16" month="1"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 16, 
1947</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> on 
the basis of said duplicate resulting in the issuance of Transfer Certificate of 
Title No. <span class="GramE">RT-34(a) (8906).</span> On the same date, the 
various documents of sale made over Lot No. 3150 were simultaneously registered 
resulting in the issuance of separate certificates of title to each and every 
transferee, the last one being Aurora <span class="SpellE">Billanes</span>. The 
title issued to the latter is Transfer Certificate of Title No. 123, free from 
all liens and encumbrances. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On December 1, 1959, Jose A. 
Arches who came to know for the first time the reconstitution made of Transfer 
Certificate of Title No. 3906 in 1947, as well as the issuance of transfer 
certificates of title in favor of the subsequent transferees, filed a petition 
before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> praying 
for the annotation of his interest in Lot No. 3150 not only on Transfer 
Certificate of Title No. RT-34(a) (3906), as reconstituted, but also on all the 
titles issued subsequent thereto by the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>, on the ground that such interest which appears on the 
original of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 3906 has been improperly omitted 
on the reconstituted title and on the other titles issued subsequent thereto to 
his prejudice, he being the owner of a portion of Lot No. 3150 covered by them. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Aurora <span class="SpellE">Billanes</span> filed an opposition to this petition alleging, 
among other things, that when she bought Lot No. 3150 from spouses <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Bibit</span> and Petra <span class="SpellE">Obligar</span> on </span><st1:date year="1947" day="2" month="1"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 2, 
1947</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, she 
examined the owner's duplicate of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 3906 
covering the same and found no lien or encumbrances annotated thereon. It is on 
the basis of this duplicate that she bought said lot and the reconstitution of 
the original title was made by the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After setting the hearing of the 
petition on September I, 1961, the court <i>a quo</i> without any hearing on the 
merits, issued an order dismissing the petition for lack of sufficient legal 
basis. But the dismissal was made "without prejudice to the-petitioner's right 
to take recourse to a more appropriate remedy." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner took the present 
appeal which was certified to this Court on the ground that the only issue 
involved is one of law. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The order of the court <i>a 
quo</i> which is now the subject of this appeal reads as follows: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"</span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Lot</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> No. 3150, <span class="SpellE">Panay</span> Cadastre, is registered under the 
</span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Torrens</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> system. It appears that the only 
copy of the various certificates of title issued thereon, which has survived 
through the last world war, is the Owner's Duplicate Certificate of Transfer 
Certificate of Title No. 3906, now on file in the Office of the Register of 
Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>, which was issued as appearing from the 
face thereof, on June 26, 1939. On the basis of the said existing copy, the said 
title was administratively reconstituted on </span><st1:date year="1947" day="16" month="1"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 
16, 1947</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
in accordance with Republic Act No. 26, and the reconstituted title bears <span class="GramE">No</span>. <span class="GramE">RT-34(a) (3906).</span> 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Now <span class="GramE">comes</span> the petitioner herein claiming to have a lien on the 
property aforementioned and claiming further that said lien was registered 
before the war. Petitioner also prays that his said lien be made to appear as 
annotated on the title as requested. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It appearing that the Owner's 
Duplicate Certificate of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 3906 does not bear 
any annotation with reference to the aforementioned lien, the Court cannot see 
its way dear to ordering the said lien annotated on the copy as reconstituted 
from the Owner's Duplicate Certificate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Therefore, the within petition is 
hereby dismissed without prejudice to the petitioner's right to take recourse to 
an appropriate remedy."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It should be noted that Lot No. 
3150, a portion of which was acquired by petitioner, was originally covered by 
Original Certificate of Title No. 17104, which was later cancelled and 
substituted by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 3906. It should also be noted 
that on both originals of said titles the interest of petitioner was annotated 
as directed by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> in 
its decision rendered in Civil Case No. 3286, but no such annotation was made on 
the owner's duplicate of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 3906 which was issued 
in the names of spouses <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span> <span class="SpellE">Espi</span> and <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span> <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span>. And since this owner's duplicate has been the 
basis of the different transfers made on Lot No. 3150 up to the time it was sold 
to <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> Aurora <span class="SpellE">Billanes</span> 
and the reconstitution of the original of Title No. 3906 was also made on the 
basis of said duplicate, the resultant effect was that the title as 
reconstituted [RT-34(a) (3906)], as well as the transfer certificates of title 
issued to the different transferees of the same lot, do not bear any annotation 
concerning the interest adjudicated in favor of petitioner. In other words, it 
may be stated that on the basis of the pleadings submitted, the persons who 
subsequently bought Lot No. 3150 from spouses <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Espi</span> and <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span> <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> in whose names the original of Certificate of 
Title No. 3906 was issued, down to herein <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> 
Aurora <span class="SpellE">Billanes</span>, bought the lot with the knowledge 
that the same was free from any lien or encumbrance. They did not have any 
knowledge of the interest now claimed by petitioner except only when he filed 
the present petition on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="1" month="12"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 1, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
praying for the annotation of his interest on the title as British Traders his. 
Co., Ltd. vs. Comm. of Int. Revenue reconstituted as well as on the titles 
issued subsequent thereto, a matter which could have been avoided had petitioner 
been more solicitous in securing the annotation of his interest not only on the 
original title but on the owner's duplicate as well. It is for this reason that 
the Court <i>a quo</i> considered the petition improper though reserving to him 
the right to take any other action that may be appropriate to protect his 
interest. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We do not find error in this 
regard. Since there are third parties who claim to have acquired the property in 
good faith and for value, there seems to be no other more appropriate recourse 
than to take a separate action in court in order that the parties concerned may 
have an opportunity to defend their interests. Republic Act No. 26 which 
provides for reconstitution of titles does not afford such an opportunity for 
the proceedings therein authorized are merely summary in nature and do not cover 
controversial issues. These have to be threshed out in a separate action. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the order appealed from is 
affirmed. <span class="GramE">Costs against petitioner.</span>
