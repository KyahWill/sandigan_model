<p class="BODY">In spite of the facts established by petitioner’s evidence, as

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING THE PRESENT PETITION FOR
NATURALIZATION."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find the first assignment of error to be without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a fact that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was born on <st1:date year="1939" day="17" month="10">October 17, 1939</st1:date> and grew up in <span class="SpellE">Naga-Naga</span> (now Alicia), <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
<st1:state><st1:place><span class="GramE">del</span></st1:place></st1:state> <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.</st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that from 1957 to 1961 he
lived in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, it is nonetheless
true that his stay in said city was merely temporary and was due to the fact
that he spent those four years studying Chemical Engineering at the <span class="SpellE">Mapua</span> <span style="">Institute of
Technology.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such temporary stay in the
City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> for that particular purpose did not imply
that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had abandoned his residence in the municipality
of his birth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the State’s contention that the peti­tion and notice
of hearing were not published for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of
general circulation, <span class="GramE">We</span> find that according to <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "I", the same were pub­lished consecutively <span style="">on May 21 </span>and 28 and June 4, of 1960,
in the local newspaper "EL SUR", which was of general cir­culation in
the City of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> and other parts of Min­danao.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Moreover, the certificate
issued by the Bureau of Printing (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
"H") shows that the petition was also published in three consecutive
issues of the Official Gazette.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the question of whether or not <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
had a lucrative employment (second assignment of error), the latter's evidence
shows that he was at first an employee of the State Glass Supply at a monthly
salary of P150.00; that in 1962 his total income went up to P5<span class="GramE">,600.00</span> be­cause his yearly salary at the State Glass Supply
had been increased to P3,000.00, and besides, he earned around P2,600.00 a year
doing a salesman's work for <span class="SpellE">Jaba</span> Trading.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General argues that this unusual increase in <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> income is highly suspicious and that it is not
improbable that he and his employers had resorted to fictitious or deceptive
arrangements to show that he had a lucrative employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While We agree with the Solicitor General
that these fictitious or deceptive arrangements are a <u>possibility</u>, still
We cannot definitely say that it is a fact in the instant case because, at the
time <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> claims he had such yearly income, he
was already in the senior year of Chemical Engineering <span style="">in </span>the <span class="SpellE">Mapua</span>
Institute of Technology and it is at least probable that, due to his training
and qualifications, his yearly salary as General Clerk of the State Glass
Supply located at 681 <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. <span class="SpellE">Cristo</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> had been increased to P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, and that during his spare time he earned annual
commis­sions amounting to P2,600.00 as a casual salesman of <span class="SpellE">Jaba</span>
<span style="">Trading also </span>of the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
(See <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">"A" &amp;
"B").</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the
trial court found in this connection that "this income of the petitioner
for 1961 had been declared by him in his income tax returns (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "<span class="GramE">C") and in his statement
of assets and liabilities (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
"D").</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span><span style="">relation to the third assignment of error,
the Solicitor General says the following in his brief:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner left <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> for <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
in 1957 (Annex "A").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
that year up to the time of the hearing in 1962, he has always been in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
by <span style="">reason of his </span>employment and
studies at the <span class="SpellE">Mapua</span> Institute of Tech­nology.</blockquote>

<blockquote>His witnesses Leon <span class="SpellE">Uro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Montojo</span>, both of whom
are residents of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, never had contacts with
petitioner in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They therefore can­not be said to have the
opportunity to observe the conduct and demeanor of petitioner, <span style="">much less can they be said to have such a </span>close
personal association with him as to consider themselves to be intimates (<span class="SpellE">Chong</span> Pong v. Republic, L-9153, May 17, 1957; <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> <span class="SpellE">Suat</span> v. Republic, G.R. No.
L-9224, <st1:date year="1957" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1957</st1:date>)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We are inclined to agree with the Solicitor General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems obvious that, for a period of four
years (1957-61), <span class="SpellE">appellee’s</span> character witnesses -
both of whom resided in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> during that period of time -
did not have sufficient contact with him because he spent that period of time
in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That for this reason they had no reasonable
opportunity to observe his conduct during that period is quite easy to
see.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> presented no witness to testify regarding his
conduct while studying in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> -
which was for quite a long period of time.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the decision appealed from
is reversed and set aside on the sole ground that <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
character witnesses were not qualified to say - and their testimony did not
prove - that during <u>all the period</u> of his residence in the Philippines
he had ob­served good and irreproachable conduct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs.</span></p>
