				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Eight cases of truck replacement parts consigned to the <span class="SpellE">Silvertown</span> Auto Supply in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City were on March 18, 1963 discharged from the vessel "SS Pioneer
Ming" into the custody and possession of the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service of the defendant Republic of the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the shipment was delivered by the
Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service to the broker of the
consignee, one of the 8 ca­ses was found empty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The plaintiff Domestic Insurance Company of the Philippines, as insurer,
thereafter indemnified the consignee in the sum of P3<span class="GramE">,210.09</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By virtue of such payment, the plaintiff was
subrogated to the rights of the consignee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Demand for <span class="GramE">payment</span> was made on the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because the latter refus­ed to pay, the plaintiff filed the present
action in the Court of First Instance of Manila to recover the amount of P3<span class="GramE">,210.09</span> with interest, attorney's fees, expenses of
litigation and costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court on
September 8, 1966 adjudged "in favor of the plaintiff and against the
Republic of the Philippines, ordering the latter to pay the former the sum of
P3,210.09 with legal interest there­on, the sum of P500 as and for attorney's
fees and li­tigation expenses, and costs."</p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue in this appeal brought by the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is, by formulation of the Solicitor Gen­eral, "whether or not in the
operation of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service through the Bureau
of Customs," the Republic "may be sued without its consent." We
now proceed to resolve this issue, without waiting the briefs of the parties,
in order to save them and this Court needless expense of time, money and
effort.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule announced in <u>Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. vs.
Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service and Bureau of Customs</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
which was subsequently affirmed and reaffirmed in at least ten cases, is
hereunder quoted:</p>

<blockquote>"The fact that a non-corporate government entity performs a
function proprietary in nature does not necessarily result in its being <span class="SpellE">suable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If said
non-governmental function is undertaken as an incident to its governmental
function, there is no waiver thereby of the sovereign immunity from suit
extended to such gov­ernment entity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
*</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Bureau of Customs, to repeat, is part of the Department
of Finance (Sec. 81, Rev. Adm. Code), with no personality of its own apart from
that of the national government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its
primary function is governmental, that of assessing and collecting law­ful
revenues from imported articles and all other tariff and customs duties, fees,
charges, fines and penalties (Sec. 602, R.A. 1937).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this function, <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
service is a necessary incident.</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
*</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Clearly, therefore, although said <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
function may be deemed proprietary, it is a necessary incident of the primary
and governmental function of the Bureau of Customs, so that engaging in the
same does not necessarily render said Bureau liable to suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For otherwise, it could not
perform its governmental function with­out necessarily exposing itself to suit.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sovereign immunity, granted as to the end,
should not be denied as to the necessary means to that end.</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It must be remembered that statutory provi­sions waiving
State immunity from suit are strictly construed and that waiver of immunity,
being in derogation of sovereignty, will not be lightly inferred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(49 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>.,
States, Territories and Dependencies, Sec. 96, p. 314; Petty vs.
Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Com., 359 U.S. 275, 3 L. Ed. 804, 79 S. Ct.
785).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the provision autho­rizing
the Bureau of Customs to lease <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operations to
private parties, <span class="GramE">We</span> see no autho­rity to sue the said
Bureau in the instances where it undertakes to conduct said operation
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Bureau of Customs, acting as
part of the machinery of the national government in the operation of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service, pursuant to express legislative mandate
and as a neces­sary incident of its prime governmental function, is immune from
suit, there being no statute to the contrary."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We see no valid reason why the doctrine expounded in <u>Mobil</u>
should not control the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The remedy of the plaintiff is to be found in the pro­visions of
Act 3083 and Commonwealth Act 327 which (a) per­mit the presentation of money
claims, such as the one here sued on by the plaintiff, to the Auditor General
for adju­dication, (b) set forth the requisites to be fulfilled, and (c)
outline the procedure to be followed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> is set
aside, and this case is dismissed without costs.</p>
