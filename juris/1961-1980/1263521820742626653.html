				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by <i>certiorari</i> from the decision of the Court of Appeals
in CA-G.R. 33126-R dated July 25, 1967, affirming (a) the order of default
issued by the Court of First Instance of Manila in a collection suit instituted
by the Pacific Merchandising Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the
Pacific) against the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> Development Corporation
(hereinafter referred to as the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>), and (b) the
judgment by default in the same case which ordered the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>
<span style="">to </span>pay the Pacific the sum of
P143,282.76, with interest at the rate of 1% a month from July 21, 1962 until
fully paid, a sum equivalent to 12% of the principal obligation as attorney's
fees, and the costs of suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">A sales agreement dated August 10, 1962 was entered into by and
between the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> and the Pacific, by virtue of which
the latter agreed to supply the former roofing and related materials and to be
responsible for their installation at the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> City
public market, for a total cost of P238,447.76, exclusive of materials that may
be additionally required during construction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the terms of payment specified in the mentioned agreement,
the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> covenanted that it shall (a) deposit the <span style="">sum of P106,300 with the Pacific upon the
signing of the con­tract; (b) pay the balance of the price, payable within 45
days after completion of the deliveries and installation of the roof­ing
materials, but not later than 95 days from the date of deli­very thereof to the
job site in case their installation is delayed due to the fault of the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>; and (c) furnish the Pacific a deed of assignment,
properly acknowledged, recognized and/or accepted by the Government Service
Insurance System, providing direct payment to the Pacific in an amount equal to
P142,144.76, representing the balance of the amount involved, within 45 days
after completion of the installation of the roofing materials by the Pacific.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Several days before the date of the aforesaid agreement, or, on <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1962</st1:date>, the Pacific already
made deliveries to the job site at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
of roofing materials to be used in the construction of the mentioned <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
public market.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The total value of the
materials delivered plus the cost of installa­tion from <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1962</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="10">October 19, 1962</st1:date> amounted to P250,312.76.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 19, 1963 the Pacific filed with the Court of First
Instance of Manila a complaint against the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>
(docketed as civil case 54547), alleging in essence that only P107,030 of <span style="">the total obligation of the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> under their agreement had been paid and that the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> refused to pay the balance thereof in the amount of
P143,282.76.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On August 5, 1963 the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> filed a
motion with the trial court requesting for an extension of 15 days, to expire
on August 20, 1963, within which to file its answer, counsel stating that ---</p>

<blockquote>"The inability to prepare and finalize defendant's answer on
time is due to the burden of other equally if not more urgent professional work
on the part of the undersigned counsel."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The said motion was granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 16, 1963 the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Naga</span></span><span style=""> </span>filed
another motion for an additional extension of 10 days within which to file its
responsive pleading, counsel alleging this time that the <span style="">extension ---<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“... is requested for the reason that counsel is presently
verifying certain material facts and information relative to the transaction
object of the plaintiff's complaint, which are needed in order that they may be
able to intelligently prepare defendant's answer, and such verification may not
be accomplished in time for the completion of the answer on or before the
aforesaid due date.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The court <u>a quo</u>, however, denied
the foregoing motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="8">August 22, 1963</st1:date>,
a day after receipt of the said order of denial, counsel for the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> moved for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="8">August
 23, 1963</st1:date> the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> filed a supplemental
motion for the admission of its answer and for the denial of the Pacific's
motion, filed the day before, to declare the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> in
default.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court below denied the <span class="SpellE">Naga's</span>
motions and declared it in default in an order dated <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1963</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> filed a motion to set aside the default
order on the following grounds:</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The court's order was entered after the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> had tendered its answer to the complaint, so that
judicial discretion should have been exercised in favor of its admission,
following the policy laid down in <u>Coombs vs. Santos</u>, 24 Phil. 446
(1913).</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->In the process of drafting the <span style="">answer to </span>the complaint, counsel for
the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> found it necessary to make further verifica­tion
and re-checking of the amount claimed as well as the articles alleged to have
been shipped to <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> <span style="">City, </span>considering that the total amount involved was more than
P100,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This took <span style="">some doing as the data to be </span>checked

order of default was issued merely on the strength of the Pacific's
representation that the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> does not have an office
in <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> <span style="">City,
</span>which is belied not only by the fact that the <span class="SpellE">Naga's</span>
articles of incorporation state that its principal office is in <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> City but as well by the Pacific's allegation in its
complaint that the materials in question were sold and delivered to the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> at <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> City through the
Manila Railroad Company.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> has good and
substantial defenses, such as that the claim was prematurely filed, <span style="">it being the express agreement of the parties
that payments after the completion and acceptance of the work will be </span>satisfied
out of the releases of the loan applied for by the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Naga</span></span><span style=""> </span>to the
GSIS which, due to the latter's refusal to release, prompted the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> to file a complaint against the <span style="">GSIS to </span>obtain release of payments
(civil case 52637 of <span style="">the Court of First
Instance of </span>Manila).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the said
litigation, the Pacific even filed a motion for intervention, but later
withdrew the same.</p>

has been <span style="">no </span>delivery to, and
acceptance by, the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> of the complete installation
work made by the Pacific.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>, through an affidavit of merit
executed by its president and attached to the motion <span style="">to set </span>aside the order of default, stated additionally that ---</p>

<blockquote>“... the result of the complete verification and re-checking
conducted shows that there were several amounts advanced and paid for by the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> Development Corporation for the account of the
plaintiff Pacific Merchandising Corporation, such as the sum of P600.00 which
was paid some­time in May, 1963 to sub-contractor Marquez upon the request of
the plaintiff, which advances should be taken into account of and considered in
the final accounting."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, however, in an order dated <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1963</st1:date>, denied the motion to set
aside the order of default, for the following reasons:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(a)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> does not have
a valid defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not dis­pute
the completion of the delivery and the installation of the materials in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sales agreement provides
that payment for the services and materials should be made within 45 days after
the materials are installed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
there is no provision in the agreement in question which makes the right of the
Pacific to collect the balance of the price agreed upon dependent on the re­lease
of the GSIS loan aforementioned.</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The failure of the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>
to file its answer within the ex­tended period was due to its fault and
negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For while in its first
motion for extension, counsel for the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> said that
the res­ponsive pleading could not be prepared and finalized due to the
pressure of urgent professional commitments, in its second motion for
extension, the <span class="SpellE">Naga's</span> counsel alleged that more time
was needed to verify the truth of the allegations in the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason adduced by the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>
in its first request for extension, according to the lower court, gave the lie
to the second request for extension.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(c)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->There was no real need to verify the truth of
the aver­ments contained in the Pacific's complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the complaint filed by the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> against the GSIS on <st1:date year="1963" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1963</st1:date>, it was therein expressly averred that the
<span class="SpellE">Naga</span> was indebted to the Pacific in the amount of
P143,282.76 --- a sum identical to the amount of the claim of the Pacific in
the instant suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the large
amount involved, there must have been a thorough inquiry made about the said
debt before the complaint against the GSIS was filed, as in fact, said the court,
the president of the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> admitted that several
conferences were held with representatives of the Pacific relative thereto.</p>

answer which the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> belatedly submitted for
admission admitted the correctness of the Pacific's claim to the last centavo,
but the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> sought avoidance thereof solely upon the
<span style="">grounds that the </span>same was not
yet demandable on account of <span style="">the <span class="SpellE">GSIS's</span> refusal to release the mentioned loan and that there
was as yet no delivery and acceptance of the installation work performed by the
Pacific at the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> City public market.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These grounds, how­ever, according to the
court, cannot be sustained under the express terms of the sales agreement in
question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1963</st1:date>,
after the <u>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> reception of the evidence
submitted by the Pacific, the trial court rendered its decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby ren­dered sentencing the
defendant to pay the plain­tiff the sum of P143, 282.76, with interest thereon
at the rate of 1% per month from <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="7">July
 21, 1962</st1:date>, until full payment is made, and a sum equivalent to 12%
of the unpaid obligation as attorney's fees and expenses of litigation,
together with <span style="">costs."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Naga</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">appealed the foregoing decision as well as the orders refusing it
recognition to participate in the trial below to the Court of Appeals; the
latter court, in a decision rendered on </span><st1:date year="1967" day="25" month="7"><span style="">July 25, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">, ruled in favor of the Pacific.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also denied the <span class="SpellE">Naga's</span>
motion for reconsideration in a resolution dated </span><st1:date year="1967" day="26" month="9"><span style="">September 26, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence, the present
recourse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This appeal raises the following issues:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) whether the trial court's order of
default and its order denying the <span class="SpellE">Naga's</span> motion to
set aside were correctly issued, and (b) whether the adjudication made by the
trial court on the merits is correct.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Anent the first issue, we are in agreement with
the Court of Appeals' <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the questioned
orders of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The granting of additional time within which to file an answer to
a complaint is a matter largely addressed to the sound discretion of a trial
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While trial courts are persuaded,
as a matter of policy, to adopt a basically flexible attitude in favor of the
defendant in this area of our adjective law, the defense should never be lulled
into the belief that whenever trial courts refuse a second request <span style="">for extension to </span><span style="">file an answer, the appellate courts will
grant relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where, as in the case at
bar, another full period of 15 days to file the answer had been granted,
substantial grounds must be shown by the party declared in default in order
that the questioned order of the trial court may be reversed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>,
in its second request for <span style="">extension </span>to
file its answer, pleaded that a verification of the truth of the averments
contained in the complaint would be needed because it had made certain
payments, such as the amount of </span><span style="">P</span><span style="">600, which should be deducted from the claim
of </span>the Pacific.</p>

<p class="BODY">This excuse, in our opinion, is flimsy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its belated answer filed with the trial
court for admission, the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> explicitly denied that
the claim asserted in the complaint was already due and demandable at that
time, the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> saying that the GSIS loan (the release
of which was claimed to be a pre-condition to the payment of the Paci­fic's
claim) had not yet been released and that the installation work done by the
Pacific had not yet been accepted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
written denial of this nature will not, in our view, take long to make, as,
indeed, the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Naga</span></span><span style="">, </span>after it came to know of the
default order, was able to make the said answer in less than three days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said belatedly filed answer, as we read
it, sufficiently joined issues with the material allegations of the Pacific's
complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">But even if it is true, as the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>
asserts, that it had made certain payments to the Pacific which should be deducted
from the amount of the claim, it would likewise have been a very simple matter
to allege that the complaint does not reflect the true amount due to the
Pacific because of payments made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
payments could then be proved at the trial, or, possibly, admitted at the
pre-trial conference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The essential
purpose of a responsive pleading is to secure a <span class="SpellE">joinder</span>
of the issues and not to lay down evidentiary matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is also another aspect of this case which, in our opinion,
should be counted as a factor in determining whether the trial court exercised
its discretion soundly in declaring the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> in
default and denying its motion to set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Pacific claims, as one of its defenses against the grant­ing
of the petition at bar, that the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> public market has been
operating since 1965 and that the questioned GSIS loan had already been
released as early as in March, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
<span class="SpellE">Naga's</span> sole answer to this is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Just because a debt will fall due in
the future does not mean that it can be filed now...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, settled is the rule that a com­plaint
that states no valid cause of action at the time it is filed cannot be cured by
the subsequent accrual of one (<span class="SpellE"><u>Surigao</u></span><u> Mine
Exportation Co., Inc. v. Harris</u>, et al., 68 Phil. 113, 119)."</p>

<p class="BODY">The correctness of the foregoing legal postulate is conceded, <span style="">but the </span>very fact of its assertion in
the case at bar demonstrates that the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> intends
solely to bank upon the trenches of what may perhaps be called a pure and
simple "lawyer's defense." <span style="">A
defense of </span>this nature <span style="">serves </span>precisely
to affect adversely, rather than enhance, the cause of the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Adverting next to the <span class="SpellE">Naga's</span> claim that
it has valid and meritorious defenses, we concur in the conclusion reached
below that the payment of the amount agreed upon in the sales agreement
aforementioned did not depend upon the availability of funds from the GSIS.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under the said agreement,
it was the obligation of </span>the Pacific <span style="">to supply and install the roofing materials needed for the construction
of the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Naga</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> public market; and for those materials
supplied and the services rendered, it was the reciprocal duty of the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> to pay the price agreed upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The GSIS, which was not a party to the said
contract, and, consequently, </span>not bound by <span style="">its terms, can­not be made to assume the obligation of the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> with­out its
consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its desire to speed up
payments </span>to <span style="">the Pacific, the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> could make arrangements, as </span>it <span style="">apparently attempted to do, so that the GSIS
would make its treasury warrants payable directly in favor of the Pacific on
the basis of the amounts the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> would certify to
the GSIS, but such an arrangement obviously cannot destroy or modify the direct
legal responsibility of the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> to the Pacific to
pay for what the latter gave and rendered to the former.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With reference to its other allegedly valid and meritorious
defense - that the materials in question had not yet been delivered and <span style="">that the </span>alleged installation job had
not yet been accepted by the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> - suffice it to
state that this defense involves a factual determination <span style="">with which this Court </span>is not concerned
in the instant appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The determination
made by the Court of Appeals on such factual matters is binding upon us.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We now turn <span style="">to </span>the second <span style="">issue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> contends that the Court of
Appeals erred in affirm­ing the judgment by default rendered by the trial court
ordering the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> to pay <span style="">(a) </span>the sum of P143,282.76, representing the unpaid balance of the
price of the materials delivered and services ren­dered by the Pacific; (b)
interest thereon at the rate of 1% per month from July 21, 1962 until the
principal is fully paid; (c) a sum equivalent to 12% of the unpaid principal as
attorney's fees; and (d) the costs of suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Bearing in mind the nature of the instant suit and considering
that the Court of Appeals' concurrence in the trial court's assessment of the
amount of P143,282.76 is in the nature of a factual finding, this Court cannot
now pass upon its correctness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two
courts below had before them the sales agreement between the parties, and to
what extent the parties complied with their respective <span class="SpellE"><span style="">prestations</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> was
purely a matter of evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, although we
cannot pass upon the correctness of the said assessment, </span><span style="">it is quite obvious that in the execution of
its judgment as affirmed by </span><span style="">the
Court of </span><span style="">Appeals, the trial
court cannot compel the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> to pay more than what it
actually owes the Pacific under the terms of their covenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Deeply imbedded in </span><span style="">our legal system </span><span style="">are </span><span style="">the principles that no man may unjustly </span><span style="">enrich himself at the expense of another, and that every person must,
in the exercise of his rights, act with justice, give everyone </span>his due,
and observe honesty and good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
these sacred legal postulates, the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> should,
therefore, be allowed, during the execution phase of the judgment, to present
proof of payments made by it to the Pacific which constitute proper deductions
from the principal amount it owes.</p>

<p class="BODY">The payment of interest on the principal sum ordered by the trial
court, on the other hand, presents certain aspects of law which properly lie
within the compass of the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">That portion of the decision of the trial court awarding inte­rest
appears to have been based upon a clause, contained in the invoices receipted
for by the <span class="SpellE">Naga's</span> agents at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
evidencing delivery of the materials contracted for, which states:</p>

<blockquote>"Terms:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All bills are
payable on demand unless otherwise agreed upon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Interest at 1% per month will be charged on overdue accounts. ...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties expressly submit to the
jurisdiction of the courts of the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
on any legal action arising out of this transaction and an additional 25%
representing attorney's fees and cost of collection will be charged by the
vendor."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Pan Pacific Company (Phil.) vs. Philippine Advertising
Corporation</u> (L-22050, June 13, 1968, 23 SCRA 977), we recognized the
binding effect of an identical provision appearing in the invoice slips issued
by the seller on the ground that since the buyer never expressed any objection
thereto, and, further, accepted and made use of the goods, the buyer is deemed
to have given its implied conformity to the terms of the said invoices.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
In that case, the terms and conditions of sale were embodied in a
letter-agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Following the ruling laid down in the said case, it is our
opinion that the <span class="SpellE">Naga's</span> failure to interpose any
objection to the invoices issued to it by the Pacific to evidence delivery of
the materials ordered as per their agreement and which contained the clause in
question on the payment of interest, should be deemed as an implied acceptance
by the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> of the said condition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, while we hold that the foregoing clause is bind­ing
upon the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>, it is also our view that the courts
below erred <span style="">in determining the time </span>from
which the said interest to be paid <span style="">should
be computed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">By the express terms </span>of
the sales agreement, the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> was to make a deposit
with the Pacific of a certain amount upon the <span style="">signing of the </span>agreement, and the balance of the price, to
include the value of additional materials, was to be paid <span style="">within 45 </span>days after completion of the
installation work.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record of this case shows that the installation of the
roofing materials was finished in "January, 1963." Hence, the
interest should be computed starting on the 46th day after <span style="">the completion of </span>the installation
work as it was only on this date that the <span class="SpellE">Naga's</span>
account became due.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no
definite statement <span style="">in </span>the record
of the exact day in January, 1963, we shall presume, for purposes of computing
the <span style="">interest due, that the installation
of the roofing materials was completed in the middle of </span>January, 1963,
that is, on January 15, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
presumption we base solely on equity, there being nothing in the record to show
exactly when the said installation work was completed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should there be any inaccuracy in this
presumption, <span class="SpellE"><u>vis</u>-<u>a-vis</u></span> the actual
completion date, it is our considered opinion that the difference involves a
trifling amount which, in law, may be overlooked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>De <span class="SpellE">minimis</span> non <span class="SpellE">curat</span> <span class="SpellE">lex</span></u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Concerning the payment of the attorney's fees which were fixed at
12% of the principal obligation to be paid by the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Naga</span></span><span style=""> </span>to the Pacific, it is our view that the said adjudication is
fair and reasonable, considering the various stages that the instant case has
passed and now reached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This 12% award
of attorney's fees should be computed on the basis of the outstanding
obligation of the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> to the Pacific as of the date
of the filing of the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">ACCORDINGLY</b><span style="">, </span>the judgment of the Court of Appeals
affirming the questioned orders of the trial court declaring the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> Development Corporation in default and denying its
motion to set aside the said default order, is hereby affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment by default, rendered by the trial court and affirmed
by the Court of Appeals, ordering the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>
Development Corporation to pay the Pacific Merchandising Corporation the amount
of P143,282.76 is hereby affirmed, with the qualification that the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> Development Corporation shall be allowed to prove,
during the process of execution of the said judgment, whatever payments it had
made to the Pacific Merchandising Corporation, either before or after the
filing of the complaint, which constitute a proper deduction from the principal
sum ordered to be paid.</p>

<p class="BODY">The interest ordered to be paid by the said judgment by default
shall be computed on the basis of the total amount due an outstanding as of the
46th day after <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1963</st1:date>,
at the rate of 1% per month until fully paid.</p>

<p class="BODY">The award of attorney's fees shall be computed on the basis of

Cf. Royal Shirt Factory, Inc. <i>vs</i>. Co Bon Tic, L-6313, May 14, 1954, 94
Phil. 995, where the provision in the invoice slip concerning the payment of
interest and attorney's fees was not considered binding upon the buyer because
he did not sign the slip, and because even if the buyer accepted and made use
of the goods sold, he had placed a written notation on the printed slip which
was construed as a demurrer to the printed provision on the payment of interest
and attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur, except as to the qualification allowing petitioner <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> Development an opportunity to prove partial payments
during the execution proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
believe that since <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> has been declared in default,
and no grave abuse of discretion having been found by the Court in that
respect, the judgment by default must stand and be executed, as is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>
has partially paid was part of the issues before the court before judgment was
rendered; <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>, thru its own fault, was not allowed
to prove any such partial payment by the trial court; surely, that issue cannot
be reopened during the execution because that would tend to vary the terms of
the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matters of equity
which can be raised in an execution <span class="GramE">proceeding,</span> cannot
to my mind, refer to those which the court could have passed upon before
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, there will be no
end to litigation, since <span class="GramE">conceivably,</span> the proof of
partial payments could be so seriously controversial as to need another full
blown trial, decision and appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
my view that under the circumstances, <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> can do no
more than address itself to the benignity or conscience of the private
respondent.</p>
