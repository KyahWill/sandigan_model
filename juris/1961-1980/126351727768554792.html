				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Prime objective of plaintiffs' complaint is to nullify the real
estate mortgage on certain parcels of land - covered by Original Certificates
of Title Nos. 739, 742, and 743 - located in <span class="SpellE">Sibalom</span>,
Antique, allegedly executed by plaintiff Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>
in favor of defendant spouses Mariano <span class="SpellE">Vagilidad</span> and
Luz <span class="SpellE">Managuit</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> is the donor and
plaintiff Consuelo G. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>, the <span class="SpellE">donee</span>
of said parcels of land, amongst others, by a deed of donation claimed to have
been executed prior to the real estate mortgage afore­said.</p>

<p class="BODY">The history of this case may be traced as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> was the owner of ten
(10) parcels of land of the <span class="SpellE">Sibalom</span> Cadastre,
Antique, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>: Lots 1000, 1002 and 1004 covered
by Original Certificate of Title 739; 1/3 share of Lot 45, Original Certificate
of Title 740; Lots 756 and 765, Original Certificate of Title 741; Lot 7354,
Original Certificate of Title 742; Lot 977, Original Certificate of Title 743;
and Lots 385 and 419, Original Certificate of Title 744.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1955" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1955</st1:date>,
Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> executed in favor of Consuelo G. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> a <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> deed of
donation <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vivos</u></span> covering all the
aforementioned lots, acceptance of which was also set forth in the same
document.</p>

<p class="BODY">For purposes of registration of the deed of donation, Consuelo
asked Carmen where the titles were.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was referred to Carmen's elder brother, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>, who
informed Consuelo that the titles were in the possession of the defendants <span class="SpellE">Vagilidad</span> and <span class="SpellE">Managuit</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span> learned
that <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> was
indebted to the <span class="SpellE">Vagilidads</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Together with <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>,
Consuelo G. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> went to defendants on <st1:date year="1955" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1955</st1:date> and asked for the
certificates of title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants
refused to deliver them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reason for
refusal was that it was Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> who owed
them money and they would part with the titles only when they were paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1956" day="8" month="1">January
 8, 1956</st1:date>, Consuelo G. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>, accompanied
by <span class="SpellE">Agripina</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabrine</span>, made
another effort to procure the titles, but it was again in vain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Towards the end of January 1956, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> himself requested
for the return of the titles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
also rebuffed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In all of those visits,
defendants were made to understand that the titles were needed to enable
Consuelo to register the donation in her favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1956" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1956</st1:date>,
plaintiff Consuelo G. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> was forced to go to the
cadastral court (Cadastral Case No. 24, G.L.R.O. Rec. 1232) with a prayer that
defendants be compelled to surrender the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> titles
to the lands donated.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Because of the court's order of <st1:date year="1956" day="10" month="7">July
 10, 1956</st1:date> directing defendants to surrender the titles to therein
peti­tioner Consuelo G. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> within five days, the
titles were finally turned over to plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Those titles were cancelled, and new transfer certificates of title were
issued in the name of Consuelo G. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was at the hearing of the petition of plaintiff Consuelo G. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> for the surrender of the titles that plaintiffs
first learned that there was a mortgage allegedly executed on February 14, 1956
by Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> in favor of defendant Mariano <span class="SpellE">Vagilidad</span> covering some of the lands donated, namely, those
described in Original Certi­ficates of Title 739, 742 and 743, and annotated at
the back thereof on March 2, 1956.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
mortgage annotations, therefore, also appear at the back of Consuelo's titles
issued in lieu thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1956" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1956</st1:date>,
the donor Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>, the <span class="SpellE">donee</span>
Consuelo G. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>, assisted by her husband <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>, commenced the
present suit against defendant spouses Mariano <span class="SpellE">Vagi­lidad</span>
and Luz <span class="SpellE">Managuit</span> to annul the real estate mortgage.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
They averred that without the knowledge and consent of Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>, defendants came to possess Original Certificates
of Title 739, 742 and 743 and fraudulently brought about the false execution of
the mortgage aforesaid in their effort to collect money due them by way of
loans extended to <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>,
brother of Carmen; that plaintiff Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>
had absolutely nothing to do with said loans.</p>

<p class="BODY">The gist of defendants' answer and amended answer was that the
mortgage was executed as security for loans granted Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>
on various occasions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was in the
second amended answer that for the first time defendants alleged that the
donation relied upon by plaintiffs, the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span>, was
made in fraud of creditors.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the trial was going on, that is, on <st1:date year="1960" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1960</st1:date>, plaintiffs' counsel filed a
notice of death of party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel
informed the court that plaintiff Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>
died on <st1:date year="1960" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1960</st1:date>,
and proposed that <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>,
Carmen's brother and the nearest of kin, be substituted as party-plaintiff in
place of the deceased Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A hitch developed when, on <st1:date year="1960" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1960</st1:date>, this same <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> lodged a complaint against herein
plaintiffs Consuelo G. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> docketed as Civil Case 207 of the Court of
First Instance of Antique<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
praying that the <st1:date year="1955" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1955</st1:date>
deed of donation heretofore mentioned be declared null and void.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
With this development, we find defendants' counsel joining plaintiffs, by
motion of <st1:date year="1960" day="5" month="9">September 5, 1960</st1:date>,
in the substitution of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Ytur­ralde</span>
as party-plaintiff in place of the deceased Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was plaintiffs' turn now to object to the
substitution of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>
upon the averments that there was no conflict of interests between surviving
plaintiffs and <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>
before the death of plaintiff Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>, but
that after the death of the latter, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> filed the suit aforesaid to annul the donation;
that for this reason, he is not the ideal person to substitute for the late
Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>; that since Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> in her lifetime had already donated her
properties, the proceedings in this case could continue without the need of
having Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> substituted as
plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its order of <st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1960</st1:date>, the court ruled
that there was no necessity for substitution and denied defendants' motion of <st1:date year="1960" day="5" month="9">September 5, 1960</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial on the merits, the court rendered its judgment of
July 6, 1962 declaring null and void the deed of mortgage dated February 14,
1956 as well as the registration of said document in the Office of the Register
of Deeds of Antique, and the annotation thereof as an <span class="SpellE">incumbrance</span>
on O.C.T. Nos. 739, 742 and 743 and on T.C.T. Nos. N-2692, N-2693 and N-2694,
all of the land records of Antique; directing the Register of Deeds of Antique
to cancel said <span class="SpellE">incumbrance</span> on said certificates of
title; and ordering the defendants to pay plaintiffs P500.00 as attorneys'
fees, and the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants appealed direct to this Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">1. The threshold question defendants' brief presents is the trial
court's denial of their motion to have <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> substituted for the deceased Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> as co-plaintiff.</p>

<p class="BODY">The power of a court to drop or add parties to an action "on
motion of any party or on its own initiative at any stage of the action and on
such terms as are just" is recognized by Section 11, Rule 3, both of the
old and the new Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
problem before us, therefore, turns upon the question of whether or not the
plaintiffs <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> may prosecute the complaint by
themselves, independently of the deceased Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is elementary in law and jurisprudence that an action for
annulment of a contract "may be instituted by all those who are thereby
obliged principally or <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon the other hand, it has also been said that the nullity of a deed or
contract may be taken advantage of only by persons who bear such relation to
the contract that it interferes with their rights and interests.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It is likewise the jurisprudence of this Court that a "person who is not a
party obliged principally or <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span> in a
contract may exercise an action for nullity of the contract if he is prejudiced
in his rights with respect to one of the contracting parties, and can show the
detriment which would positively result to him from the contract in which he
had no intervention."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In reality, the deceased Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>
had no material interest in the suit, for the reason that she had already
parted with the ownership of the properties involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By joining as plaintiff, Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> in effect confirmed the deed of donation and,
consequently, the right claimed by the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span> to
clear their title to the properties of the mortgage allegedly executed by
Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> in favor of said defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in this posture that we say that the
substitution of the deceased Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> has no
bearing on the issues in the case brought by plaintiffs against defend­ants.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span> whose title to the
properties is directly affected by, the real estate mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a real right, a recorded mortgage follows
the property whoever is the owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
successors-­in-interest of Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>, the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span> are certainly prejudiced by the existing mortgage
annotated on their titles which were issued to them upon registration of the
donation in their favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As long as the
mortgage remains <span class="SpellE">unannulled</span>, the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span>
are bound to pay the mortgage debt and its interests or face foreclosure of the
mortgage.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is thus no other conclusion than that the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span> are the real party-plaintiffs in interest who can
go forward with the present complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>
is certainly not a proper person to be joined as co-plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By his complaint in Civil Case 207, he has truly
assumed a position inimical to plaintiffs, the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span>,
<u>and</u> <u>the</u> <u>deceased</u> <u>Carmen</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Yturralde</u></span>,
in his attempt to impugn the deed of donation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, he wants the properties involved for his own upon the averment
that he is the legal heir of the deceased Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, he (<span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>) testified in this case for defendants to
sustain the validity of the mortgage. Correctly then did the lower court say in
its order of <st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1960</st1:date>
that: "We cannot have two plaintiffs maintaining diametrically opposite
views."</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the non-substitution at best is a harmless error
which "does not affect the substantial rights of" defendants.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
They have no cause for complaint.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. Defendants next protest that in the resolution of the dispute, the
court below did not find it necessary to pass upon the validity of the donation
made by Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> over her properties in favor
of Consuelo G. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court's expressed view is that such
"is not necessary for the determination of the case".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More important still is that, in the lower
court's opinion, "that question is now in issue in Civil Case No. 207 of
this Court (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2) and will there be decided."
Parenthetically, Civil Case 207, as heretofore mentioned, is a suit filed by <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>, brother of
Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>, against herein plaintiffs, the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span>, to annul the donation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As previously stated (footnote 4), plaintiff,
the defeated party, brought that case before us on appeal in G.R. L-22158.</p>

<p class="BODY">We perceive of no legal right on the part of defendants to assail
the validity of the donation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Valid or
void, the donation would not affect their real right as mortgagees, which
attaches to the properties independent of whether the owner thereof be the
deceased Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> or the present plaintiffs.
And this, on the assumption that their mortgage is valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They may not seek the annulment of the
donation because they cannot show prejudice to them resulting from said
donation in which they had no inter­vention.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor can defendants ask the courts to strike down the donation as
having been executed in fraud of creditors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That donation cannot defraud, much less prejudice, defendants in any
way.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
They are secured by the registered mortgage.</p>

<p class="BODY">More on this point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
original and amended answers did not assail this donation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only in the second amended answer that
defendants charged that such donation was contrived to defeat the creditors of
Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>, amongst whom were defendants.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Inspite</span> of this specific allegation, no evidence at all was
presented by defendants to prove that the deed of donation was a document the
execution of which was tainted with fraud.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since the deed of donation is a public document, it enjoys the
presumption of validity. It is evidence even as against third persons of the
fact which gives rise to its execution and of the date of the latter.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3. The preliminary questions disposed of, we now go to the meat of
the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants decry the finding below
that the deed of mortgage of <st1:date year="1956" day="14" month="2">February
 14, 1956</st1:date> is null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
question of fact is here involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs' evidence, as testified to by two maids, Flora <span class="SpellE">Gar­cinela</span> and Angelica <span class="SpellE">Presente</span>,
shows the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About the middle of
February 1956, defendant Luz <span class="SpellE">Managuit</span>, a niece of
Carmen <span class="SpellE">Ytur­ralde</span>, went to the house of the latter
sometime after lunch with a piece of cake.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Luz prevailed upon Carmen to eat it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After Carmen did, she fell asleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was still asleep when suppertime came.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not long after <st1:time minute="0" hour="22">10:00
 o'clock p.m.</st1:time>, when the maids retired, Flora heard someone open the
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She saw Luz enter and approach
Carmen's bed with a bundle of papers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Luz got hold of the right hand of Carmen, applied something to the thumb
and pressed said thumb to the papers she brought with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Luz then folded the papers again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she was about to leave, Flora inquired
from her as to what she did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Luz
answered: "Just keep quiet, you have nothing to do with it." Flora
woke up her husband and Angelica, and told, them what Luz did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Flora and Angelica went to Carmen. When they
saw that her thumb was stained with ink, they washed her thumb because she
might get angry when she would wake up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Carmen slept through it all.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court came to the conclusion that the papers Luz
brought with her could have been no other than the mortgage papers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A meticulous dig into the evidence by His
Honor, Judge Juan de <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>, the trial judge, is
reflected in his findings, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"From the evidence of the defendants themselves, <u>it</u> <u>has</u>
<u>been</u> <u>established</u> <u>that</u> <u>the</u> <u>defendants</u> <u>loaned</u>
<u>money</u> <u>and</u> <u>goods</u> <u>to</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Cipriano</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span></u> <u>and</u> <u>not</u> <u>to</u> <u>Carmen</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>Yturralde</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is evident from the 'vales' Exhibits G, G-1, G-2 and G-3 which are
all signed by <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> as well as from <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H where it appears that the rest of the 'vales' were
also signed by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact makes
understandable the reluctance of Luz <span class="SpellE">Managuit</span> to
produce said 'vales' in Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She at
first denied that she had them, saying that they have been lost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she was finally cornered in
cross-examination into admitting that she had the receipts and was then ordered
by the Court to produce them, she brought only these four receipts and claimed
she could not find the rest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Luz <span class="SpellE">Managuit</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> sought to explain the latter's signatures
on the receipts by stating that <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> was
authorized by Carmen to secure the loans from the defendants.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a> <u>Carmen's</u>
<u>circumstance</u> <u>in</u> <u>life</u> <u>does</u> <u>not</u> <u>indicate</u>
<u>that</u> <u>she</u> <u>needed</u> <u>any</u> <u>loan</u> <u>of</u> <u>money</u>
<u>or</u> <u>goods</u> <u>to</u> <u>maintain</u> <u>herself</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the defense witnesses
themselves, Carmen received 252 <span class="SpellE">cavanes</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> and 20 <span class="SpellE">cavanes</span> of mongo
yearly from her lands, and a monthly pension of P65.00 from the U.S.
Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had nobody but herself
to support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She lived frugally. It was
not shown that her illness was such as to require expensive treat­ment or
medication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely she could not have
spent all her income and ran up an indebtedness of P2,000.00 yearly besides.</blockquote>

<blockquote>There is evidence in the record that <span class="SpellE"><u>Cipriano</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>Yturralde</u></span> <u>is</u> <u>somewhat</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u>
<u>prodigal</u> <u>or</u> <u>wastrel</u>. Susana <span class="SpellE">Duatin</span>
testified that he owed several people money, including herself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An examination of the 'vales' of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> in favor of Susana <span class="SpellE">Duatin</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. D, D-1 to D-5) seems to support this view. The
'vales' are each for five <span class="SpellE">cavanes</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> taken successively on March 8, 1955, March 23, 1955,
April 2, 1955, April 4, 1955, April 13, 1955, and July 23, 1955.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be noted that he took a total of 30 <span class="SpellE">cavanes</span> within a period of hardly more than four months, 15
<span class="SpellE">cavanes</span> of which were between April 2 and April 13,
1955, or only 11 days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Carmen and <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>, and their household help, could not have eaten or
needed 7 1/2 <span class="SpellE">cavanes</span> of rice during that period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only conclusion is that <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> must have taken the loan either in <span class="SpellE">palay</span> or in money and used it <u>for</u> <u>his</u> <u>own</u>
<u>purposes</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>While it is true that <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> was the
one who owed the money to the defendants, it may still be possible that Carmen,
out of love for her brother had agreed to shoulder payment of the debt.
However, the defendants did not allege this matter in their answer and their
evidence did not touch on that point.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their theory is that it was Carmen who contracted the obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even this possibility was met by the
evidence of the plaintiffs, thru the testimony of Susana <span class="SpellE">Duatin</span>,
that she heard Luz try to collect from Carmen the indebtedness of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>, and <u>Carmen angrily</u> <u>refused</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>It is against this background that the Court has to inquire into
and determine what were the true cir­cumstances that attended the preparation
and execution of the deed of mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The plaintiffs claim, thru the testimony of Flora <span class="SpellE">Garcinela</span>
and Angelica <span class="SpellE">Presente</span>, that Luz <span class="SpellE">Managuit</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
approached Carmen while the latter was asleep and impressed her thumb on the
pages of a document that Luz had with her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The defendants maintain, thru the testimony of Luz herself, that the
document was signed by Carmen voluntarily in the pre­sence of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Novisteros</span>, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Valente</span> and the
ins­trumental witnessed Felix <span class="SpellE">Sabrine</span> and Jesus
Morales.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also claimed by the
defendants that even admitting the testimony of Flora and Angelica, there is no
evidence that the papers carried by Luz were the document of mort­gage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no merit to this claim, since this
is the only document that bears the <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> of
Carmen dated February of 1956, and if <u>Luz</u> <u>had</u> <u>caused</u> <u>Carmen's</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>thumbmark</u></span> <u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>placed</u> <u>on</u>
<u>document</u> <u>in</u> <u>that</u> <u>month</u>, <u>it</u> <u>can</u> <u>be</u>
<u>no</u> <u>other</u> <u>than</u> <u>this</u> <u>one</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court finds the narration made by Flora and Angelica <u>clear</u>
<u>and</u> <u>believable</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>They</u>

<u>been</u> <u>easily</u> <u>disconcerted</u> <u>if</u> <u>their</u> <u>stories</u>

<u>the</u> <u>impression</u> <u>of</u> <u>telling</u> <u>the</u> <u>truth</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense tried to discredit their
testimony by evidence that they did not live with Carmen as claimed by
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This evidence consists of a group
picture of the members of Carmen's household (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 7)
in which Flora and Angelica do not appear, and of the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> <span class="SpellE">Basañez</span> and Carlos <span class="SpellE">Sasi</span>, <span class="SpellE">barriomates</span> of the two, who
said that Flora and Angelica were both living in their respective barrios in
February of 1956. Said evidence is not con­vincing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was shown that the picture was taken in
1953 or 1954, long before Flora and Angelica came to live with Carmen, and they
could not therefore have been included in the picture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Basañez</span> and Carlos <span class="SpellE">Sasi</span>, <u>the</u>
<u>Court</u> <u>does</u> <u>not</u> <u>find</u> <u>the</u> <u>same</u> <u>worthy</u>
<u>of</u> <u>credit</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could have
been possible for them to remember in 1961, when they gave their testimony,
whether or not a particular <span class="SpellE">barriomate</span> was in the
barrio in the month of February, 1956.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>The</u> <u>testimony</u> <u>of</u> <u>Luz</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Vagilidad</u></span>, <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>other</u> <u>hand</u>,

to produce <span class="SpellE">Cipriano's</span> 'vales' has already been
mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She claimed that the deed of
mortgage was prepared by <span class="SpellE">Atty</span>, <span class="SpellE">Novisteros</span>
in the house of Carmen on <st1:date year="1956" day="14" month="2">February 14,

</span>If this was true, then Atty. <span class="SpellE">Novisteros</span> should
have typed the date and place of execution along with the rest of the
document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the spaces for these
particulars were left in blank, which can only indicate that the document was
prepared at some other time and place.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Luz' testimony about the execution of the docu­ment was

<p class="BODY">A rule long familiar is that appellate courts, when faced with a
conflict of testimony, are bound to sustain the lower court's find­ings on the
evidence unless there appears in the record some fact or circumstance of weight
and influence which has been overlooked or the significance of which has been
misinterpreted<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
or unless some conclusion established from the facts is inconsistent with the
court findings or there is some inherent weakness in the evidence upon which
the conclusion is based.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
And this is because the trial judge is unquestionably in a superior position
to, gauge the credibility of those who take the witness seat before him, He has
the opportunity to size up the appearance, the demeanor, <u>the</u> <u>manner</u>
<u>of</u> <u>testifying</u>, the probability or improbability of the testimony,
of the witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the trial
court has a first hand advantage to assess the value to be given the testimony
of a witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this distance, we find ourselves unwilling to say that we are
better prepared to ascertain the relative weight to be given the testimony of
those who appeared and testified in the court below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have nothing before us but the cold words
written into the trans­cript.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in
this context that we say that we cannot downgrade the findings of the lower
court just quoted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our review of the
record does not yield any cause or reason why we should overturn the said
findings.</p>

<p class="BODY">More than these, the facts and circumstances spread over the
record plainly and manifestly demonstrate a pattern of conduct on the part of
defendants aimed at assuring themselves of payment from the deceased Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> for debts incurred by the latter's brother, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The receipts of indebtedness produced in
court (Exhibits G, G-1, G-2 and G-3) all show that the different vales on
different occasions during the year 1954 were signed by <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> in favor of defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The minutes of the court's session of July
10, 1956 in the cadastral proceedings (Exhibit H) to procure surrender by
defendants to plaintiffs of the Torrens titles list 46 vales signed by <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> for the period
from March 17, 1953 to January 11, 1955.</p>
