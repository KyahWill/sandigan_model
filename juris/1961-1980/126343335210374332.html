respondent <span class="SpellE">Tansiong</span> Lim's favor, of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span> in an action for sum of money
filed by petitioner against Lim.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1964</st1:date>,
petitioner International Harvester Macleod, Inc. and private respondent <span class="SpellE">Tansiong</span> Lim entered into a dealership agreement (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">"A", "B" and
"C") whereby the latter was appointed dealer of the former in the
island </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span class="GramE">province</span></st1:placetype><span class="GramE"> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Bohol</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span class="GramE"> for the sale and service of International trucks and equipment and
farm tractors.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dealership
agreements had for their consideration discounts and terms laid down in
petitioner's Schedule of Discounts and Terms of Dealer­ship Applying to Goods
Covered by Dealer Sales and Service Agreements (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"D").</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="14" month="9">September 14, 1965</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a Complaint with prayer for Preliminary Writ of Attachment
with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span> for the
recovery of the sum of P76<span class="GramE">,806.88</span> allegedly due it
from respondent Lim under their dealership agreement and which the latter had
refused to pay in spite of repeated oral and written demands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then prayed that a Writ of Preliminary
Attachment be issued against respondent Lim's properties as security for the
satisfaction of any judgment that may be recovered; and that respondent Lim be
ordered to pay the sum of P76<span class="GramE">,806.88</span>, with interest
from August 1, 1965 until fully paid, the sum of P19,000.00 as and for
attorney's fees and the costs of suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 28, 1965, respondent Lim filed his Answer averring
that he had asked for a liquidation of his accounts with petitioner, which the
latter neglected to give him; that without such liquidation, he could not
determine his indebtedness, if any; and that in the remote possibility that petitioner's
demand is correct, he, nevertheless, has no obligation to pay the same for the
reason that the former has monetary obligations to him which were much more
than its claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By way of counterclaim,
respondent Lim alleged that as a consequence of the rigid import controls
imposed by the Government, petitioner's dollar allocations had been reduced
resulting in a tremendous decrease of its volume of sales in 1958; that in
order to remedy the situation as it was expected that further reduction of its
dollar allocations would be made the following year, petitioner's President,
Mr. Paul Wood, asked him, prior to February 25, 1959, to bring to the attention
of then President Carlos P. Garcia the detrimental effects of the import
control on petitioner's business and on the entire nation; that on February 28,
1959, Mr. Wood delivered to him the letter dated February 25, 1959, giving him
authority to meet President Garcia, together with a copy of General Letter No.
77 addressed to all employees of petitioner; that on the same date, Mr. Wood
verbally promised to give him two percent of petitioner's volume of sales for
the duration of the term of President Garcia, should its business improve as a
result of his mission; that as a result of his inter­vention, petitioner's
volume of sales increased in the ensuing fiscal years; and that, consequently,
he is entitled to receive 2% of petitioner's total volume of sales from March
1, 1959 to December 31, 1961, when President Garcia's term of office expired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then prayed for the dismissal of the
Complaint, the payment of his share of 2% of petitioner's total volume of sales
from <st1:date year="1959" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1959</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1961</st1:date>, upon a determination
of said amount, as well as the sums of P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as
moral damages and P5,000.00 as attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that in a letter dated <st1:date year="1965" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1965</st1:date>, petitioner advised respondent Lim of
the termination of their dealership agreement effective <st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, respondent Lim filed a Supplemental Counterclaim against
petitioner for the amount of P170<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> by way of
damages by reason of the illegal termination of their dealership agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its Answer to respondent Lim's counterclaims, petitioner
denied knowledge of his agreement with Mr. Paul Wood regarding the payment of
2% of the total volume of its sales contending that the increase in its volume
of sales was not due to respondent Lim's intervention as he had nothing to do
with the management of its business; that not being a stockholder, he is not
entitled to any percentage of its volume of sales; and that it has all the
right to terminate their dealership agreement for violation thereof by respondent
Lim.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1966</st1:date>,
after the pre-trial, the trial Court issued a Resolution denying petitioner's
Motion for dismissal of the Complaint without prejudice, as well as
respondent's Motion to Dismiss for petitioner's non-appearance, and ordered
respondent Lim to pay petitioner, within ninety (90) days from notice, the sum
of P63<span class="GramE">,453.67</span>, with interest at the legal rate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an Order dated <st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1966</st1:date>, the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
set aside the Resolution of <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="3">March 21,
 1966</st1:date> and dismissed the Complaint and counterclaim with
prejudice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in an Order dated <st1:date year="1967" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1967</st1:date>, the Resolution of <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1966</st1:date> was reinstated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, trial was held with respect to the other issues,
including respondent Lim's counterclaim regarding the payment of his commission
of 2% of petitioner's total volume of sales, pursuant to his agreement with Mr.
Paul Wood.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="11" month="10">October 11, 1971</st1:date>,
the trial Court rendered judgment, decreeing:</p>

TIME SIX (6) YEARS AFTER THE AGREEMENT WAS MADE AND ONLY THE FORM OF A
COUNTERCLAIM AND (B) WHEN THE CONCLUSION AS TO THE EXISTENCE OF THE ORAL
AGREEMENT WAS BASED SOLELY ON DEPOSITIONS WHICH ARE INADMISSIBLE."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In sustaining the validity of the agreement with respect to the
payment of the 2% commission, respondent Court found no similarity between the
case at bar and the cases cited by petitioner, Tee vs. <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span>
Electric &amp; Ice Plant Co., Inc. and <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Suan</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Regala</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein this Court ruled that contracts providing for a 10% commission for
securing import licenses or dollar allocations are null and void as being
against public policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said respondent
Court:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> We
find nothing against public policy in the agreement in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Tansiong</span> Lim was requested only to present the case of
appellant, with the aid of certain documents, to the President, taking into account
his accessibility to President Garcia whom he saw almost every Sunday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not <span class="SpellE">Tansiong</span>
Lim's influence with President Garcia that induced his choice for the mission
of making an appeal to the President against reduction of appellant's dollar allocation,
for in arming him with documents to support the appeal, appellant did not rely
on influence but on the merits of its case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If instead of <span class="SpellE">Tansiong</span> Lim, it was a high
official of appellant who had gone to see President Garcia for the same mission
and succeeded in presenting the appellant's case and obtaining the relief
sought, there would seem to be nothing immoral or illegal in the act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the payment of the commission, it was
but natural for <span class="SpellE">Tansiong</span> Lim, who is a mere dealer,
not an official of the appellant company, to de­serve and be entitled to some
compensation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Neither was there anything inherently immoral in making the
appeal to President Garcia with the objective of showing how detrimental is it
for the economy for appellant's allocation to be reduced, affecting as it does
also the well-being and livelihood of hundreds of employees and workers of
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President has made a
decision, and it is only to reconsider the decision to appellant's favor that
the latter sought <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> service for a fee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not following up a dollar quota
application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to ask for a
reconsideration of a policy decision laid down by the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not suggested that the President was
going to be shared in the 2% commission of <span class="SpellE">Tansiong</span>
Lim as to taint the whole proceedings, within the contemplation of the
agreement, with impropriety that will make the agreement itself void as against
public morals or policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matter
taken up with President Garcia comes within the legitimate exercise of his
presidential prerogatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No hint is
given that his decision or action would be influenced by <span class="SpellE">Tansiong</span>
Lim's closeness to him as a friend, much less by money consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the agreement is neither void as
against public policy in general, nor as against the spirit of the Anti-Graft
Law, which incidentally, was not yet in force when the agreement was
forged."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find it difficult to uphold the above-observations of
respondent Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that protests against the policy of the Monetary Board
reducing dollar allocations were filed by alien importers and that the protests
filed by American importers, which included petitioner, were denied by
President Garcia, as may be gleaned from the following statements appearing in
the <st1:date year="1959" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1959</st1:date> issue
of the Official Gazette, reading thus:</p>

<blockquote>"February 20, PRESIDENT GARCIA announced today he will give
the Central Bank time to act on protests against the reduction of dollar
allocations for the current quarter of all alien importers, <u>except American
importers</u>." (<span class="GramE">underlining</span> supplied)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The President received at <span class="SpellE">Malacañang</span>
British Ambassador George <span class="SpellE">Clutton</span>, who verbally
transmitted to him the protests of some members of the local diplomatic corps
against the 'Filipino First Policy' in the grant of dollar allocations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President also received officials and
members of the International Chamber of Commerce who presented a resolution
protesting against the policy adopted by the Monetary Board on <st1:date year="1959" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1959</st1:date>."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for respondent Lim then is to the effect that as a
consequence of rigid import controls imposed by the Government, the dollar
allocation of petitioner had been reduced, resulting in a tremendous decrease
in its volume of sales in 1958, and that in a meeting he had with petitioner's
President and General Manager, Mr. Paul Wood, on February 25, 1959, the latter
promised to give him a commission of 2% of petitioner's total volume of sales
should he succeed in having petitioner's dollar allocation improved or, at
least, maintained, for the duration of the term of then President Carlos P.
Garcia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, as respondent Court itself
stated in its Decision, respondent Lim's counterclaim was based on an oral
agreement he had with Mr. Paul Wood whereby he (Lim) would use his personal
influence and association with President Garcia to improve or, at least,
maintain petitioner's dollar allocation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Lim himself admits that the fact that he was a close friend
of President Garcia might have been one of the considerations taken into account
by petitioner in entreating him to undertake the job of bringing the matter of
its disastrous condition to the attention of the President.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is also evidence to show that Mr. Paul Wood had wanted to
see respondent Lim as early as October, 1958 (Exhibit "42").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the meeting between the two did not
materialize until sometime in the third week of February, 1959, when Mr. N. L. <span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span>, who was also one of petitioner's dealers,
conveyed to respondent Lim Mr. Wood's urgent desire to have a conference with
him on <st1:date year="1959" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conference on <st1:date year="1959" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1959</st1:date> must have been prompted by
President Garcia's denial, on <st1:date year="1959" day="20" month="2">February
 20, 1959</st1:date>, of the protests filed by American importers against the
reduction of their dollar allocations.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be conceded that Mr. Paul Wood armed respondent Lim with
some documents to support his appeal to the President to improve or, at least,
maintain petitioner's dollar allocations, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit "24", which is a letter of
Mr. Wood to respondent Lim ex­pressing his wish that President Garcia would
read petitioner's General Letter No. 77 (Exhibit "26") addressed to
its dealers informing them of the re­duction of its dollar allocations for the
first quarter of 1959 by 30.9%, resulting in its inability to meet service
parts requirements of dealers and customers; Exhibit "25", which is
petitioner's Memorandum to its employees informing them of the reduction of
employment and sales as a consequence of its reduced dollar allocations; and
Exhibit "27", which is a brochure showing that petitioner's retail
business is handled solely by Filipino dealers whose employees are all
Filipinos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, said documents, on
their face, tend to support petitioner's appeal for the maintenance or
improvement of the latter's dollar allocations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, having failed in its attempt to obtain a reconsideration
of the policy of the Monetary Board reducing the dollar allocations of American
importers, petitioner then sought the aid of respondent Lim, who could see
President Garcia "anytime",<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
for the purpose of using Lim's influence to convince the latter to improve, or,
at least maintain petitioner's dollar allocation.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find as untenable the finding that the circumstances obtaining
herein are dissimilar to the factual setting in <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Suan</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Regala</span>, <u>supra</u>,
wherein it was succinctly stated:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> (S<span class="GramE">)<span class="SpellE">uch</span></span> intervention would not render
an unmeritorious application deserving, nor unde­serving applications
meritorious, but would serve no other purpose than to influence, or possibly
corrupt, in unmeritorious cases, the judgment of the public official or
officials performing an act or service connected with the issuance of import
license or quota allocation -- an eventuality which the law precisely sought to
avoid."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As announced by then President Garcia, the protests of American
importers against the reduction of their dollar allocations were not to be
entertained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The approach by respondent
to President Garcia could not but be for any other purpose but to influence him
through personal connections to make an exception in petitioner's case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, an agreement to this effect should
be declared as against public policy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Any agreement entered into because of the actual or supposed influence
which the party has, engaging him to influence administrative or executive
officers in the discharge of their duties, which contemplates the use of
personal influence and personal solicitation rather than any appeal to the
judgment of the officer on the merits of the object sought, is contrary to
public policy.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor can we agree with the appellate Court's observation that the
cases of Tee vs. <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> Electric &amp; Ice Plant
Co., Inc. and <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Suan</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Regala</span> are not applicable to the case at bar as it does not
involve following up of dollar allocations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that respondent Lim's mission, for which he was promised a 2%
commission, involved an appeal to President Garcia for a reconsideration of a
policy decision reducing petitioner's dollar allocations does not make the
present case essentially different from the above-cited cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctrines enunciated in said two cases
that public interest demands that applications for foreign exchange be
considered, acted upon or disposed of strictly on the basis of the merits and
demerits of each case, without the intervention of intermediaries, and that the
exigencies of public welfare require that proceedings for the determination of
such applications be conducted in the most impersonal and impartial manner to
forestall favoritism or the commission of other irregularities in relation
thereto or, at least to minimize the opportunities <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
or the possibility thereof, are equally applicable to the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, even with more reason considering
that re­consideration of the policy decision slashing the dollar allocations of
alien importers, affecting as it did public interest, had to be applied
uniformly without exception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
private respondent's "influence" with President Garcia was the only
causative factor that improved petitioner's business in subsequent years has
not been satisfactorily and convincingly proven.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, it is our considered opinion that the agreement
between respondent Lim and petitioner is null and void, for being against
public policy, and, therefore, unenforceable before a Court of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was to give statutory imprimatur to such
public policy that Republic Act No. 3019, the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices
Act, was enacted on <st1:date year="1960" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1960</st1:date>,
incorporating the following provision:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 4.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Prohibition on private
individuals.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- (a) It shall be
unlawful for any person having family or close personal relation with any
public official to capitalize or exploit or take advantage of such family or
close personal relation by directly or indirectly requesting or receiving any
present, gift or material or pecuniary advantage from any other person having
some business, transaction, application, request or contract with the
government, in which such public official has to intervene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Family relation shall include the spouse or
relatives by consanguinity or affinity in the third civil degree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The word 'close personal relation' shall
include close personal friendship, social and fraternal connections, and
professional employment all giving rise to intimacy which assures free access
to such public officer."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing conclusion renders a determination of the other
issues raised by petitioner unnecessary.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision of the Court of Appeals is modified
by eliminating the award in favor of respondent Lim in the amount of
P1,838,096.09, representing 2% of petitioner's total volume of sales
corresponding to the period from March, 1959 to December 31, 1961, but affirmed
in all other respects.</p>
