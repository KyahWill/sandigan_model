<p class="BODY">The following are the <span class="SpellE">antecedental</span>
facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">The Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
owns a parcel of land identified as Lot No. 1467 of the Santa Rosa Cadastre,
situated in <st1:city><st1:place>Santa Rosa</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, containing an area
of 131,7992 hectares, and covered by Original Certificate of Title No. 9950.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Lot No. 1467 formed part of the "<span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
Estate".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records before us are
devoid of accurate information on the history of the acquisition by the
Philippine Government of that Estate which would be helpful in the disposition
of the present controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, an
examination of the pertinent documents, now in the possession of the Records
Management Division of the Ministry of Agrarian Reform, reveals that while the
original documents and papers including the owner's copy of the title, were destroyed
during the last World War, we found on pages 162-165 of Volume 3 of the <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> Estate Record a signed duplicate original copy
of the letter, dated March 28, 1947, of the then Di­rector of Lands Jose P. <span class="SpellE">Dans</span> addressed to the Secretary of Justice, from which we
can gather the following data:</p>

<p class="BODY">In his Last Will and Testament, dated February 15, 1918, Reverend
Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>, a "non-secular" priest
of <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
donated certain tracts of land in <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span> and Sta.
Rosa, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, forming
part of the estate he had inherited, to the Government of the Philippine
Islands "in order that the same may be invested in the erection of any
building for charitable purposes such as hospital, orphanage, maternity house,
or such others which may redound to the benefit of the Filipino people,"
and appointed as his executor the Attorney General of the Philippine Islands.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The then Attorney General represented the Government in the probate
of the Will and when the properties left by the testator were partitioned and
those pertaining to the Government ascertained and taken over, the Office of
the Attorney General continued with the administration of the properties
consisting of commercial and residential lots as well as agricultural lands.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, however, the Attorney General, concurring with the
opinion of the Auditor General, ruled that the properties should properly be
administered by the Bureau of Lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conformably
with this ruling, the late Governor General Leonard Wood issued a Memorandum
Order designating the Director of Lands as the administrator of the <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> Estate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, the pro­perties and all records were transferred to said
Bureau.</p>

<p class="BODY">The interpretation given by the Bureau to the Will was that the
Government had to keep intact the properties donated to it from the <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> Estate and could use only the income derived <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> in the form of rents paid by the tenants
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conformably thereto, the Governor
General, on <st1:date year="1932" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1932</st1:date>,
created a Committee composed of the Director of Lands, as Chairman, and the
Directors of Health and of Public Welfare, as members, to make recommendations
for the disposition of the <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> Estate in order
to carry out the wishes of the donor in a fitting manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Committee had been instrumental in
giving away several thousands of pesos as donations to different municipalities
in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for the construction of <span class="SpellE">puericulture</span> centers and
maternity houses, most noteworthy of which were the maternity pavilion of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Provincial</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> at <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>
and that of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Provincial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, three of the lots, other
than <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1467 in question, were leased to <span class="SpellE">Ismael</span> <span class="SpellE">Lapuz</span> for a period of ten
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dis­puted lot itself was also
leased to one <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> de Guzman for a period of ten
years, but as of <st1:date year="1947" day="28" month="3">March 28, 1947</st1:date>,
the land was vacant and the rental thereon had not been paid since 1946.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1947" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1947</st1:date>,
President Manuel <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> issued Administrative Order
No. 36 transferring the administration of all the properties pertaining to the <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> Estate from the Bureau of Lands to the Rural
Progress Administration.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the records, it now appears that on <st1:date year="1950" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1950</st1:date>, Executive Order No. 376 was
issued abolishing the Rural Progress Administration, transferring its powers,
duties and functions to the Bureau of Lands, and creating a Division of Landed
Estates in the latter Bureau "to handle the various phases of the activities
presently undertaken by the Rural Progress Administration."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On March 31, 1955, the then Director of Lands, <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Castrillo</span>, "acting for
and in behalf of the Bureau of Lands which succeeded the defunct Rural Progress
Administration," entered into a contract of lease with defendant <span class="SpellE">Heraclio</span> D. Diaz over Lot No. 1467 of the Santa Rosa
Cadastre under the following terms and conditions:</p>

<blockquote>"1. That the
lessee shall pay to the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> an annual rental of
P800.50 on or before March 30 of every year for the occupation and use of Lot
No. 1467 of the Santa Rosa Cadastre, a portion of the <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
Estate, with an area of 131.7992 hectares;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style=""> </span>That this lease shall cover a period of ten
(10) years from the execution of this contract renewable for another period of
ten (10) years at the option of the lessee unless sooner revoked or renewed as
provided hereinafter;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3. That the
land shall be used for agricultural purposes and that no construction of any
kind that may be detrimental or may cause damage to the property shall be made
by the lessee;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4. That the
whole, or any part of the land leased shall not be sublet, transferred,
assigned, encumbered or in any way alienated without the previous written
permission of the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5.<span style=""> </span>The <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> has the
right to terminate this lease any time the lot covered thereby or a part
thereof is needed by the government for any public improvements and the lessee
agrees to vacate the premises within 30 days from his receipt of notice <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"6. That
violation of any of the terms and conditions hereinabove set forth shall be
sufficient cause for the rescission or termination of this contract without prejudice
to claiming whatever damages that may be caused by the lessee in the premises
and to enforcing the collection of unsettled obligations in favor of the government."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, portions of Lot No. 1467 were actually cultivated by
thirteen "helpers-tenants" of defendant covering roughly forty-three
(43) hectares, while the remaining area was possessed by defendant himself.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, the Division of Landed Estates in the Bureau of
Lands was ordered abolished upon the organization of the Land Tenure
Administration created under Republic Act No. 1400, which took effect on
September 9, 1955, and its functions, powers and duties, among other things,
were transferred to this new agency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Land Tenure Administration was, in turn, abolished upon the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>,
on <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1963</st1:date>, of
Republic Act No. 3844, and its powers and functions which were not inconsistent
with the newly-created Land Authority, as well as agricultural lands, public
and private under its administration, were transferred to the latter body.</p>

<p class="BODY">As early as <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="1">January 31,
 1962</st1:date>, the tenants of Lot No. 1467, other landless farmers in the
area and the Barrio Council of San Gregorio, <st1:city><st1:place>Santa Rosa</st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, had filed
various petitions to allow them and other farmers of the barrio to lease Lot
No. 1467 directly from the Government.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Before the expiration of his lease contract, defendant, in a
letter dated January 11, 1965, addressed to the Governor of the Land Authority,
gave notice that he was exercising his option to renew the lease contract for
another period of ten (10) years, and at the same time requested that he be
given written permission to assign his leasehold rights over said lot to the
Development Bank of the Philippines as an additional guaranty for payment of a
loan intended for the purchase of farm implements.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in May 1965, the Land Authority sent an investigator to
verify the various petitions concerning Lot No. 1467 and to conduct an ocular
inspection of said property.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> A

<p class="BODY">On October 12, 1965, the Governor of the Land Authority, Hon.
Benjamin M. <span class="SpellE">Gozon</span>, sent a reply-letter to defendant
informing the latter that the Office could not agree to the latter's exercise
of his alleged option to renew the contract of lease over Lot No. 1467 for
another period of ten (10) years "in view of the fact that the same is in
contravention of the provisions of Article 1878 of the New Civil Code which was
already prevailing when the lease contract was entered into" and which
limits to one (1) year only the period for which an administrator without
special power of attorney could effectively lease real property to another, and
inviting Diaz to enter into a contract of lease with the Office for the current
agricultural year, inasmuch as he (Diaz) had already begun cultivating the
property.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In a letter dated January 27, 1966, addressed to defendant, the
Governor of the Land Authority, this time, Hon. <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
F. <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span>, requested defendant to vacate the
premises on or before April 1, 1966 (Lot No. 1467), the lease of which was
extended in his favor for the agricultural year terminating on March 31, 1966,
"in order to enable (the) Office to administer the property in line with
the land reform program and in a manner that will best serve the purposes for
which the property has been entrusted to the Government."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in February 1966, defendant personally went to the
Office of the Land Authority and verbally requested for recon­sideration of its
decision, for which reason, a team of investigators was again sent to
investigate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the investigating
team ren­dered its report dated April 5, 1966, defendant was invited, through
two telegrams sent on two different occasions, to a conference but he failed to
come on the days appointed nor on any other day.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, a report was submitted to the Governor of the Land
Authority to the effect that defendant was able to pay to the Cashier of the
Land Authority advance rentals on the litigated property for the years 1966 to
1970, which payments were considered unauthorized by the Land Authority as per
letter of the Chief, Col­lection and Accounts Division, dated April 25, 1966,
addressed to defendant.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On April 25, 1966, the Land Authority received a letter from
defendant mentioning the exercise by him of his option on January 11, 1965 and
informing that office that he had already been granted a loan by the
Development Bank of the Philippines, for which reason, there would be no
further need for the deed of assignment of leasehold rights mentioned in his
letter of January 11, 1965.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In a letter dated May 18, 1966, addressed to defendant, Governor <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> of the Land
Authority informed the latter that the decision of the Land Authority contained
in its letter of October 12, 1965 to the effect that it could not agree to the
exercise of the defendant's option in the lease contract is "in line with
the policy of the government, as expressed in the Agricultural Land Reform
Code, which favors the actual tillers of the land to be the direct lessees
thereof and not crop-sharers or sub-lessees." The Governor also informed
defendant of the decision of the Land Authority to lease the property directly
to the latter's tenants who are actually cultivating the same and to other
landless farmers in the area; that effective April 1, 1966, the Land Authority
would cease to recognize any leasehold right which he might claim on the
property; and requested him to desist from exercising any such right thereon
and to surrender to the Land Authority the possession of the portion of Lot No.
1467 which was being cultivated by him through mechanization.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

entitled "Republic of the Philippines (Land Authority) versus <span class="SpellE">Heraclio</span> D. Diaz," alleging therein as its first cause
of action, that the rest of Lot No. 1467 still in the possession of defendant,
is needed by the Republic to enable it to lease the land directly to the
persons working on and/or tilling it in line with its policy and to effectively
solve the existing socio-economic problem in Central Luzon, particularly in the
locality where the land in question is situated; and, as its second cause of
action, that, the nullity of the exercise by defendant of the option to renew
the lease contract notwithstanding, the Republic was entitled to reasonable
compensation for the use and occupation of the parcel of land in question from
April 1, 1966 until he vacates and returns possession thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the pleadings, the critical issue for resolution is whether
or not the Director of Lands had power to convey by way of lease the property
owned by the Republic for a period longer than one (1) year, for if he had,
then the validity of the lease in defendant's favor will have to be upheld.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its dismissal Order dated June 24, 1970, the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
stated that when the Director of Lands entered into a contract of lease with
defendant on March 31, 1955, the Director of Lands exercised his powers,
authority and functions not as a Director of Lands as constituted within the
meaning of the Revised Administrative Code but as head of the Division of
Landed Estates in the Bureau of Lands, with the same powers, functions and
authority vested in the Administrator of the defunct corporation Rural Progress
Administration; that the powers exercised by the Director of Lands was a
corporate power vested in him by Commonwealth Act No. 378 pursuant to Executive
Order No. 206 dated May 31, 1939; that as Administrator of the <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> Estate which is a patrimonial property of the
State, the Director of Lands went down to the level of a private individual and
did not have to seek further authority for such authority has been vested in
him by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the Director of Lands acted within his power and
authority as head of the Division of Landed Estates when he entered into the
contract of lease with defendant on <st1:date year="1955" day="31" month="3">March
 31, 1955</st1:date> for a period of ten (10) years renewable for a like
period, at the lessee's option.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Director of Lands was not acting merely as an agent in the
sense that he still needed a special power of attorney to lease the real
property to another person for more than one (1) year under Article 1878 (8) of
the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the war, administration
of the <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> Estate was turned over to the Rural
Progress Administration by Administrative Order No. 36 issued by President
Manuel <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, and thereafter, on November 28, 1950,
administration reverted to the Bureau of Lands, particularly in the latter's
newly created Division of Landed Estates.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the Di­rector of Lands, therefore, leased the property to
defendant, he did so as a public officer and he represented the Government and
stood for it as an "arm of the State." He acted by virtue of an au­thority
vested in him by law and needed no further delegation of power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was clothed with some part of the
sovereignty of the State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He acted as a
"vice principal" defined as "one vested with the entire
management, control, and supervision of a particular work to be done, so as to
say, not only what shall be done, but how it shall be done, and has full power
and authority to command the men under him in the work, and the work is under
his practical direction and control, save and except as he may receive
directions from time to time from his employer, and there is ordinarily no one
else present and authorized to superintend and direct the work of the men.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then represents the employer -- stands for
the employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the foreman of a gang
of men is invested with such control he is a vice principal (<span class="SpellE">Lindvall</span> v. Woods, 44 F. 855, 857)."<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
Directly empowered "to handle the various phases of the activities
(presently) undertaken by the Rural Progress Administration," it was his
duty to administer the <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> Estate as he saw
best and fit.</p>

<blockquote>"When power or jurisdiction is delegated to any public officer
over a subject matter, and its exercise is confided to his discretion, the acts
done in the exercise of the authority are, in general, binding and valid as<i> </i>to
the subject matter."<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At the time of the lease, the immediate objective was still to
generate funds to carry out the purposes of the donation, and lease was one of
the avenues <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, on <st1:date year="1943" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1943</st1:date>,
Lots Nos. 301, 883 and 1885 of the Estate had been leased for a period of ten (10)
years to <span class="SpellE">Ismael</span> <span class="SpellE">Lapuz</span>;
while Lot No. 1467 itself had also been leased to <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span>
de Guzman for a similar period.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
The lease to defendant in 1955 for a period of ten (10) years, therefore, was
but a continuation of the pre-war policy.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lease contract being valid, its renewal for a like period of
ten (10) years was likewise valid, the option <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
having been given to and having been exercised by defendant lessee pursuant to
the terms of the lease, <u>supra</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">But while we are finding that the lease contract was valid as
well as the exercise by defendant of his option to renew, it is obvious that
the period of the lease contract, even as renewed, had already expired on <st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since defendant is still occupying the
subject premises, according to a Manifestation dated <st1:date year="1979" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1979</st1:date> of Ms. Lourdes C. <span class="SpellE">Tabañag</span> of the Bureau of Agrarian Legal Assistance of the
Ministry of Agrarian Reform, it will have to be held that defendant's occupancy
thereof no longer finds any legal basis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He is a usurper and he has no right to legitimately continue in the use
and enjoyment of the premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has
become a possessor in bad faith.</p>

<blockquote>"If the lessee continues enjoying the thing after the
expiration of the contract, over the <span class="SpellE">lessor's</span>
objection, the former shall be subject to the responsibilities of a possessor
in bad faith."<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As claimed by plaintiff, it is entitled to reasonable compensation
for the use of the premises by defendant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff, however, reckons the date from <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Actually, considering our finding that the renewal of the lease was
valid, this should commence only from <st1:date year="1976" day="1" month="4">April
 1, 1976</st1:date>, or the day after the expiry of the renewal period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> should
be sentenced to pay not necessarily the rental fixed in the contract of lease
that has expired but the reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of
the detained prem­ises.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
Evidence herein as to such reasonable compensation is wanting, although
plaintiff has prayed for payment of P4,000.00 per agricultural year, which
defendant has not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While a remand to the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
for determination of such reasonable compensation is called for, it is our
opinion that this would only unduly delay the final disposition of this
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A protracted hearing on the issue
would not be far-fetched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
interest of the faster termination of this suit, therefore, we fix the amount
of the reason­able compensation for the use and occupation of the premises at
P4,000.00 per year, which we find reasonable.</p>
