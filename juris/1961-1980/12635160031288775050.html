the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Boljoon</st1:placename></st1:place>,

prohibition in Administrative Case No. 4, and directing the respondent either
to dismiss the same or to proceed with it in accordance with the opinion
heretofore stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>No costs and damages."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The facts necessary to decide this appeal are the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellee Gregorio Y. Romero, a civil service eligible, was
appointed Chief of Police of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Boljoon</st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:place>Cebu</st1:place>,
on <st1:date year="1954" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1954</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="8">August
 16, 1962</st1:date>, the Municipal Mayor of Boljoon, suspended him from office
following the filing of Administrative Case No. 2 against him with the
Municipal Council for serious irregularities in the per­formance of official
duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After several postponements of
the hearing at Romero's instance, the Council, on <st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1962</st1:date>, approved its Resolution No. 66 finding
him guilty and dismissing him from office effective <st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1962</st1:date> - the date of his preventive
suspension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Romero then appealed to the
Commissioner of Civil Service.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a letter dated <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="12">December
 14, 1962</st1:date> addressed to the Municipal Mayor, Romero, thru counsel,
asked for his immediate reinstatement, invoking the provisions of Section 3 of
Republic Act No. 557 limiting the period of preventive suspension of provincial
guards, city police and municipal police to sixty days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Mayor denied the request on the 18th of
the same month and year.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="8">August 23,
 1962</st1:date>, Administrative Case No. 3 was filed with the Municipal
Council by the Villarica Finance Company against Romero for alleged wilful
neglect to pay his just obligation to it in accordance with Section 1135 of the
Civil Service Manual, etc. Romero moved to dismiss the com­plaint on the
grounds that the Municipal Council had no juris­diction to try the same as the
charges were not filed by the Municipal Mayor as required by law and that the
subject-matter thereof was not one of the grounds recognized by Republic Act
No. 557 for the suspension and/or removal of members of the Municipal
Police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Council denied the motion
and pro­ceeded ex-parte to hear the case upon failure of Romero to appear at
the hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1962</st1:date>, the Council approved
Resolution No. 75 ordering Romero's dismissal as Chief of Police of Boljoon, <st1:place>Cebu</st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 16, 1962, still another administrative complaint - the
fourth - was filed by the Municipal Mayor with the Muni­cipal Council against
Romero for alleged gross misconduct and dishonesty in the performance of
official duty in that the latter refused to record in the police blotter a
complaint for destruction of property filed by a certain Salvacion Sestoso
against one Nabor Derama and failed to take any action thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, Romero moved to dismiss the case on
the ground that he, being the Chief of Police and deputy of the Provincial Fiscal
in the prosecution of criminal cases, was vested with discretion to file or not
to file criminal complaints.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Municipal Council denied the motion and proceeded to hear the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Romero failed to appear at the hearing,
the Council resolved to postpone the same indefinitely until the final
determination of Administrative Case No. 2 mentioned heretofore.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 26, 1963, Romero - hereinafter referred to as appellee
- filed the present petition for a writ of <i>mandamus</i> and/or certiorari
and prohibition, with damages, with the Court of First Instance of Cebu against
appellants to secure judg­ment ordering the Municipal Mayor of Boljoon to
reinstate him in office; declaring null and void Resolution No. 75 of the
Municipal Council of Boljoon in Administrative Case No. 3; prohibiting said
Municipal Council from further proceeding with the hearing in Administrative
Case No. 4; and for the recovery of his salary from October 16, 1962 - the date
appellee claims he should have been reinstated in office - plus damages and
attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due time, respondents-appellants filed their answer, in which,
after making denials and admissions of fact, they interposed the following
affirmative defenses: (1) that the petition did not state facts constituting a cause
of action in favor of petitioner (appellee herein); that the decision of the
Municipal Council was rendered within sixty days from the date of appellee's
preventive suspension, and that what­ever delay there was thereafter was due to
his own act of appealing to the Commission of Civil Service; and that appellee
had not exhausted all the administrative remedies available to him at law.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due trial, the lower court rendered the appealed judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the assignment of errors made in appellants' brief it
appears that the only issue to be resolved in this appeal is whether or not
appellee is entitled to reinstate­ment pending final determination of his
appeal to the Com­missioner of Civil Service.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is an admitted fact that appellant Municipal Council's
decision in Administrative Case No. 2 was rendered within the sixty-day period
prescribed by the provisions of Republic Act No. 557 from the date of
appellee's suspension from office, after deducting the delay chargeable against
the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court, however,
held that from the time appellee was notified of the decision of the Council
and he appealed to the Commissioner of Civil Service, he was entitled to re­instatement
after the lapse of the period of sixty days pur­suant to Section 35 of Republic
Act 2260 (Civil Service Act of 1959) and the doctrine laid down in Garcia vs.
the Executive Secretary, et al. G. R. L-19748, September 30, 1962.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question to be resolved is not new.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Alacar vs. City Mayor etc.,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
construing the provisions of Section 3 of Republic Act No. 557, We said the
following:</p>

<blockquote>"This question has already been resolved in the affirmative in
the case of <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city> vs. Muni­cipal
Mayor of Labason, et al., G.R. No. L-11888, <st1:date year="1958" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1958</st1:date>, wherein this Court made the follow­ing
pronouncement:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'It will be noticed, however, that on the sixtieth day the council
voted by resolution to remove the petitioner from his position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such resolution would have de­cided the
matter finally if petitioner had not filed a notice of appeal to the Commis­sioner
of Civil Service. Therefore, his case was not finally disposed of because of
his own voluntary act of appealing, which amounted to a petition for
review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such petition excused any delay
in the definite disposition of the charges.</p>

<p class="2Q">'Indeed, it would be contrary to the spirit of mandamus proceedings
to compel reinstatement of suspended officers after the latter had been found
guilty and dropped from the service by the competent official body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such suspended official, it may be said, did
not have a clear legal right (to return) enforceable by mandamus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the court's discretion should not be
exercised in a way injurious to public interest; nor should <i>mandamus</i>
issue where it would not promote substantial justice.'"</p>

<p class="BODY">More recently We decided the case of Kordovez vs. Carmona etc.,
G. R. No. L-21473, <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1967</st1:date>,
which is on all fours with the present, the pertinent portions of our decision
being as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner Perfecto D. Kordovez was a desk sergeant of the
police force of the City of <st1:city><st1:place>San Carlos</st1:place></st1:city>,
<st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Negros
  Occidental</st1:placename></st1:place>, with the required civil service
eligibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having been charged
administratively by the respondent mayor for violation of law or duty, he was
suspended from office on <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="9">September 19,
 1962</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After due investigation of the charges, the Municipal Board,
on <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1962</st1:date>,
rendered a decision dismissing him from the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There­upon and within the period provided for
in Republic Act No. 557, he appealed to the Commissioner of Civil Service.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sixty days after the date of his suspension (September 19,
1962) petitioner asked the res­pondent mayor to order his reinstatement pending
appeal, invoking the provisions of Section 35 of Republic Act No. 2260,
otherwise known as the Civil Service Act of 1959, in relation to Section 3 of
Republic Act No. 557, and our ruling in the case of Paulino Garcia vs. the Hon.
Executive Secretary, et al.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
having refused to do so, the petitioner filed with the Court of First Instance
of Negros Occidental a Petition for <i>Mandamus</i> to secure an order for his
reinstatement, to recover back salaries from <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1962</st1:date>, the date which he claimed to be the
end of his 60-day pre­ventive suspension, and damages (Civil Case No. 6862).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After due trial, however, the lower court rendered its
decision dismissing the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
this appeal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To secure a reversal of the abovequoted decision, Kor­dovez
relied anew upon the provisions of Section 35 of Re­public Act 2260, in
relation to Section 3 of Republic Act, No. 557, claiming that thereunder he was
entitled to re­instatement because the Commissioner of Civil Service had not
decided his appeal within the period of sixty days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We found this contention to be without merit
and said the following:</p>

<blockquote>"The law applicable to the present case is Republic Act No.
557, Section 3, and not the one relied upon by the petitioner. Con­trary to his
view, We are of the opinion that no provision of the latter had repealed the
former.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Republic Act No. 2260 is a
general law which covers public officials and employees, civil service
eligibles or not, while Republic Act No. 557 is a special law which applies
only to provincial guards, city and municipal policemen with civil service
eligibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of conflict between
the two kinds of legislative enactment, the rule is that the one general in
character shall not be deemed to have repealed the special law unless that is
expressly and clearly provided in the former.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reason for this is that the special law evinces the parti­cular legislative
intent more clearly.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That Section 3 of Republic Act No. 557 was not repealed by
Section 35 of Republic Act No. 2260 may also be inferred from the fact
that.Section 16 of Republic Act No. 4864, other­wise known as the Police Act of
1966 - which took effect on September 8, 1966 - reproduces the last part of
Section 3 of Republic Act No. 557 as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x Provided, however, That if the delay
in the dis­position of the case is due to the fault, negligence, or petition of
the respondent, the period of the delay shall not be counted in computing the
period of suspension herein provided.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The respondent shall be entitled to his salary for the period of
suspension upon exoneration.'</p>

<blockquote>"In connection with such provision, We have held heretofore
that although under Republic Act No. 557 a suspended policeman is entitled to
re­instatement if the administrative case against him has not been finally
decided within sixty (60) days after his preventive suspension, such
reinstatement can not be demanded if the delay in the disposition of his case
is due to his own fault or petition as when the cause of the delay was the
appeal to the Commissioner of Civil Ser­vice taken by him (Alacar vs. City
etc., G. R. No. L-10020, <st1:date year="1958" day="29" month="12">December 29,
 1958</st1:date>; <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city> vs.
Municipal Mayor etc. G.R. No. L-11868, <st1:date year="1958" day="30" month="4">April
 30, 1958</st1:date>)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>UPON ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, judgment is hereby rendered
reversing the decision appealed from in so far as it directs the appellants
herein to reinstate appellee immediately "to his position as Chief of
Police of Boljoon, <st1:place>Cebu</st1:place>, subject to the result of his
appeal in Administrative Case No. 2".<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
