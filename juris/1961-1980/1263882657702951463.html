Survey of <span class="SpellE">Guimba</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They are also the ones in possession of the said lot, each of them
occupying definite portions of the land, and their possession dates back to the
time their parents <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>

portions to them, to Andres <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> on January 31,

their predecessors, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacia</span> Lora, had

acquired anything, and similarly, did not convey anything to <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> <span class="SpellE">Melebo</span> nor did <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> <span class="SpellE">Melebo</span> convey anything to
Mariano <span class="SpellE">Copuyoc</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;

predecessor in interest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defendants <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> <span class="SpellE">Melebo</span> and Mariano <span class="SpellE">Copuyoc</span> raise
the defense of ignorance of the flaw in the title, considering that the title
does not appear to have any encumbrance, and that, consequently, they could be
regarded as innocent purchasers for value with the corresponding protection
under the Torrens system of registration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to them, they do not have to look beyond the title as a
feature of the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This could be correct, under the situation
where there are no circumstances which would convince a reasonable mind of the
presence of marks or evidence of fraud and deceit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> <span class="SpellE">Melebo</span> and Mariano <span class="SpellE">Copuyoc</span> are
lawyers by profession, and the last named had moreover served as councilor of <span class="SpellE">Guimba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The titles they each purchased or acquired
bore the annotation on their faces of the existence of the legal encumbrance represented
by Section 74 of the Rules of Court, and it was only natural for them to
inquire as to the existence of other heirs or on the very rights of these
purported heirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They could have looked
into the cadastral records and they would have found the petition for review
filed by Andres and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> years before <span class="SpellE">unacted</span> upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And,
as the purchasers of a property which is in their own hometown, it should have
been natural also for these two to look over the property and find out, even
only to satisfy their curiosity, if they do not give much regard to the sum of
money, P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, which they appear to have given away
for the acquisition of the said property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And if they did, as the defendant <span class="SpellE">Copuyoc</span>
found out, they would have found Andres and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>
or even only their father <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> standing on the land that they have cultivated for
years and which they have learned to regard to be a part of their lives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All transactions by which Marta Manuel, who
appears to be illiterate, as she merely affixed her <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span>
to the documents, alternately acquired and sold what could be acquired and what
could be sold under what appears to be a great haste, do not appear to be the
work of an unlettered person.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in these assignments of error.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant does not seriously question the finding of the trial
court that from the evidence, "there is no question that Andres <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> (married
to Luisa <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>) herein <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
-- are the owners of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2986 of the Cadastral Survey of
<span class="SpellE">Guimba</span>", the land in dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, appellant admits that said <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> are in actual possession of said land, so much so
that, in his brief, appellant himself states that "on March 24 or 25,
1954, herein appellant Mariano D. <span class="SpellE">Copuyoc</span> attempted
to take possession of the land but <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> prevented him from taking possession of the land
because the latter claimed to be the owner." (p. 5, Appellant's Brief)</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, according to the lower court, "They (<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>) are also the ones in possession of the said lot,
each of them occupying definite portions of the land, and their possession
dates back to the time their parents <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacia</span> Lora had
conveyed their respective portions to them, to Andres <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>
on January 31, 1929 and to Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> on March 2,
1936, even as their predecessors, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacia</span> Lora,
had occupied the same from the time that they acquired it from the spouses Juan
<span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> and Leonardo Sanchez on February 2, 1900, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">A,</span> and that Juan <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> had exercised proprietary rights and possession, the
same since before the outbreak of the revolution against <st1:country-region><st1:place>Spain</st1:place></st1:country-region>."
(p. 83, Rec. on Appeal) And with particular reference to <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>, it is a fact that when appellant bought the
land in question from <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> <span class="SpellE">Melebo</span>,
the title itself showed that <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> was owner of
at least 1/7 thereof, and yet appellant has not shown that he inquired about
the circumstances surrounding the acquisition by <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span>
of such share.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had he been prudent
enough to find out, he would have known likewise the interest of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, at the time appellant made his purchase from <span class="SpellE">Melebo</span>, he well knew that his vendor was not the one in
possession of the land being sold to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a lawyer and ex-councilor of the town, this significant fact alone
should have put him on notice that <span class="SpellE">Melebo's</span>
representation of ownership might not be in fee simple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he did not even inquire why the <span class="SpellE">Pascua's</span> instead of <span class="SpellE">Melebo</span> were
in possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so, as contended by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in their Motion to Dismiss Appeal dated <st1:date year="1974" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1974</st1:date>, "<u>Being thus
aware of sufficient facts to induce a reasonably prudent man to inquire into
the status of the title to the property in litigation, plaintiff can not
legally claim the rights of a purchaser in good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>INDEED, BY APPEALING DIRECTLY TO THIS COURT,

<p class="BODY">It being clearly borne by the evidence discussed in its decision,
We share the trial court's feeling that in the various transactions undertaken
by Marta Manuel, which resulted in the acquisition by appellant of the land in
question, she was merely the tool of others who, being acquainted with the
technicalities of the Land Registration Act and the Torrens system and yet
ignorant of the moral principles that have always been enforced by this Court
in their application, maneuvered to either acquire the same or to otherwise
profit from the deals involving it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
pointed out by His Honor, in complete disregard of the fact that there was
pending unresolved by the court the motion for review filed by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> Pedro and Andres <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>
of the court's decision declaring all the heirs of Juan <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>,
including the predecessor of Marta, of which the interested parties were
notified, and ignoring the formal recognition already separately entered in the
records by her co-heirs, among them, the other Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>,
married to <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span> <span class="SpellE">Ancheta</span>,
Angelo Reyes, who is the only heir of Maria <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>, <span class="SpellE">Severina</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> and <span class="SpellE">Petronila</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>, that <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> are the real owners of the land in dispute, Marta
misrepresented to the court that the decision had already become final and
subsequently undertook steps to have 6/7 of the land titled in her name.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the words of His Honor, "On March 31, 1952 Marta Manuel,
an heir of <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>,
presented an 'Ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> Motion for the Issuance of a
Decree," claiming that the decision of this Court dated October 31, 1929
has already become final and praying for the issuance of an order for decree, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. N.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order
for the issuance of decree was issued on <st1:date year="1952" day="7" month="4">April

U, all made on August 3, 1952, before the same Notary Public, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> B. Serrano, Marta Manuel acquired 4/7 share in the
property, <span class="SpellE">Valeriana</span>, <span class="SpellE">Severina</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> remaining with a 1/7 share each, and
TCT No. NT-12784 was correspondingly issued to them, per <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
V.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, before the same Notary Public,
Marta Manuel declared herself the sole heir of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Valeriana</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> and Julian Manuel, by the instrument dated <st1:date year="1953" day="30" month="11">November 30, 1953</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. X.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1953" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1953</st1:date> Marta Manuel acquired
the rights of <span class="SpellE">Severina</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>,
also before Mr. Serrano, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. W, thus accumulating a
total of 6/7 share in the name of the said Marta Manuel, and on <st1:date year="1953" day="30" month="11">November 30, 1953</st1:date> she sold off all
her rights to <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> <span class="SpellE">Melebo</span>,
also before Mr. Serrano, per <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. Y.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A new title, TCT No. <span class="GramE">NT-15124,

for 1/7 share, per TCT No. <span class="GramE">NT-15403, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
BB, which still stands." <span class="GramE">(pp. 81-82, Rec. on Appeal.)</span>
Thus, "all transactions by which Marta Manuel, who appears to be
illiterate, as she merely affixed her <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> to
the documents, alternately acquired and sold what could be acquired and what
could be sold under what appears to be a great haste, do not appear to be the
work of an unlettered person." <span class="GramE">(p. 85, Rec. on Appeal.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Needless to say, lawyers should be the last ones to take undue
advantage of the special evidentiary value accorded to <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
titles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More than anybody else, they
should always bear in mind that whenever there are extant circumstances related
to the ownership and possession of a titled land which by their nature would
suggest to any prudent man that there could actually be some flaw in the rights
of the registered owner, the fact that there is such a Torrens title does not
relieve the party who deals with the holder of the title from the duty to make
the proper inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While an inherently
defective Torrens title may not ordinarily be cancelled even after proof of its
defect, the law nevertheless safeguards the rightful party's interest in the
titled land from fraud and improper use of technicalities by allowing such
party, in appropriate cases, to judicially seek <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
to him of whatever he has been deprived of as long as the land has not been
transferred or conveyed to a purchaser in good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Sec. 55, Act 496;
Registration of Land Titles and Deeds by <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>, p.
137, 1961 ed.)</span> It is certainly a rank disservice to the noble profession
of law, for any member of the bar to knowingly use his superior knowledge of
the intricacies of the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> system as a means to unduly
deprive anyone of his rights over land.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, We hold that, regardless of whether or not Section 4
of Rule 74 has been correctly applied by His Honor, - a point We need not
decide - here the trial court's conclusion that appellant is not a purchaser in
good faith is legally correct.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision is affirmed, with costs
against appellant.</p>
