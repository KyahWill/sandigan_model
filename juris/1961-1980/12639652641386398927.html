It appears that the original judgment of Judge de Guzman on August 8, 1962 approved the amicable settlement and held that petitioner is not a tenant but merely a watcher (Item 3, <em>supra</em>). Petitioner moved for reconsideration of the same (Item 5, <em>id</em>.). As a result, the said decision was set aside (Item 7, <em>id</em>.). The case was set for another hearing (Item 8, <em>id</em>.). A court representative was even appointed to conduct an ocular inspection (Item 9, <em>id</em>.). The court representative, Mr. Marcelino Bacod, Clerk of Court, filed a Report finding that the petitioner is not a tenant (Item 10, <em>id</em>.). On January 8, 1963, the Court set the case for hearing on the nature of the tenure relation of the parties (Item 11, <em>id</em>.). On March 15, 1963, Judge de Guzman rendered judgment again declaring petitioner a mere watcher not a tenant of the holding in question (Item 12, <em>id</em>.). On March 29, 1963, petitioner again moved for reconsideration of said decision (Item 13, <em>id</em>.). The Motion for Reconsideration was argued before another judge, Jose R. Cabatuando (Item No. 15, <em>id</em>.). On May 5, 1964, Executive Judge Artemio Macalino reversed the decision of Judge de Guzman dated March 15, 1963 (Item 16, <em>id</em>.). On May 29, 1964, private respondent, in turn, moved for reconsideration of Judge Macalino's Resolution (Item 17, <em>id</em>.). On July 15, 1964, Judge Macalino set aside his own resolution of May 5, 1964 and revived the decision of Judge de Guzman of March 15, 1963 (Item 19, <em>id</em>.). The Motion for Reconsideration of March 29, 1963 and the opposition thereto of June 12, 1963 were referred to Judge de Guzman for resolution (<em>id</em>.). Petitioner moved for reconsideration of the foregoing resolution (Item 20, <em>id</em>.). On August 18, 1964, Judge de Guzman abstained from acting on the motion for reconsideration "for the reason that to allow the same is tantamount to allowing interminable litigation (Item 21, <em>id</em>.). On September 12, 1964, petitioner herein, also petitioner below, moved that the Executive Judge take jurisdiction of the case (Item 22, <em>id</em>.). On November 6, 1964, Judge de Guzman denied the same for lack of merit and in effect affirmed his decision of March 15, 1963 -- which was revived by Judge Macalino's order of July 15, 1964 -- finding petitioner not a tenant but a mere watcher or patao of the holding in question (Item 23, <em>id</em>.). </p><p>From the foregoing recitals, it is obvious that the proceedings before the CAR - which found petitioner on three occasions, including one after an ocular inspection of the holding and a second hearing, not an agricultural tenant but a mere watcher - have been the subject of a chain of interminable motions for reconsideration of two decisions, which have been originally issued as early as 1962 and then in 1963. But counsel for petitioner, who received the last order of Judge de Guzman denying his Motion for Reconsideration on December 1, 1964 instead of appealing therefrom, pursuant to Section 156 of the Agricultural Land Reform Code, <em>filed this special civil action for certiorari instead, before this Court nine months thereafter or on August 10, 1965</em>. </p><p>This issue should, therefore, be answered in the negative. Section 156 of the Agricultural Land Reform Code, which was approved and took effect on August 8, 1963, provides as follows: </p><blockquote>&nbsp; <p>"SEC. 156. <em>Appeals</em>. - Appeals from an order or decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations may be taken to the Court of Appeals on questions of fact and law or to the Supreme Court on pure questions of law, as the case may be, in accordance with rules governing appeals from the Court of First Instance as provided in the Rules of Court." </p> </blockquote> <p>Under the foregoing provision, petitioner herein, also the petitioner in the CAR Case No. 59 (San Pablo City 61’) could and should have appealed from the latest decision of Judge de Guzman to the Court of Appeals on questions of fact and law in accordance with the rules governing the appeals from Courts of First Instance. This he did not do. Having thus failed to exercise that recourse of appeal, it is settled that he cannot avail of the special civil action for <em>certiorari</em> as a substitute therefor. The rule is that <em>certiorari</em> will not lie where appeal is an adequate remedy, even if the period for appeal has already lapsed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><p>2. <em>The</em> <em>second issue</em>. Section 157 of the same Code provides as follows: </p><blockquote>&nbsp; <p>"SEC. 157. <em>Detail of Judges to Another District</em>.- Whenever any judge in any of the Court shall certify to the Executive Judge that the condition of the docket in his Court is such as to require the assistance of an additional judge, or when there is any vacancy in any Court, the Executive Judge may, in the interest of justice, with the approval of the Supreme Court, assign any judge of the Court of Agrarian Relations whose docket permits his temporary absence from said Court, to hold session in the Court needing such assistance or where such vacancy exists. </p>&nbsp; <p>"Whenever a judge appointed or assigned in any branch of the Court shall leave his district by transfer or assignment to another Court of equal jurisdiction without having decided a case totally heard by him and which was duly argued or opportunity given for argument to the parties or their counsel, it shall be lawful for him to prepare and sign his decision in said case anywhere within the Philippines and send the same by registered mail to the clerk of court to be filed in the Court as of the date when the same was received by the clerk, in the same manner as if the judge had been present in the Court to direct the filing of the judgment; Provided, however, that if a case has been heard only in part, the Supreme Court, upon petition of any of the interested parties to the case and the recommendation of the respective district judge, may also authorize the judge who has partly heard the case to continue hearing and to decide said case notwithstanding his transfer or appointment to another court of equal jurisdiction." </p> </blockquote> <p>The section - in providing for flexibility in the detail of CAR judges to other districts and the procedures to be observed in respect to the cases heard fully and/or partly by them - takes into consideration the nature, composition and mission of the CAR. A Special Court created under RA 1267<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; for the enforcement of agrarian reform legislation and conceived to resolve and decide with promptitude landlord - tenant disputes, it consisted of several judges - originally nine, then fifteen under Republic Act No. 3844, and now sixty under PD No. 946. CAR judges are assigned in various districts of the country where their services are urgently needed in view of the high incidence of tenancy cases and landholder-tenant disputes. </p><p>The section in par. 1 envisions and insures the mobility of CAR judges, who may be detailed from one district to another where the court dockets demand their presence. In view of this flexibility in the detail of judges to other districts, as the court dockets require, the section in par. 2 specifically authorizes the judge who has totally heard a particular case to prepare and sign his decision in said case anywhere within the Philippines and promulgate the same through the Clerk of Court of the district where the case has been heard, as if the judge had been present in said district; and, where the case has been heard by a judge only in part, the Supreme Court may under certain procedures, authorize the judge to continue the hearing and to decide the case notwithstanding his transfer to another district. This flexibility/mobility in the detail of CAR judges and the procedures laid down is intended to maximize the just, prompt and economical disposition/resolution of agrarian cases in view of the felt need for their early resolution to defuse and mitigate agrarian unrest and satisfy the tenantry's persistent clamor for prompt and inexpensive resolution of their disputes with their landholders. </p><p>The provisions whereby the judge is authorized, in the event of transfer/detail to other districts, to continue with the case/cases heard by him completely or partly and decide the same is, in turn, premised on the fact that the judge – who has heard the case, observed the demeanor of the witnesses, otherwise acquired acquaintance with the issues and incidents thereof - is in the best position to resolve the same. It is also based on convenience and expediency; for as between the judge who has heard the case either wholly or partially and another who has not done so, the former, all things considered, would be in a better position to determine the case fairly and expeditiously. </p><p>But in this case, which has been heard in full and the decision promulgated in San Pablo by Judge de Guzman, can be, under the terms of the section and after Executive Judge Macalino has referred the case to him, act on the motion/motions for reconsideration of his decision? </p><p>We believe so and so hold. In the first place, the section in implementing the legislative policy to insure mobility of CAR judges thru greater flexibility in their detail to other districts, authorizes the judge, who has fully and/or partly heard the same, to decide the case even after he has been transferred to another district. The reasons behind this authorization - namely that having conducted the trial, he had observed the demeanor of the witnesses, perhaps even conducted the pre-trial and/or amicable settlement proceedings therein and otherwise acquired knowledge of and exposure to the issues involved and the relevant incidents necessary for an intelligent disposition of the case, is in the best position to render judgment - hold true and perhaps with even greater force to make him act on the motion/motions for reconsideration of the decision. It follows then that Judge de Guzman who heard, conducted amicable settlement proceedings, received the Report of the Commissioner and decided the case is in a better position to resolve the motion/motions for reconsideration of the same. </p><p>In the second place, the decision contemplated under the provision, which will be promulgated by the judge transferred to another district under the authority of the second paragraph of Section 157 extends to and includes final judgment. Otherwise stated, the decision contemplated by the section is the final judgment in the case. For a case is not terminated until after the judgment has attained finality or until an appeal is timely perfected. Since the philosophy of this special provision which allows the judge transferred to another district to decide the case is premised on the fact that a judge who totally or partly heard the case is in a better position to resolve it, it follows that motion/motions for reconsideration of that decision, should be resolved by the judge who decided the case originally. </p><p>Having jurisdiction to decide the case totally heard by him under Section 157, <em>supra</em>, and having assumed the responsibility of preparing the decision pursuant thereto, it follows that Judge de Guzman possesses the necessary authority to resolve motions for reconsideration, which are clearly part and parcel of the decision-making process. In this connection, Section 6, Rule 135 of the Rules of Court is pertinent and is thus quoted below: </p><blockquote>&nbsp; <p>"Sec. 6. <em>Means to carry jurisdiction into effect</em>: When by law jurisdiction is conferred on a court or judicial officer, <em>all auxiliary writs, processes and other means necessary to carry it into effect may be employed by such court or officer</em>; and if the procedure to be followed in the exercise of such jurisdiction is not specifically pointed out by law or by these rules, <em>any suitable process or mode of proceeding may be adapted which appears conformable to the spirit of said law or rules</em>." </p> </blockquote> <p>As this Court held in <em>Go Lea Chu v. Gonzales</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; "(I)ndependent of any statutory provision, We assert that every court has inherent power to do all things reasonably necessary for the administration of justice within the scope of its jurisdiction." </p><p>To require another judge to consider and resolve the motion/motions for reconsideration is to require him to restudy the whole case over again with the resultant delay, and loss of time and effort on the part of all concerned. </p><p>Finally, it is a rule of statutory construction that the intention of the law should be considered and given due weight in its interpretation or construction. That construction, therefore, should be adopted which would carry to the fullest extent possible the policy considerations behind the enactment. The legislative intention to establish the CAR which will be responsive to the pressing need for just and economical disposition of landholder-tenant disputes is best carried out by allowing the judge who has decided the case to resolve the motion/motions for reconsideration. Therefore, the interests of justice, convenience and expediency, dictate that Judge de Guzman resolve the motions for reconsideration of the decision rendered by him originally. </p><p>3. <em>The third issue</em>. This issue is answered in the negative in the light of the foregoing resolution. The records show that Executive Judge Macalino who took over the <em>sala</em> at San Pablo City when Judge de Guzman was transferred to Angeles, Pampanga where his services were urgently needed, acted upon and resolved the motion for reconsideration filed by petitioner below, also the petitioner herein. Thereafter, however, realizing as rationalized above that par. 2 of Section 157 authorizes Judge de Guzman "... in the greater interest of justice and judicial comity among CAR judges" to resolve the same, he set aside his resolution of May 5, 1964 and referred the said motion to Judge de Guzman. In thus referring the case to Judge de Guzman, under the terms of Section 157 and for the reasons stated above, Executive Judge Macalino merely adopted an interpretation or construction of the section, to enhance just and expedient resolution of the motions for reconsideration, and, therefore, did not, by any standard, act without jurisdiction nor with grave abuse of discretion. In electing to refer the case to Judge de Guzman, who under the terms of Section 157 is authorized to act on the motion/motions for reconsideration of his own decision in spite of his assignment to another district, Executive Judge Macalino merely acted pursuant to law, and there cannot be grave abuse of discretion if a judge acted under the sanction of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><p><strong>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</strong>, let this Petition be, as it is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit.
