<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that in the morning of <st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1966</st1:date>, the remains of Mrs. Andrea de la <span class="SpellE">Cerna</span> de <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> were found in an

Subdivision in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Jane <span class="SpellE">Payumo</span> <span class="SpellE">Misa</span>,
the NBI Medico-Legal Officer who performed the autopsy on the cadaver of the
victim, testified that the body of the deceased was "carbonized" with
first degree burns in the skull, face, neck, anterior and posterior chest wall,
and the whole of the abdominal region and the back; while the upper extremities
as well as the lower extremities sustained second degree burns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The body sustained ten (10) stab wounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first stab wound with an aperture of 0.5
x 0.2 cm., oblong in shape, with contused edges, was located in the left chest,
anterior aspect at the level of the 1st <span class="SpellE">intercostal</span>
space, and 2.5 <span class="SpellE">cms</span>. from the anterior median line,
its long axis oriented obliquely upwards and downwards, penetrating the first cavity
and perforating the <span class="SpellE">antero</span>-medial portion, upper lobe
of the left lung to an approximate depth of 13 <span class="SpellE">cms</span>..<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second stab wound with an orifice of 0.5
x 0.2 cm., oblong in shape, with contused edges, was located at the left chest,
anterior aspect, 2 <span class="SpellE">cms</span>. below the first stab wound,
4.3 <span class="SpellE">cms</span>. from the ante­rior median line, running
horizontally and slightly downwards, directed <span class="SpellE">posteriorly</span>,
horizontally and medially, penetrating the thoracic cavity through the upper
lobe of the left lung, with an approximate depth of 8 <span class="SpellE">cms</span>..<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third stab wound, with a vent of 0.5 x
0.2 cm., oblong in shape, with contused edges, was located on the left chest,
anterior as­pect, at the level of the 3rd rib and 2.8 <span class="SpellE">cms</span>.
from the anterior median line, its long axis oriented backwards and downwards
directed medially slightly upwards and backwards, penetrating the first cavity
at the 3rd <span class="SpellE">intercostal</span> space, grazing the lower border
of the 3rd rib and penetrating the upper lobe of the left lung at an
approximate depth of 8 <span class="SpellE">cms</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other seven (7) stab wounds had similar
points of entry and direction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According
to her, the afore-cited ten (10) stab wounds were all fatal and could have been
caused by an <span class="SpellE">icepick</span> (Exhibit "L").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also declared that the victim died before
her body was burned.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bienvenido</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, a security
guard of the Bureau of Public Works in Manila, also testified that after he
left his house at the <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> Juana Rodriguez
Subdivision, <span class="SpellE">Balara</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, at about 10:30 a.m. on January 7, 1966, and while aboard a jeep with his
brother-in-law cruising towards Commonwealth Avenue of said city, he noticed a
car with a blue body and white top parked along a secluded spot near a road in
the <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> Juana Subdivision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Standing beside the open luggage compartment
of the car was a man of regular build, about 5 feet and 4 inches in height,
with brown complexion, long hair, and wearing a white polo shirt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As their jeep came nearer the car, the man
closed the luggage compartment and hurriedly drove away, taking Road 2 (shown
in the sketch, Exhibit "AA").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He later identified </span>this man to be appellant Ronald <span class="SpellE">Tanchico</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he
returned to his house thirty minutes later, he was met by his son who informed
him that something was burning near their house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proceeding immediately to the place
indicated, he saw, at about two (2) meters beyond the road's gutter, the thick
cogon grass burning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After fetching
several cans of water, he succeeded, with the assistance of his wife and
children, in putting out the blaze.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the middle of the
burnt cogon, he saw the remains of a woman lying on the ground, face up­wards
with her hands raised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The feet were
badly charred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After reporting the
matter to the Detec­tive Bureau of the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City
Police Department, a police team composed of Patrolmen Rodolfo Garcia, Sta.
Maria, <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Mangahas</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Godofredo</span> Ruiz proceeded to the place to investigate
the incident, </span>arriving there at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="11">11:30</st1:time>
that same morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The investigators
found, a short distance from the cadaver of the victim, a pair of step-ins, a
coin purse, a rosary with metallic beads, a pair of sur­gical gloves, a pair of
sunglasses, a handkerchief, and a cash voucher bearing the names of Mrs. Andrea
<span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Amando</span> <span class="SpellE">Calleja</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among the
persons whom the investigators questioned at the place where the remains were
found was <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cuales</span>,
a rural policeman in the <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> Juana Subdivision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cuales</span> informed the investigators that between 11:00 and
11:30 that morning, he saw a car with a light blue body and white top cruising
on a bumpy road near Commonwealth Avenue, driven by a man whom he identified to
be appellant Ronald <span class="SpellE">Tanchico</span>, and sit­ting beside the
driver in the front seat of the car was a slightly stout woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After he returned to his place of work, he
was informed by the son of <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> that a woman answering the des­cription of the said
woman was being burned in the cogon fields.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He further revealed to the police investigators that he could recognize
the man if he were to see him again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the police headquarters, this witness identified appellant as the man whom he
saw driving the light blue car with a woman pass­enger along <st1:street><st1:address>Commonwealth
  Avenue</st1:address></st1:street> that morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cuales</span> executed writ­ten statements at the police
headquarters that same day.</p>

<p class="BODY">To ascertain the identity of the victim, Pat. Garcia and the
other investigators tried to contact the persons whose names appeared in the
cash voucher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon discovering that
Architect <span class="SpellE">Amando</span> <span class="SpellE">Calleja</span>
was one of those mentioned in the voucher, they imme­diately proceeded to his
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From there, they were directed to
the house of Mrs. Andrea <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The investigators found out from the children
of Mrs. Andrea <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> that some of the articles
recovered at the scene of the fire belonged to their mother and the last time
they saw their mother was when she left their house at <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30</st1:time> in the morning of that same day.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Perpetua</span> <span class="SpellE">Dejarno</span>,
a maid of the <span class="SpellE">Tuazons</span>, told the police that it was
appellant Ronald <span class="SpellE">Tanchico</span> who fetched Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> early that morning and drove her away in his
car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also identified the step-ins,
the coin purse, the rosary, the handkerchief and the pair of sunglasses found
near the cadaver as those which Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> was
wearing when she left with the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Nilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>,
a son of the deceased, who iden­tified the remains of his mother at the <span class="SpellE">Quiogue</span> mor­tuary, recalled that appellant <span class="SpellE">Tanchico</span> was very close to their family as <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> Esquivel, wife of appellant, was brought up as a
member of their fami­ly, and when <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> married
the appellant, his mother acted as the wedding sponsor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also tes­tified that his mother used to
extend loans to appellant, who was engaged in building construction, to assist
the latter in the funding of his business.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the police were still in the residence of the deceased,
appellant Ronald <span class="SpellE">Tanchico</span> appeared, purportedly
looking for Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When ques­tioned by the police, he admitted
that he was with the deceased earlier that morning, but claimed that afterwards
they separated and he did not know where she went.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Tanchico</span> was then taken to
the police headquarters at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="17">5:30 p.m.</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon noticing some injuries on his right
knuckles and scratches on his arms and cheeks, Pat. Garcia inquired from <span class="SpellE">Tanchico</span> how he sustained them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant explained that the injuries on his
knuckles were sustained in an accidental fall in their bathroom but he could
not, however, account for the scratches found on his arms and cheeks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="15" hour="18">6:15
 p.m.</st1:time>, Pat. Garcia took Ronald <span class="SpellE">Tanchico</span> to
the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon being
questioned at the scene of the fire, <span class="SpellE">Tanchico</span>
admitted that he stabbed Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> and then burned
her to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further admitted taking
her bag and that finding P40.00 inside it, he took the money and spent P20.00
of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The balance he turned over to the
investigator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was brought back to the
police headquarters at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="18">6:30 p.m.</st1:time>,
and af­ter he was given some refreshments, he gave his statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he was informed that he had a right to
the assistance of counsel and he could call for a lawyer to assist him, <span class="SpellE">Tanchico</span> refused, saying that he does not need the
assistance of a lawyer.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his aforesaid statements (Exhibits "A",
"A-1" to "A-5"), <span class="SpellE">Tanchico</span>
narrated that the deceased was one of his marriage sponsors; that being a build­ing
contractor, he had borrowed from her two loans of P5,000.00 each to finance the
construction of two houses for his customers; that although he had already paid
to the deceased the amount of P9,700.00, she insisted that he still owes her the
sum of P6,500.00; that on January 5, 1966, the deceased called him up by phone
warning him that if he could not pay her his debt, she would file a case
against him in Court; that on the following day, or on Jan­uary 6, 1966, he
called her by phone pleading for a thirty-day extension within which to settle
his obligation but she refused; and that he, therefore, promised to pay her on
January 7, 1966 at the house of one of his customers from whom he could get the
money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was, however, his intention to
take her to the dumping grounds at <st1:street><st1:address>Commonwealth Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>,
kill her and then bury her there.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with his aforesaid plan, he bought an <span class="SpellE">icepick</span> from a store in <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span>,
Manila, and in the early morning of January 7, 1966, he brought with him on his
way to the house of the victim a pair of rubber gloves used by his
mother-in-law in dyeing her hair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
also purchased two cans of paint thinner and a pick axe and placed them in the
trunk of his car.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">He arrived at the house
of the deceased at </span>about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 a.m.</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased asked him to take her first to
the house of one Mrs. Medina at <st1:address><st1:street>15th Avenue</st1:street>,
 <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:city></st1:address>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From there, they proceeded to the house of
Commander Javier at <st1:street><st1:address>Cambridge Street</st1:address></st1:street>
to see the cabinet which she delivered, and from that place proceeded to <st1:street><st1:address>Commonwealth
  Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
an uninhabited place, he parked the car near a tree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they got out of the car, he asked her
not to insist in collecting his debt and when she refused, he boxed her, hitting
her at the bridge of the nose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
accounted for the injuries on his knuckles.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She began to shout as she fought back, scratching him on the neck and
face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Infuriated at her actions, he
stabbed her with the <span class="SpellE">icepick</span> several times on her
chest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then dragged the body and hid
it inside the thicket and then returned to his car to get the pick axe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was at this juncture that he saw a jeep
approaching the place where he was, so he hurriedly closed the trunk and drove
his car away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After cruising around the
place for a while, he returned to the spot where he had left the de­ceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He poured the paint thinner on the body of
the victim and lighted it with a match.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He then took the bag of the victim to get the <span style="">promissory notes </span>which he had asked her to bring with her that
morning and then proceeded to his house at <st1:address><st1:street>San <span class="SpellE">Mar­celino</span> Street</st1:street>, <st1:city>Manila</st1:city></st1:address>,
after throwing away the empty cans of paint thinner and the <span class="SpellE">icepick</span>
at the garbage dumping ground at <st1:street><st1:address>Scout <span class="SpellE">Torillo</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon open­ing the bag, he found two P20.00
bills inside but the promissory notes were not there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After getting the money, he threw the bag
into the "<span class="SpellE">estero</span>" near the <st1:place><st1:placename>Adamson</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place> bridge at <st1:street><st1:address>San
  <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> St.</st1:address></st1:street> where it
was carried away by the current.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then
brought the car to be washed at the gasoline station at <st1:street><st1:address>San
  <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After his extrajudicial statement was typewrit­ten, it was
presented to appellant <span class="SpellE">Tanchico</span> for signature who,
after reading it, made some correct­ions on items 13 and 43 and then he affixed
his signature thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. Garcia <span style="">then </span>called up City Fiscal Cortez to
inform him that the suspect in the killing perpetrated in the <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> Juana Subdivision had been identified and had executed
a statement on the matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">When Fiscal Cortez arrived in the Office of the Chief of Police
in the early morning of <st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1966</st1:date>,
he questioned appellant <span class="SpellE">Tanchico</span> on the crime in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant admitted to him
the com­mission <span style="">of </span>the crime, as
well as the veracity of the statements he made in his extrajudicial confession
(Exhibits "A", "A-1" to "A-5").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the presence of Capt. Diego, Lt. San Jose
and some press photogra­phers, Ronald <span class="SpellE">Tanchico</span>
subscribed under oath the veracity of his statements before Fiscal Cortez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he was asked by the Fiscal if he would
be will­ing to re-enact the crime, <span class="SpellE">Tanchico</span> readily
acceded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Acco</span>rding to Fiscal Cortez, when they arrived at the scene of
the incident, <span class="SpellE">Tanchico</span> voluntarily re­enacted the
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant even demonstrated how
he opened the can of paint thinner with the pick axe, soaked the body of the
victim with the inflam­mable liquid and the manner in which he ignited the body
of the victim with a lighted match.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to Fiscal Cortez, some objects found at the scene of the
crime, such as the rubber gloves and the dark glasses, were identified by the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He even described to the Fiscal
the shoes, pants and shirts, which he wore at the time of the commission of the
crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant also showed to the police investiga­tors the route
which he took after he had committed the crime - from the scene of the crime to
his house at <st1:address><st1:street>San <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span>
  Street</st1:street>, <st1:city>Manila</st1:city></st1:address>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in company with the police
investigators, from <st1:street><st1:address>Common­wealth Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>
they proceeded to the elliptical road, turning right to <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
Boulevard Extension, thence to <st1:street><st1:address>West Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>,
turning left to <st1:street><st1:address>South Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>,
then to <st1:street><st1:address>Scout <span class="SpellE">Torillo</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>
where the investigators recovered the <span class="SpellE">icepick</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They failed, however, to reco­ver the two
empty cans of paint thinner which appel­lant claimed to have dumped in the said
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the re-enactment of the
crime, appellant was then brought to the Office of Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>
where he exe­cuted a supplemental statement.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the trial, appellant Ronald <span class="SpellE">Tanchico</span>
denied involvement in the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Testifying on his own behalf, appellant declared that at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1966</st1:date>, he went to the
residence of Andrea <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> at <st1:street><st1:address>Lantana
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>, in response to her
telephone call.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon arriving at her
house, he was told by Andrea <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> that they are
going to the house of Mrs. Medina at <st1:address><st1:street>15th Avenue</st1:street>,
 <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:city></st1:address>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They arrived at the place of Mrs. Medina at
about <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30 o'clock</st1:time> that morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon being informed that Mrs. Medina was not
there and after staying there for about five to ten minutes, they proceeded to
the place of one Antonio Javier at <st1:street><st1:address>Cambridge Street</st1:address></st1:street>,
<span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
  City</st1:place></st1:city> to inspect some cabinets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From there, they drove to the corner of <st1:city><st1:place>Cambridge</st1:place></st1:city>
and <st1:street><st1:address>Aurora Blvd.</st1:address></st1:street> where Mrs.
<span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> alighted, after telling him that they should
meet again at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o'clock</st1:time> of
that date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then proceeded to the GSIS
building in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> to work on the
application for loan of his wife, and after transacting his business he went
home.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the afternoon, he went to the residence of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>
but upon entering the house he was met by two men who brought him immediately
to the headquarters of the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Police
Department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon arriving at the police
headquarters, he was immediately subjected to karate and fist blows for about
ten minutes by about six detectives, after which he was forced to sign a pre<span style="">pared typewritten statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although at first he </span>refused to sign
it, he subsequently agreed after receiving "another wave of
maltreatment".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon further
questioning, appellant admitted that he parti­cipated in the re-enactment of
the crime at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time> in
the evening of <st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1966</st1:date>,
and that during the re-enactment several pictures were taken of him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Two detention prisoners,
Domingo <span class="SpellE">delos</span> </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Santos</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> and Isaac <span class="SpellE">Nala</span>,
testified for the defense and dec­lared that while they were confined in their
deten­tion cell in the afternoon of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="1"><span style="">January 7, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, they saw appellant Ronald <span class="SpellE">Tanchico</span> inside the Investiga­tion Room being maltreated by
the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appeared, however, during
the ocular inspection that it was impossible for any person inside the deten­tion
cell to see anyone in the investigation room of the Detective Bureau of the
Police Department, where according to appellant Ronald <span class="SpellE">Tanchico</span>
he was investigated by the police on that date and time in </span>question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, during the ocular inspection, the
Presiding Judge stood between the door of the deten­tion cell and the hallway
and found that it was impossible to see even the door of the investigation
room, much less the inside premises of the investigation room, because there
was a partition blocking the line of sight.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next witness for the defense was Paz <span class="SpellE">Zate</span>,
a co-employee of the wife of appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She testi­fied that between <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00</st1:time>
and <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="1">January <span style="">7,
 </span>1966</st1:date>, she saw appellant at the premises of the GSIS building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She declared that appellant's purpose in
going to the GSIS was to follow up the mortgage loan application of his wife, <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> Esquivel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to this witness, appellant approached her for the signature of
Mr. Diaz, head of the Loans and Investment Department, as Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Zate</span> had the loan papers, but Mr. Diaz was out so <span class="SpellE">Tanchico</span> left at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning.</p>

<p class="BODY">In rebuttal, Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span> of the
GSIS dec­lared that according to the records of the Real Estate Department, the
loan folder of <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> Esquivel was not released
prior to January 7, 1966 as it was only acted upon by the Manager of the Real
Estate Department and released for transmittal to the Office <span style="">of </span>the General Manager of the Loans
and Investment Department only on January 27, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This indicated that the folder could not have
been released to the witness, Paz <span class="SpellE">Zate</span>, prior to <st1:date year="1966" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pat. Rodolfo Garcia, another rebuttal witness, denied the use of
violence to secure the confession of the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stated that all the written statements
were given voluntarily by the appellant and the re-enactment of the crime was
made by appellant in the presence of newspapermen and photographers who took
pictures of the different stages of <span style="">the
re-enactment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There are facts and circumstances which render untenable the
claim of appellant that his extrajudi­cial confession was extracted through
compulsion and duress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's
confession is replete with details of the actual preparation and commission of
the crime which only he could have known.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For ins­tance, the investigators could not have been aware that
appellant had two long overdue accounts with the deceased; that the deceased
insisted that she be paid said amounts immediately in full or else she would
file court action against him; that in pursuance of his plan to kill the
deceased, he pur­chased an <span class="SpellE">icepick</span> and paint thinner
which he brought along with him, together with a pick axe and a pair of
surgical gloves; that during their drive to <span class="SpellE">Doña</span>
Juana Subdivision, he tried to persuade the deceased for another extension
within which to pay the loan and when she refused he <span class="SpellE">struct</span>
her with his fist, hitting her on the bridge of her nose causing inju­ries to
his knuckles; that he sustained scratches on his face, arms and chest as a
result of the strug­gle offered by the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then stabbed her with the <span class="SpellE">icepick</span> and then brought the body of the deceased to the
isolated dump site where he burned the cadaver.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He even related that when he tried to get the pick axe from the compartment
box of his car he saw a jeep coming, which happened to be the jeep of
prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>,
and because of this he hurriedly drove his car away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He only returned to the dump site to burn the
body of the deceased when nobody was around.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is equally important to note that appellant, before signing
his extrajudicial confession, made some corrections thereon on his own
handwriting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention of appellant
that his extrajudicial confession is involuntary is not credible, considering
that appellant affirmed under oath, without making any complaint, the veracity
of his extrajudicial confession and even re-enacted his commission of the crime
in the presence of photographers and newspaper reporters.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's claim that he was subjected to fist and karate blows
by the police is further belied by other circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, the finding of the Medico-Legal
Officer of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>,
who examined physically appellant during his detention, revealed that the
appellant had no body contusions as he had only fingernail scratches on his
face, arms and chest and a slight injury on the right hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second, the fact that according to the ocular
inspection conducted by the trial judge, it was physically im­possible for the
two corroborative witnesses of appellant to see what was actually going on
inside the investigation room where appellant was allegedly maltreated.</p>

<p class="BODY">As argued by the Solicitor General, <span class="SpellE">prescinding</span>
from the facts narrated in the extrajudicial confession (Exhibits
"A", "A-1" to "A-5"), there are facts and
circumstances which point to appellant as the perpetrator of the offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant was the only one known who had
the motive to kill the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
admitted he had financial obliga­tions to the deceased which the latter
demanded to be settled in full in the morning of <st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1966</st1:date>, otherwise she will file charges against
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant bought two gallons of
paint thinner early in the morning of <st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="1">January
 7, 1966</st1:date>, after which at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00
 a.m.</st1:time> he picked up the deceased from her residence in his car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later that same morning <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cuales</span>, a farmer and rural policeman, saw appellant
driving a light blue car with white top along a bumpy isolated street in <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> Juana Rodri­guez Subdivision near <st1:street><st1:address>Commonwealth
  Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appel­lant was with a stout woman who was sitting beside him in the
front seat of the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was shown that
the deceased was a stout woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About
thirty minutes later, <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>,
a security guard of the Bureau of Public <span style="">Works
living at </span>the subdivision, while driving a jeep towards <st1:street><st1:address>Commonwealth
  Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>, saw appellant standing behind the open
baggage com­partment of a parked car near the site of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant, upon seeing this witness, hastily
closed the luggage compartment, boarded the car, and drove away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00
 a.m.</st1:time> that day, his son inform­ed him about a person being burned
under a tree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon going to the place, <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, his wife and his son saw the remains of the
deceased burning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was thru their
efforts that they were able to quench the fire.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The remains of the deceased were found severely burned apparently by a
highly combustible material.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Near the
remains of the victim was found <span style="">a pair
of sunglasses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the investigation,
appellant admitted the sunglasses to be his although at the trial he retracted
this admission and denied </span>ownership thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant when brought to the scene of the
crime by the investigators wept and admitted that he killed the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This admission was followed by his re-enactment
of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to City Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> P. Cortez, ap­pellant re-enacted how he first
boxed the victim on the nose, after which he drew an <span class="SpellE">icepick</span>
and stabbed the victim several times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
also demonstrated how he poured the paint thinner over the prostrate body of
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> and how he lighted a match stick and
threw the lighted match on the body of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are shown by the pictures taken of the
demonstration (Exhibits "B-1", 'B-2" and "B-13").</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the light of the
foregoing evidence, the defense of alibi of appellant is unavailing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense of alibi can be availed of only
where there is no clear evidence of the presence and participation of the
defendants in the crime charged against them, and it is impossible for them to
be physically present at the scene </span><span style="">of
</span><span style="">the crime at the time it was
committed.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But in the case at bar
where there is </span>clear <span style="">evidence of
the presence and participation of the appellant in the crime charged, and the
place where he claimed to have been is less than an hour's drive by car from <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City where the crime was commit­ted, and it was not,
therefore, physically impossible for appellant to have been at the scene of the
crime, such defense will not be tenable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The killing is qualified by evident premeditation considering that
appellant planned to kill the deceased at least sometime before the incident in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the killing was planned
by appellant is shown by the fact that he bought the <span class="SpellE">icepick</span>
from a store in <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span>, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> and also two gallons of paint thin­ner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant is, therefore, guilty of the crime
of murder, defined and penalized by Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crime is aggravated by the circumstance
of craft as the appellant induced the victim to go with him to </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Quezon</span></span><span style=""> City</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> on the pre­text that he would get the money
to pay his debt to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Feigning
friendship and taking advantage of her confidence, appellant was able to lure
the vic­tim to the uninhabited place where the crime was thereafter committed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The attendance of the
afore-mentioned aggravating circumstance, without any mitigating circumstance
to offset it, requires the imposition of the supreme penalty of death.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
