				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for habeas corpus to <span style="">secure </span>the discharge from detention of
petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Floreña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinagan</span>,
who was arrested and put to prison by the respondent provincial warden in the
provincial jail <span style="">of </span><st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the commencement of these proceedings in
this Court, the petitioner was allowed provisional liberty upon the filing of a
bond in the amount of P200.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">The disputed confinement of petitioner was effected in pursuance <span style="">of </span>an order of the Court of <span style="">First I</span>nstance of Iloilo, dated <st1:date year="1964" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1964</st1:date>, in Special
Proceedings No. 1588 of that court, to <span style="">wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Floreña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinagan</span>,
former mistress of Jaime Sisson, Sr. was appointed co-administrator in the
estate of Jaime <span class="SpellE">Siason</span> who, with his wife, Loreto <span class="SpellE">Juaneza</span>, was survived by his children, namely, Jaime, Jr.,
Eduardo, <span class="SpellE">Fely</span> and Alfredo, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Siason</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only
estate of the deceased is a house, according to the inventory submitted by the
administrator on <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Not a
portion o</span>f the claims of the creditors which have been allowed by the
court have been paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon peti­tion of
the creditors, the Court ordered the sale <span style="">of
the house by </span>public auction, where the <st1:place><st1:placename>Chinese</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Commercial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>High School</st1:placetype></st1:place>
<span style="">was the highest bidder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1964" day="26" month="9"><span style="">September 26, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, the court ordered <span class="SpellE">Floreña</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tinagan</span>, in her capacity </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">co-administrator of the estate, to </span><span style="">deliver the house in </span>her possession to

<span class="SpellE">Tinagan</span> as administrator of the estate had not yet
delivered the</span><span style=""> said </span><span style="">house and she
refused to deliver the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="10"><span style="">October
 27, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, this Court
ordered the Sheriff to eject </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Floreña</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Tinagan</span></span><span style=""> from </span><span style="">said house </span><span style="">and deliver

the order of the Court after she was duly apprised by the Court of her duties
and obligations as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="4" month="11"><span style="">November 4, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, this court ordered for her arrest.</span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">She escaped </span>arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When brought to the Court and asked if she
was willing to comply with the order of the court to deliver the house to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Chinese</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Commercial</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>High School</st1:placetype></st1:place>, she told the Court
that she did not want and she does not want to obey the order and would refuse
to obey the order of the Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in accordance with Section 7, Rule<span style=""> </span>71 of the Rules of Court, the
co-administrator, <span class="SpellE">Floreña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinagan</span>,<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>is
hereby ordered committed to the Iloilo Provincial Jail for<span style="">&nbsp; </span>refusing to obey the order of the Court and
to remain con­fined therein until such time when she signifies her willing­ness
to obey the order of the court and will in effect obey the said order of the
court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The petition for bail is denied."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is claimed that it is error for the court to order
petitioner's immediate arrest and commitment to prison since the acts allegedly
committed merely cons­titute indirect or constructive contempt, in which case,
before petitioner may be punished <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, a charge
in writing should be filed and opportunity to be heard be given her, citing
Section 3, Rule 71 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The respondent counters with the argument that the petitioner is guilty
of direct contempt under section 1 of the <span style="">same </span>Rule, which may be punished summarily,
since the misbehavior was commit­ted in the presence of the court or judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent provisions of Rule 71 are hereunder quoted:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Direct
content punished summarily</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- A
person guilty of misbehavior in the presence of or <span style="">so near </span>a court or judge as to obstruct or interrupt the
proceedings before the same, including disrespect toward the court or judge, of­fensive
personalities toward others, or refusal to be sworn or to answer <span style="">a </span>witness, or to subscribe an
affidavit or de­position when lawfully required so to do, may be summarily
adjudged in contempt by such court or judge and punished <span style="">by </span>fine not exceeding two hundred
pesos or imprisonment not exceeding ten days, or both, if it be an inferior
court."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Section 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Indirect
<span class="SpellE">con<span style="">tempts</span></span></u><u><span style=""> to be p</span>unished after </u><u><span style="">charge and hearing. </span></u><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>–
After </span>charge in writing has been filed, and an opportunity given to the
accused to be heard by himself or counsel, a person guilty of any of the
following acts may be pun­ished for contempt:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Misbehavior
of an offi­cer of a court in the performance of his official duties or in his
official transactions;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Disobedience of or resist­ance to a lawful
writ, process, order, judgment, or command of a court, or injunction granted by
a court or judge, including the act of <span style="">a
</span>person who, after being dis­possessed or ejected from any real property
the judgment or process of any court of competent juris­diction, enters or
attempts or in­duces another to enter into or upon such real property, for the
purpose of executing acts of owner­ship or possession, or in any man­ner disturbs
the possession given to the person adjudged to be enti­tled thereto;</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<u><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>“But nothing in this section shall be construed as to prevent the
court from issuing process to bring the accused party into court, or from
holding him in custody pending such proceedings."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The issue, therefore, is whether or not the alleged misbehavior
of the petitioner would fall under one or the other class of contempt of
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If under the first, called direct
contempt, the process of the immediate arrest of petitioner <span style="">was </span>proper;
if under the se­cond, called indirect contempt, there must be a writ­ten charge
and hearing before petitioner could be punished.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged contemptuous conduct of petitioner consists in her
refusal to obey an order of the court, after she was duly apprised of her
duties and obliga­tions as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>, to deliver
the house to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Chinese</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Commercial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>High School</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
the subject mat­ter of the order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent contends that the act of petitioner in answering the
judge that "she did not want and she does not want to obey the order and
would refuse to obey the order of the court" constituted misbehavior in
the presence of the court and/or disrespect toward the court or judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">While petitioner's answer might be construed <span style="">as </span>a challenge to the court's
authority to enforce its lawful orders, We are of the opinion, however, that
under the circumstances, petitioner's conduct does not amount to a direct
contempt, considering that peti­tioner would not have had the occasion to give
such an answer "in the presence of or so near a court or judge" were
she not arrested and brought to court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the predicament the petitioner w<span style="">as </span>placed - a rested and brought before the Judge, and then was
asked "if she was willing to comply with the order of the court to deliver
the house", having in mind an earlier petition<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
filed by her for "<i style="">Certiorari</i>, <i style="">Mandamus</i> and Prohibition with
Preliminary Injunction," praying to annul, for being premature, the
court's order issued on July 27, 1964, directing the public auction of the
building occupied by her - petitioner merely manifested to the court what she
believed to be the correct answer to the question of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had her own valid reasons for resisting
obedience to the court's order because her petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> and prohibition before this Court had not yet been
resolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of giving the
petitioner an opportunity to explain her refusal to comply with the order, the
Judge, in violation of petitioner's <span style="">consti</span>tutional
right to due process, immediately ordered her confinement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The power to punish for contempt should be used sparingly, with
caution, deliberation and with due regard to the provisions of the law and the
constitu­tional rights of the individual.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Courts should be slow in jailing people for non-compliance with their
orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only in cases of clear and
contumacious re­fusal to obey should said power be exercised.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Austria</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. <span class="SpellE">Masaquel</span>, G.R. L-22356, <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1967</st1:date>, We held that giving of an
affirmative answer, in the courtroom, to the question of the judge, "Do
you doubt the integrity of the pre­siding Judge to decide this case fairly and
impartial­ly because the lawyer of the other party was my for­mer
assistant?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do you doubt?" is not an
act amount­ing to contempt of court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said<span style=""> </span>this Court in
elucidation:</p>

<blockquote>"When petitioner answered 'Yes, sir’ to the question asked by
respondent Judge, petitioner simply expressed his sincere feeling under the
circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> But
the petitioner was simply truthful and candid to the court when he gave <span style="">that </span>answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would have been unfair to respondent Judge
had petitioner answered 'No, sir' because then he would not be sincere with the
court, and he would be inconsistent with the request that he made through his
counsel for respondent Judge to inhibit himself from further hearing the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When respondent Judge asked that
question, he necessarily expected a truthful answer from petitioner, and indeed
petitioner gave him the truthful answer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are not persuaded that in so answering petitioner meant to be disres­pectful,
offensive or insult­ing to respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor do We consider that in so answering petitioner meant to cast
reflection on the integrity and honesty of respondent Judge.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES</b> <b>CONSIDERED</b>, the petition is hereby
granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bond posted by the
petitioner is hereby declared cancelled.<span style="">&nbsp;
