				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner Roberto <span class="SpellE">Monroy</span> was the
incumbent Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Navotas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
when on <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1961</st1:date>,
his certifi­cate of candidacy as r<span style="">e</span>presentative
of the first district of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in the forthcoming
elections <span style="">was filed with </span>the
Commission on Elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three days
later, or on <st1:date year="1961" day="18" month="9">Septem­ber <span style="">18, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>petitioner filed a letter
withdrawing said certificate of candidacy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Commission on Elections, per resolution,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
approved the withdrawal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But on Septem­ber
21, <span style="">1961, </span>respondent Felipe del
Rosario, then the vice-mayor of <span class="SpellE">Navotas</span>, took his
oath of office as munici­pal mayor on the theory that petitioner had forfeited
the said office upon his filing of the certificate of candi­dacy in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon these facts, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, sitting in <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, held in
the suit for injunction instituted by petitioner against respondents that (a)
the former had ceased to be mayor of <span class="SpellE">Navotas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ri<span style="">zal</span></span><span style="">, </span><span style="">after </span><span style="">his certificate of
candidacy was filed on September 15, </span><span style="">1961; </span>(b) respondent del Rosario became municipal mayor upon his
having assumed office as such on September 21, <span style="">1961; </span>(c) petitioner must reimburse, as actual damages, the
salaries to which respondent was entitled as Mayor from September 21, 1961 up
to the time he can reassume said office; and (d) petitioner must pay respondent
P1,000.00 as moral damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">This judgment was, on appeal by petitioner to the Court of
Appeals, affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> except for
the award of moral damages which was eliminated<span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The same Court
reaffirmed its stand upon petitioner's filing a motion to reconsider.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this petition for certiorari to review
the ruling of the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner first argues that both the lower court and the Court
of Appeals had done what they had no juris­diction to do - review a resolution
of the Commission on Elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
submission is without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Constitution empowers the Commission on Elec­tions to</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> decide, save those involving
the right to vote, all <u><span style="">administrative
questions</span></u><span style=""> </span>affect­ing
elections, including the determination of the number and location of polling
places, and the appointment of election inspectors and of other election
officials, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
(Emphasis supplied) </blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">And the decisions, orders and rulings of
the Commission on these administrative questions are <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span>
only by the Supreme Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Since the powers of the Commission are limited to matters connected with the
"conduct of elections", necessarily its adjudicatory or quasi-judi­cial
powers are likewise limited to controversies connec­ted with the "conduct
of elections."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This phrase covers
all the administrative process of preparing and operat­ing the election
machinery so that the people could exer­cise their right to vote at the given
time.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
All ques­tions and controversies that may arise <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
<span style="">are </span>to be resolved exclusively
by the Commission, subject to re­view only by the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, in this case there appears to be no deci­sion, order or
ruling of the Commission on any <u><span style="">adminis­trative
question or controversy</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>There was no dispute before the
Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent never contested
the filing of petitioner's certificate of candidacy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither has he disputed before that body the
withdrawal thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And even if there
was a controversy before the Commission, the same did not and could not
possibly have anything to do with the conduct of elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the parties are actually <span class="SpellE">controverting</span> is whether or not petitioner was still the
municipal mayor after <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="9">September <span style="">15, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>This
purely legal dispute has absolutely no bearing or effect on the conduct of the
elections for the seat of congress­man for the first district of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The election
can go on irrespective of whether petitioner is considered re­signed from his
position of municipal mayor or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
only interest and, for that matter, jurisdiction, of the Commission on
Elections in this regard is to know who are the running candidates for the
forthcoming elections, for that affects the conduct of election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So when petitioner withdrew the certificate
announcing his candidacy for Congressman, as far as the Commission could be
concerned, petitioner was no longer interested in running for that seat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matter of his having forfeited his
present po­sition and the possible legal effect thereon by the withdrawal of
his certificate was completely out of the pic­ture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, that purely legal question properly fell
within the cognizance of the courts.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Now the withdrawal of his
certificate of candidacy did not restore petitioner to his former
position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sec. </span>27 <span style="">of the Rev. Election Code providing that ?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Any elective provincial, municipal, or city official running
for an office, other than the one which he is actually holding, shall be
considered resigned from his office from the moment of the filing of his certi­ficate
of candidacy,"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">makes the forfeiture automatic and
permanently effective upon the filing of the certificate of candidacy for ano­ther
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only the <u>moment</u> and <u>act</u>
of filing are con­sidered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once the
certificate is filed, the seat is for­feited forever and nothing save a new
election or appointment can restore the ousted official.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, as We had occasion to remark, through
Justice J.B.L. Reyes, in <u>Cas­tro v. <span class="SpellE">Gatuslao</span></u>,
98 Phil. <span style="">194, 196:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>“x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span style="">The wording of the law plainly indi­cates that only the date of filing
of the cer­tificate of candidacy should be taken into ac­count.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><u>The law does not make the
forfeiture dependent upon future contingencies, unforeseen and unforeseeable,
since the vacating is expressly made as of </u><u><span style="">the moment </span>of the filing of the certificate of candidacy</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" <span style="">(Em­phasis
supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner's contention
that the certificate of can­didacy was filed without his knowledge and consent
and, hence, the Commission's approval of its withdrawal inva­lidated such
certificate for </span>all <span style="">legal
purposes, is un­tenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It nowhere
appears that the Commission's reso­lution expressly invalidated the
certificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The with­drawal of a
certificate of candidacy does not necessa</span>rily render the certificate
void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once filed, the permanent legal effects
produced thereby remain even if the certificate itself be subsequently
withdrawn. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Moreover, both the trial
court and the Court of Appeals ex­pressly found <u>as a fact</u> that the
certificate in question was filed <u>with</u> petitioner's knowledge and
consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since the nature of the
remedy taken by petitioner before Us would allow a discussion of purely legal
questions on­ly, such fact is deemed conceded.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner would next maintain that respondent Court of Appeals
likewise erred in affirming a lower court judg­ment requiring petitioner to pay
respondent Del Rosario by way of actual damages the salaries he was allegedly
entitled to receive from <st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="9">September 21,
 1961</st1:date>, to the date of petitioner's vacation of his office as
mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of this he relies
solely upon <u>Rodriguez v. Tan</u>, 91 Phil. 724, holding that a senator who
had been proclaimed and had assumed office but was later on ousted in an
election protest, is a <u>de</u> <u>facto</u> officer during the time he held
the office of senator, and can retain the emoluments received even as against
the successful protestant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's
factual premise is the appellate court's finding that he was a <u>de</u> <u>facto</u>
officer when he continued occupying the of­fice <span style="">of </span>mayor after <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="9">September
 15, 1961</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, We agree with the Court of Appeals that the Rodriguez case
is not applicable here for absence of fac­tual and legal <span style="">similarities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>The Rodriguez case involved a senator who had been proclaimed as
duly elected, assumed the office and was subsequently ousted as a result of an
election contest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These peculiar facts
called for the ap­plication of an established precedent in this jurisdiction
that the candidate duly proclaimed must assume office not­withstanding a
protest filed against him and can retain the compensation paid during his
incumbency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the case at bar does not
involve a <u>proclaimed</u> elective official who will be <u>ousted</u> because
of <span style="">an <u>election </u></span><u>contest</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pre­sent case for injunction and <u>quo</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> involves the for­feiture of the
office of municipal mayor by the incumbent occupant thereof and the claim to
that office by the vice mayor because of the operation of Sec. 27 of the Rev.
Elec­tion Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The established
precedent invoked in the Rod­riguez case cannot therefore be applied in this
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the general rule then, i.e., "that the right­ful
incumbent of a public office may recover from an of­ficer <u>de</u> <u>facto</u>
the salary received by the latter during the time of his wrongful tenure, even
though he entered into the office in good faith and under color of title"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
that applies in the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
resulting hardship occasioned by the operation of this rule to the <u>de</u> <u>facto</u>
officer who did actual work is recognized; but <span style="">it is far </span>more cogently acknowledge that the <u>de</u> <u>facto</u>
doctrine has been formulated, not for the protection of the <u>de</u> <u>facto</u>
officer principally, but rather for the <span style="">protection
of the </span>public and individuals who get involved in the official acts of
persons discharging the duties of an office with­out being lawful officers.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The question of compensation involves different principles and concepts
however.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, it is possession of
title, not of the office, that is decisive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A <u>de</u> <u>facto</u> officer, not having good title, takes the
salaries at his risk and must therefore account to the <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>jure</u></span> officer for whatever amount of <span style="">salary </span>he rec<span style="">eive</span><span style="">d</span><span style=""> during the</span> period of his wrongful
retention of the public office.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>
