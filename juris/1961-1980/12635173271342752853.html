robbery in band with homicide <span style="">and </span>sentencing
each of them to suffer the penalty of death, to <span style="">indemnify </span>jointly and severally the heirs of the deceased in the
sum of P6,000.00, to pay jointly and severally the offended party the sum of
P3,000.00 repre­senting the money and the value of the articles taken, and each
to pay his proportionate share of the costs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The six persons thus convicted were among the eleven (11) defendants
charged below, including one referred to only as "John Doe", who
together with <span class="SpellE">Salip</span> Mania and <span class="SpellE">Balawie</span>
Moro had not been apprehended at the time the information was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two (2) others, namely, <span class="SpellE">Abdulhasa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Abdula</span> and <span class="SpellE">Absan</span> <span class="SpellE">Abdula</span>, who were tried joint­ly with the six (6) convicted
defendants, were acquitted by the trial court on the ground of reasonable
doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The findings of the trial
court with reference </span>to the commission of the felonious acts and the
circums­tances surrounding them, except the sufficiency of the evidence
relating to the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> identities as the
perpetrators thereof, are not disputed, to the extent that the defendants have
adopted and reproduced said findings in their brief as their own statement of
facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, they assail the
conclusion reached by the trial court that the evidence has established beyond
reasonable doubt their identities as the perpetrators of the offense charged.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The scene of the crime
was a two-storey house located in <u>barrio</u> </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Calais</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> of the island-municipality of <span class="SpellE">Olutanga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, used both as residence and as a general store of the <span class="SpellE">Macion</span> family.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because water from the nearby </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Calais</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> river covers the base of the house during
high tide, the ground floor was actually constructed above ground level.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The structural construc­tion of said house is
aptly described by the trial court in this wise:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> It
is so constructed on the marshes, such that the water from the <st1:place><st1:placename>Calais</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place> reaches underneath the house
at high tide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The premises could be
reached from the sea through the <st1:place><st1:placename>Calais</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place> by boat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The upper floor of the house is the living
quarters of <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Macion</span>
and his family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first floor is a
store x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> with the main
entrance at the front x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the rear of the store is the kitchen, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The floor­ing of the kitchen is constructed a
little bit lower than the flooring of the store, such that there is an open
space in between where the store and the kitchen adjoin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second floor is accessible by a stairway
located near the kitchen, about seven meters to the main door of the
store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The whole store on the first
floor could be seen from the second floor through a 1 foot <span style="">by 6 inches opening on the floor, which was
built for precautionary measure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further
to the rear adjoining the kitchen is an extension of the flooring, which is a
sort of a landing place or wharf x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> where one coming to the place </span>from the sea through
the <st1:place><st1:placename>Calais</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>
by boat can land or anchor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the
kitchen one can get into the store through a door, x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>, or from the kitchen to the wharf through a
backdoor, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the side of the house or store is an
alley, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, where
customers of the store coming from the wharf may pass through an exit, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> to the alley, then to the
front of the store where there is the main entrance, x <span class="SpellE">x</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the late afternoon of </span><st1:date year="1960" day="8" month="2"><span style="">February </span><span style="">8, </span><span style="">1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, while
Diego <span class="SpellE">Mahinay</span>, cook of the <span class="SpellE">Macion</span>
household, was preparing supper, he saw through the kitchen window overlooking
the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">Calais</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">River</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> the approach of two (2) <span class="SpellE">vintas</span>,
which eventually docked alongside the <span class="SpellE">Macions</span>'
privately-constructed wharf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thinking
that the new arrivals were fishermen and realizing that he had no sufficient
viands for that evening, Diego <span class="SpellE">Mahinay</span> stepped out of
the kitchen through the rear door of the <span class="SpellE">Macion</span>
residence and proceeded to meet the men in the <span class="SpellE">vintas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one <span class="SpellE">vinta</span> were <span class="SpellE">Abdurasid</span> <span class="SpellE">Akong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abdu</span> <span class="SpellE">Gustaham</span> and four (4) others
whom he did not know by name but recognized by their faces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the other <span class="SpellE">vinta</span>
were <span class="SpellE">Sajili</span> <span class="SpellE">Diarul</span>, <span class="SpellE">Solaiman</span> <span class="SpellE">Monajin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Macabang</span> <span class="SpellE">Gustaham</span>, <span class="SpellE">Adjan</span> <span class="SpellE">Gustaham</span> and another
companion whom he likewise did not know by name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon being informed by the new arrivals that
they had no fish to sell, Diego <span class="SpellE">Mahinay</span> returned to
the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hardly had he entered when <span class="SpellE">Abdurasid</span> <span class="SpellE">Akong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Solaiman</span> <span class="SpellE">Monajin</span> suddenly barged
inside through the backdoor and hastily proceeded into the store by way of the
connecting door from the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
same time their other companions slipped through the alley beside the store and
entered by way of the main door in front.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Completely taken by surprise and unable to understand why <span class="SpellE">Abdurasid</span> <span class="SpellE">Akong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Solaiman</span> <span class="SpellE">Monajin</span> should enter the
store through the kitchen instead of the usual passage by the side alley, Diego
<span class="SpellE">Mahinay</span> followed behind them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he reached the door connecting the
kitchen to the store he saw <span class="SpellE">Abdurasid</span> <span class="SpellE">Akong</span> fire his carbine at the storekeeper, <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Yuayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The result was fatal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rest of <span class="SpellE">Abdurasid's</span>
companions then began breaking the store's shelves and looting the contents
there­of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Diego <span class="SpellE">Mahinay</span>
doubled back to seek a hiding place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He </span><span style="">squeezed himself into the small space
separating the floor of the store from that of the kitchen, and remained there
until after the looters had left the premises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Albino <span class="SpellE">Abayle</span>, a household helper of the <span class="SpellE">Macions</span>,
substantially corroborated Diego <span class="SpellE">Mahinay's</span> version of
the facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the two (2) <span class="SpellE">vintas</span> arrived that afternoon, Albino was resting at the
wharf after the day's work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With him at
the time was <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Mariño</span>,
with whom he was engaged </span>in <span style="">light
talk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He noted the new arrivals with
more than passing interest because of their large number and because some of
them were carrying unidentified ob­jects wrapped in sacks. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>He saw <span class="SpellE">Abdurasid</span> <span class="SpellE">Akong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Solai­man</span> <span class="SpellE">Monajin</span> enter the kitchen door and the others pass through
the alley and enter by </span><span style="">way </span><span style="">of
the main door in front.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly after
the group entered the store, </span>Albino <span class="SpellE">Abayle</span> <span style="">heard shots inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He rushed through the kitchen and into the
store to investigate, and </span><span style="">saw </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Raymundo</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Yuayan</span> prostrate on the floor and the men he
had seen arrive breaking the store's shelves and laying their hands on the
merchandise displayed there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Albino ran
under the store to hide, squatting in the water which had by then risen
considerably due to the incoming high tide.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From his hiding place he saw Diego <span class="SpellE">Mahinay</span>
squeezed between the floors of the kitchen and of the store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only when the raiders were taking
their loot to the <span class="SpellE">vintas</span>, with their firearms clearly
visible, that it </span>dawned upon <span style="">him
that the objects wrapped in sacks they were carrying when they arrived were
actually carbines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The occurrence from
beginning to end was witnessed by <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Yuayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Macion</span>, wife of the
storeowner, from the residential portion of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had earlier gone upstairs to rest and
through the small open­ing on the floor directly above the store she saw
several men pointing their firearms </span><span style="">menacingly </span><span style="">and one of
them actually shooting the storekeeper.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When one of them started to go up to the second floor where she was she
immediately jumped through the window into the water below, injuring her right
shoulder and leg as a result, for which she was medically treated in </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Zamboanga</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> the </span>next <span style="">day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The accused have been
positivel</span><span style="">y</span><span style=""> identified by the three (3) witnesses, who
had no conceivable reason, as none has been suggested, to falsely incriminate
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the former could not have
possibly mistaken the latter for other persons because they were frequent
visitors </span>at the store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Abdurasid</span> <span class="SpellE">Akong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abdu</span> <span class="SpellE">Gustaham</span>, <span class="SpellE">Macabang</span> <span class="SpellE">Gustaham</span> and <span class="SpellE">Adjan</span> <span class="SpellE">Gustaham</span> used to sell fish
there; <span class="SpellE">Sajili</span> <span class="SpellE">Darul</span> was a
former house helper of <span style="">Mrs. </span><span class="SpellE">Macion's</span> brother-in-law and hence familiar, at least by
face, to <span class="SpellE">Macion</span> household; and <span class="SpellE">Solaiman</span>
<span class="SpellE">Monajin</span> was a regular customer at the store every
Sunday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That particular after<span style="">noon of the </span><span style="">crime, Diego <span class="SpellE">Mahinay</span> even talked to them and
asked </span><span style="">if they had fish to
sell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no attempt to disguise
themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under those circumstances
there could hardly have been a mistake on the part of the wit­nesses in
identifying them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Each defendant set up the
defense of <u>alibi</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Abdurasid</span> <span class="SpellE">Akong</span> would have us
believe that at the time of the robbery he was 12 kilometers away in Polo <span class="SpellE">Bohangin</span> <span class="SpellE">Mahaba</span>, selling fish to
one <span class="SpellE">Abdulhari</span>; and that he left his house in <span class="SpellE">Gandaan</span> at 3:00 p.m. and arrived at Polo <span class="SpellE">Bohangin</span> <span class="SpellE">Mahaba</span> </span><span style="">an hour and a half later, staying there until
sunset when he </span>started paddling back home, arriving at his house at
almost midnight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet by <span style="">his own admission, during the more </span>than
six (6) years that he had been a fisherman that was the only occasion when he
went to Polo <span class="SpellE">Bohangin</span> <span class="SpellE">Mahaba</span>
to <span style="">sell his catch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the past he regularly catered to customers
in </span><u><span style="">barrio</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">Calais,
where he got better prices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There <span style="">is </span>no believable explanation as to
why <span class="SpellE">Abdurasid</span> <span class="SpellE">Akong</span> should
suddenly transact </span><span style="">his business
in Polo <span class="SpellE">Bohangin</span> </span><span class="SpellE">Mahaba</span>
<span style="">on </span>the date in question in spite
of the fact that it was much further away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This alibi, although confirmed by <span class="SpellE">Abdulhari</span>,
cannot prevail over the positive identification made by the three disinterested
eyewitnesses, who had no demonstra­ted motive to perjure themselves against
him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The <span class="SpellE">Gustaham</span>
brothers, namely, </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Macabang</span></span><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Abdu</span> and <span class="SpellE">Adjan</span>, and co-accused <span class="SpellE">Solaiman</span> <span class="SpellE">Monajin</span>, claimed </span><span style="">that from </span>7:00 a.m. up to about 6:00
p.m. of February 8, 1960, they were working in the farm of one <span class="SpellE">Akimodin</span> <span class="SpellE">Buto</span> <span style="">in </span><span class="SpellE">Tando</span>
Dial, about 3 1/2 kilometers from <u>barrio</u> Calais.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although their <u>alibi</u> appears to be
substantiated by the <span style="">farm </span>owner, <span class="SpellE">Akimodin</span> <span class="SpellE">Buto</span>, the same, like that of <span class="SpellE">Abdurasid</span>
<span class="SpellE">Akong</span>, can­not prevail over the direct and positive
evidence of their presence at the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same <span style="">observation also </span>holds true with respect to the <u>alibi</u> put
up by <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sajili</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Diarul</span>, who
merely explained that on hole day of February 8, 1960 he, together with his
father and one <span class="SpellE">Saraban</span>, was cultivating their farm at
<span class="SpellE">Ganda</span>-an, 3.2 kilo­meters <span style="">away </span>from <u><span style="">barrio</span></u><span style=""> </span>Calais.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Restating the consistent
ruling of this Court </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">many decisions, it said in a relatively
recent case:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<u>Alibi</u> as a defense must be <span style="">received </span>with utmost caution because of the facility with which
it maybe concocted and fabricated, <span style="">and
in order that such defense may be successful, it must be proved by convincing
evidence which reasonably satisfies the court of the truth of such defense, and
unless it meets this requirement, it can­not prevail against the clear and
positive identification of the accused by witnesses of the prosecution who had
no motive to testify against the persons charged of a crime; although, it is
also settled rule that it is not on the weakness of the defense of alibi that
his conviction lies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It (still) behooves
the prosecution to show his guilt beyond the shadow of a doubt." (People
vs. <span class="SpellE">Capito</span>, et al., L-24466, March 19, 1968; 22 SCRA
1130)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Everything considered,
there is no doubt in our </span>mind that the positive identification of herein
defendants by the three eye-witnesses has not been shaken.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The crime committed by
the defendants is robbery </span>with homicide as defined and penalized under
Article 294 (1) of the Revised Penal Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
In automatically imposing the death penalty, the trial court appears to be
under the impression that in every case of robbery with homicide committed by a
band, with the perpetrators thereof armed with unlicensed firearms, there is no
alternative but to impose the death penalty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of this
decision is actually an <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the decision
under review, we feel that a correction of the court <u>a</u> <u>q</u><u><span style="">uo</span></u><span style="">'s </span>view is in order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is </span>not
accurate to say, as the trial court did, that because the crime of robbery with
homicide is committed by <span style="">a </span>band whose members are armed with unlicensed firearms, there
is no more need to inquire into the attendant aggravating and mitigating
circumstances in order to determine the penalty imposable and that the trial
court has no choice but to impose the supreme penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This view fails to take note of the fact that
Art. 295 merely provides, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
that it is only when the offenses described in subdivisions 3, 4 and 5 <span style="">of Art. 294 are committed by a band that the
proper penalties in their maximum periods should be imposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In People vs. <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span>,
No. L-19491, August 30, 1968, 24 SCRA 798, this Court, speaking through Mr.
Justice Castro, said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">"</span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the cir­cumstance
of band is therefore qualifying only in robbery punished by subdivisions 3, 4
and 5 of Art. 294.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequent­ly, Art.
295 is inapplicable to robbery with homicide, rape, intentional mutilation, and
</span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">lesiones</span></u></span><span style=""> <u>graves</u></span><span style=""> result­ing in insanity, imbecility, impotency or blindness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the foregoing classes of robbery which are
described in Art. 294(1) and (2) are perpetrated by a band, they would not be
punishable under Art. 295, but then </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">cuadrilla</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">would
be generic aggravating under Art. 14 of the Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, with the present wording of Art. 295
there is no crime </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">'robbery with homicide in band.' If robbery
with homicide is committed by a band, the indictable offense would still be
denominated as 'robbery with homicide' under Art. 294(1), but the element of
band, as stated above, would be appreciated as an ordinary aggravating circums­tance."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Even with the generic aggravating circumstance of band alone,
there being no mitigating circumstance to offset the same, the imposition of
the death penalty is in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But then the offense in this case was likewise attended by the <span style="">circumstances of </span>"dwelling,"
treachery and premeditation, this last being evident from the fact that the
defendants must <span style="">have </span>planned the
robbery beforehand, as indicated by <span style="">their
</span>coming as an armed group and by the manner in which they entered <span style="">the </span>store.</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> submits
that the defendants belong to the cultural minorities and that this <span style="">should be considered as a mitigating
circumstance in their favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact
cannot conceivably reduce, </span>from the subjective point of view, the
defendants' aware­ness of the gravity of their offense, for robbery and killing
are by their very nature just <span style="">as </span>wrong to the ignorant as they are to the
enlightened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event <span style="">even if considered as mitigating, the </span><span style="">circumstance referred to would be
insufficient </span><span style="">to offset the
aggravating </span><span style="">circums­</span><span style="">tances present.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Both the provincial fiscal and the trial court designated the offense committed
as "robbery in band with homicide" as defined and penalized under
Art. 294(1) in relation to Art. 296 of the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This inaccurate designation of the offense
led the trial court to automatically impose the death penalty without
appreciating any ag­gravating or mitigating circumstances which might have
attended the commission of the deed, apparently relying solely upon the provisions
of Arts. 295 and 296 of the Re­vised Penal Code to the effect that where
