				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for review on certiorari the order of 23 May 19 64 and
the resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> of 29 June 1964 of the respondent Court of
Industrial Relations in its Case, No. 12-IPA.</p>

<p class="BODY">The said case No. 12-IPA was an off-shoot of a strike staged by
the respondent National Shipyards employees' and Workers' Association on 5
November 1956 for failure of the petitioner National Shipyards and Steel
Corporation (NASSCO for short) to accede to their demands concerning terms and
conditions of employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the
President of the Philippines had certified the labor dispute as one involving
an industry indispensable to the national interest, the NASSCO filed a petition
with the Industrial Court, docketed as Case No. 12-IPA, praying for a
return-to-work order or for authority to replace the striking workers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Labor and management later reached an amicable settlement on
certain demands and conditions, among which was the re­instatement of the union
president, <span class="SpellE">Melanio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Capellan</span>,
and the payment of his <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The partial settlement was reduced to writing
and submitted to the court and, on the basis thereof, the court rendered a
partial decision on <st1:date year="1957" day="29" month="7">29 July 1957</st1:date>
enjoining the parties to comply with the said agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The herein respondent union on 17 December 1957 Moved for
reinstatement of <span class="SpellE">CapeIlan</span> with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>,
and for contempt of court because of petitioner's refusal to do so, followed on
27 January 1958 by another motion for execution of the partial decision and for
contempt of court (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 178).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner company opposed both
motions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an order on 13 November 1958
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> directed the reinstatement of union president <span class="SpellE">Capellan</span> and the computation and payment of his <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the
writ Issued pursuant thereto was returned unsatisfied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On 30 May 1959, the court denied the motion
for contempt because the company's refusal to reinstate <span class="SpellE">Capellan</span>
was found by the court to be justified by the latter's conviction for slight
physical injuries, with a penalty of 20 days imprisonment, by the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> in its Criminal Case No.
4802.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Capellan</span>
had appealed the judgment to the Court of Appeals, but was unsuccessful; the
Judgment became final in June 1959.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 6 July 1959, the court, on motion of took the position that
even if <span class="SpellE">CapeIlan</span> had lost his right to reinstate
merit by reason of his conviction, such loss did not include his <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, and so, ordered the payment of said <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> up to May 1959, when the Court below found the
NASSCO justified in its refusal to reinstate <span class="SpellE">CapeIlan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>NASSCO duly complied and paid as ordered.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="3">1 March 1963</st1:date>
the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
granted "an absolute and unconditional pardon" to <span class="SpellE">Melanio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Capellan</span> for the crime committed by him and
"restored" him to "full civil and political rights." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 210 being Annex ‘A’ to
respondent, Answer).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 7 May 1963, <span class="SpellE">Capellan</span> again moved for
his reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was denied by the court on 12 September
1963 (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 94-98, being Annex “K” to Petition)
on the ground that the motion seeks to set aside, alter modify the order of 30
May 1959 which the court, in its opinion could no longer do under Section 17 of
Commonwealth with Act 103 since more than three years was elapsed from the date
of the order.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 29 December 1963, the union filed again an urgent motion for
execution of the order of 13 November 1958.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The company again opposed the motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This time, on 23 May 1964, the labor court granted the motion, and provided
for <span class="SpellE">Capellan's</span> reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
from 1 March 1963 until actually reinstated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The order was affirmed <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> on 29 June 1964.</p>

<p class="BODY">The aforesaid order of 23 May 1964 and the subsequent
confirmatory resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> are the subjects of the present
petition for review, wherein the petitioner NASSCO assigned the following
errors:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred in
issuing an alias writ of execution for the portion of the order dated November
13, 1958 which was subsequently modified or altered by the orders of May 30,
1959 and July 6, 1959, and which orders modifying the order of November 13,
1958, were appealed and are already final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent CIR erred
in holding that absolute pardon restored to <span class="SpellE">Melanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Capellan</span> the office forfeited by reason of his conviction.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The order dated 13 November 1959 was not modified or altered by
the orders of 30 May 1959 and 6 July 1959.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is so because the matter considered by the industrial court in its
order of 10 May 1959 was not the reinstatement and <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Capellan</span> (which reinstatement and <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> were the matters adjudicated in the order of 13
November 1958), but the motion for contempt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The order of 30 May 1959 plainly states in its <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion the following:</p>

<blockquote>“The Court, finding the refusal of the Company to reinstate <span class="SpellE">Melanio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Capellan</span> to be well-taken,
denies the motion for contempt of Court.” <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 69 being the last page of Annex “F” to Petition.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The same thing may be said of the order
of 6 July 1959 because what was considered is as stated in the order as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The question now to be resolved is whether­ <span class="SpellE">Melanio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Capellan's</span> loss of
right to reinstatement as per Court order quoted above carries with it the loss
of his right to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.” (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 72, being on p. 3 of Annex "G" to Petition) ---</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">which</span> the court
resolved in the negative and accordingly directed:</p>

<blockquote>“IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Court hereby orders the petitioner
to pay union president <span class="SpellE">Melanio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Capellan</span>
his <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> corresponding from the date of his
dismissal to May 30, 1959.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx."</span>
<span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 74).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is, therefore, clear that the orders of <st1:date month="5" day="10" year="1959">10 May 1959</st1:date> and <st1:date month="7" day="6" year="1959">6 July 1959</st1:date> did not modify the order of <st1:date month="11" day="13" year="1958">13 November 1958</st1:date>; hence, the first
assignment of error makes an assumption that is neither true nor correct.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner NASSCO admits that the absolute and unconditional pardon
extended by the President to <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Capellan</span> blotted out of existence his guilt, but argues,
quoting <u>In Re <span class="SpellE">Lontok</span></u>, 43 Phil. 203 and 37 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. 554, that the pardon did not restore to him the office
that was forfeited as a consequence of his conviction; that the pardon did not
expressly provide for his restoration to his former job in the company.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is this flaw in the foregoing arguments of the petitioner:
it is assumed that by <span class="SpellE">Capellan's</span> conviction, his
office was forfeited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Capellan</span> was
convicted of the crime of slight physical injuries, with the penalty of 20 days
imprisonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty, which is <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>menor</u></span>,
carries the accessory penalty of "suspension of the right to hold office
and the right of suffrage during the term of the sentence." (Rev. Penal
Code, Art. 44).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Capellan</span>,
by reason of his 20-day sentence was therefore, merely <u>suspended</u> for the
said period of time from the right to hold office Upon serving the sentence,
his suspension was lifted, even with out the grant of executive clemency.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The limitation upon the effects of a pardon, as
mentioned in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Lontok</u></span> case, <u>supra</u>
(decided before the adoption of the Constitution) and the American cases cited
by the petitioner (Illinois C.R. v. Bosworth, 133 </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE">U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE">

State of Washington v. Linda <span class="SpellE">Burfield</span> <span class="SpellE">Pazzard</span>, 46 A.L.R. 538-544) that the power does not restore
offices forfeited does riot apply, since the present case does not involve a
forfeited office, but a suspended right to hold office.</p>

<p class="BODY">We may, however, consider the presidential pardon as a
reiteration of the termination of the suspension of the union president's right
to hold office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, it has erased
all doubts as to <span class="SpellE">Capellan's</span> reinstatement, for had
expressly provided for the restoration of his political rights, and this
includes his right to hold office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Cf. Flora vs. <span class="SpellE">Oximana</span>, L-19745, 31 Jan.
1964).</span></p>
