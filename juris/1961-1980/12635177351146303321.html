				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The focal point of the <i>certiorari</i> petition before the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span> is whether or
not, upon the facts hereinafter set forth, petitioner should be allowed to
litigate as pauper before the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Gubat</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>, for the recovery of P85.00 with legal
interest, and attorneys' fees, in a civil case in which petitioner is plaintiff
and respondent Felipe F. Dugan is defendant.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would appear that to prosecute the civil case aforesaid in the
inferior court as pauper, petitioner filed an affidavit stating that he had
been owner of several parcels of land, but that for several years prior to the
filing of the complaint in the inferior court said parcels of land had been
divided and partitioned amongst his children who had since been in possession
thereof and paying the taxes thereon; and that he no longer owned nor possessed
"a single parcel of land", and had "no income or means of livelihood."
The municipal judge denied the petition for authority to litigate as
pauper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This denial was based upon a
certification of the municipal treasurer that a man by the name of Juan <span class="SpellE">Enaje</span> was owner of lands under Tax Declarations 1100 and
1106.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner moved to reconsider,
emphasizing that he was not the same Juan <span class="SpellE">Enaje</span>
referred to in said tax declarations and that said Juan <span class="SpellE">Enaje</span>
could have been the deceased Juan <span class="SpellE">Enaje</span> I or Juan <span class="SpellE">Enaje</span> II; and that in truth and in fact, he was without any
means of livelihood as stated in the affidavit submitted with the petition for
leave to litigate as pauper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion
for reconsideration was also rejected by the inferior court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner then went to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span> on <i>certiorari</i>, the present case.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
He was there allowed to litigate as pauper.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, the latter court, in its order of <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1963</st1:date>, ruled that the municipal judge had
not gravely abused his discretion in disallowing petitioner to sue as
pauper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's motion to
reconsider was thwarted in the lower court's order of <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present proceeding before us is an appeal from the orders of
June 4 and <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We granted petitioner permission to continue
prosecuting as pauper and to file a type­written brief.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The case is now before us for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">"Free access to the courts shall not be denied to any person
by reason of poverty." Thus runs paragraph 21, Section 1, Article III
(Bill of Rights) of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Implementing this constitutional precept is Section 22, Rule 3 of the
Rules of Court, which in part provides that "[a]<span class="SpellE">ny</span>
court may authorize a litigant to prosecute his action or defense as a pauper
upon a proper showing that he has no means to that effect by affidavits,
certificate of the corresponding provincial, city or municipal treasurer, or
otherwise."</p>

<p class="BODY">There should not be any misapprehension as to the con­cept of the
term "pauper litigant".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
the Constitution and the rule just cited, a "pauper litigant" is not
what the nomen­clature literally means - that the petitioner must be <span class="GramE">so</span> destitute as to have no means at all of even supporting
himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Acar</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span></u> (March 18, 1967), 19 SCRA 625, which is
an expositor of the constitutional precept, our language is this - "As
applied to statutes or provisions on the right to sue <u>in</u> <u>forma</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>pauperis</u></span>, the term has a broader meaning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has thus been recognized that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'An applicant for leave to sue <u>in</u> <u>forma</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>pauperis</u></span> need not be, a pauper; the fact that
he is able-bodied and may earn the necessary money is no answer to his
statement that he has not sufficient means to prosecute the action or to secure
the costs' (14 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. 31).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It suffices that plaintiff is <u>indigent</u>
(Ibid.), <span class="SpellE">tho</span> not a public charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the difference between 'paupers' and
'indigent' persons is that the latter are 'persons who have no property or
source of income sufficient for their support aside from their own labor,
though self-supporting when able to work and in employment' (Black's Law
Dictionary, p. 913, 'Indigent', citing People vs. Schoharie County, 121 NY 345,
24 NE 830).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore in this
sense of being indigent that 'pauper' is taken when referring to suits <u>in</u>
<u>forma</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>pauperis</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Black's Law Dic­tionary in fact defines
pauper, thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'A person so poor that he
must be supported at public expense; <u>also</u> <u>a</u> <u>suitor</u> <u>who</u>,
<u>on</u> <u>account</u> <u>of</u> <u>poverty</u>, <u>is</u> <u>allowed</u> <u>to</u>
<u>sue</u> <u>or</u> <u>defend</u> <u>without</u> <u>being</u> <u>chargeable</u>
<u>with</u> <u>costs</u>' (p. 1284, italics supplied)."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Not that the foregoing view stands alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This concept of pauper litigant has been
incorporated in recent (1969) legislations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In Republic Act 6033, "An Act Requiring Courts to Give Preference
to Criminal Cases Where the Party or Parties Involved are Indigents", and
Republic Act 6034, "An Act Providing Transportation and Other Allowances
for Indigent Litigants", both approved on August 16, 1969, Congress has
defined the term "indigent" to refer to a person "who has no
visible means of income or whose income is insufficient for the subsistence of
his family." Of particular interest is a third statute, Republic Act 6035,
also approved on <st1:date year="1969" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1969</st1:date>,
entitled "An Act Requiring Stenographers to Give Free Transcript of Notes
to Indigent and Low Income Litigants and Providing a Penalty for the Violation
Thereof." This refers to the transcript of steno­graphic notes of "a
hearing before an investigating fiscal or trial judge or hearing commissioner
of any quasi-judicial body or administrative tribunal." For, indeed, the
term "indigent litigant" for the purpose of this statute (R.A. 6035)
was given a more expansive meaning to include "anyone who has no visible
means of support or whose income does not exceed P300 per month or whose income
even in excess of P300 per month is insufficient for the subsistence of his
family."</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, the present case came up before the decision in <span class="SpellE"><u>Acar</u></span> <u>vs.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Rosal</u></span>
and the approval of the statutes just mentioned. Nonetheless, we believe that
in the resolution of the issue involved we should not lose sight of the liberal
views expressed in said deci­sion and laws.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For, these views are but expressions of the constitutional policy that
proscribes denial of free access to the courts by reason of poverty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Which policy should be liberally applied, the
better to approximate the constitutional intent.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is in the record the affidavit of petitioner stating that
he has neither property nor income.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
yet, the municipal judge misconceived the impact of this affidavit by relying
merely on a certificate of the municipal treasurer stating that a man by the
name of Juan <span class="SpellE">Enaje</span> appears to own property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such certificate was mistakenly given
importance by the municipal judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
Honor should have taken stock of petitioner's vehement assertion that he is not
the Juan <span class="SpellE">Enaje</span> mentioned in those tax declarations;
and that, in truth and in fact, he (petitioner) had no source of income at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even on the assumption that petitioner owns <span class="GramE">property,</span>
he may still be an indigent,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
considering his sworn statement that he had no income.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the standard set forth in <span class="SpellE"><u>Acar</u></span> vs. <span class="SpellE"><u>Rosal</u></span> as
well as the recent legislations heretofore adverted to, it is the income of a
litigant that is the determinative factor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For, really, property may have no income.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may even be a financial burden.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the reasons given, we hold that the judges below committed a
grave abuse of discretion in refusing to allow petitioner to prosecute his
action in the inferior court as pauper litigant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the orders of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span> dated June 4 and <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1963</st1:date> are hereby set aside; and petitioner is
allowed to litigate as pauper in the civil case before the Justice of the Peace
