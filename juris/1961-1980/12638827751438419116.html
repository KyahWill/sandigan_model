				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The setting aside by respondent Court of Appeals of its previous
resolution of June 18, 1970 dismissing the appeal of respondents for failure of
their record on appeal to disclose on the face thereof that it was perfected on
time prompted petitioner to file this <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition
proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's motion to
dismiss appeal, at first favorably acted on by respondent Court, pointed out
that from what was stated in the record on appeal, namely the decision being
rendered on January 12, 1970 and the notice of appeal being filed on February
25, 1970 with the appeal bond and record on appeal coming three days later, it
could not be said that the record on appeal was perfected on time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner, as plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
cited Atlas Consolidated Mining Co.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>v.
Progressive Labor Association<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
to show that such procedural requirement was both mandatory and
jurisdictional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Court, as
noted, was in agreement as shown by its resolution of <st1:date year="1970" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1970</st1:date> dismissing the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents duly filed their motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was granted in the
assailed resolution of <st1:date year="1970" day="12" month="8">August 12, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Court first took note of the
certification by the clerk of the lower court that while the decision was dated
<st1:date year="1970" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1970</st1:date>, a copy was
not served on counsel until <st1:date year="1970" day="2" month="2">February 2,
 1970</st1:date> and that the notice of appeal, the cash bond, and the record
on appeal were all filed on <st1:date year="1970" day="30" month="3">March 30,
 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then came this portion
of the resolution sought to be nullified:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"From the foregoing proofs as submitted by the appellants, it can
readily be seen that their appeal was perfected within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the Order of the lower
court dated April 21, 1970, which states that 'said record on appeal as well as
the corresponding appeal bond and notice of appeal have been seasonably filed'
by the appellants, which Order now forms part of the original record on file
before this Court, deserves commensurate weight which can not just be ignored,
unless of course the contrary appears, a situation which is not true in the
present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It therefore becomes
imperative that a liberal interpretation of our procedural rules concerning the
perfection of appeal be resorted to and not technicalities of procedure or imperfection
of form in derogation of the intent and purpose of said procedural rules so
that the real matter in dispute may be submitted to the judgment of the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is indeed too harsh if not
malevolent to dismiss an appeal, which appears to have been perfected within
the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, just because appellant's
counsel in the preparation of the record on appeal failed to observe the
technical procedure required, an omission which we consider as a harmless error
which does not in anyway prejudice the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> never registered any
opposition to the approval of appellants' record on appeal in the lower
court."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, it may be observed that the approach taken by
the respondent Court, the opinion being rendered by the then Associate Justice <span class="SpellE">Hermogenes</span> <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, Jr., now a
member of this Court, has gained the approval of this Tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice <span class="SpellE">Mu√±oz</span>
Palma, in Krueger v. Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
referred to <span class="SpellE">Berkenkotter</span> v. Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> a
1973 decision, as the first decision to reflect the current trend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The liberal doctrine has been followed by
this Court whenever the material data rule is invoked to dismiss an appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents were required to answer, and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>thereafter the parties filed their respective
memoranda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, on <st1:date year="1977" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1977</st1:date>, petitioner filed a motion to withdraw
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It alleged:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"1.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That the petition in this case seeks to annul the questioned order of
respondent Court, reinstating the appeal of private respondents in CA-46220-R;
2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on September 17, 1976, respondent
Court rendered its decision in CA-46220-R, in favor of petitioner, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'[Wherefore], with the modification that
defendant-appellant PHHC is not liable for attorney's fees and costs, the
decision appealed from is [affirmed].<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With costs against private appellants,' thereby rendering the petition
in this case moot and academic; * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Under the circumstances, it was understandable why no useful purpose would be
served in deciding this controversy, petitioner having won on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was his prayer in the above motion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this petition for <i>certiorari</i> and
prohibition is dismissed for having become moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
