<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On August 10, 1960 <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> N. <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span> and Ernesto 
Garcia were designated by President Garcia, pursuant to Section 10 of Republic 
Act 180 as Acting Mayor and Acting: Vice-Mayor, respectively, while <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> Valero, Jose <span class="SpellE">Cajes</span>, 
<span class="SpellE">Melecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tilanduca</span>, Marcelo 
<span class="SpellE">Salintao</span> and Roberto <span class="SpellE">Laoyan</span> 
were also appointed as Acting Municipal Councilors of the municipality of 
Valencia, <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>, then newly created under Executive 
Order No. 360 dated October 11, 1959, and duly qualified thereafter. On May 19, 
1961 they were extended new acting designations to the same positions and 
qualified <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> on August 15 of the same year, 
performing the functions of their respective offices uninterruptedly and 
receiving from the Municipal Treasurer of Valencia their salaries and per diems 
from November 6, 1960 to June 23, 1962.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On September 28, 1961, Vicente 
<span class="SpellE">Cabiling</span> and <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> 
Gonzales were similarly designated as Acting Mayor and Acting Vice-Mayor, 
respectively, and Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Cayanong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> <span class="SpellE">Ayuban</span> and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Caspe</span> as Acting Municipal Councilors, of the municipality of 
<span class="SpellE">Dangcagan</span> likewise newly created under Executive Order 
No. 444 issued by former President Garcia on August 29, 1961. On October 26 of 
the same year they took the corresponding oath of office. Jose <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarajena</span> and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Leuterto</span> were 
likewise appointed as Acting Municipal Councilors of said municipality on 
December 8, 1961, the latter two qualifying for the office on December 19 of the 
same year. All of them, with the exception of Jose <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span>, discharged their respective duties continuously, 
and were paid their salaries and per diems by the Municipal Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Dangcagan</span> up to June 23, 1962.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 18, 1961 <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> U. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, officer in of 
processing all presidential appointments, revived instructions from the 
Executive Secretary to have all previous "Acting designations" converted into 
“Ad-interim appointments" and have them antedated. On December 25, 1961, 
President Garcia signed said ad-interim appointments, including those of the 
aforementioned officers, which were antedated as of June 1, 1961, in the case of 
the appointments of the municipal officials of Valencia, and December 8, 1961 in 
that of the municipal officials of <span class="SpellE">Dangcagan</span>. The 
following day, the appointments were forwarded to the Commission on Appointments 
together with several hundred others, and in May, 1962, the Commission confirmed 
the ones involved in the case now before Us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On December 31, 1961, President 
<span class="SpellE">Macapagal</span> issued Administrative Order No. 2, 
withdrawing, recalling, and declaring without effect all ad-interim appointments 
extended or released by President Garcia after December 13, 
1961.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On June 6, 1962, President <span class="SpellE">Macapagal</span> extended acting appointments to <span class="SpellE">Lucilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Alkuino</span>, as Mayor, Solomon 
<span class="SpellE">Gaoay</span> as Vice-Mayor, Hugo Limbo, Segundo <span class="SpellE">Dumaguita</span>, Emilio <span class="SpellE">Ermio</span>, Alfredo 
<span class="SpellE">Acasio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Escolastico</span> Hugo 
<span class="SpellE">Ogario</span>, as Councilors, of the municipality of 
Valencia. On the same day, <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pabulaan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Emigdio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ofima</span> were similarly appointed as Acting Mayor and Acting 
Vice-Mayor, respectively, of the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Dangcagan</span>, while <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Baticolon</span>, Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Paeste</span>, <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> Salazar, <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Pabulaan</span>, Victor <span class="SpellE">Ampuan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Tosem</span> were appointed as 
Acting Councilors thereof. All officials qualified for their respective office 
in June, and were paid their respective salaries and per 
diems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On December 4, 1962 Vicente <span class="SpellE">Cabiling</span> and his co-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> 
filed a petition for quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> with the First 
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span> (Case No. 240) claiming the right 
to hold the positions of Mayor, Vice-Mayor and Councilors of the municipality of 
<span class="SpellE">Dangcagan</span> and assailing the validity of the 
appointments of <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pabulaan</span>, et al. to the same offices, with a prayer for the 
issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction to restrain the Municipal Treasurer 
of <span class="SpellE">Dangcagan</span> from paying the salaries diems of the 
latter during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the 
case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">A similar petition was filed by 
<span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> N. <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span> and his 
co-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> with the same court (Case No. 239) 
assailing the validity of the appointments of <span class="SpellE">Lucilo</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Alkuino</span>, et al., to the positions of Mayor, Vice-Mayor 
and Councilors of the municipality of Valencia, with a prayer for the issuance 
of a writ of preliminary injunction against the municipal treasurer of 
Valencia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After a joint trial of the 
petitions, the court, on June 7, 1963, rendered judgment as 
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Wherefore, judgment is hereby 
rendered declaring the petitioners in all these cases to be the legal occupants 
of the positions to which they were appointed with the right to the salaries and 
emoluments thereof from the date of their removal until reinstatement, and the 
respondents are hereby ousted and altogether excluded <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, with costs against the said 
respondents."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">From the above decision 
respondents interposed the present appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Section 10 of Republic Act No. 
180, provides as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"When a new political division is 
created the inhabitants of which are entitled to participate in the elections, 
the elective officers thereof shall, unless otherwise provided, be chosen at the 
next, regular election. In the interim, such offices shall, in the discretion of 
the President, be filled by appointment by him or by a special election which he 
may order."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The trial court ruled that the 
"acting appointments" extended to <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> were 
permanent because all appointments made by the Chief Executive under the legal 
provision quoted above are necessarily permanent, to last until the elective 
officers of the newly created political subdivision are chosen at the next 
regular election. This means that, in the opinion of the trial court, the 
"acting" appointments extended in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> 
were necessarily up to or until the general elections of 1963. We can not agree 
with this view, there being nothing in the legal provision aforementioned to 
justify it, directly or indirectly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Generally, the power to appoint 
vested in the Chief Executive includes the power to make temporary appointments, 
unless he is otherwise specifically prohibited by law, or a temporary or acting 
appointment is repugnant to the nature of the office to be filled. This is based 
upon the theory that the whole includes and is greater than the part (<span class="SpellE">Tañada</span> and <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span>, Philippine 
Political Law, 1961 Edition, pp. 316-317).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the case of officials of newly 
created municipalities, there is <span class="GramE">no law nor</span> public 
policy requiring that they must be filled by permanent appointees. The 
applicable legal provision already quoted above—merely gives the Chief Executive 
the option to fill the offices by appointment. Of course, if the appointment 
made is permanent, it should last up to or until the elective officials of the 
newly created municipality have been chosen at the next regular 
election.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">To the above <span class="GramE">We</span> must add the circumstance that <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> are <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from 
claiming that their acting appointments were, in reality, permanent 
appointments. As already stated, President Garcia extended in their favor acting 
appointments twice. On the other hand, that they were so intended conclusively 
shown by the fact that on December 18, 1961, the Office of the President gave 
out the order to have all previous acting appointments converted into 
"ad-interim" appointments. <span class="SpellE">Appellees</span> having accepted 
the appointments thus extended to thorn without any protest or reservation, and 
having acted <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> for a considerable time it is 
clear that they can not now be hear to say that such appointments were, in 
reality, permanent and that, by reason of their being so, they could not be 
removed, except for cause, before the end of the term for which they were 
supposedly appointed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is not disputed that the 
ad-interim appointments extended in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> 
were signed by President Garcia only on December 25, 1961, and that they were 
among the several hundred similar appointments forwarded by the Office of the 
President to the Commission on Appointments on December 26, 1961. This being so, 
<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' appointments should be regarded as an 
integral part of the so called "mid-night appointments" voided by our decision 
in the <span class="SpellE">Aytona</span> case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">There is still another factor 
that makes <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' stand untenable. The 
preponderance of evidence,—to say the least—shows that their ad-interim 
appointments had never been released. As a consequence, the action taken thereon 
by the Commission on Appointments must be deemed of no legal effect (Rosales 
<i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Yenko</span> G. R. No. L-20618, May 1965). It is 
true that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Ramon <span class="SpellE">Caspe</span> (G. R. No. L-21764) produced in evidence a telegram 
which purported to advise him of the signing of his ad-interim appointment, but 
said telegram was received only in January 1962 after the issuance of the 
Executive Order withdrawing and <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> all 
appointments made by the previous Chief Executive after December 13, 1961. <span class="GramE">In G. R. No.</span> L-21765, a similar attempt was made by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cajes</span> who presented as evidence the telegrams now marked as 
Exhibits A and B. The fact is, however, that the telegram Exhibit A was sent 
only on January 1, 1962, while the telegram Exhibit B was sent on December 31, 
1961, and both were received on January 2, 1962, also after the recall of their 
appointments. As a matter of fact, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span> testified that up to the time when he took the 
witness stand, he had not received a copy of his ad-interim appointment, and he 
also admitted that he had never taken his oath of office as ad-interim 
Mayor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: Verdana;">In 
view of all the foregoing</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decisions appealed from are 
reversed, with the result that the <span class="GramE">petition for quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> under consideration are</span> dismissed, with 
costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
