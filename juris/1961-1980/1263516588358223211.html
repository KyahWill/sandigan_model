				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal interposed by <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> and Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>
from the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City) in its criminal case 847-O, finding them
guilty of the crime of murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion thereof reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court finds the accused <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> and Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and hereby sentences each
of said accused <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>
and Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> and to joint­ly and severally
indemnify the heirs of Esteban <span class="SpellE">Me­sias</span> in the sum of
six thousand pesos (P6,000.00) and to pay 2/3 of the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In an amended complaint filed with the justice of the peace court
of <span class="SpellE">Kananga</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>,
seven persons, namely, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>,
Domingo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>, Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>,

<span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> <span class="SpellE">Moriles</span> and <span class="SpellE">Berto</span> <span class="SpellE">Nadera</span>, were charged with
the murder of Esteban <span class="SpellE">Mesias</span>. Domingo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> <span class="SpellE">Moriles</span> and Arturo <span class="SpellE">Arego</span> were
later excluded from the complaint because the prosecution entertained grave
doubt as to their participation in the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabilte</span>, Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Cabil­tes</span>, and
Diego <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> were thereafter indicted in an
information filed with the Court of first Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City), which recites that on or about May 31,
1960, the three accused, conspir­ing and confederating, and mutually helping
one another, and with treachery, feloniously assaulted, attacked, and wounded
Esteban <span class="SpellE">Mesias</span> with a bolo, knives and stones,
inflicting injuries on him, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"(1) incised wound on the chin 2-1/2 inches long, deepness reaches
the bone; (2) incised wound 3 inches below the left clavicle 1-1/2 inches long
and 1/4 inch deep; (3) stab wound right side <span class="SpellE">epi­gastric</span>
region 1 inch long 10 inches deepness diagonal; (4) stab wound 1 inch above
sternum left side 1 inch long 8 inches deepness diagonal; and (5) stab wound
back left side 1 inch long by 10 inches deepness diagonal," which injuries
caused his death.</p>

<p class="BODY">The version of the prosecution, as unfolded by witnesses Faustino
<span class="SpellE">Alapan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span> <span class="SpellE">Moriles</span>, <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarit</span> and Joaquin and the documentary evidence on record,
is substantially as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During a <u>barrio
fiesta</u> in <span class="SpellE">Natubgan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Kananga</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, while <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> was standing on the roadside (where a native drama
was to be staged) at around six o'clock in the evening of May 31, 1960, he was
informed by his uncle Gregorio that his father Do­mingo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>
had been assaulted by Esteban <span class="SpellE">Mesias</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> proposed to take revenge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this proposal to kill <span class="SpellE">Mesias</span>
was communicated to Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>, Diego <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> <span class="SpellE">Moriles</span>, Arturo <span class="SpellE">Allego</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gualberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Nedera</span>, all of whom gave their assent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> then went home, changed his clothes, and armed
himself with a hunting knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon his
return, Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>, Diego <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>,
Domingo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>, Arturo <span class="SpellE">Allego</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> <span class="SpellE">Moriles</span> and he,
as one group, left for the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span> of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Kananga</span></st1:place></st1:city>, accompanied by Faustino <span class="SpellE">Alapan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about
half a kilometer from the house of Domingo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>,
they overtook <span class="SpellE">Mesias</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>
walked abreast and side by side with <span class="SpellE">Mesias</span> for a
while, and then stabbed him in the back with his hunting knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>
then stabbed him in the breast with a small bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the victim slumped to the ground, the
three ac­cused carried him to a canal filled with water, after which <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> hacked him on
the chin and other parts of the body.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Diego <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> then hurried home, while
Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> ran away to the house of his aunt
where he was later arrested.</p>

<p class="BODY">The three accused, after their arrest, as well as Faustino <span class="SpellE">Alapan</span>, executed affidavits which were sworn to before <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Sarit</span>, justice of the
peace of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Kananga</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The version of the defense, on the other hand, <span class="SpellE">unravelled</span> by the declarations of Diego <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>,
<span class="SpellE">TeofiloCabiltes</span>, Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>,
Benjamin Pore, <span class="SpellE">Eufracio</span> <span class="SpellE">Zarcon</span>
and Buenaventura <span class="SpellE">Tali­bao</span>, consists partly in a
disavowal that the written statements se­cured from <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>,
Diego and Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> were voluntarily
made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Benjamin Pore declared that
he was informed by the three accused of their maltreatment at the hands of the
police autho­rities, and because of this, he advised them to submit to medical
treatment, which they did.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>, while
admitting that he was with <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> on the way to the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span>
of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Kananga</span></st1:place></st1:city>
on the day of the killing, disclaimed knowledge of the plot to kill <span class="SpellE">Mesias</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared
that on their way to the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span>, they met <span class="SpellE">Mesias</span>, who thereupon asked <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> if he was the son of Domingo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>, and when <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
answered that he was, <span class="SpellE">Mesias</span> forthwith boxed him on
the right forehead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surprised at what he
saw, he fled to the house of his aunt, Paying <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>
he was later apprehended and brought to the municipal jail together with <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>, Diego <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> and Domingo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claims that al of them were manhandled by
the police, for which reason they sought medi­cal treatment at the <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> Public Dispensary.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon its evaluation at the evidence on record, the trial court
rendered the judgment<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> puts squarely in issue
the credibility a Faustino <span class="SpellE">Alapan</span>, the only
eyewitness for the prosecution, averring that this witness has enmeshed himself
in irretrievable inconsis­tencies and grave contradictions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, it is averred that while in his
affidavit (<span class="SpellE">exhs</span>. 1, 1-A).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alapan</span> stated that
when the killing took place at around six o'clock in the evening of May 31,
1960, he was in the house of Domingo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>,
pounding rice, af­ter which he was told to go to the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span>
of <span class="SpellE">Kananga</span>, in his di­rect testimony he declared that
at the time the killing took place, he was in Diego <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>'
house in <u>barrio</u> <span class="SpellE">Tubgan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Kananga</span>,
pound­ing rice, and, on cross-examination, he stated that he started to live in
the house of Javier <span class="SpellE">Porras</span> at three o'clock in the
afternoon of the same date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appellant's submission, on the basis of the above-stated contradictions, is
that <span class="SpellE">Alapan</span> was not present at the scene of the
killing as it was impossible for him to be in-two places et the same time.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our own perceptive examination of <span class="SpellE">Alapan's</span>
oral testimony <span class="SpellE"><u>vis-a-vis</u></span> his affidavit reveals
no material contradiction of conse­quence. Although in his affidavit he did
state that he was in the house of Domingo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> at
about six o'clock in the evening of May 31, 1960, his oral testimony that he
was in the house of Diego <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> in the afternoon
of the same date makes no mention of the exact time of his presence in the
house of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are therefore
not prepared to accept the appellant's thesis that <span class="SpellE">Alapan's</span>
being in Diego's house earlier precluded him from being present at six o'clock
of the same afternoon in the house of Domingo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>,
es­pecially if we take into account that the <u>barrios</u> where the houses of
Domingo and Diego are located?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Natubgan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tubgan</span>,
respectively, are in the same <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Kananga</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no evidence whatsoever that would
suggest that if <span class="SpellE">Alapan</span> was initially in the <u>barrio</u>
of <span class="SpellE">Tubgan</span>, it was impossible for him to be in the
house of Domingo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> in <u>barrio</u> <span class="SpellE">Natubgan</span> in the afternoon of the same day.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant lays stress on the import of the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Alapan</span> on cross-examination that he started to live in the
house of Javier <span class="SpellE">Porras</span> at three o'clock in the
afternoon of May 31, 1960, that he did not leave the house of <span class="SpellE">Porras</span> except at 4:00 p. m. when he went out to fetch
water, and that he had never gone to <u>barrio</u> <span class="SpellE">Natubgan</span>
The pertinent testimony reads:</p>

<blockquote>“Q. On that date when you started living with Mr. <span class="SpellE">Porras</span>, what time of day did you go to the house of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Porras</span> to start living with him?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A. I went to the house of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Porras</span>
in the af­ternoon of that day.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q. Approximately what time in the afternoon?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A. I went to the house of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Porras</span>
on <st1:date year="1960" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1960</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o'clock</st1:time>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q. And you did not leave the house of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Por­ras</span>
from that time on, did you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A. I left the house of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Porras</span>,</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q. When, what time did you go out from the house of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Porras</span> on <st1:date year="1960" day="31" month="5">May 31,
 1960</st1:date>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A. At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00 o'clock</st1:time></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q. Where did you go at <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1960" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1960</st1:date>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A. I fetched water to he used for cooking.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q. And you never had gone to the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Natub­gan</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A. No, sir."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But as aptly stated by the Solicitor General, when the witness
sta­ted that he had never gone to <u>barrio</u> <span class="SpellE">Natubgan</span>,
the question that was asked him did not make reference to any particular date
or hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So that his negative answer
could refer to any day other than that of the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But whatever doubt may have been engendered
by the above interrogation and the answer thereto elicited regarding his
presence at the scene of the crime, was dissi­pated when he made the
clarification that the killing had already hap­pened when he went to live in
the house of <span class="SpellE">Porras</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is Further argued that there was no sense in the <span class="SpellE">Cabilteses</span>' bringing <span class="SpellE">Alapan</span> along
with them to kill <span class="SpellE">Mesias</span>, because as there were
already six in the group, <span class="SpellE">Alapan</span>, who was a mere
youngster of 15 years of age, could not be of any conceivable help to
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We deem it unnecessary to
speculate on the possible reasons or motives that impelled the accused to take <span class="SpellE">Alapan</span> with them in the execution of their mission to
liquidate <span class="SpellE">Mesias</span>, but it is pertinent to observe in
this regard that <span class="SpellE">Alapan</span> was a former neighbor of <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> and Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> in <u>barrio</u>
<span class="SpellE">Minuto</span>, <span class="SpellE">Kananga</span> and that
for sometime he lived in the house of <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further assailing <span class="SpellE">AIapan's</span> credibility,
the appellant not only accords undue emphasis to the statement made by <span class="SpellE">Alapan</span> in his affi­davit to the effect that Domingo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>, Arturo <span class="SpellE">AIlego</span> and <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> <span class="SpellE">Moriles</span> helped in
stabbing <span class="SpellE">Mesias</span>, but as well contrasts his decla­ration
in direct examination that Gonzalo, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> and Diego
<span class="SpellE">Cabil­tes</span> inflicted the wounds sustained by the
deceased, with his declara­tion on cross-examination that Domingo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> and Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>
were the only participants in the stabbing inci­dent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, as regards the
participation of <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>
and Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> in the stabbing, <span class="SpellE">Alapan's</span> testimony was consistent both in the direct and
cross-examinations, although this a appears to be at variance with the
narration in his affidavit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
discrepancy regarding who took part in the stabbing, is of course patent, but
such contradiction may justifiably be overlooked because it is not infrequent
that a witness may, without design, inaccurately narrate certain facts arising
from extraordinary occur­rences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
Moore on Facts, 1098, has said, an affidavit, "being taken <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> is almost always incomplete and often
inaccurate sometimes from partial suggestion, and sometimes from want of
suggestion and inquiries, without the aid of which witness may be unable to
recall the connected collateral circumstances necessary for the correction of
the first suggestion of his memory and for accurate recollection of all that
belongs to the subject."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Alapan</span> was a lowly laborer, an illiterate <u>barrio</u>
lad, 15 years of age, who signed his name by affixing his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span>,
did know how to write, did not know what a minute or an hour is, or how many
days there are in a month, or what a year is, and could not recall the
different barrios where he lived.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although it is neither the function nor the prerogative of a
court to conjure up a meaning that is not there or to give to the testimony of
a witness a meaning that cannot reasonably he inferred from the entirety of his
integrated testimony, we are of the opinion, nevertheless, that this Court is
required by the recognized canons of judicial review to determine whether under
the environmental circumstances surrounding the declarations of a witness, the
said witness can be accorded credence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case at bar, we are satisfied after a searching scrutiny of the
testimony and the affidavit of eyewitness <span class="SpellE">Alapan</span>,
that the contradictions and inconsistencies his declarations are trivial
mistakes which cannot be attributed a desire to pervert the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a truism that the most can­did witness
oftentimes commits mistakes and incurs in inconsisten­cies in his declarations,
but such honest lapses do not necessarily impair his intrinsic
credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Far from being evidence of
falsehood they could justifiably be regarded as a demonstration of good faith
and, in this case before us, a confirmation of the fact that <span class="SpellE">Alapan</span> was not a rehearsed witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, we note that <span class="SpellE">Alapan</span> appears to
be a person who bore absolutely no ill-feeling against any of the accused; the
re­cord does not disclose any untoward motive which could have in­duced him to
perjure himself in a prosecution for a heinous crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The theory of intentional falsehood which is
the central theme of the appellant in his brief must therefore be discounted.</p>

<p class="BODY">At all events, there is proof beyond reasonable doubt that the
appellant, acting in conspiracy, participated in the killing of the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Firstly</u>, his disclaimer of knowledge of the plot to kill <span class="SpellE">Mesias</span> is negated by the following circumstances:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I) the plan to kill <span class="SpellE">Mesias</span>
was discussed before they left for the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span>;
(2) <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>
personally explained to him the plan to go to the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span>;
(3) he joined the other accused and was with them on the way to <span class="SpellE">Kananga</span>; and (4) he was admittedly present when the
stabbing was committed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Secondly</u>, his declaration that when <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> stabbed the deceased he ran away, is of
doubtful veracity, For, if as tes­tified to by him, it was <span class="SpellE">Mesias</span>
who first hit <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>
on the right forehead, causing 'the latter to fall to the ground, then his na­tural
reaction as an uncle would be to rush to the aid of his prostrate nephew.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Abandoning his relative in the condition
pictured by him is contrary to human instinct:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>blood is still thicker than water.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, it is more reasonable to believe that Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> is net the type of a man so, devoid of courage and
so lacking lea human feeling as not to give succor or defend his nephew from
List alleged assailant whom he described as being twice taller and bigger than <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus it is that we accept as the true version
of the appellant's beha­vior during the incident that testified to by <span class="SpellE">Alapan</span> who affirmed that after <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> stabbed <span class="SpellE">Mesias</span>,
Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> also stabbed him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Thirdly</u>, corroboration can be gleaned from the autopsy
find­ings of sanitary inspector Joaquin <span class="SpellE">Demillo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The various stab wounds found in the body of
the deceased were obviously caused by more than one weapon and inflicted by
more than one person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the trial,
two different weapons were presented in evidence, which sup­ports the thesis
that at least two persons participated in the stabbing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alapan</span> identified
the hunting knife (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. E) as the weapon used by <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>, and the small
bolo (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. F) as that wielded by Gon­zalo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Fourthly</u>, the mute but eloquent physical evidence proves
be­yond peradventure that the mortal "stab wound 1 inch above sternum left
side 1 inch long 8 inches <span class="SpellE">deepeness</span> diagonal"
sustained by <span class="SpellE">Me­sias</span> was caused by the small bolo
which measures about eight inches in length arid about one inch in width.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Finally</u>, the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Alapan</span>
finds indirect corroboration in the extrajudicial confession of <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>, Gonzalo's
co-accused, which in part states "That when he [Esteban <span class="SpellE">Mesias</span>] was already hit my companions rushed at him namely;
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span>, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
and they helped one another in stabbing Esteban <span class="SpellE">Me­sias</span>
and they also stoned him."</p>

<p class="BODY">True it is that an extrajudicial confession is admissible only
against the person who made it; jurisprudence, however, makes it admissible as
corroborative evidence of other facts that tend to es­tablish the guilt of his
co-defendant(s) (People v. <span class="SpellE">Simbajon</span>, et al.,
L-18073-75, Sept. 30, 1965).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conspiracy
having been established in this case, each of the statements is admissible
against all the conspirators (People v. Belen, et al., L-13895, Sept. 30, 1963).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant's conduct before, during and
after the commission of the crime, conclusively shows that he acted in concert
with his co-accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Cabiltes</span> claims with
vehemence that their statements were wrenched from them thru force and
violence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This claim does not command
respect, as no motive on the part of the investigating officer has been proven,
and none was in fact given, that could have impelled him to concoct the facts
narrated in the extra judicial confessions in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, judging from the nature of the
facts stated therein, it is clear that it is only the affiants who could have
supplied them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarit</span>, jus­tice of peace
of <span class="SpellE">Kananga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, before
whom the affidavits were sworn to, testified that the contents thereof which
are in the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>- <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span>
dialect were read to the affiants, and that they confirmed the contents thereof
as true and correct, after which they volunta­rily affixed their
signatures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And although they aver that
several persons were looking at them when they signed their affidavits at the
point of a gun, oddly enough not one of these supposed onlookers testified in
their behalf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regarding Pore's testimony
that he was informed by the three accused that they were maltreated by the
police, because of which he advised them to secure medical certificates, the
accused failed to produce any medical certificate at the trial attesting to the
alleged injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court,
therefore, correctly found that the affidavits in question were freely and
volun­tarily executed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the face of the evidence against the appellant, his avowal of
innocence must be rejected.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, in so far
