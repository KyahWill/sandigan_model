				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Two election protests
against the duly proclaimed Mayor and Councilors of <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span>
City, after the Nov. 14, 1967 elections, based on the allegations of flagrant
violations of certain mandatory provisions of the Election Code, to be more
specifically set forth hereafter, were dismissed in </span>a <span style="">single order by the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte, the Honorable <span class="SpellE">Teodulo</span>
C. <span class="SpellE">Tandayag</span> presiding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cases are now before us on appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In one of them,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the election of Honorable <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Cabili</span> to the Office of
City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> <span class="GramE">City,</span> </span>was
<span style="">contested by protestant, now appellant,
Mariano <span class="SpellE">Badelles</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the other,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the protestants are the now appellants, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> and Cecilia
T. <span class="SpellE">Barazon</span>, who along with the five <span class="SpellE">protestees</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> were among those who were registered
candidates voted for in such election for councilors in the City of <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span>, with the <span class="SpellE">protestees</span> being
credited with the five highest number of votes, with protestants <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> and <span class="SpellE">Barazon</span> obtaining
sixth and seventh places respectively.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In such order of dismissal, it was admitted that while
irregularities <span style="">as </span>well as
misconduct on the part of election officers were alleged in the election
protests filed, there was however an absence of an allegation that they would
change the result of the election in favor of the protestants and against the <span class="SpellE">protestees</span>, that such irregularities would destroy the
secrecy <span style="">and </span>integrity of the
ballots cast, or that the <span class="SpellE">protestees</span> knew of or parti­cipated
in the commission thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the lower
court then, the lack of a cause of action was rather evident.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence the order of dismissal of March 23, 1968, which was sought
to be fortified by the invocation of the doctrines that voters should not be
deprived of their right to vote occasioned by the failure of the election
officials to comply with the formal prerequisites to the exercise of the right
of suffrage and that the rules and regulations for the conduct of elections
while mandatory before the voting should be considered directory there­after.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The validity of such order of dismissal is
now to be inquired into by us in this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the petition of protestant <span class="SpellE">Badelles</span>,
dated December 8, 1967, and marked <span style="">as </span>received
the next day by the Clerk of Court of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte, 15th Judicial District, it was stated that
both he and <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span>
P. <span class="SpellE">Cabili</span> were the duly registered candidates for the
Office of City Mayor or <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City, both having
filed their respective certificates of candidacy in accordance with law and as
such candidates voted for in the November 14, 1967 election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then alleged that the Board of
Canvassers, on <st1:date year="1967" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1967</st1:date>,
proclaimed as elected <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> for having obtained
11,310 votes while protes­tant was credited with 8,966 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Protestant would impugn the election of <span class="SpellE">Cabili</span> on the ground that there were "flagrant
violations of mandatory provisions of law relating to or governing elections *
* *" in that more than 200 voters were registered per precinct contrary to
the provision limiting such number of 200 only and that no publication of the
list of voters for each precinct was made up to the election day itself,
enabling persons who under the law could not vote being allowed to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">As a </span>result
of such alleged "flagrant violations of the laws relation to or governing
elections" around 8,300 individuals were allowed to vote illegally.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was likewise asserted that not less than 8,000 qualified
voters were unable to exercise their right of suffrage in view of their
failure, without any fault on their part, to have the proper identi­fication
cards or the non-listing of their names in the list of voters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was stated further that even in the case
of those individuals provided with identification cards with their names
included in the list of voters, they could not avail themselves of their right
of suffrage as their applications for registration could not be found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mention was also made of the fact that the
final lists of voters and the applications for registration were delivered to
their respective precincts late on <span class="GramE">election day</span> itself
thus preventing them from voting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, confusion, so it was alleged, was caused by the excessive
number of voters being listed and many having been assigned to precincts other
than the correct ones.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">What was thus objected to
<span class="GramE">is</span> the fact that illegal votes were cast by those not
qualified to do so, numbering 8,300 or more and that an approxi­mately equal
number, who were duly registered with the Commission on Elections, </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Iligan</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">, were unable to vote due to the above
circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proclamation then
could not have reflected the true will of the electorate as to who was the
mayor elected, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">the majority of <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cabili</span> over the protestant consisted of only 2,344
votes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The prayer was among others for the proclamation of <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> as well as other candidates for elective
positions in the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Iligan</span></st1:place></st1:city>
being set aside and declared null and void, protestant pleading further <span style="">that he be granted other such relief as may
be warranted in law and equity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The protest of the candidates for councilor <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Barazon</span>, in the other case against <span class="SpellE">protestees</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
was in substance similarly worded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
prayer was for the setting aside and declaring null and void the proclamation
of <span class="SpellE">protestees</span>, with protestants seeking such other,
relief which should be theirs according to law <span style="">and </span>to equity.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the first case, <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabili</span> moved to dismiss
the petition on the following grounds:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"1. That the protest was filed beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period allowed by the Revised Election Code; 2. That [the lower court] has no
jurisdiction over the subject matter of the present case, the Commission on
Elections being the proper body to hear the same; 3. That the complaint states
no cause of action."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <span class="GramE">This</span> very same
grounds were relied upon in a motion to dismiss by <span class="SpellE">protestees</span>
<span class="SpellE">Actub</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cabigon</span>, filed in
the other suit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">As above noted, in a single order of </span><st1:date year="1968" day="23" month="3"><span class="GramE">March 23, 1968</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, the two above election protests were dismissed, the lower court
being of the opinion that neither petition alleged a cause of action "to
justify [it]<span style=""> </span>to try the
same."</span> The first ground of the motion to dismiss to the effect that
the protests in both cases were filed beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period was rejected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim as to
lack of jurisdiction was likewise held to be without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The single order of dismissal in both cases <span style="">as </span>indicated was based on the lack of
a cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The reasoning followed by the lower court in reaching the above
conclusion that there was no cause of action proceeded along these lines:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Mere ir­regularities or misconduct on
the part of election officers which do not tend to affect the result of the elections
are not of themselves either ground for contest or for proper matters of
inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * There is no allegation in
the protest that the alleged irregularities committed by the election officers
would tend to change the result of the election in favor of the <span class="GramE">protestants</span> and against the <span class="SpellE">protestees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no allegation in the petition that
the 8,000 voters who failed to vote were all voters of <span class="GramE">protes­tants</span>
and the 8,300 illegal voters who voted were for the <span class="SpellE">protestees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, therefore, no legal and <span style="">practical justification for the court to
inquire into the irregularities committed by the election officials, as alleged
in the petition, for it would not give any benefit in favor of the protestants
to the end that they will be declared the duly elected mayor and councilors,
respectively, of this City."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It was further stated in such order of <span style="">dismissal:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>"There is
no allegation in the petition that the irregularities committed by the election
officials have destroyed the secrecy and integrity of the ballots cast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no allegation in the petition that
the <span class="GramE">non­compliance of the election officials of the
provisions of the election laws regarding the registration of voters were</span>
intentional on their part for the purpose of committing frauds for the benefit
of the <span class="SpellE">protestees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no allegation in the petition that because of the alleged
irregularities committed by the election officials in not following the
provisions of the election laws regarding the registration of voters and the
distri­bution of the precincts, that all the votes cast during said elections
are illegal, nor is there an allegation in the protests that the irregularities
committed by the election officials would affect the election in favor of the <span class="SpellE">protestees</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A greater regard for the cause of accuracy ought to have
admonished the lower court from asserting in an uncompromising tone the absence
of an allegation that the <span class="GramE">protestants</span> in both cases
failed to allege that if the facts pleaded by them were proved the result would
not have been different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true the
complaints could have been more explicitly worded, but as they stood, the
absence of such <span style="">a claim </span>could
not be so confidently asserted.</p>

<p class="BODY">To repeat, both protests were dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not discount a certain degree of plausibility
attaching to the line of reasoning thus pursued by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not unaware of the undeniable fact
that both petitions were not distinguished by skill in their drafting or
precision in their terminology.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless the seriousness and gravity of the imputed failure to have
the elections conducted freely and honestly, with such irregularities alleged,
give rise to doubts, rational and honest, as to who were the duly elected
officials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such allegations, it is to be
stressed, would have to be accepted at their face value for the <span style="">purpose of determining whether there is a
cause of action, a motion to dismiss amounting to </span>a <span style="">hypothetical admission of facts thus
pleaded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot in law and in
conscience then sustain the order of dismissal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Without the lower court having so intended, the dismissal would
amount to judicial abnegation of a <span style="">sworn
duty to inquire into and pass upon in an appropri­ate proceeding allegations of
misconduct and misdeeds of such character.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, we reverse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Abes</span> v. Commission on Elections<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
points the way, but the lower court was apparently impervious to its
teaching.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may not be controlling, but
it furnishes more than a hint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would
seem, though, that for the court below, its message did not ring out loud and
clear.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The opinion in the <span class="SpellE">Abes</span> case, penned by Justice Sanchez, starts thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Petitioner's cry for relief, so their
petition avers, is planted upon the constitutional mandate of free, orderly,
and honest elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Speci­fically,
they list a number of repressible acts." Among those mentioned were that
blank official registration forms were taken from the office of the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> Register
several weeks before election day, November 14, 1967; that active campaigning
within the polling places by <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> leaders or
sympathizers of <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> candidates were allowed;
that voters were permitted to vote on mere mimeographed notices of certain <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> candidates; that voters were compelled to fill
their official ballots on open tables, desks and in many precincts outside the
polling places; that thousands of voters sympathetic to the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
candidates were allowed to vote beyond the hours for voting allowed by </span>law;
<span style="">that identification cards were
delivered by partisan leaders of respondents <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
candidates, and those who did not signify their preference for <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> candidates were not given such cards; that the
precinct books of voters were not sealed within the deadline fixed by law; and
that the resulting effect of irregularities was to prevent fully fifty-one per
cent of the registered voters from voting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">One of the issues raised on the above facts is whether or not the
Commission on Elections could annul the aforesaid election in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city> on the above
allegations of fraud, terrorism and other illegal practices committed before
and during the election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition
did not prosper; it was dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
remedy, we held, lay not with the Commission on Elections but with the courts
of justice in an election protest.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the language of Justice Sanchez:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The bounda­ries of the forbidden area
into which <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> may not tread are also marked by
jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
<span style="">is not the proper forum to seek
annulment of an election based on terrorism, frauds and other illegal
practices, is a principle emphasized in decisions of this Court." For </span>as
<span style="">announced in <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party v. Commission on Elections,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> assuming that there <span class="GramE">be</span>
a failure to conduct an election in a free, orderly and honest manner,
"the duty to cure or remedy the resulting evil" did not rest with the
Commission on Elections but in "some other agencies of the
Government." More specifically, with reference to provincial and municipal
officials, election contests "are entrusted to the courts." Then <span class="GramE">came</span> this express affirmation:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The power to decide election contests
necessarily includes the power to determine the validity or nullity of the
votes questioned by either of the contestants."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As so emphatically
observed in the <span class="SpellE">Abes</span> opinion, "there has been
neither deviation nor retreat from the foregoing pronouncement." After
which came the follow­ing:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The
ratiocination advanced that there was failure of election due to rampancy of
terrorism, frauds, and other irregularities, before and during elections, such
that allegedly about 51% of the registered voters were not able to vote, will
not carry the day for petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For,
in the first place, this is grounded upon bare assertions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents contest the correctness there­of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in the answer of respondents <span class="SpellE">Amoranto</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mathay</span> and others, they
aver that out of 162,457 registered voters in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Quezon</span></span><span style=""> City</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, 100,382 voters actually cast their votes -
about 62% of the registered voters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
above all, as pointed out in City Board of Canvassers vs. <span class="SpellE">Moscoso</span>,
[the] nullity of an election for municipal officials should be determined in </span>a
<span style="">petition contesting the election of
municipal officers-elect to be filed before the Court of First Instance."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Why an election protest is more fitly <span style="">and </span>appropriately the procedure for determining whether
irregularities or serious violations of the electoral law vitiated the <span style="">conduct of elections </span>was clearly and
succinctly explained in the <span class="SpellE">Moscoso</span> decision above
cited, the opinion coming from Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The question of whether or
not there had been terrorism, vote-buying <span style="">and
</span>other irregularities in the 1959 <span style="">elections
in </span><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> City should be ventilated in a
regular election protest, pursuant to section 174 of the Election Code, and not
in a petition to enjoin the city board of canvassers from canvassing the
election returns <span style="">and </span>proclaiming
the winning candidates for municipal offices."</p>

<p class="BODY">It would follow then that if the grievance relied upon is the
widespread irregularities and the flagrant violations of the election law, the
proper remedy is the one availed of here, the protest.</p>

<p class="BODY">That such should be the case should occasion no surprise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Time and time again,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
we have stressed the importance of preserving inviolate the right of
suffrage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If <span style="">that right be disregarded or </span>frittered away, then popular
sovereignty becomes a myth.</p>

<p class="BODY">As Justice Laurel correctly pointed out:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"As <span style="">long </span><span style="">as </span>popular
government is an end to be achieved and safeguarded, suffrage, whatever may be
the modality and form devised, must <span style="">continue
to be the </span>means by which the great reservoir of power must be emptied
into the <span class="SpellE">receptacular</span> <span style="">agencies wrought </span>by the people through their Constitution in the
interest of good government and the common weal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Republicanism, in so far as it implies the
adoption of a representa­tive type of government, necessarily points to the
enfranchised citizen as a particle of popular sove­reignty and as the ultimate
source of the established authority."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A republic then to be true to its name requires that the
government rests on the consent of the people, consent freely given,
intelligently arrived at, honestly recorded, and thereafter counted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only thus can they be really looked upon as
the ultimate sources of established authority.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is their undeniable right to have officials of their unfettered
choice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The election law has no
justification except as a means for assuring a free, honest and orderly
expression of their views.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is of the
essence that corruption and irregularities should not be permitted to taint the
electoral process.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may not always be thus unfortunately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That should be the ideal however.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there be a failure to observe the mandates
of the Election Code, the aggrieved parties should not be left remediless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the law as it stands, it is precisely
an election protest that fitly serves that purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was sought to be thus utilized in these two cases, perhaps in
a rather awkward and far from entirely satisfactory manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in itself is no reason for the courts to
slam the door against any opportunity for redress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, that is what would happen if the order
of dismissal complained of were not set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence the inevitability of its reversal.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The scope of our decision must not be
misinterpreted however.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that it
directs is that the <span class="SpellE">protestees</span> in both cases be
required to answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, if, as
is not unlikely, there be a denial of the serious imputations made as to the
alleged irregularities, the lower court could properly inquire into what
actually transpired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the facts are
thus ascertained in accordance with the accepted procedural rules, then the
appropriate law could be applied.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be clearly emphasized that we do not at this stage
intimate any view as to the merit, or lack of it, of either protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That would be premature to say the
least.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All we do is to set aside the
order of dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of dismissal of <st1:date year="1968" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1968</st1:date>, is reversed and the two cases
remanded to the lower court for proceeding and trial in accordance with this opinion
and the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Without

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur whole-heartedly in everything contained in the ably
written opinion of our distinguished colleague, Mr. Justice Fernando,
including, of course, the disposi­tion he makes therein of these cases before
Us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may not be amiss, nonetheless, to
add a few words which I consider appropriate, in the light of my experience in
handling some election cases before my appointment as Solicitor General.</p>

<p class="BODY">The thing that has struck me most in these two cases, both
denominated as election protests, is that the prayers of the two petitions
therein are identical in that they do not ask for the seating of the
petitioners, who call themselves protestants, in the places of the protestees -
respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What they ask in the main is
that "the proclamation of the protestees as duly elected (mayor and
councilors) be set aside and declared null and void." This sole principal
prayer was precisely what gave appellees in both cases cause to contend that
(1) the Court of First Instance of Lanao del Sur had no juris­diction over the
subject matter, it being allegedly the Commission on Elections that has such
jurisdiction, and (2) neither of the petitions state any cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, the trial court properly overruled
the first ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, however, best
for all concerned that the observations and arguments adduced by the trial
judge in disposing of the second ground are placed in proper light.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ruling on the first ground above-stated, His Honor held thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Mere irregularities or misconduct on the part of election
officers which do not tend to affect the result of the elections are not of
themselves either ground for contest or for proper matters of inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x x x There is no alle­gation in the protest
that the alleged irregularities committed by the election officers would tend
to change the result of the election in favor of the protestants and against
the protestees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no allegation
in the petition that the 8,000 voters who failed to vote were all voters of
protestants and the 8,300 illegal voters who voted were for the
protestees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, therefore, no
legal and practical justification for the court to inquire into the irregula­rities
committed by the election officials, as alleged in the petition, for it would
not give any benefit in favor of the protestants to the end that they will be
declared the duly elected mayor and councilors, respectively, of this
City."</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The failure of election of of­ficers to obey the mandatory pro­visions
of a statute relating to the conduct of the election and designed to secure the
secrecy and integrity of the ballot may so taint the votes with irregularity as
to cause the rejection of the entire votes of the dis­trict.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be remembered, however, that all
statutes tending to limit the citizen in the exercise of the right of suffrage
are to be construed liberally in his favor, and that the courts are loath to
disfranchise voters who are wholly innocent of wrong­doing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, it is a firmly established
general rule that voters will not be rejected, even though election officers
fail to comply with the directory pro­visions of a statute, if there is no
fraud or other irregularity and failure to comply is unintentional; nor is it
material in this connect­ion that the failure of the elect­ion officers to
perform their duty subjects them to penalties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, the courts will not permit the will of the voters to be
defeated by fraud on the part of election officers if it is pos­sible to avoid
such a result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, a fair election
and an honest return should be con<span style="">sidered
as paramount in import­</span>ance to minor requirements which prescribe the
formal steps to reach that end, and the law should be so construed as to remedy
the evils against which its provisions are directed and at the same time not to
disfranchise voters further than is necessary to attain that object.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of a violation of the law on the part
of an election officer, punishment may be provided therefor, and in this way
the law can be rendered effectual may be provided therefor, <span style="">and in this way </span>the law can be
rendered effectual without going to the extent of depriving a voter of his
right to have his vote counted in consequence of such violation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may, therefore, be stated as a general
rule that if ballots are cast by voters who are, at the time, qualified to cast
them and who have done all on <span style="">their
part that </span>the law requires of <span style="">voters
to make </span>their voting effective, an erroneous or even unlawful handling
of the ballots by the election officers charged with such responsibility will
not be held to disfranchise such voters by throwing out their <span style="">votes on account of </span>erroneous pro­cedure
had solely by the <span style="">election </span>officers,
provided the votes are legal votes in their inception and are still capable of
being given proper effect as such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Nor will an </span>election be set aside
because of <span style="">irregularities </span>on the
part of the election officials unless it appears that such irregularities
affect the results.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(18 <span style="">Am. </span>Jur. Sec. 225, pp. <span style="">331-332, cited on pp. 621-622, Re­vised Election
Code by Francisco).'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"There is no allegation in the peti­tion that the
irregularities committed by the election officials have destroyed the secrecy
and integrity of the ballots cast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
<span style="">is </span>no allegation in the pe­tion
that the non-compliance of the election officials of the provisions of the
election laws regarding the regis­tration of voters were intentional on their
part for the purpose of committing frauds for the benefit of the
protestees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no allegation in
the petition that because of the alleged irregularities committed by the
election officials in not following the provisions of the election laws
regarding the registration of voters and the distribution of the precincts,
that all the votes cast during said elect­ions are illegal, nor <span style="">is </span>there an allega­tion in the
protests that the irregulari­ties committed by the election officials would
affect the election in favor of protestees."</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'A misconduct or irregularity committed by an election official is
not <span style="">a </span>sufficient ground to annul
the votes cast in the precincts where the person elected neither knew of nor
participated in the misconduct and it is not shown that any <span style="">elector who voted for the persons elected
either participated in such misconduct.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(18 Am. Jur. Sec. 228, p. 333, cited on page 622, Revised Election Code
by Francisco).'</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">While this ruling is, on
the whole, correct, His Honor failed to emphasize that the cases before him
were precisely ones for the annulment and setting aside of the election for
Mayor and Councilors in the </span>City of Iligan and that, therefore, the only
question that should be resolved is whether or not the facts alleged in the
petitions in quest­ion constitute sufficient grounds for such relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, the trial court made as may be seen
above, a long discourse on the thesis that "the purpose of an election
contest is to correct the canvass," and that "the general rule is
that whatever may be the cause of an election contest, the <span style="">true gravamen of the case is to determine who
receives the highest number of votes, etc." (pp. 5-8, Order in quest­ion)
and then held that there was no allegation in both petitions that "would
give any benefit in favor of the protestants to the end that they will be
declared the duly elected mayor and councilors, respectively, of this
City," ergo, the said petitions do not state any cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More specifically, the trial court looked in
vain for allegations to the effect that "the alleged irregulari­ties
committed by the elections in favor of the protestants and against the protestees."
(p. 7, id.) For example, His Honor reasoned out that "there is no
allegation ... that the 8,000 voters who failed to vote were all voters of
protestants and the 8,300 illegal voters who voted were for the
protestees." (id.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I am afraid that such
discourse, if quite impressive as an exposition of considerable learning in
election law matters, is rather irrelevant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I believe that what should be emphasized in these cases is that ruling
in Our decision to the effect that in an election protest, (otherwise en­titled
at times, petition or complaint or motion of pro­test) it is not necessary to
allege that the true results of the election in question would be in favor of
protest­ant and against protestee on the basis of the legal votes, or that the
proclaimed result would be changed if the facts alleged are proven, when the
sole ground of protest and the only purpose of the protestant is to have the
whole election in a precinct or municipality annulled and set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, as pointed out in the brief of appel­lants:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In the case No. G. R. L. No. 29333, the prayer is for the
annulment of the proclamation of protestee-appellee Ca­milo P. Cabili and of
the local elect­ions held in Iligan City on November 14, 1967, while in Case
No. G. R. No. L-29334, the prayer is for the annul­ment of the proclamation of
protestee-­appellees Felix Z. Actub, et als, and of the local elections held in
Iligan City on November 14, 1967.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Section 177 of the Revised Elect­ion Code provides:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sec. 177 -<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Decision of the Contests - The court shall
decide <span style="">the protest </span>x x x and
shall declare who among the parties has been elected, or in the proper case,
that none of them has been legally elected.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x x x"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under the above-quoted provision of law, the courts are
authorized to declare that none of the candidates has been le­gally elected,
which in effect would mean that the elections are annulled.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If it were not the intention of the lawmaker not to authorize
the courts to annul an election, such authority would not have been provided in
Section 177 of the Revised Election Code quoted above.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Francisco, in his book How to Try Election Cases, 1952
Edition, p. 82, citing as authorities the decisions of this Honorable Court in
Bustos vs. Moir and Fajardo, 35 Phil. 16; and Manalo vs. Sevilla, 24 Phil. 609,
states:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The court is authorized, in a proper case, not only to re­count
the ballots and reject those which it considers illegal and accept those which
it consi­ders valid but it is also autho­rized, in a proper case, to annul the
election completely.' (Under­lining supplied)</p>

<blockquote>"It is therefore clear that the trial court erred in holding
that the purpose of the protestants in filing these protest is not in accord
with the purpose of the Revised Election Code in allowing a defeated candidate
to file an election protest."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In other words, I like to
make it very clear that an election protest may be filed not only for the
purpose of having the protestant declared elected, but even for the purpose
alone of having the election annulled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise
</span>stated, protestants may come to court, not necessarily to win an
election, but even if solely to have the court de­clare that no one has won
because the election is void and that it <span style="">is
</span>obvious and pure common sense that in the lat­ter case, the protestant
does not have to allege the probability of his being the real victor, for in
such a case, his prayer precisely is - that it be declared, using the language
of the law, "that none of them has been legally elected." Surely, the
following ruling of the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>"An election contest is a summary proceeding the object of
which is to expedite the settlement of the con­troversy between candidates as
to who received the majority of the legal ballots (Gardiner vs. Romulo, 26
Phil. 522, 524).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of an election
contest is to correct the canvass of which the proclamation is a public
manifestation and the power granted by law to the court must agree with and be
adequate to such an object.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the
court can directly declare which candidate is to be elected leav­ing the
canvass made by the Board null and void, and the candidate so declared elected
may assume position of the of­fice (Aquino vs. Calabia &amp; Sahagun, 55 Phil.
984).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It being the policy of the law to
give effect to elections, the general rule is that whatever may be the cause of
an election contest, the true gravamen of the case is to determine who receives
the highest number of votes (20 C. J. 217).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In an elect­ion case, the court has an imperative duty to ascertain by
all means within its command who is the real candidate elected by the
electorate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Ibasco vs. Ilao, G. R. No.
L-17512, December 29, 1960).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, only
candidates have the right to file an election protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Gil Hermanos vs. Hord, 10 Phil. 217).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"From the foregoing authorities, it could be concluded that
the purpose of the election law to allow a candidate to file an election
protest <span style="">is </span>for the court to
determine whether the protest­ant or the protestee is the winner of the
election under protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present
case, the object of the protestants in filing their protests based on the
prayer of <span style="">their petitions is not to </span>declare
them the duly elected mayor and councilors, respectively, of this City but
merely to declare null and void <span style="">the
proclamation and </span>election of the pro­testees as well as the elections
held in Iligan City on November 14, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">The purpose, </span>therefore,
of the protestants in filing these protests is not in accord with the purpose
of the Revised Election Code in allowing a de­feated candidate to file an
election <span style="">protest."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">must be emphatically denounced as a
misreading by His Honor of the real import of the authorities cited by
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such proposition represents <span style="">the </span>most narrow concept of the judi­cial
remedies in matters of election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
single precedent in extant jurisprudence whether here or in any other country
can be found to support it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">I am equally confident that no </span>thesis
in any of the existing legal publications can be referred to as upholding such
an illogical idea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To sanction such a
ruling is to kill almost entirely all hopes for a clean, orderly and honest
suffrage in <span style="">this country, which </span>the
Commission on Elections alone may not be able to achieve in all possible
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, as pointed out by
appellants the trial court would have been right if it had only adhered <span style="">to the </span>decisions already rendered by
this Court on the subject, cited by said appellants in their <span style="">brief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The real issue then in
these cases is whether or not </span>the facts alleged in the <span style="">respective petitions of appellants constitute
sufficient ground or grounds for annulment of the election of Mayor and
Councilors in Iligan City, held in November, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this score, it has to be admitted that, </span>indeed,
the petitions of appellants which <span style="">appear
to have </span>been prepared by a single counsel are not as accurately and <span style="">precisely worded as to fit exactly into </span>the
pattern that may perhaps be most ideal in cases of this nature, but I cannot go
along with His Honor's ruling that the allega­tions in said <span style="">petitions are legally inadequate to serve as </span>a
basis for the relief of annulment of the election therein prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His Honor seemed to be more concerned with
what he considered the need for direct averments that <span style="">the </span>irregularities and violations of the election law alleged by
appellants resulted in the destruction of the "secrecy and integrity of
the ballot cast," that "all the votes cast in said elections are
illegal" and that "the irre­gularities committed by the election
officials would af­fect the election in favor of the protestees." (p. 8,
id.) I feel that His Honor was asking too much and unnecessa­rily because, as
they appear to me, these allegations as well as the others His Honor considered
as indispensably required, are more in the nature of legal conclusions, not
supposed to be averred in the pleadings, rather than statements of ultimate
facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The truth of the matter is that,
viewed as a whole, the petitions in question sufficiently lead to the
conclusion that what appellants are complain­ing about is that the elections
held in Iligan City in November, 1967 were characterized by general and
specific circumstances that leave rational doubt as to whether or not the true
will of the people of said City could be re­flected in the proclaimed
results.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the more polished and
inimitable language of Mr. Justice Fernando, "x x x the seriousness and
gravity of the imputed failure to have the elections conducted freely and
honestly, with such irregularities alleged, give rise to doubts, rational and
honest, as to who were the duly elected officials."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is my considered opinion that while it is truly desirable that
election protests should be discouraged where they have hardly any basis in
fact or in law, the earlier to free from doubt the title to their respective
offices of those chosen to direct the affairs of our go­vernment, whether
national or local, thereby giving them the peace of mind and freedom of action
gravely needed in the formulation of policies and the implementation there­of,
courts should also be careful in seeing to it that their doors are not untimely
shut to complaints regarding the commission of electoral frauds, irregularities
and illegalities, the most despicable banes of popular suf­frage, which though
unhappily worded are fairly indica­tive of a situation wherein the will of the
electorate has not been freely and clearly expressed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To my mind, the rule followed in an unbroken
line of decisions of this Court, to the effect that the commission of irregu­larities
by election officials, no matter how serious, and the actual discovery of
frauds and violations of law by either candidates or voters, are not in
themselves suffi­cient to cause the annulment of an election unless so ex­pressly
provided by law, or that the frauds, illegalities and irregularities are so
rampant and diffusive as to place the result of such election in grave doubt,
is one that governs more the rendition of judgments in election cases and the
evaluation of the circumstances surrounding the elections in question, as
portrayed in the evidence al­ready presented before the court, rather than as a
strict criterion for determining whether a complaint or petition or motion of
protest sufficiently states a cause of act­ion for annulment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respecting contrary opinion others may
entertain on the matter, I regard it as a sound rule that pleadings in election
cases, at least, should not be subjected to such minute examination as should
be done to facts duly established after proper hearing, if only be­cause facts
are unerring manifestations of the truth, while allegations in pleadings often
suffer from the com­mon flaws in the means of human expressions as well as from
the usual imperfections of human language.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If words are but children of thoughts, parents and off-springs do not
always, as among men and animals, look exactly alike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pleadings in such cases must, therefore, be
read with more liberality so as to make it difficult, if not impos­sible for
grievances against the suppression in one form or another of the expression of
the popular will, well-grounded in fact, may not be thrown out merely because
of lack of skill and precision in the formulation of the cor­responding
protests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More importance should be
given to the substantial matters sufficiently appearing in such pleadings as
intended to be brought to the court for a remedy, than to the form, at times,
ambiguous and often ungrammatically phrased, in which they are expressed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, in case of doubt as to which
should be done, such doubt must be resolved <span style="">in </span>giving due course to the protest, unless it <span style="">is </span>manifestly evident that the same
has been filed for other than legitimate purposes.</p>

<p class="BODY">As already indicated, my vote <span style="">is </span>for the reversal of the appealed order sustaining the motion
to dismiss filed by appellees in the court below, because I agree with the
decision herein of Mr. Justice Fernando that there are enough indications,
within the four corners of the questioned petitions, of irregularities and
illega­lities which, if proven, may result in the annulment of the elections
prayed for by appellants.</p>
