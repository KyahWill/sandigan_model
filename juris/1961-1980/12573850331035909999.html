				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an &nbsp;appeal from the &nbsp;decision of the &nbsp;Court of First Instance of Manila (in Sp. Proc. No. 20037) denying the petition for writs of habeas corpus and/or prohibition, certiorari, and mandamus filed by Qua Chee Gan, James Uy, Daniel Dy alias Dy Pac, Chan Tiong Yu, Chua Chu Tian, Chua Lim Pao alias Jose Chua, &nbsp;and Basilio King. The &nbsp;facts of the case, briefly stated, are as follows: On May 12, 1952, Special Prosecutor Emilio L. &nbsp;Galang charged the above-named petitioners before the Deportation Board, &nbsp;with &nbsp;having purchased U.S. dollars &nbsp;in &nbsp;the total sum &nbsp;of &nbsp;$130,000.00, without the &nbsp;necessary &nbsp;license from the Central Bank of the Philippines, and of &nbsp;having clandestinely &nbsp;remitted the same to Hongkong; &nbsp;and petitioners Qua Chee Gan, &nbsp;Chua &nbsp;Lim Pao &nbsp;alias Jose Chua, and Basilio King, with having attempted to bribe &nbsp;officers of the Philippine and United States Governments &nbsp; (Antonio Laforteza, Chief of &nbsp;the Intelligence Division of the Central Bank, and Capt. A. &nbsp;P. Charak of &nbsp;the OSI, U. S. Air Force) &nbsp;in order to evade prosecution for said unauthorized purchase &nbsp;of U. S. dollars:<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[1]</sup></font> <p>Following the filing of said deportation charges, &nbsp;a warrant &nbsp;for the arrest of said aliens was issued by the presiding member of the &nbsp;Deportation Board. &nbsp;Upon their filing surety bond for P10,000.00 and cash &nbsp;bond for P10,000.00, herein &nbsp;petitioners-appellants were provisionally set &nbsp;at liberty.</p> <p>On September 22, &nbsp;1952, &nbsp;petitioners-appellants filed a joint motion to dismiss the charges presented against them&nbsp; in &nbsp;the Deportation &nbsp;Board for the reason, among others, that the same do not constitute legal ground for deportation of aliens from this country, and that said Board has no jurisdiction to entertain such charges. &nbsp;This motion to dismiss &nbsp;having &nbsp; been denied by &nbsp;order &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Board on February 9, 1953, petitioners-appellants filed in this &nbsp;Court a petition for <em>habeas corpus</em> and/or prohibition, which petition was given due course in &nbsp;our resolution of July 7, 1953, but made &nbsp;returnable to the Court of First Instance of Manila &nbsp;(G. &nbsp;R. No. &nbsp;L-6783). &nbsp;&nbsp;The &nbsp;case was docketed in the lower court as &nbsp;Special Proceeding &nbsp;No. &nbsp;20037. At the instance &nbsp;of petitioners and upon their filing a bond &nbsp;for P5,000.00 each, a writ of preliminary injunction was issued by the lower court, restraining the respondent Deportation Board &nbsp;from hearing Deportation &nbsp;Charges No. R-425 against &nbsp;petitioners, &nbsp;pending &nbsp;final termination of the <em> habeas corpus</em> and/or &nbsp;prohibition &nbsp;proceedings. </p> <p>On July 29, 1953, the respondent Board filed its answer to the original &nbsp;petition, maintaining among others, that the Deportation Board, as an agent &nbsp;of the President, has jurisdiction over the charges filed against petitioners and the authority to order &nbsp;their arrest; &nbsp;and that, while petitioner Qua Chee Gan was &nbsp; acquitted of the offense of attempted bribery of a public official, &nbsp;he was &nbsp;found &nbsp;in the same decision of the trial court &nbsp;that he did actually offer money &nbsp;to &nbsp;an officer of the United &nbsp;States Air Force in order that the latter may abstain from assisting the Central &nbsp;Bank official in the investigation of the purchase of $130,000.00 from the Clark Air Force Base, &nbsp;wherein said petitioner was &nbsp;involved.</p> <p>After due trial, the court rendered a decision on January i&amp;, &nbsp;1956, upholding the validity of &nbsp;the delegation &nbsp;by the President to the Deportation Board of his power to conduct investigations &nbsp;for &nbsp;the purpose of &nbsp; determining whether the stay of an alien in the country &nbsp;would be injurious to the security, welfare and interest of &nbsp;the State. &nbsp;&nbsp;The court, likewise, sustained the power of the &nbsp;Deportation Board to, issue warrants of arrest and fix bonds for the alien's temporary release pending investigation of charges against him, on the theory that &nbsp;the &nbsp;power &nbsp;to arrest and fix the amount of the &nbsp;bond &nbsp;of the &nbsp;arrested &nbsp;alien &nbsp;is essential to and complement the power to deport aliens, pursuant to Section 69 &nbsp;of the Revised Administrative Code. Consequently, the petition was dismissed without costs. &nbsp;Hence, the &nbsp;petitioners instituted the present appeal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>It may be pointed out at the outset that after they &nbsp;were provisionally released on bail, but before the charges filed against &nbsp;them &nbsp;were &nbsp;actually &nbsp;investigated, petitioners- appellants raised the question of jurisdiction of the Deportation Board, first before &nbsp;said body, &nbsp;then in the Court of First Instance of Manila, &nbsp;and now before us. &nbsp;Petitioners appellants contest the power of the President &nbsp;to deport aliens and, consequently, the delegation to the Deportation Board, of the ancillary power to investigate, &nbsp;on the ground that such power is vested &nbsp;in the Legislature. &nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, it is claimed, for the power to deport to be exercised, there must be a legislation &nbsp;authorizing the same.</p> <p>Under &nbsp;Commonwealth &nbsp;Act No. 613 (Immigration Act of &nbsp;1940), the Commissioner of &nbsp;Immigration &nbsp;was &nbsp;empowered &nbsp;to effect &nbsp;the &nbsp;arrest and expulsion of an alien, after previous determination by &nbsp;the Board of &nbsp;Commissioners &nbsp;of the existence &nbsp;of &nbsp;ground &nbsp;or &nbsp;grounds therefor (Sec. 37). &nbsp;With the enactment of this law, however, the legislature did not intend to delimit or concentrate the exercise of the power to deport on the Immigration Commissioner alone, because &nbsp;in its Section &nbsp;52, it &nbsp;provides: </p> <blockquote> <p>"Sec. 52. This &nbsp;Act is in substitution &nbsp;for and supersedes all previous laws relating to the &nbsp;entry of &nbsp;aliens into &nbsp;the &nbsp;Philippines, and &nbsp;their exclusion, deportation, &nbsp;and repatriation &nbsp;therefrom, with the exception of &nbsp;section sixty-nine of Act &nbsp;Numbered Twenty-seven hundred and eleven which shall continue in &nbsp;force and effect: * &nbsp;* *." (Com. Act No. 613). </p> </blockquote> <p>Section &nbsp;69 &nbsp;of &nbsp;Act &nbsp;No. &nbsp;2711 &nbsp;(Revised Administrative Code) referred to above reads:</p> <blockquote> <p>"Sec. 69. <em>Deportation of subject &nbsp;to foreign &nbsp;power.</em>—A &nbsp; subject of a foreign power residing in the Philippines shall not be deported, expelled, &nbsp;or excluded from said Islands or repatriated to his own country by the President of &nbsp;the &nbsp; Philippines except upon prior investigation, conducted by said Executive or his authorized agent, of the ground &nbsp;upon which such action is contemplated. &nbsp;In such case the person concerned shall &nbsp;be informed of the charge &nbsp;or charges against him and &nbsp;he &nbsp;shall be &nbsp; allowed &nbsp;not less than three days for the preparation &nbsp;of &nbsp;his defense. He &nbsp;shall also have the right to &nbsp;be heard by himself or counsel, to produce witnesses in his own behalf, and to cross-examine the opposing witnesses."</p> </blockquote> <p>While it may really be &nbsp; contended that the aforequoted provision did not expressly confer &nbsp;on &nbsp;the President the authority to &nbsp;deport undesirable aliens, unlike &nbsp;the &nbsp;express grant to the Commissioner of Immigration under Commonwealth Act No. 613, &nbsp;but merely lays down the procedure &nbsp;to &nbsp;be observed should &nbsp;there be deportation proceedings, the fact &nbsp;that &nbsp; such &nbsp;a procedure was provided for before the President &nbsp;can deport an alien—which provision was expressly declared exempted from the repealing effect of the Immigration Act of 1940—is a clear indication of the recognition, &nbsp;and inferentially a ratification, &nbsp;by the legislature of the existence of such power in the Executive. And &nbsp;the exercise of &nbsp;this power by the Chief Executive has been sanctioned by this Court in several decisions.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[2]</sup></font></p> <p> Under the &nbsp;present and existing laws, &nbsp;therefore, deportation of an &nbsp;undesirable &nbsp;alien &nbsp;may be effected in two ways: by order of &nbsp; the President, after &nbsp;due investigation, pursuant to &nbsp;Section &nbsp;&nbsp;69 &nbsp;&nbsp;of the Revised Administrative Code, and by the Commissioner of Immigration, &nbsp;upon recommendation by the Board of Commissioners, under Section 37 of Commonwealth Act No. 613.</p> <p>Petitioners contend, however, that even granting that the President is vested with power to deport, still he may do so only upon the grounds enumerated &nbsp;in Commonwealth Act &nbsp;No. 613, as &nbsp;amended, and on no other, as it &nbsp;would be unreasonable &nbsp;and undemocratic to hold "that an alien may be deported upon an unstated or &nbsp;undefined ground depending merely on the unlimited discretion of the Chief Executive. &nbsp;&nbsp;This contention is not without merit, considering that whenever the legislature believes a certain &nbsp;act or conduct to &nbsp;be just cause for deportation, &nbsp;it &nbsp;invariably enacted a law to that effect. &nbsp;Thus, in a number of amendatory acts, grounds have been added to those originally contained in Section 37 of Commonwealth &nbsp;Act No. 613, as justifying deportation &nbsp;of &nbsp;an &nbsp;alien, &nbsp;as &nbsp;well as other laws which &nbsp;provide deportation as part of the penalty imposed on aliens &nbsp;committing violation thereof.</p> <p>Be this as it may, the charges &nbsp;against the herein petitioners &nbsp;constitute in effect an act of &nbsp;profiteering, hoarding &nbsp;or blackmarketting of U.S. dollars, in violation of the &nbsp;Central Bank regulations—an economic &nbsp;sabotage— which is a ground for deportation under the provisions of Republic Act 503 amending &nbsp;Section 37 &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Philippine Immigration Act of 1940. &nbsp;The &nbsp;President &nbsp;may therefore order the deportation of these petitioners if after investigation they are shown to have committed the act charged.</p> <p>There seems to be no doubt that the &nbsp;President's &nbsp;power of investigation may be delegated. &nbsp;This is clear from a reading of Section &nbsp;69 of the Revised Administrative Code which &nbsp; provides &nbsp;for a "prior investigation, &nbsp;conducted by said Executive (the President) <em>or his authorized agent." </em>The first executive order on the subject was that of Governor General Frank &nbsp;Murphy (No. 494, July 26, &nbsp;1934), constituting a board to take action on complaints against foreigners, to conduct investigations and thereafter make recommendations. &nbsp;By virtue of Executive Order No. 33 dated May 29, 1936, President Quezon created the Deportation Board primarily to receive complaints against aliens charged to be undesirable, to conduct investigation &nbsp;pursuant to Section 69 &nbsp;of &nbsp;the Revised Administrative Code and the rules and regulations therein &nbsp;provided, and make the corresponding recommendation.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[3]</sup></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, the &nbsp;Deportation Board has &nbsp;been conducting &nbsp;the investigation as the authorized &nbsp;agent of &nbsp;the President.</p> <p>This gives rise to &nbsp;the question regarding the extent of the power of the President to conduct &nbsp;investigation, &nbsp;i.e., whether such authority &nbsp;carries with it the power to order the arrest of the alien complained &nbsp;of, since the Administrative &nbsp;Code is silent &nbsp;on &nbsp; the matter, &nbsp;and &nbsp;if &nbsp;it does, whether the &nbsp;same may be &nbsp;delegated to the &nbsp;respondent Deportation Board.</p> <p>Let it be noted that Section 69 of &nbsp;the Revised Administrative Code, unlike Commonwealth Act No. 613 wherein the Commissioner of Immigration was specifically granted authority, among others, to make arrests, fails to provide the President with like specific power to be exercised in connection with such investigation. &nbsp;&nbsp;It must be for &nbsp;this reason &nbsp;that &nbsp;President Roxas, for &nbsp;the &nbsp;first &nbsp;time, &nbsp;saw it necessary to issue his Executive &nbsp;Order No. 69, dated July 29, 1947, providing—</p> <blockquote> <p>"For &nbsp;the purpose of &nbsp;insuring &nbsp;the appearance of aliens charged before the &nbsp;Deportation &nbsp;Board &nbsp;created under Executive &nbsp;Order &nbsp;No. 37, &nbsp;dated January 4, 1947, and facilitating the &nbsp;execution &nbsp;of the order of deportation whenever the President &nbsp;decides the case against the respondent, I, Manuel &nbsp;Roxas, President of the &nbsp;Philippines, by virtue of the &nbsp;powers vested in me by law, do hereby &nbsp;order that all respondents in deportation proceedings &nbsp;shall &nbsp;file a &nbsp;bond &nbsp;with the Commissioner of Immigration in such &nbsp;amount &nbsp;and &nbsp;containing such conditions as he may prescribe.</p> </blockquote> <p>Note that the executive order only required the filing of a bond to secure appearance of the alien under investigation. &nbsp;&nbsp;It did &nbsp;not authorize the arrest &nbsp;of the respondent.</p> <p> It was only on January 5, 1951, when President Quirino reorganized the Deportation Board by virtue of his Executive &nbsp;Order &nbsp;No. &nbsp;398, &nbsp;that &nbsp;the &nbsp;Board &nbsp;was authorized <em>motu proprio</em> or upon the filing of formal charges by the Special Prosecutor of the Board, to issue &nbsp;the warrant for the arrest of &nbsp;the alien &nbsp;complained &nbsp;of aim&nbsp; to hold him under detention during the &nbsp;investigation unless he files a bond for his provisional release in such amount and under such &nbsp;conditions as may be prescribed by the &nbsp; Chairman of the &nbsp;Board.</p> <p>As has been pointed &nbsp;out elsewhere, Section 69 of the Revised Administrative &nbsp;Code, upon &nbsp;whose &nbsp;authority the President's power to deport &nbsp;is predicated, does not provide for the exercise of the power to arrest. &nbsp;But the Solicitor General argues that the &nbsp;law could not have denied to the Chief Executive acts which &nbsp;are &nbsp; absolutely &nbsp;necessary to carry into effect &nbsp;the power of deportation &nbsp;granted &nbsp;him such &nbsp;as the authority to &nbsp;order the arrest &nbsp;of the foreigner charged as undesirable.</p> <p>In &nbsp;this &nbsp;connection, it &nbsp;must be remembered &nbsp;that the right &nbsp;of &nbsp;an &nbsp;individual &nbsp;to &nbsp;foe' secure &nbsp;in his person is guaranteed by the Constitution in the following language:</p> <blockquote> <p>"3. The right of the people to "be secure &nbsp;in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no warrants &nbsp;shall issue &nbsp;but upon probable cause, to be determined by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation &nbsp;of the complainant and the witnesses &nbsp;he &nbsp;may produce, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized." &nbsp;(Sec. 1, Art. Ill, Bill of &nbsp;Rights, &nbsp;Philippine Constitution).</p> </blockquote> <p>As &nbsp;observed by the &nbsp;late Justice Laurel in his &nbsp;concurring; opinion in the case of Rodriguez, et al. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs. </span>Villamiel, et al. (65 Phil. 230, 239), &nbsp;this &nbsp;provision is not the same as that contained &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;Jones &nbsp;Law &nbsp;wherein this guarantee is placed among the rights &nbsp;of &nbsp;the accused. &nbsp;&nbsp;Under our &nbsp;Constitution, &nbsp;the &nbsp;same &nbsp;is declared &nbsp;a popular &nbsp;right of'.Hie people and, &nbsp;of course, indisputably &nbsp;it equally applies to both &nbsp;citizens and &nbsp;foreigners &nbsp;in &nbsp;this &nbsp;country. &nbsp; Furthermore, a notable innovation in this guarantee &nbsp;is found &nbsp;in our Constitution in that it specifically provides that the probable cause &nbsp;upon which a warrant of &nbsp;arrest may &nbsp;be issued, must be determined by the judge &nbsp;after examination under oath, etc., of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce. &nbsp;This requirement—"to &nbsp;be determined by the judge"—is not found in the Fourth Amendment &nbsp;of the U. S. &nbsp;Constitution, in the Philippine &nbsp;Bill or &nbsp;in the Jones Act, all of which do not specify &nbsp;who will determine the existence of a probable cause. &nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, under their provisions, &nbsp;any &nbsp;public officer may be authorized by the Legislature to &nbsp;make &nbsp;such determination, &nbsp;and thereafter issue &nbsp;the warrant &nbsp;of arrest. &nbsp;Under &nbsp;the express terms of our Constitution, it is, therefore, even doubtful whether the arrest of an individual may be ordered by any authority other than the judge if the purpose is merely to determine the &nbsp;existence &nbsp;of a probable cause, leading to &nbsp;an administrative &nbsp;investigation. &nbsp;The &nbsp; Constitution does not distinguish between warrants in &nbsp;a criminal case and administrative warrants in administrative proceedings. &nbsp;And, if one suspected of having committed a crime is entitled to a &nbsp;determination &nbsp;of the probable cause against him, &nbsp;by a &nbsp;judge, why should one suspected of a &nbsp;violation of &nbsp;an administrative &nbsp;nature deserve less guarantee? &nbsp;Of course it is &nbsp;different if the order of arrest is issued to carry out a &nbsp;final &nbsp;finding &nbsp;of a violation, either &nbsp;by an executive &nbsp;or legislative &nbsp;officer or agency duly authorized for the purpose, as then the warrant is not that &nbsp; mentioned in &nbsp;the Constitution which is issuable &nbsp;only &nbsp;on &nbsp;probable cause. Such, for example, would be a warrant of arrest to carry out a final order of deportation, or to effect compliance of an order of contempt. </p> <p>The contention of the &nbsp;Solicitor General that the arrest of a foreigner is necessary to carry into effect the power of deportation &nbsp;is valid only when, as already stated, there is already an order of deportation. &nbsp;To carry out the order of deportation, the President &nbsp;obviously has &nbsp;the &nbsp;power to order the arrest of the &nbsp;deportee. &nbsp;But, certainly, during the investigation, it is not indispensable that the alien be arrested. &nbsp;It is enough, &nbsp;as was true before &nbsp;the &nbsp;executive order of President &nbsp;Quirino, that a -bond be required to insure the appearance of &nbsp;the &nbsp;alien during the investigation, as was authorized in the executive order of President Roxas. &nbsp;Be that as it may, it is not imperative for us to rule, in this &nbsp;proceeding,—and nothing &nbsp;herein said is intended to so decide—on whether or not &nbsp;the &nbsp;President himself can order the arrest &nbsp;of a foreigner for purposes of investigation only, and before a definitive order of &nbsp;deportation has been issued. &nbsp;We are merely called upon to resolve herein whether, conceding without &nbsp;deciding that the President can personally order the arrest of the alien complained of, such power can be delegated &nbsp;by him to &nbsp;the Deportation Board.</p> <p>Unquestionably, the exercise of the power to &nbsp;order &nbsp;the arrest of an individual demands the exercise of &nbsp;discretion by the one issuing the same, to determine whether under specific circumstances, the curtailment of the liberty &nbsp;of such person is warranted. &nbsp;The fact that &nbsp;the Constitution itself, as &nbsp;well as the statute relied upon, prescribe the manner by which &nbsp;the warrant may be issued, conveys the intent to make the issuance of &nbsp;such warrant dependent upon &nbsp;conditions the &nbsp;determination &nbsp;&nbsp;of &nbsp;the existence &nbsp;of which requires the use of discretion by the person issuing the same. &nbsp;In other words, the &nbsp; discretion &nbsp;of &nbsp;whether &nbsp;a warrant &nbsp;of arrest &nbsp;shall issue or not is personal to &nbsp;the one upon whom the authority devolves. &nbsp;&nbsp;And &nbsp;authorities are to the effect &nbsp;that &nbsp;while ministerial duties &nbsp;may &nbsp;be delegated, official &nbsp;functions requiring the exercise of &nbsp;discretion and judgment, may not be so delegated. &nbsp;Indeed, an implied grant &nbsp;of &nbsp;power, &nbsp;considering that &nbsp;no express authority was granted &nbsp;by the law &nbsp;on the matter under discussion, &nbsp;that would serve as a curtailment or limitation on the fundamental right of a person, such as his security to life and &nbsp;liberty, must be viewed &nbsp;with caution, if we are td give &nbsp;meaning &nbsp;toL the guarantee contained in the Constitution. &nbsp;If &nbsp;this &nbsp;is so, then &nbsp;a &nbsp;delegation of &nbsp;that implied power, nebulous as it is, must be rejected as inimical to the &nbsp;liberties of the people.&nbsp; The guarantees of human rights and freedom &nbsp;can not be made to rest precariously on such a shaky foundation.</p> <p>We &nbsp;are not unaware of the &nbsp;statements made by this Court in &nbsp;the case of Tan Sin <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Deportation Board (104 Phil., &nbsp;868). It may be &nbsp;stated, however, &nbsp;that &nbsp;the &nbsp;power of arrest was &nbsp;not squarely raised in that proceeding, but only as a consequence of therein petitioners &nbsp;proposition that the &nbsp;President had &nbsp;no inherent power to &nbsp;deport and that &nbsp;the &nbsp;charges &nbsp;filed &nbsp;against him &nbsp;did &nbsp; not &nbsp;constitute ground for deportation.</p> <p>In &nbsp;view of &nbsp;the &nbsp;foregoing, Executive &nbsp;Order &nbsp;No. 398, series &nbsp;of &nbsp;1951, insofar &nbsp;as it empowers &nbsp;the Deportation Board to &nbsp;issue warrant of arrest upon the filing of formal charges against an &nbsp;alien &nbsp;or aliens &nbsp;and to fix &nbsp;bond &nbsp;and prescribe &nbsp;the conditions &nbsp;for the temporary release of said aliens, &nbsp;is declared illegal. &nbsp;As &nbsp;a consequence, &nbsp;the order of arrest &nbsp;issued by &nbsp;the &nbsp;respondent &nbsp;Deportation Board is declared null and void &nbsp;and the bonds filed pursuant to such order of &nbsp;arrest, &nbsp;decreed cancelled. &nbsp;&nbsp;With the foregoing modification, the decision &nbsp;appealed &nbsp;from is &nbsp;hereby affirmed. &nbsp;No costs. &nbsp;So ordered.</p> <p><em>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Paredes, Dizon, Regala,</em> and <em>Makalintal, JJ.,</em> &nbsp;concur.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p></p><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><font color="#ff0000"><sup>[1]</sup></font> On &nbsp;Jan. 22, 1952, &nbsp;Qua Chee Gan &nbsp;was charged &nbsp;in the Court of First Instance of Rizal of the crime of attempted bribery (Crim.
