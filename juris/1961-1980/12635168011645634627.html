				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF SY SUAN TO BE ADMITTED A
CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, SY SUAN, PETITIONER-APPELLEE,
VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR-APPELLANT.

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Solicitor General seeks the review of a decision of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> finding "that
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Suan</span> is
qualified to be admitted a citizen of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>."
Appellant maintains that the decision appealed from should be re­versed
because:</p>

lower court assumed jurisdiction over the case des­pite the fact that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) petitioner had not filed the requisite
declara­tion of intention to become a citizen of the Philippines, although he
is not exempt <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, and (b) his former places of
residence were not alleged in the petition; and<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(2)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->the
lower court erred in rendering said decision for:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) petitioner is not a person of good moral
character; (b) he has not conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable
manner; (c) he has not evinced a sincere desire to become a citizen of the
Philip­pines; (d) he has not enrolled all of his children in public schools or
private schools recognized by the Government, during the entire period of his
residence in the Philippines; (e) he does not have a lucrative trade,
profession or occupation; and (f) his witnesses are not credible persons.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the first assignment of error, it appears that in his
application for naturalization, filed on September 4, 1958, petitioner alleged
that his "present place of residence is No. 68-C Arellano St., <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
Philippines," and that his "former residence was 744 Magdalena
Street, Manila."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified,
however, that, upon his arrival in the Philippines, in 1923, he resided with
his father at T. <span class="SpellE">Pinpin</span> Street, Manila; that in <span style="">1933, </span>he moved to <span class="SpellE">Tetuan</span>
Street; and that, in <span style="">1936, </span>he
established his residence at <span class="SpellE">Platerias</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span>, where he stayed up to 1941.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have repeatedly held that failure to state
in a petition <span style="">for naturalization all of
petitioner's former places of residence, constitutes a violation of Section 7
of Commonwealth Act No. 473,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> which is fatal to the jurisdiction of the
Court to hear and grant said petition.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With respect to the
second assignment of error, the record shows that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1952" day="26" month="9">September
 26, <span style="">1952</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>petitioner was administratively
fined by the Bureau of Immigration for late registration of his child, Julie <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Suan</span>, born on July 31, of the
same year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This notwithstand­ing, he did
not cause his son, Henry <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Suan</span>,
born on February 12, 1945, to be registered until November 23, <span style="">1959, </span>or more than 14 years later and
over a year after the filing of the petition herein and, seemingly, to avoid
obstacles thereto, for which reason he was, once again, fined administratively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that the late registration of his
daughter Julie in 1952 had been due either to ignorance of his obligation to
register her or to oversight on his part, the discipli­nary action taken
against <span class="GramE">him</span> at that time should have been "more
than sufficient warning for him" - in the language used in Cu vs. Republic<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
- of his duty to register his son Henry, born much earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's failure to do so until over
seven years late<span style="">r </span><span style="">reveals - as stated in said case - his
"little respect for our laws." Under comparable circumstances, we
held in the Cu case that failure of an alien to comply with the Alien
Registration Act proves that he has not conducted himself in an irreproachable
manner.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's income from 1957 to 1959 was P9<span class="GramE">,600.00</span> a year. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Considering that petitioner has a wife and
eleven (11) children, four (4) of whom were in college, one (1) in high school
and three (3) in grade school, he can not be regarded as having a lucrative
trade, profession or occupation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
was the view taken by this Court in <span class="SpellE">Keng</span> <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> vs. Republic,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
involving an applicant for naturalization who had a wife and five (5) children
of school age actually attend­ing school and a yearly income of P8<span class="GramE">,656.50</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At least one of petitioner's attesting
witnesses, namely, Mrs. Carmen <span class="SpellE">Pavon</span> <span class="SpellE">Albar</span>, did not know him sufficiently to vouch for his
possession of the requisite qualifications, such, for instance, as whether or
not he believes in the principles underlying our Consti­tution, thereby being
short of one of the requirements of Section 7 of Commonwealth Act No. 473,
above referred to.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, likewise, points out a number of other
factors bolstering up the theory that petitioner is not exempt from the duty to
file a declaration of intention to apply for naturalization, and that he has
not evinced a sincere desire to embrace the customs, traditions and ideals of
the Filipinos, but we deem it unnecessary to discuss these points inasmuch as
those already adverted to suffice to warrant rejection of petitioner's
application for naturalization.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the decision appealed from should be, as it
is hereby reversed, and the petition for naturalization in this case,
accordingly, denied, with costs against petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
