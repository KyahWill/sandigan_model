				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal by the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
from the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span>,
in its civil case 55, granting the petition for naturalization of <span class="SpellE">Que</span> Tee <span class="SpellE">Tiao</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The statement of facts
made by the Solicitor General, which the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Que</span>
accepts <span class="GramE">as</span> "substantially correct," is
hereunder reproduced in full:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The evidence presented in this case shows that petitioner was
born on August 11, 1915 in <span class="SpellE">Sua</span>-Tao, <span class="SpellE">Ankoy</span>, China; that he is a citizen of the Republic of
China; that his wife is <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Lim, with whom he
has 8 children, namely, Cesar, Delia, <span class="SpellE">Merlinda</span>,
Alonso, Elvira, Corazon, Jesus and Yolanda, all surnamed Tan; that he was
baptized in the Roman Catholic Church under the name Enrique <span class="SpellE">Loza</span> Tan; that he has resided in the Philippines con­tinuously
since 1931.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"The evidence further
shows that petitioner is a merchant, and from his occupation he derived </span>a
net income of P6,353.95 in 1959; P5,228.06 in 1960; and P4,333.35 in 1961, the
year when <span style="">he </span>filed the instant
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The above figures represent
the joint income of petitioner and his wife during the <span class="GramE">periods</span>
<span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"<span class="SpellE">Tirso</span>
Ponce de Leon, a witness for petitioner, stated in his affidavit attached to
the petition that he knows personally petitioner <span class="SpellE">Que</span>
Tee <span class="SpellE">Tiao</span> @ Enrique Tan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other witness, Ramon Austria, likewise
stated in his affidavit attached to the petition that he knows personally
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Que</span> Tee <span class="SpellE">Tiao</span>
Enrique Tan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These witnesses, in their
respective affidavits, alleged that petitioner has all the qualifications
necessary to become a citizen of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> and is not in any way disqualified under the
provisions of the Naturalization Laws of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Republic asks this Court to reverse the judgment <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
on the grounds that the petitioner (1) "does not have a lucrative
income," and (2) "is disqualified for admission for Philippine<span style=""> citizenship because he uses an alias name
without proper authority.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">"We</span> uphold
the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<blockquote>1. The income tax returns of the petitioner show a net income of
only P5<span class="GramE">,228.06</span> for 1960 and P4,333.35 for 1961, the
year when he filed the present petition for naturalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that he has a wife and 8 children
to support, 7 of whom are schooling, the mentioned net incomes are clearly not
lucrative and therefore disqualify him for Philippine citizenship.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. The petitioner used the name Enrique <span class="SpellE">Loza</span>
Tan when he was baptized on <st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="7">July 11,
 1963</st1:date>, as well as when he contracted marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the certificates of baptism of his
children he registered his name as Enrique Tan.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the certificate of clearance issued to him by the Anti-Dummy Board,
the petitioner represented himself as <span class="SpellE">Que</span> Tee <span class="SpellE">Tiao</span> <u>alias</u> Enrique Tan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His own character witness Tirso Ponce de
Leon, averred in his affidavit of February 3, 1961, "that I have known and
have been acquainted with the said Mr. <span class="SpellE">Que</span> Tee <span class="SpellE">Tiao</span> alias Enrique Tan." His failure to state in his
petition that he was also known as Enrique Tan is, in virtue of this Court's
consistent ruling, a sufficient ground of itself for denial of his petition for
naturalization.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment appealed from is reversed, and
the present petition for naturalization is hereby dismissed, at petitioner's
cost.</p>
