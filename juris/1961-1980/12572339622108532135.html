				<H3>FRANCISCO LAO ALIAS ME-O, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPONENT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In a verified petition filed in the Court of First Instance of Leyte on 22 
April 1958 and amended on 21 June 1958, Francisco Lao <i>alias</i> Me-o avers 
and claims that he is qualified to become a Filipino citizen by naturalization 
and prays that his petition to become such citizen be granted (case No. N-40). 
After hearing, on 2 March 1959 the court entered a decree granting his petition 
to become a citizen of the Philippines by naturalization. The Government has 
appealed.
<blockquote>
<p>The Government claims that the trial court erred inâ€”</p>
<p>* * * finding that the petitioner conducted himself in a proper and 
irreproachable manner and in not finding that he lacks good moral character.</p>
<p>* * * not holding that the petitioner did not have a lucrative trade.</p>
<p>* * * not finding that the filiation of petitioner's alleged children has not 
been proved by competent evidence.</p></blockquote>
<p>The record shows that.the appellee has five children, namely, Jacinto, bom on 
16 July 1949; Tita, 6 December 1951; Teresa, 14 October 1953; Enrique, 12 
December 1955; and Dione, 22 October 1957, all surnamed Lao and born out of 
wedlock by Joseiina Cawaling, whom he married only on 18 April 1958 (Exhibit K), 
or four days before filing the petition for naturalization. Such common-law 
relationship does not show good moral character and is not a proper and 
irreproachable conduct required by law of aliens desiring to become naturalized 
Filipino citizens.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>The appellee's annual income of P1,200 (p. 60, t.s.n.) as merchant since 1950 
is not lucrative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> This, taken together 
with his improper and reproachable conduct in cohabiting for almost twelve years 
with his wife without benefit of clergy, disqualifies him to become a citizen of 
the Philippines by naturalization.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
This conclusion renders unnecessary the passing upon the last and third error 
assigned by the appellant regarding proof of filiation of the appellee's 
children.</p>
<p>The decree appealed from is reversed and the petition for naturalization 
denied, with costs against the appellee.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,
