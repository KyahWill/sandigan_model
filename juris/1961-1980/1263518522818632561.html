				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an administrative case filed on <st1:date year="1965" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1965</st1:date> by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>
M. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, as lawyer for <span class="SpellE">Tita</span>

Service Commissioner,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a>
with:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) serious misconduct thru
falsification of public documents; (2) serious misconduct and inefficiency thru
gross ignorance of the law, partiality <span style="">and
</span>corrupt practices; and (3) serious misconduct thru corrupt practices.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Commissioner filed his answer on <st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1965</st1:date>, after which the case <span style="">was assigned </span>to Hon. Juan P.
Enriquez, Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals, for investigation, report

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1966" day="2" month="2"><span style="">February
 2, </span><span style="">1966</span></st1:date><span style=""> Justice Enriquez submitted to this Court his
report, the pertinent portions of which read:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of the first charge, complainant
has established that on June 1, 1962 respondent was nominated by the President
of the <span style="">Philippines to </span>the
position of Commissioner of Public Service Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In connection therewith, the Commission on
Appointments required <span style="">respondent to
accomplish </span>and submit to <span style="">it an
information </span>sheet, which the re­spondent did under oath <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="6" month="5"><span style="">May 6, 1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, </span><span style="">Exhibit A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Question No. 4 of </span>Exhibit
A reads, 'Record of court and/or <span style="">administrative
case against you </span>if there <span style="">is </span>any;
status of the same.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No criminal nor
administrative <span style="">case is pending </span>against
him.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It, however, appears that <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1956" day="17" month="12"><span style="">December 17, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="">, a decision </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">rendered by the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span>
against respondent for slight physical injuries committed by respondent against
his wife, imposing upon him P50.00 fine, Exhibit B.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">proferred</span>
the explanation that he understood the question to refer to <span style="">unfinished cases in 1963, and so his answer
refers to pending cases only; and that there was no intention to evade the
question.</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Under the facts, the offense charged has not been established.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence shows that by virtue of a
provisional permit issued on <st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="10">October
 27, 1964</st1:date>, applicant <span class="SpellE">Tita</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Bayhon</span> started operation of five units of PU cars sometime
in November, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on <span style="">December 7, 1964, Rodrigo Lim wired re­spondent
Commissioner a complaint charging <span class="SpellE">Bayhon</span> with
collecting fare by distance instead of per hour, in not issuing stub receipt
and without being provided with BIR and municipal licenses and requesting
suspension of her provisional permit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent referred the telegram to the Chief, Transportation Division,
for </span><span style="">'possible action'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 10, respondent instructed by
telegram PSC inspector <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>
in <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> to
investigate the charges and on December 14, <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>
wired back that according to </span><span style="">operator
<span class="SpellE">Bayhon</span> and </span><span style="">her men they </span><span style="">were </span><span style="">charging per person, al­though he has
'personal knowledge that all PU operators in the city of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
de </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Oro</span></span><span style="">, are charging P2.00 </span><span style="">per head from the </span><span style="">city of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> proper to the air</span><span style="">port and vice-versa, a distance of </span><span style="">more than </span><span style="">twelve (12)
kilometers', that is, P2.00 per head per twelve kilometers covered in fifteen
(15) minutes, thus overcharging the </span><span style="">public four times the authorized fare.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="">More­over, in proceedings
before the City Fiscal </span><span style="">held on
December 3, 1964, operator </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bayhon</span></span><span style=""> admitted
operating </span><span style="">without </span><span style="">issuing receipt </span><span style="">to passengers, </span><span style="">operating in violation of city ordinances and operating without
painting the authorized rates on the wind­shield of the vehicles, pleading
however that she had just started operation with the promise to </span><span style="">correct </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">deficiencies </span><span style="">pointed out above, respondent suspended </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bayhon's</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">operation
on December 18, 1964 ordering her at the same time to 'show cause why her
certificate of public con­venience (issued December 15, 1964) should not be
cancelled'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="1"><span style="">January
 4, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Bayhon</span> presented a motion for </span><span style="">reconsidera­</span><span style="">tion directed to the PSC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, and after hearing </span><span style="">the PSC en </span><u><span style="">banc</span></u><span style=""> issued on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="18" month="1"><span style="">January
 18, 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> an order
maintaining the order of suspension, setting aside </span><span style="">the decision </span><span style="">granting </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Tita</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Bayhon</span> authority to operate and ordering a new trial </span>of
the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the hearing of this
administrative case, the <span style="">case of <span class="SpellE">Bayhon</span> appears </span>to <span style="">be </span>still pending action.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Bayhon</span> wired respondent
on <st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1964</st1:date> requesting
immediate investigation of Rodrigo Lim's <span style="">taxicab for being </span><span style="">dilapidated and </span><span style="">operated with
tampered meters and without <span class="SpellE">toplights</span> and color
scheme, Exhibit D.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="1"><span style="">January </span><span style="">8, </span>1965</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Bayhon</span> filed a
formal complaint thereon and pressed her demand for <span style="">im</span><span style="">mediate investigation, enclosing therewith photographs of Lim's taxicabs,
Exhibit E.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon respondent's telegraphic
order of December 18, 1964, <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, PSC inspector, investigated the charges against
Lim and found them to be true and correct on January 28, 1965, Exhibits G and
L. So on </span><st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="1"><span style="">January 29, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> filed
with the PSC seven (7) verified complaints against public convenience granted
same operator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Confirmation of the
charges is contained in the letter of February 2, 1965 of acting registrar <span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span> E. <span class="SpellE">Factura</span>, Exhibit H,
his certificate of August 13, 1965, Exhibits R and R-1, letter of PSC inspector
Jesus V. <span class="SpellE">Agana</span>, March 31, 1965, </span>Exhibit <span style="">5, respondent's order of April 5, 1965,
Exhibit M, and </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">herein complainant as
late as August 12, 1965, Exhibits P and </span><span style="">Q.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Examination of the evidence
will </span>show that the alleged disregard of Section 16 (n) of the Public
Service Law has not been shown.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent's suspension of <span class="SpellE">Bayhon's</span> operation
is based on the report of PSC inspector <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> and the
very admissions of <span class="SpellE">Bayhon</span>, which up to now have not
been denied nor explained away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any
rate, the order of the PSC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> of <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1965</st1:date> confirmed respondent's order of <st1:date year="1964" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1964</st1:date>, thus purging it
of whatever technical defect it may have suffered from.</blockquote>

respondent granted a certificate of public convenience and necessity to <span style="">Juan Sierra to operate 30 units of taxicabs
in the metropolitan area, Annex 27.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Juan
Sierra's wife is the sister of the wife of Angel Medina, brother of respondent
and </span><span style="">who
was a witness at the hearing on the application and subsequently appointed
manager of the taxicabs operated by Sierra.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>In his defense respondent alleges that the decision, Annex 27, was
based on the overwhelming evidence of financial competence and qualifications
of Juan Sierra and after proper delibera­tion; that he did not advise <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> to go slow with respect to Rodrigo Lim because the
latter is his <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">compadre</span></u></span><span style="">, </span><span style="">since no such relationship ever existed be­tween them.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Complainant
charges respondent with a violation of Section 3(d) of Republic Act 3019, which
reads: 'Accepting or <u>having any member of his family accept employment</u>
in a private enterprise which has pending official business with him during the
<span class="SpellE">pendency</span> thereof, or within one year after its
termination.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While a certificate of
public convenience </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">granted to Juan Sierra while respondent is Commissioner of PSC and that
respondent's brother who is Sierra's brother-in-law became manager of Sierra's
taxicab business, there is <u>no showing that respondent had his brother accept
such </u></span><u><span style="">employment</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">If he was so employed, it must be because of
the relationship existing between the brothers-in-law, with which respondent
has nothing to do."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While recommending respondent's exoneration on two counts the
investigator found him guilty of partiality and recommended that a reprimand
with admonition be ad­ministered, on the ground that despite the findings of
two PSC inspectors and the MVO registrar, the operation of Lim's taxicabs was
not suspended, in contrast to the action taken by respondent in connection with
Lim's complaint against <span class="SpellE">Tita</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayhon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was, apparently, <span style="">a </span><span style="">difference in the treatment awarded the two operators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They mutually charged each other, but
suspension was meted out to only one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
must be noted, however, that <span class="SpellE">Tita</span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bayhon's</span></span><span style=""> operation of her
PU cars </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">pursuant to a provisional permit issued by
the Commission in its order dated </span><st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="10"><span style="">October
 27, 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. S).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Violations of some of the terms and conditions of said provisional
permit were admitted by her in her testimony during the investigation conducted
by Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> de la <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
(Annex 8) and confirmed by the letter-report of inspector <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> (Annex 6).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said provisional permit pro­vides, among other things, that "the
first violation of these prohibitions, <u>duly </u></span><u><span style="">proven</span></u><span style="">,</span><span style=""> shall be
sufficient cause for the cancellation of this provisional permit"; that
"the provisional permit hereby granted may be cancelled or revoked by the
Commission at anytime"; and that "failure of the applicant to comply
with any of the foregoing re­quirements will be considered cause for this
Commission to withdraw the authority herein granted."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, the order of suspension was, upon the filing of a motion
for reconsideration by counsel for <span class="SpellE">Tita</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayhon</span>, submitted to the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>,
which, on <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1965</st1:date>,
after hearing, denied the said motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Rodrigo Lim was the holder of a regular
certificate of public convenience, and he denied the charges against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although it is true that two PSC inspectors
and the MVO registrar reported that violations had been committed by Lim, the
Commission has no power, except in specified instances, to suspend or revoke
the certificate of public convenience without proper notice and hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Public Service Act provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 16.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proceedings
of the Commission, upon notice and hearing.- The Commission shall have the
power, upon proper notice and hearing in accordance with the rules and
provisions of this Act, subject to the limitations and exceptions mentioned and
saving provisions to the contrary:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(n)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To suspend or revoke any certi­ficate issued
under the provisions of this Act whenever the holder thereof has violated or
willfully and contumaciously <span style="">refused to comply with any order, rule or regulation of the Commission or
any provision of this Act: Provided, That the Commission, for good cause, may,
prior to the hearing suspend for a period not to exceed thirty days any </span><span style="">certificate or the
exercise of any </span><span style="">right or </span><span style="">authority </span><span style="">issued or granted under this Act by order of the Commission, whenever
such step shall in the judg­ment of the Commission be necessary to avoid
serious and irreparable damage </span><span style="">or inconvenience to the public or to </span><span style="">private
interests."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The non-suspension of Lim's operation before notice and hearing
does not necessarily show partiality on the part of respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The requirement of notice and hearing may be
dispensed with only when in the opinion of <span style="">the Commission the remedy of suspension
before hearing is necessary to avoid serious and irreparable damage or inconvenience
to the public or to private interests.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This consideration obviously contemplates the exercise of sound
discretion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that after receipt of the telegram-complaint of <span class="SpellE">Tita</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayhon</span>, dated <st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1964</st1:date>, respondent, on
December 18, directed inspector <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> to investigate the operation of Rodrigo <span style="">Lim and to submit his report and
recommendation immediately (Annex 14).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, due to Lim's protest against the arbitrariness and partiality
of <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, respondent designated Atty. <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Eltanal</span>, special
assistant of the Commission, to investigate said protest and, later on, the
complaint of <span class="SpellE">Bayhon</span> against Lim (Annexes 18 and 19).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="1">January <span style="">29, </span>1965</st1:date> <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> filed seven (7) identical complaints filed against
Lim, in effect relinquishing his role as investigator for the Com­mission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These complaints were brought to respondent's
attention only on <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date respondent referred them to
the Chief of the Complaints and Enforcement Section for appropriate action and
required the receiving clerk to explain why the said complaints had not been
brought to his attention earlier <span style="">(Annex
</span><span style="">21).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway </span><span style="">they were calendared for hearing on </span><st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="6"><span style="">June 30, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, but upon motion of <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>
</span><span style="">the </span><span style="">hearing was postponed to </span><st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="7"><span style="">July 12,
 1965</span></st1:date><span style=""> (Annex
25).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, before that date the
instant administrative case was filed </span><span style="">against </span><span style="">respondent, whereupon he in­hibited himself from hearing the complaints
and </span><span style="">as­signed </span><span style="">them instead to Associate Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Josias</span>
K. <span class="SpellE">Guinto</span>, who in turn re-assigned them, for certain
personal reasons, to Commissioner Alex F. de Guzman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Commissioner de Guzman, on his part, ran for
Congress on </span><st1:date year="1965" day="9" month="11"><span style="">November 9, 1965</span></st1:date><span style=""> and hence was not able to conduct the
investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cases were then
reassigned to Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Sunga</span>, but on the date of
hearing <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> did not appear despite notice to him
and so on motion of Lim's counsel the cases were dismissed for lack of
interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">In view of all the
foregoing</b><span style="">, this Court finds that
the charges against respondent have not been substantiated and accordingly resolves
to dismiss the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
