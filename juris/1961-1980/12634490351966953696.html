				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Direct appeal from the decision of the Court of
First Instance of Manila, in its Civil Case No. 54284, dismissing, for lack of
juris­diction, the complaint of the plaintiff-appellant Fireman's Fund Ins­urance
Company against the Manila Port Service and Manila <span style="">Railroad </span>Company, as alternative defendants with <span class="SpellE">Compañia</span> General de <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Tabacos</span></span><span style=""> </span>de Filipinas.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 15 May 1962, the International General El<span style="">ectric </span>Co., U.S.A., of which the <span class="SpellE">Compañia</span> General de <span class="SpellE">Tabacos</span> de
Filipinas was the agent in the Philippines, shipped at the port of New York
fifteen <span style="">(15) </span>cartons on board
the ocean vessel "Susan <span class="SpellE">Maersk</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shipment, valued at $1,722.19 was
consigned to the order of the First National City Bank of <st1:state><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:state>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
with arrival notice to the General Electric Com­pany (P. I.) and was insured by
the plaintiff Fireman's Fund Insurance Company against loss or damage.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="6">17 June 1962</st1:date>,
the vessel arrived in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
unloaded its car­go and allegedly delivered the cartons, 2 of them in bad
order, <span style="">to </span>the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator, the defendant Manila Port Service, a
subsidiary <span style="">of </span>the Manila Railroad
Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In turn, the Manila Port
Service <span style="">del</span><span style="">ivered the goods to the consignee but short
of one (1) carton, with a value of $390,72 (Case No. 6652) while another one
was short of contents, with a value of $9.84 (Case No. 218).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The consignee filed formal claims with the carrier's agent, <span class="SpellE">Compañia</span> General de <span class="SpellE">Tabacos</span> de
Filipinas, with the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator, Manila Port
Service and with the insurer, Fireman's Fund Insurance Company (through its agent,
E.E. <span class="SpellE">Elser</span>, Inc.) for the insured value of the
loss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The carrier rejected the claim on
the ground that it had discharged the shipment complete from the vessel;
however, it sent a communication on <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="10">4
 October 1962</st1:date> to the consignee, advising that Case No. 6652
"was discharged against clean tally sheet #6353" and that the claim
should be referred to the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator and the
underwriters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The carrier requested that
the consignee's claim be amend­ed on Case No. 218 only; but the consignee did
not heed the requested amendment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
part of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator, it contended that one
case was not landed, and refused to pay.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The plaintiff-insurer, through E.E. <span class="SpellE">Elser</span>,
Inc., paid the claim at the dollar-peso conversion rate in the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,898.66</span>.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 17 June 1963, the plaintiff, as <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span>
to all rights of recovery in connection with the loss that it had insured and
paid, filed an ac­tion in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the
carrier and the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator as alternative
defendants, claiming that it was uncertain as to which of them is liable for
the lost cargoes.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the lower court rendered its decision dismissing the
complaint against the Manila Port Service and Manila Railroad Com­pany for lack
of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action as against said
defendants; but sentenced the defendant <span class="SpellE">Compañia</span> Ge­neral
de <span class="SpellE">Tabacos</span> de Filipinas to pay the plaintiff the sum
of P38.25, with interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the decision, the plaintiff interposed the pre­sent
direct appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue in this case is whether or not the Court of First
Instance of Manila has jurisdiction over the subject matter of the ac­tion
insofar as the defendants Manila Port Service and Manila Rail­road Company are
concerned and considering that the amount demanded in the complaint is only P1<span class="GramE">,898.66</span>, considering that these defendants were joined as
alternative defendants with a carrier of goods by sea, the <span class="SpellE">Compañia</span>
General de <span class="SpellE">Tabacos</span> de Filipinas.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with plaintiff-appellant that the Court below erred in
dismissing its action against defendants Manila Port Service and the Manila
Railroad Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only because
Section 13 of Rule 3 permits it, in case of uncertainty, to <span style="">sue </span>several defendants in the <span style="">alternative, but also because Section 5, Rule
2 of the Rules of Court permits a <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of causes
of action in the alternative, or otherwise, if said causes of action arise out
of the same contract, transaction or relation between the same parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the second para­graph of the last
cited provision prescribes that in the cases afore­mentioned -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">the</span> action
shall be filed in the inferior court <u>unless any</u> of the causes joined
falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance in which case it
shall be filed in the latter court."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The provision of our Rules of Court accords with the American
rule:</p>

<blockquote>"Constitutions and statutory
provisions conferring jurisdic­tion on the inferior courts of demands below
certain amounts do not forbid determination of said demands in the superior
court where they are connected with larger claims or with type of demand solely
within the jurisdiction of the superior court." (21 C.J.S., p. 81.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court below admitted that the action for damages to Case No.
218 was within its jurisdiction since it involved an issue in admiralty;
wherefore, it must be held to have likewise acquired jurisdiction over the
other cause of action alternatively joined thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is the suit filed by plaintiff in the Court of First Instance
with­out precedent in this country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
same issue, on practically iden­tical facts, was posed in Switzerland General
Insurance Co., Ltd. vs. Java Pacific and <span class="SpellE">Hoegh</span> Lines
and the Manila Railroad Company, G.R. No. L-21760, decided on <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="4">30 April 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">After referring to section
5, Rule 2, <u>jam</u>.</span> <u>cit</u>.<span class="GramE">,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>this</span> Court observed:</p>

<blockquote>"As may be seen, the instance case comes within the purview of
the rule above-quoted for therein it is postulat­ed that a party may in one
pleading state in the alterna­tive as many causes of action as he may have
against an opposing party if they arise from the same transaction with the
particularity that the case may be filed in the court of first instance if any
of said causes of action falls exclusively within its jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is pre­cisely what was done in this
particular case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of the
uncertainty of the place where the disappearance of the shipment occurred,
plaintiff brought the case in the alternative before the court of first
instance upon the theory that it may have occurred while the shipment was in
transit or while in the custody of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operator.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">"This case also finds support in International Harvester
Company of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. <st1:country-region><st1:place>Aragon</st1:place></st1:country-region>, et
al., 84 Phil. 363.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="">said </span>case, the complaint was filed in
the municipal court against both the shipping company as agent of the vessel on
which the shipment was loaded and the Manila Railroad Company, Inc. as
alternative defendants, seeking to recover the sum of P200.00 as value of the
undelivered goods, it being uncertain whether said cargo was lost at sea or
while in storage at the Port of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In affirming the dismissal of the case this Court stated that the munic­ipal
court had no jurisdiction over the same because it is predicated on the
contract of carriage by sea which falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of
the court of first ins­tance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
reasoning by analogy, we may say that the ins­tant case also falls exclusively
within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of Manila upon the
theory that the loss or disappearance of a portion of the shipment may have
taken place during the voyage and hence it involves a maritime case which falls
within the original jurisdic­tion of said court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the amount sought to be
collected is less than its jurisdictional limit is of no mo­ment, because the
cause of action being indivisible, cov­ering as it does laws on ordinary as
well as maritime con­tract, such jurisdictional limitation as to amount must
yield to the greater jurisdiction of the court as to subject matter for reasons
of expediency and convenience."</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">foregoing ruling was reiterated in <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Surety
vs. </span>Manila Rail­road Co., G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-20875, </span><st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="4"><span class="GramE">30 April 1966</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, and in Insurance Company of </span><st1:place><span class="GramE">North
 America</span></st1:place><span class="GramE"> vs. United States Lines Company,
G.R. No.</span> L-21021, decided on <st1:date year="1966" day="27" month="5">27
 May 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, the Court below declared that the consignee or its
suc­cessor in interest could have easily verified the disclaimer of the agents
of the <span style="">vessel
</span>as to the loss of case No. 6652, "by asking for the part­icular
cargo receipt which had been signed by the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
contractor and would therefore be binding upon it." This <span style="">would </span>only
be true on the assumption that the cargo receipt <span style="">was </span>authentic, and in view of the denials of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator that it had received case No. 6652, or
that the same had been landed, the consignee was not in a pos­ition to be
certain that the receipt was genuine, or that the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operator would recognize its authenticity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The plaintiff's uncertain­ty, therefore, remained and justified it in
suing both the carrier and the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator in
the alternative as authorized <span style="">by </span>the
Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">And, it appearing that the Manila Port Service has had no oppor­tunity
to submit its own evidence as to its receipt of case No. 6652, a rehearing of
the case is in order.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed
and set aside, and the Court of First Instance is directed to overrule the
motion to dismiss of the defendants Manila Railroad Company and Manila Port
Service, and to proceed further with the case in conform­ity with this
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against the defendants
above named.</p>
