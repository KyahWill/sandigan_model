				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for prohibition with <span style="">a </span>prayer for preliminary injunction
to restrain the respondent Judge from proceeding with the trial of Civil Case
No. 7278 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
entitled <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacalso</span>
versus the Secretary of Agriculture &amp; Natural Resources, Mateo <span class="SpellE">Bacalso</span> and Cesar Gonzalez.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Culled from the pleadings
and annexes thereto before <span class="GramE">Us</span>, the following are the
facts pertinent to the issue involved in the present petition:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Dissatisfied with the decision of the Director of Mines, which
was affirmed by the Secretary of Agriculture &amp; Natural Resources, declaring
that Mateo C. <span class="SpellE">Bacalso</span> and Cesar Gonzalez, petitioners
herein, have established superior location rights on certain mining claims
situated in the City of Toledo, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, which were in
dispute between <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacalso</span>,
on one hand, and Mateo C. <span class="SpellE">Bacalso</span> and Cesar Gonzalez,
on the other hand, and pursuant to which decision, the claims of the latter
were given due course, on November 10, 1961 <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bacalso</span> filed a complaint in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, against the Secretary of
Agriculture &amp; Natural Resources, Mateo C. <span class="SpellE">Bacalso</span>
and Cesar Gonzalez, dock­eted as Civil Case No. 7278.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents filed separate motions to <span style="">dismiss </span>the case, based on a common ground,
that the decision of the administrative body had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
motions were denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private
respondents moved to reconsider the order which was also denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the trial on the merits, the private
respondents filed an "Ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion to or­der
the clerk of court, Atty. Vicente Miranda, to transfer civil case No. 7278, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> from branch V to Branch VII, <span class="SpellE">Barili</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>", alleging that
"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> in virtue of
the Administrative Order No. 302 of the Department of Justice, Series of 1962,
as amended by Administrative Order No. 337, in the sense that the City of
Toledo be included under the Seventh Branch in <span class="SpellE">Barili</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> and considering that the properties involved in
the litigation are located in Toledo City as above-stated - compliance to the
said Admi­nistrative Orders of the Department of Justice by the clerk of court
is necessary."</p>

<p class="BODY">Resolving the motion, the court denied the same in an order which
reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Defendants Mateo <span class="SpellE">Bacalso</span> and Cesar
Gonzalez, <span style="">in </span>their motion <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">parte</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>dated May 15, 1963, ask this court to
order the clerk of court to transfer <span style="">this
case </span>to Branch <span style="">VII of this court
at <span class="SpellE">Barili</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, alleging
as grounds that after the said additional branch was created, the Department of
Justice ordered that all cases originating from Toledo and other southern towns
of this province should be heard by the said branch; that this case involves
mining claims which are situated in Toledo City, within the jurisdiction of the
said branch at <span class="SpellE">Barili</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>;
and that the trial of this case has not been started yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">movants</span>
attached to their motion certified copies of their mining claims showing that
the said claims are situated in the City </span>of <st1:city><st1:place>Toledo</st1:place></st1:city>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The same motion was submitted for resolution to the Honorable
Judge Amador E. Gomez, presiding as vacation judge, who refrained from
resolving the <span style="">same.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The record shows that this case was filed on November 22,
1961, long before the said Branch VII at <span class="SpellE">Barili</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> was created by law, and since then several important
incidents have taken place, one of which was a motion to Dismiss the Complaint
for lack of jurisdiction, which motion was resolved by this court denying the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several motions for
reconsiderations had been submitted to, and considered and resolved by this
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although it is true that the
mining claims in this case are situated in <st1:place><st1:placename>Toledo</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, within the jurisdiction of
this court at <span class="SpellE">Barili</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>,
the said motion to transfer the case to that branch is not considered well
taken by this court by reason of the following grounds:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This case had
already been assigned to the Fifth Branch of this court long before the Seventh
Branch was created and before Administrative Order No. 337 of the Department of
Justice was issued;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="2Q">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several <span style="">important in</span>cidents had taken place
and resolved by this court, and it is necessary in order to avoid variance and
conflict in the rulings on the previous incidents resolved by this court, that
this case should remain to be tried by this Branch;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="2Q">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The agreement of
the judges of this court concerning cases pertaining to the different branches
of this court d<span style="">o</span>e<span style="">s</span> not cover the present case were several
inci<span style="">dents have </span>already been
acted upon by this Branch.<o:p></o:p></p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, based on the <span style="">foregoing
</span>considerations, the ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion to order
the clerk of court to transfer this case to Branch VII of this court is hereby
denied for lack of merit."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration of the order having <span style="">been </span>denied, the present petition for
certiorari with preliminary injunction was filed before this Court on <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question presented for review expressed in the terms and
circumstances of the case is, whether or not the respondent Judge presiding
over branch V of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
to which the case No. 7278 has been assigned by agreement of the Judges
presiding over the other branches of the same court, and before whom the case
had been partially heard on matters other than the merits, has lost
jurisdiction to try and decide the <span style="">said case </span>by virtue of the Administrative
Orders Nos. 302 and 337 of the Secretary of Justice, transferring the cases
assigned in branch V, one of which is the case No. 7278, to branch VII of the
same court which is stationed at <span class="SpellE">Barili</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Administrative Order No. 302, dated August 20, 1962, states that,
in view of the addition of two branches of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> from six to eight branches by virtue of Republic Act
No. 2613, approved in August <span style="">1, </span>1959, and pursuant to the provisions of Section 57 of the
Judiciary Act, as amended, that the cases coming from the different municipalities
of the Province of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, are hereby distributed
between the eight branches of the court as follows:</p>

<blockquote>(Here follows the list of cities and
municipalities, included among them the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Toledo</st1:place></st1:city>,
as corresponding to the six branches of the Court; the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Barili</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
among other municipalities, corresponding to Branch VII.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As already stated, the <span style="">case </span>No. <span style="">7278, by </span>agreement of the judges presiding over the six branches
of the court, was assigned to Branch <span style="">V,
</span>presided over by the respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1962</st1:date>, Administrative Order No. 337
was issued by the Secretary of Justice, amending Administrative Order No. 302,
providing that "the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Toledo</st1:place></st1:city>
be included under the Seventh Branch in <span class="SpellE">Barili</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>."</p>

<p class="BODY">We start with the statement that it is a settled rule that
jurisdiction is conferred only by the Constitution or the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be fixed by the will of the
parties; it cannot be acquired through, enlarged or diminished by any act of
omission of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Constitutionally viewed, apportionment of jurisdiction is vested in
Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court has said, thru
Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> (n<span style="">ow </span>Chief Justice) in <span class="SpellE">Gumpal</span> v. CFI of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, et al., L-16409 and 16416, <st1:date year="1960" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1960</st1:date>:</p>

<blockquote>"It is trite to say, however, that the validity of a given judicial
action is dependent upon the jurisdiction of the court taking it, and that, by
specific constitutional mandate, the power to define, prescribe and apportion
the jurisdiction of the various courts, is subject to the limitations set forth
in the fundamental law, within the exclusive <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Congress</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since, being legislative, said power cannot
be delegated to the Secretary of Justice x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing statement of the law on the fountain source and
extent of the jurisdiction of the court is beyond debate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is incorrect to assume, as the respondent
Judge did assert in his order complained of, that because the <span style="">case </span>No.
7278 has been assigned to Branch V, by agreement of the Judges presiding over
the six branches of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
that he has acquired exclusive jurisdiction to try and decide the case to the
exclusion of the other Judges presiding over the other branches of the same
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The various branches of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> under the Fourteenth
Judicial <span class="GramE">District,</span> are a coordinate and co-equal
courts, and the totality of which is only one Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jurisdiction is vested in the court, not
in the judges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when a case is filed
in one branch jurisdiction over the case does not attach to the branch or judge
alone, to the exclusion of the other branches.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Trial may be held or proceedings continue by and before another branch
or judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is for this reason that
Section 57 of the Judiciary Act expressly grants to the Secretary of Justice,
the administrative right or power to apportion the cases among the different
branches, both for the convenience of the parties and for the coordination of
the work by the different branches of the same court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The apportionment and distribution of cases
does not involve a grant or limitation of jurisdiction; the jurisdiction
attaches and continues to be vested in the Court of First Instance of the
province, and the trials may be held <span style="">by
</span>any branch or judge of the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the respondent Judge grievously erred in not
complying with the directive of the Secretary of Justice in Administrative
Order No. 337, on a flimsy, nay, self-conceited reasons that<span style=""> </span>because -</p>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several important
incidents had taken place and resolved by this Court, and it is necessary, in
order to avoid various and conflicting rulings on the previous incidents resolved
by this Court, that this case should remain to be tried by this Branch."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The apportionment of cases among the different branches of the
same court, as ordained by the Secretary of Justice, must be respected by the
Judges in the interests of order and coordination in the dispatch of cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">Be all that as it may, however, the legal question under
consideration has become moot and academic, because on June 22, 1963, or more
than a year before the present petition was filed, Republic Act No. 3729
amending Republic Act No. 296, otherwise known as the Judiciary Act of 1948,
went into effect, increasing the number of branches of the Court of First
Instance in the 14th Judicial District, comprising <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
Toledo, and Bohol from 11 to 14 branches, and as ordained in Section 6 of the
law -</p>

<blockquote>"Wherever an additional branch or branches of the Court of
First Instance is or are established in this Act in the same place where there
is an existing court or courts of first instance, <u>all </u><u><span style="">cases already filed in the latter court or
courts shall be heard, tried and decided by such latter </span>court or courts</u>."
<span class="GramE">[Underscoring <span style="">Ours.]</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">which</span> means that
branch V of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> shall
retain jurisdiction to try and decide the case No. 7278.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is dismissed, and the writ of
preliminary injunction heretofore issued is hereby dissolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">On equitable
considerations, no costs.</span></p>
