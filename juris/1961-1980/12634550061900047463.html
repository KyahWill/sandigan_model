 January 1959</st1:date>, Victoriana <span class="SpellE">Eguaras</span>, single,
made and executed a real estate mort­gage over a parcel of land, owned by her

favor of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>

of the deceased, on <st1:date year="1960" day="16" month="9">16 September <span style="">1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, filed a petition for the intestate

a <span style="">deputy clerk of court, administrator

commissioner to <span style="">receive the evidence

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="8"><span style="">16
 August 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">,
decision was rendered decree</span><span style="">ing
the foreclosure </span><span style="">of the mortgaged
property and the sale thereof, if, within ninety days from finality of the decision,
the obligation was not fully paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
judgment not having been satisfied, a writ of execution was issued for the sale
of the mortgaged-property, and after compliance with the requirements of the
law regarding the sending, posting and publication of the notice of sale, the
Sheriff sold the property at pub­lic auction to the highest bidder, who </span>happened
<span style="">to be the plaintiffs themselves, for
the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,888.50</span> covering the amount of the
judgment, plus the expenses of </span><span style="">the
sale </span><span style="">and the Sheriff's
fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On petition of the plaintiffs, the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On 6 February 1962, <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> Ramirez, Monica </span>Ra­<span style="">mirez and Jose <span class="SpellE">Eguaras</span>, the first two being
the heirs named in the petition for intestate proceedings, filed a complaint designated
"For the Annulment of all Proceedings in said </span><span style="">Civil </span><span style="">Case No. SC-292 for the Fore­closure of the Mortgage", against the
spouses <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>
and Susana Flores, and <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Diawan</span>,
in his capacity as administrator of the estate of Victoriana <span class="SpellE">Eguaras</span>, deceased, and <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Talabis</span>, in his capa­city as deputy provincial sheriff of
Laguna, docketed </span>as Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">SC-319 of the Court
of First Instance of Laguna.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The facts hereinabove narrated are, succinctly, contained in the
complaint in said Civil Case No. SC-319, with the additional averments that the
defendant <span class="SpellE">Diawan</span>, the deputy clerk of court appointed
as adminis­trator of the intestate estate of the deceased, acted in collusion
with the other defendants <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>
and Susana Flores, deliberately and in fraud of the plaintiffs:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) in allowing the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period <span style="">within which to file an answer
to lapse without notify</span>ing and/or informing the said plaintiffs of the
com­plaint for foreclosure, as a result of which he was de­clared in default to
the prejudice of the estate which he represents; (b) that had the plaintiffs
(Monica and <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>) been notified of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case, the defendant-administrator could
have interposed a counter­claim because payment in the sum of P1,548.52 had
been made and received by the mortgagees on account of the debt; (c) in
presiding as hearing officer in the <u>ex­</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">parte</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>hearing in Civil Case No. 292, to
receive evidence for plaintiffs therein, notwithstanding the fact that there
was another deputy clerk of court available who could have acted in his stead,
as a result of which an anomalous situation was created whereby he was a defend­ant
and at the same time a commissioner receiving evidence against himself as
administrator; (d) in allowing judgment to become final without notifying the
plaintiffs; (e) in deliberately allowing the 90-day period within which to make
payment to expire without notifying the heirs, as a result of which the said
heirs were not afforded an opportunity to make payments ordered by the Court in
its decision; and (f) in refusing to help the heirs seek postponement of the
auction sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also alleged that it
was only when the property foreclosed was published for sale at public auction
that the heirs came to know about the foreclosure proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="GramE">defendants</span> spouses, <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> and Susana
Flores, filed <span style="">a </span>motion to
dismiss the complaint on the ground that the plaintiffs have no legal capacity
to sue; defendant <span class="SpellE">Diawan</span> likewise moved to dismiss on
two grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that plaintiffs have no
legal capacity to sue and that the complaint states no cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Despite vigorous opposition interposed by the plaintiffs against
the aforesaid motions to dismiss, the court, on 13 March 1962, dismissed the
complaint with costs against the plaintiffs, reasoning thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that "upon <span style="">considering </span><span style="">of</span><span style=""> the</span> <u><span style="">ev</span>idence</u>, said defendant could<span style=""> not </span>have offered<span style=""> any</span>
evidence to avoid the foreclosure of <span style="">the
mortgage</span> which the Court found to be in order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Un­der the circumstances and with the
apparent disinterestedness of <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> and Rolando to
qualify as administrator when appointed, there could not have been any
connivance and/or collusion between plaintiffs in this case and <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Diawan</span> as administrator”;
and that<span style=""> plaintiffs have no legal
capacity to sue since their status as legal heirs of the deceased has yet to be
determined precisely in Special Proceedings No. SC-99, and until such status </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">so </span><span style="">fixed </span><span style="">by the Court, they have no cause of action
against defendants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span>that order of <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="3">13 March 1962</st1:date>, the court also denied
plaintiffs' petition for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction to
enjoin defendants from entering and taking physical possession of the land in
question on the ground "that possession thereof was effected and delivered
by the Provincial Sheriff to <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> and Susana Flores on February, 1962."</p>

<p class="BODY">Reconsideration of the aforesaid order having been denied, the
plaintiffs took the present appeal where they assigned the following
errors:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in holding that
plaintiffs-appellants have no legal capacity to sue until their status as legal
heirs of the deceased is determined in Special Proceeding No. SC-99; (2) in
ruling that there was no collusion or connivance among the defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, despite the fact that the issue in the motion to
dismiss is purely legal, not factual; a<span style="">n</span>d
(3) in denying the petition for a writ of preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, let it be remembered that the defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, in availing themselves of the de­<span style="">fense that the plaintiffs-appellants had not
been de­clared to </span>be the heirs <span style="">of
the deceased Victoriana <span class="SpellE">Eguaras</span>, have overlooked the
fact that they (defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>) themselves in
their petition for intestate proceedings (Case SC-99) have alleged that <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> Ra­mirez and Monica Ramirez, </span>two <span style="">of herein plaintiffs-appellants, are the
heirs of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Insofar </span>as
defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> are concerned, it is our opinion
that they are <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from questioning the <span class="SpellE">heirship</span> of these two named persons to the estate of the
deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the rights to success­ion are
automatically transmitted to the heirs from the moment of the death of the
decedent.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
While, as a rule, the formal declaration or recognition to such <span class="SpellE">successional</span> <span style="">rights
needs judicial confirmation, this Court has, under special circumstances,
protected these rights from encroachments made or attempted before the judicial
declaration.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In <span class="SpellE"><u>Pascual</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span></u>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> it was ruled </span>hat although heirs have
no legal standing in court upon the commencement of testate or intestate
proceedings, this rule admits of an exception as "when the administra<span style="">tor fails or <span class="GramE">refuses</span>
to act, in which event the heirs </span>may act in his place."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A similar situation
obtains in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
administrator is being charged to have been in col­lusion and connivance with
the mortgagees of a property of the deceased, allowing its foreclosure without
notifying the heirs, to the prejudice of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the ground for the present action to
annul the aforesaid foreclosure proceedings is the fraud resulting from such
insidious machinations and collusion in which the admi­nistrator has allegedly
participated, it would be farfet</span>ched to expect the said administrator
himself to file the action in behalf of the estate. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>And who else but the heirs, who have an
interest to assert and to pro­tect, would bring the action?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inevitably, this case should fall under the
exception, rather than the general rule that pending proceedings for the
settlement of the estate, the heirs have no right to commence an action arising
out of the rights belonging to the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the second point
raised, <span class="GramE">We</span> fully agree with the plaintiffs-appellants
that the lower court had gone too far in practically adjudicating the case on
the merits when it made the observation that "there could n</span><span style="">ot </span><span style="">have been any connivance and/or collusion between p</span>laintiffs in
this case and <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Diawan</span>
as administrator." A thorough scrutiny of the allegations in the motions
to dismiss filed by defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> does not
indicate that that question was ever put at issue <span style="">therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">On the other hand, the controversy – on the
existence or </span><span style="">inexistence of
collusion between the </span><span style="">parties </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">a result of which judgment was rendered against the estate - is the </span><span style="">very core of the complaint that was
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Undoubtedly, the </span><span style="">cause </span><span style="">of action is based on Section 30, Rule 132 of the Rules of </span><span style="">Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We are not, however, in
accord with the third assigned error – the denial of the motion </span><span style="">for the issuance of preliminary injunction –
for it puts at issue </span><span style="">the factual
finding made by</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the lower court that the defendants </span><span style="">h</span><span style="">ad
already been placed in possession o</span><span style="">f
the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this stage of the
proceeding, and considering the </span><span style="">nature
of the </span><span style="">case before <span class="GramE">Us</span>, </span><span style="">such a </span><span style="">question is, at this time, beyond the
competence of the Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">PREMISES CONSIDERED</span></b><span class="GramE"><span style="">,</span></span><span style=""> the order appealed from is hereby set aside </span><span style="">insofar as </span><span style="">it dismissed the complaint in Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">SC-319,</span>
and the records be remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
