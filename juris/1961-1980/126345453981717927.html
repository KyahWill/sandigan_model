				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner,
</span>Philippine Iron Mines, Inc<span class="GramE">.,</span> seeks the review
by certiorari of a decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main facts are not disputed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While in the performance of his duties as petitioner's employee, since
1934, herein respondent Tomas <span class="SpellE">Abear</span> met an accident
in 1936, in consequence of which his <span style="">left </span>leg was then amputated below the knee,
and he received from <span class="GramE">petitioner</span>, by way of
compensation benefits <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, the sum of P600.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">About one year later, <span class="SpellE">Abear</span> returned to
work as bolt <span class="SpellE">threader</span> in petitioner's shop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Owing to the loss of his left foot, <span class="SpellE">Abear</span> was then using a home made metal walking
caliper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1957" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1957</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="7">7:00 a.m.</st1:time>, while getting the <span class="SpellE">threader</span>
out of the repair shop, <span class="SpellE">Abear</span> slipped and fell on the
cement floor of petitioner's bodega, thereby causing the stump of his
previously amputated foot to <span style="">bleed </span>profusely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of this, on <st1:date year="1957" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1957</st1:date>, a surgeon had to operate on <span class="SpellE">Abear's</span> leg stump and amputated his left leg, above the
knee.</p>

<p class="BODY">Soon thereafter, he reported back to work as re-<span class="SpellE">threader</span> of bolts, performing comparatively light work,
but, on <st1:date year="1961" day="30" month="11">November 30, 1961</st1:date>,
he was laid off due to petitioner's retrenchment policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="8">August
 20, 1962</st1:date>, a physician of the Workmen's Compensation Commission
found him to be suffering from a 100% permanent partial disability of the left
leg.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon a claim for compensation,
based on the loss of his left leg, above the knee, <span class="SpellE">Abear</span>
secured a decision of an Associate Commissioner of the Workmen's Compensation
Commission, which was affirmed by the Commission, granting him the full
compensation provided by law for said loss.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence, this appeal by
petitioner, who maintains: </span>(1) <span style="">that
<span class="SpellE">Abear's</span> claim is barred by the statute of limitations
of action; and (2) that, having been awarded and paid compensation in 1936, for
the disability resulting from the amputation of the left leg, below the knee,
the amount of such compensation should be deducted from the sum collectible for
the amputation of the left leg, above the knee, in 1957.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's claim of prescription is based upon the fact that,
although the last acci­dent took place on <st1:date year="1957" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1957</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Abear's</span> claim
for compensation <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> was not filed until <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This defense cannot be entertained, petitioner
having failed to set it up in the Workmen's Compensation Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well-settled that the benefits of the
statute of limitations of action cannot be invoked for the first time on
appeal, the defense being deemed waived if not seasonably <span style="">pleaded in the lower court.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Moreover, although </span>aware of the
accident that befell <span class="SpellE">Abear</span> on <st1:date year="1957" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1957</st1:date> - he having been confined in
petitioner's hospital from said date to <st1:date year="1957" day="25" month="2">February
 25, 1957</st1:date> - petitioner did not report it to the Workmen's
Compensation Commission within 14 days from the date of the disability or with<span style="">in </span>10 days
after it had knowledge of the accident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, said report was not submitted until after the filing of <span class="SpellE">Abear's</span> claim, or on <st1:date year="1962" day="9" month="8">August
 9, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to Section
45 of Act No. 3428, as amended, peti­tioner is deemed to have <i style="">"renounced the right to
controvert"</i><span style=""> </span>the claim.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As regards the question </span>whether
<span style="">the compensation paid by petitioner in
1936, on account of the amputation of <span class="SpellE">Abear's</span> left
foot, </span><i style="">below</i><span style=""> </span><span style="">the knee, should </span>be deducted from the compensation due for the
disability resulting from the amputation of the left <i style="">leg</i><span style="">, </span><i style="">above</i><span style=""> </span>the knee, in 1957, it is well settled that no such deduction
can be made, unless the law so provides, and there is no such provision in our
laws.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>

the employee, who had lost three fingers of his left hand, nineteen years
before he entered the service of the employer involved in the case, lost his
left hand in an industrial accident while performing his duties as the latter's
employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He sought to recover for the
loss of the hand, but the employer contended that the value of the three
fingers, previously lost, should be deducted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After declaring that the apportionment statute clearly prohibited the
deduction, the Tennessee Supreme Court further declared that <i style="">inde­pendently</i><span style=""> </span><i style="">of</i><span style=""> </span><i style="">such</i><span style=""> </span><i style="">provision</i><span style=""> </span>the weight of authority is against
said deduction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It continued:</p>

<blockquote>"In Industrial Commission v. State Ins. Compensation <span style="">Fund, </span>71 <span class="SpellE">Colo</span>
109, 203 Pac. 216, the court said: 'The remaining question is whether claimant
became totally . . . blind by the accident at the Camp Bird mine when, as
matter of fact, he was practically sightless in the right eye prior to such
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in our
compensation statute requiring employees to be physically perfect in order to
come within its provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Claimant,
for practical purposes, was blind in one eye when he <span style="">entered </span>the service of the Camp Bird Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i style=""><span style="">This, however, did not prevent him from doing
the work which he was employed to</span></i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">His </span><i style=""><span style="">wages were the same</span></i><span style=""> as </span>his
fellow employees with perfect vision; the Camp Bird Company paid the same
compensation insurance premium for him as for workmen with normal sight; no
penalty whatsoever attached to him because he was practically sightless in one
eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he lost the sight of his remaining
eye in an accident arising out of and <span style="">in </span>the course of his employment, <span style="">we </span>are of opinion that he became
totally and permanently disabled within the meaning of our Compensation
Act.'"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In Schwab v. Emporium Forestry Co. 216 N.Y. 712, 111 N.E.
1099, an award for total disability was affirmed under the following facts,
stated in the opinion, to wit: 'The claimant suffered an injury on July 6,
1914, while in the employ of the Emporium Forestry Company, the injury resulting
in the loss of his right hand at the wrist.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Many years before, in some way not disclosed by the record, the claimant
had lost his left hand, not, however, while engaged in the same employment, nor
while working for the said Emporium Forestry Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question at issue was:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"'Shall the claimant be awarded as for
total permanent disability, <span style="">as </span><span style="">provided </span>in subdivision 1 of § 15 of
the Workmen's Compensation Law, or for permanent partial disability for a
period of 244 weeks, as provided <span style="">in </span>subdivision 3 of said § 15?'"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In <span class="SpellE">Branconnier's</span> Case, 223 Mass.
273, 111 N. E. 792, the court, speaking through Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Rugg</span>, said:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The employee, a man who in 1910 had lost one eye, met with an
injury in 1915 arising out of and in the course of his employment for a subscriber
under the Workmen's Compensation Act, whereby he lost the sight of his
remaining eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question presented is
whether there was error in refusing to rule as matter of law that the total
incapacity of the employee could not be attributed to the injury of 1915,
because made up in part of the result of a previous accident.</p>

<p class="2Q">'The denial of this request was right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The employee, when he entered the service of
the subscriber, had that degree of capacity which enabled him to do the work for
which he was hired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was his
capacity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was an impaired capacity as
compared with the normal capacity of a healthy man in the possession of all his
faculties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But nevertheless it was the
employee's capacity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It enabled him to
earn the wages which he received.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
became an "'employee" under the act and thereby entitled to all the
benefits conferred upon those coming within that description.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The act affords a fixed compensation for a
limited time, "'while incapacity for work, resulting from the injury is
total.'" <span class="GramE">Stat. 1911, chap. 751, pt. 2, § 9.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It establishes no other standard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i style="">It
fixes no method for dividing the effect of the injury and attributing a part </i><i style=""><span style="">of </span>it
to the employment and another part to some </i><i style=""><span style="">pre-existing </span>condition,
and gives no </i><i style=""><span style="">indication that the legislature </span>intended any such division</i><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">The total capacity of this employee was not
<span class="GramE">so</span> great as it would have been if he had had two sound
eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His total capacity was thus only
part of that of the normal man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But that
capacity, which was all he had, has been transformed into a total incapacity by
reason of the injury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That result has
come to him entirely through the injury.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In principle this case is concluded by the reasoning and the decision of
<span class="SpellE">Madden's</span> Case, 222 Mass. 487, L. R.<span style="">A., 1916D, 1000, 111 N.E. 379, where the
subject of <span class="GramE">pre-existing</span> infirmities of the employee,
as bearing upon the right and extent of compensation under the act, was discussed,

not render its loss any less complete</i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As <span style="">the result of his injury he has totally lost the use of the hand which
he pre</span>viously had, and under the <span style="">statute
he is entitled to compensation for that loss.<span style="">&nbsp;

language of the law is such as to give us no discretion in the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to Section 17 of Act No. 3428, as

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It may not be amiss to
add that, to offset the undue hardship or injustice that may, at times, be
caused to the employer, in consequence of the strict or literal interpretation

deduction of the compensation formerly paid, otherwise known </span><span style="">as </span><i style="">"apportionment </i><i style=""><span style="">statute."</span></i><span style=""> In either case, courts of justice are
