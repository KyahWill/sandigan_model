				<H3>ARSENIO L. CANLAS AND ADENA GONZALES-CANLAS, PETITIONERS, VS. THE JUDGE OP THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OP TARLAC AND JAIME TAYAG, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This is an original petition for, certiorari filed by the spouses Arsenio L. 
Canlas and Adena Gonzales-Canlas, questioning the order of the Court of First 
Instance of Tarlac in Civil Case No. 3512 of said court, dated October 14, 1961, 
dissolving the writ of preliminary injunction issued therein, on the ground that 
the aforesaid order runs counter to the judgment already rendered by this Court 
In 6. R. No. L-16815, entitled Arsenio L. Canlas, et al. vs. Hon. Bernabe de 
Aquino, etc., et al. promulgated on July 24, 1961. </p>
<p>Civil Case No. 3512 was instituted by the spouses Canlas to enjoin Jaime 
Tayag from constructing and operating h rice mill in front of their clinic and 
private hospital, and pursuant to their prayer, the then presiding Judge Zoilo 
Hilario of the Court of First Instance of Tarlac, granted and issued a writ of 
preliminary injunction. Subsequently, however, respondent Tayag, petitioned for 
the dissolution of the injunction order. Judge Bernabe de Aquino who later took 
cognizance of the case, granted the petition and dissolved the preliminary 
injunction. Their motion for reconsideration of the aforesaid dissolution order, 
having been denied, the spouses Canlas come to this Court (in G. R. No. L-16815) 
and obtained a judgment on July 24, 1961, in effect reinstating the preliminary 
injunction previously issued by the lower court against the construction of 
Tayag's rice mill, on the ground that Tayag's petition (for dissolution of the 
writ of preliminary injunction) was not verified and that the same was granted 
by the lower court without hearing and based only on information that the rice 
mill to be constructed would not constitute a nuisance to the neighborhood. : 
</p>
<p>At the continuation of the proceedings in the lower court as a result of our 
decision, Tayag filed an alternative petition again asking for the lifting of 
the writ of preliminary injunction. Considering the grounds given therein as 
well as the affidavits attached thereto, the said Petition was granted by order 
of the court of October 14, 1961, and the writ of preliminary injunction was 
again order dissolved. The spouses Canlas came again to this court and brought 
the instant petition for certiorari seeking the annulment of the aforesaid order 
and the maintenance of the writ of preliminary injunction issued, there- in, and 
reaffirmed by our decision in the first certiorari proceedings, contending that 
to again lift the original preliminary injunction before the final disposition 
of the case on the merits would be contrary to the decision of the Supreme Court 
and would amount to prejudging the case. As prayed for by petitioners, and upon 
their filing of the required bond, 1ms Court issued a writ of preliminary 
injunction in this case, enjoining the lower court from enforcing its order of 
October 14, 1961. </p>
<p>On October 22, 1964, respondent Jaime Tayag filed a petition to lift the 
preliminary injunction issued herein, for the reason that the lower court has 
already rendered a final decision en the merits in the main case, dismissing the 
original petition filed therein and dissolving the writ of preliminary 
injunction issued in said action. Asked to comment on this motion, petitioner 
Canlas objected alleging that the decision rendered in the main case has been 
appealed by them to the Court of Appeals and that the lower court had no 
authority to dissolve the preliminary injunction issued by this court at the 
inception of this certiorari proceedings. </p>
<p>There seems to be a misconception of the import of (1) the decision of this 
Court in G. R. No. L-15815 (supra) which annulled trio first order of the lower 
court dated February 4, 1960, lifting the writ of preliminary injunction 
previously issued by it, and (2) the writ of preliminary injunction issued by 
this Court in this present case dated February 11, 1963. </p>
<p>As has been stated earlier, our decision in case G. RÂ« No. Lr-16815, merely 
annulled the lower court's lust order of dissolution because the petition to 
that effect was not in proper form and the circumstances then prevailing did not 
justify such dissolution. This Court, in setting aside the order of dissolution, 
stated that: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Indeed, the main action was filed by petitioners herein for the purpose of 
enjoining and prohibiting Tayag from constructing a ricemill, so that, upon the 
conrtruction thereof, said action would become futile. Besides, the intention of 
respondent Judge to prohibit the continuance of the operation of said ricemill, 
Should it later be found to be a nuisance, is not sufficient to offset the harm 
already done to the operation of the hospital, specially the injury suffered by 
the patients therein and the public in general, which are hardly susceptible of 
estimation or compensation, Needless to say, by permitting Tayag to construct 
his building, and purchase and install the machinery for the operation of the 
ricemill respondent Judge exposed him to much greater damage than that which 
could possibly have resulted had the writ of preliminary injunction been 
maintained until the final disposition of the case."</p>
<p>"In effect, therefore, it was thought best that the preliminary injunction 
originally issued should remain in force only until the main case has been 
finally heard and decision therein rendered on the merits. </p></blockquote>
<p>However, as also already mentioned above, after the promulgation of our 
decision in G. R. No. L-16815, respondent Tayag renewed his petition in the 
lower court for the lifting of the same original injunction reinstated by us in 
said case G.R. No. L-16815. Acting upon said petition, and in view of the 
rectification of the former defects and the affidavits attached to the new 
petition, the lower court on October 14, 1961, ordered the dissolution of the 
order of preliminary injunction. The herein petitioners, contending that this 
last order of the lower court was contrary to our decision in G. R. No. L-1G815 
and that the said dissolution constituted a prejudgment of the case on the 
merits, again came up here and filed the present petition for certiorari asking 
for the setting aside of this second order of dissolution. And, acting upon the 
prayer in the petition, we issued a writ of preliminary injunction on joining 
the enforcement of the second order of dissolution dated October 14, 1961. It is 
this case for certiorari which is now before us and which has already been 
submitted for decision on the merits. </p>
<p>However, in view of the decision on the merits now rendered by the Court of 
First Instance in Civil Case No. 3512, dismissing the petition and consequently 
the preliminary injunction originally issued therein, the maintenance of which 
was ordered by this Court only pending the trial and final disposition of the 
main case, it is clear that the writ of preliminary injunction issued by this 
Court on February 11, 1963 has become <i>functus oficio</i> as the purpose 
thereof has already been attained. And this being the case, the issue before us 
in the present certiorari proceeding has become academic. </p>
<p>In view thereof, the writ of preliminary injunction issued herein is hereby 
dissolved and the case dismissed, for being moot. No. costs. So ordered. </p>

and <i>Zaldivar, J.J.</i> concur. </p>
