				<BR><BR><div align=""><div class="Section1"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On June 17, 1963, the P &amp; B 
Enterprises Co., Inc. filed a complaint before the Court of First Instance of 
Manila for injunction and damages against Vicente de Lara, Jr. and the Bureau of 
Forestry. It was alleged that Vicente de Lara, Jr. was granted on August 5, 1957 
a timber license to log over an area of about 300 hectares in <span class="SpellE">Claveria</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental, for 
which he was authorized to annually about 600 cubic meters of timber. Although 
Lara failed to undertake any operation in the area covered by his license, he 
was, however, able to secure its renewal from year to year up to 1961, while his 
latest renewal for 1962 was rejected by the Bureau of 
Forestry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">During De Lara's period of 
non-renewal of his timber License, the application for a similar forest 
concession filed by P &amp; B Enterprises Co., Inc. was processed, the same 
having been finally approved on September 25, 1961 over a forest area of 
approximately 25,000 hectares also situated in <span class="SpellE">Claveria</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental. 
Immediately after the granting of its timber license, the company procured heavy 
equipment and introduced substantial improvements thereon consisting of access 
road, base camps, fuel facilities and the like, in compliance with the rules and 
regulations of the Bureau of Forestry. Likewise, by virtue of the authority 
granted by said Bureau to construct logging roads within the forest area covered 
by the license, the company commenced in December, 1961 the construction of a 
logging road of approximately 7 kilometers in length which extended not only 
along the plaintiffs concession but partially within the area covered by the 
latter's timber concession, which project cost the company approximately 
P139<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the meantime, De Lara's 
petition for renewal of his license for 1963 was approved, which, as amended, 
included a portion of the forest concession area originally granted to P &amp; B 
Enterprises Co., Inc., whereupon the latter protested against such approval 
insofar as the portion of the area in conflict is concerned, but the protest was 
overruled. Hence, the company appealed the Director of Forestry's decision to 
the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, but until now the appeal 
remains pending study and consideration by said official. Despite its protest 
and its appeal as above stated, however, De Lara, aided by his men as well as by 
Acting Governor <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> G. Rodriguez of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental, continued his logging operation even if, 
in doing so, he trespassed upon and used the road constructed by the company in 
the transportation of his logs cut within the contested area. The protest of the 
company against such act and usurpation was at first heeded by the Director of 
the Bureau of Forestry by prohibiting De Lara to use the road constructed by the 
company, but the same was later countermanded, thus prompting the company to 
appeal to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, who on June 7, 
1963 issued an order prohibiting De Lara from entering and operating within the 
contested area until after the conflict existing between the two loggers shall 
have been finally decided However, since despite this order De Lara continued to 
operate and cut logs within the contested area to the great damage and prejudice 
of the company, the latter comment the present action as stated in the early 
part of this decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">According to plaintiff's request, 
respondent court issued <i>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> </i>the writ of 
preliminary injunction prayed for enjoining Vicente De Lara and his aids from 
cutting, hauling, shipping and exporting logs from the forest area covered by 
the timber license issued in plaintiff's favor. De Lara filed a motion to 
dismiss as well as to dissolve the injunction alleging, among other grounds, 
that the complaint fails to state a cause of action in that plaintiff has failed 
to exhaust its administrative remedies it appearing that the appeal taken to the 
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources regarding the conflict in the 
fogging area of the litigants was still pending determination by said official. 
But respondent court denied both the motion to dismiss as well as the 
dissolution of the writ of preliminary injunction. As a consequence, defendant 
De Lara interposed the present petition for certiorari with a request for the 
issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction in order to maintain the <i>status 
quo</i> of the logging operation of the parties prior to the institution of the 
instant case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This petition was given due 
course, and upon posting a bond of P5.000.00, this Court issued the injunction 
prayed for.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Respondents, in their answer, 
admitted the issuance by respondent court of an <i>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></i> writ of injunction restraining petitioner De Lara 
from cutting, hauling, shipping and exporting logs from the contested forest 
area and from transporting his logs along the road constructed by respondent 
company exclusively for its use, but they averred that such injunction was 
necessary to prevent bodily injury and violence to the employees of respondent 
company in view of De Lara's threat to appropriate and utilize the private 
logging road constructed by said company through the use of force and political 
influence and in open defiance of an order of the Secretary of Agriculture and 
Natural Resources not to do so until the conflict existing between the two 
loggers shall have been finally decided. They prayed that the petition be 
dismissed and the writ issued dissolved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The issue now to be resolved is: 
Has respondent court committed a grave abuse of discretion in issuing) ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> the writ of preliminary injunction prayed for by 
respondent company?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It should be recalled that one of 
the grounds invoked by petitioner De Lara before respondent court in his motion 
to dismiss the complaint filed by respondent company is that the latter has 
failed to exhaust all its administrative remedies in that it filed said 
complaint before the appeal taken from the order of the Director of Forestry 
allowing De Lara to use the logging road constructed within the contested forest 
area could be finally acted upon by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural 
Resources, thereby implying that such action was premature.<span class="style11"><sup>[1]</sup></span> But this motion was denied excepting only 
insofar as it affects the logs already cut by De Lara on the uncontested area 
whose transportation was allowed to pass through the logging road constructed by 
the company.' And now it is contended that such denial constitutes a grave abuse 
of discretion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">While as a rule a petition for 
certiorari which is interposed to dispute the validity of an order or decision 
that may be rendered by an administrative official in pursuance of the powers 
and duties with which he is invested cannot be entertained if the party in 
interest fails to avail of the administrative remedies that the law affords to 
him under a particular situation upon the theory that administrative officials 
are the most competent to pass upon matters the exclusively come within their 
jurisdiction, such rule maybe relaxed when its application may cause great and 
irreparable damage which cannot otherwise be prevented except by taking the 
opportune appropriate court action. Stated otherwise, the rule is inapplicable 
if it should appear that an irreparable damage and injury will be suffered by a 
party if he should <span class="GramE">await</span>, before taking court action, 
the final action of the administrative official concerned on the matter. This is 
the situation herein obtained. Because of the conflict existing between 
petitioner and respondent company regarding a portion of the logging area 
awarded to them, as well as the use of the logging road constructed by the 
company, the case was taken to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural 
Resources for his final resolution, who in the meantime directed petitioner "to 
refrain from entering and operating within the contested area until the said 
case shall have been finally decided,” but before such resolution could come De 
Lara disregarded the directive and continued operating within the contested area 
to the irreparable damage and injury of the company. This act of defiance 
prompted the company to take the needed appropriate action. In the 
circumstances, we find the action taken by respondent court proper and justified 
even if no final decision has as yet been rendered by the Secretary of 
Agriculture and Natural Resources. Respondent court did nothing but to maintain 
and put into effect the directive issued by said official. Indeed, before the 
protest lodged by the company could be decided regarding the conflicting 
interests it is best that the<i> status quo</i> be maintained as was done by 
respondent court. We on this matter no abuse of 
discretion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: Verdana;">Wherefore</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, petition is dismissed with 
costs against petitioner Vicente De Lara, Jr. The injunction issued by the Court 
is hereby dissolved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
