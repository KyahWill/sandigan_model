<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner Allied
Workers' Association </span>of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(National Chapter) asked to be declared the winner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It contended that the challenged votes cast
by security guards and supervisors should be declared illegal and, to­gether
with the spoiled ballots, should be deducted from the total number of votes
cast for the purpose of determin­ing the majority.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its order of <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="10">October
 1, 1963</st1:date>, the Court <span style="">of
Industrial Relations denied </span>petitioner's motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The minimum majority necessary to elect a
union, it was held, was 679, because "the <span style="">basis </span>for the majority in this jurisdiction <span style="">is the total votes cast, not the valid votes
alone."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This ruling was
subsequently </span>affirmed in the resolution of <st1:date year="1964" day="16" month="1">Jan­uary 16, 1964</st1:date> of the Court of Industrial Relations <u>in</u>
<u>banc</u>, denying reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner appealed to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent portion of section 12 of the Industrial Peace Act,
Republic Act No. 875, reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Exclusive Collective Bargaining <span style="">Representative </span>for Labor
Organizations.</span> -</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(a) The labor
organization designated or selected for the purpose of collective bargaining by
<u>the majority of the employees</u> in an ap­propriate collective bargaining
unit shall be the exclusive representative of all the employees in such unit
for the purpose of collective bar­gaining in respect to rates of pay, wages,
hours of employment, or other conditions of employment:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, That any individual employee
or group of employees shall have the right at any time to present grievances to
their employer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b) Whenever a
question arises concern­ing the representation of employees, the Court may
investigate such controversy and certify to the parties in writing the name of
the labor organization that has been designated or se­lected for the
appropriate bargaining unit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any such
investigation, the Court shall provide for a speedy and appropriate hearing
upon due notice and if there is any reasonable doubt as to whom the employees
have chosen as their representative for purposes of collective bargaining, the
Court shall order a secret ballot election to be conducted by the Department of
Labor, to ascertain who is the freely chosen re­presentative of the employees,
under such rules and regulations as the Court may prescribe, at which balloting
representatives of the contend­ing parties shall have the right to attend as
inspectors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a balloting shall be
known as a 'certification election' and the Court shall not order certification
in the same unit more often than once in twelve months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The organiza­tion receiving the majority
of votes cast in such election shall be bargaining representative of such
employees</u>."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Emphasis added)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It will be noted that while subsection (a) speaks of the labor
organization "designated or selected x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> by the majority of the employees," subsection (b)
speaks of the organization "receiving the majority of the votes cast <span style="">in such
election." Is there a difference in meaning be­tween these phrases?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inquiry is important because, <span style="">as </span>will be shown, the pursuit of this
inquiry can yield the answer to the question posed by this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the United States, section 2, Fourth, of the Rail­way Labor
Act of May 20, 1926, 45 U.S.C.A. s151, provid­ing that "The majority of
any craft or class of employees shall have <span style="">a </span>right to determine who shall be the repres­entative of the <span style="">craft or </span>class" was construed by
the Federal Supreme Court <span style="">as </span>requiring
only <span style="">a </span>majority of the votes
cast although such <span style="">a majority may </span>be
less than a majority of the entire membership.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Virginian <span class="SpellE">Ry</span>. Co. System Federation No. 40,
300 U.S. 515, 81 L. Ed. 789 [1937])<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
reason for this is that those who do not participate are presumed to assent to
the expressed will of the majority of those voting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was explained that "If, in addition
to participation by <span style="">a majority </span>of <span style="">a </span>craft, a vote of the majority of those eligible is necessary
for a choice, an indifferent minority could prevent the resolution of <span style="">a contest, </span>and
thwart the purpose of the Act, which is dependent for its operation up­on on
the selection of representatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is the added danger that the absence of eligible voters <span style="">may </span>be due less to their indifference
than to coercion by the employer."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus the political principle of majority rule was applied to
representation elections.</p>

<p class="BODY">This rule <span style="">was </span>applied by the Circuit Court of Appeals even to a case where
those participating in the election were far less than <span style="">a majority </span>of the number of eligible
voters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<u>See</u>, <u>e</u>.<u>g</u>.,
New York Handkerchief Mfg. Co. v. NLRB, 144 F. <span style="">2d </span>144 [1940]; NLRB v. Deutsch Co., 265 F. 2d 473 [1959];
Semi-Steel Casting Co. of St. Louis v. NLRB, 160 <span style="">F. </span>2d 388 [1947]) In the <u><span style="">Handkerchief</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">case, </span>for instance, out of 225 eligible
voters only 56 voted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">was held that since the union received 53 of
the votes cast, the certification was proper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is important to note that the provision construed <span style="">in <u>Handkerchief</u>,
</span><u><span style="">Deutsch</span></u><span style=""> </span>and <u><span style="">Semi-Steel Casting</span></u><span style=""> </span>was
Section 9(a) of the National Labor Relations Act (Wagner Act) 29 U.S.C.A. §
141, from which 12(a) of our statute was copied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In similar language, the American statute
provides that "Representatives designated or selected x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> by the majority of the
employees" in an appropriate unit shall be the <span style="">exclusive collective </span>bargaining
representatives of all em­ployees in such unit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, section 12(a) of the local statute must be deemed to have
the same meaning when it speaks of the labor organization "designated or
se­lected <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>by the majority of the
employees."</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, by using different language in section 12(b), did Congress
intend <span style="">a </span>different
meaning and, perforce, <span style="">a </span>different rule in this jurisdiction?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quite the contrary, <span style="">we </span>think.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will help analysis to recall in this
connec­tion that, in the early administration of the National Labor Relations
Act, the issue was "whether the choice at such election shall be by a
majority of the qualified voters, or merely by a <u><span style="">majority of the </span>votes cast</u>."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Virginian <span class="SpellE">Ry</span>. Co. v.
System Federation No. 40, 84 F. 2d 641, 653 [1936], <span class="SpellE"><u>aff'd</u></span>,
300 U.S. 515 [1937]) It will thus be seen that the resolution of the i<span style="">ssue </span>in
favor of the second choice (<u>i</u>.<u>e</u>., the majority of the votes cast)
did not foreclose the question which is now raised in this case, namely,
whether "the majority of the votes cast" means all votes cast,
including invalid and spoiled votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
inserting, then, in section 12(b) the phrase "the majority of the votes cast,"
Congress intended no more than to adopt the political principle of the major­ity
rule, aware <span style="">as </span>it must have
been of the controversy to which <span style="">the </span>phrase
"majority of employees" in section 12(a) has given rise in the United
States.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the language of section 12(b)
it was never intended to authorize the counting of invalid votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They should be excluded and only the number
of valid votes cast should be made the basis in determining the majority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Semi-Steel Cast­ing Co. of St. Louis v.
NLRB, <u>supra</u>; American Tobacco, 10 NLRB 1171 [<span style="">1939]; </span><span class="SpellE">Sorg</span> Paper Co., 9 NLRB 136
[1938]) As Professors Cox and <span class="SpellE">Bok</span> state the rule,
"It is enough that the union be designated by a majority of the <u>valid</u>
ballots, and this is so even though only <span style="">a
</span>small propor­tion of the eligible voters <span class="GramE">participates</span>."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Labor Law 382 [5th ed., <span style="">1962]) A </span>contrary rule, such <span style="">as </span>that announced by the Court of
Industrial Relations, would make it easy for <span style="">a </span>union to go on challenging voters known to be sympathetic to
its rival, knowing that the votes thus chal­lenged would not be examined even <span style="">as </span>their number would be counted in
determining the majority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An <span style="">easier </span>way of frustrating the results
of the elections would not be imagined.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, spoiled ballots, <u>i</u>.<u>e</u>., those which are
defaced, torn or marked (Rules for Certification Elections, Rule <span style="">II, sec. </span>2[j]) should be counted in
determining the majority since they are nevertheless votes cast by those who
are qualified to do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the 39 spoiled votes in this case should be counted
while the 113 challenged votes, because they are likely to affect the result of
the election (Rules for Certification Elections, Rule II, sec. <span style="">2[k].<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><u>See</u>
<span class="SpellE">Overnite</span> Transportation Co. v. NLRB, 48 CCH Lab. L.
Rep. 18, 687 [1963]) should have been examined as to the grounds of
objection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those found to have been cast
by voters who were in­eligible because they were either supervisory or
confidential employees, <span style="">should </span>have
been rejected and excluded from the count, while those found to have been cast
by eligible employees should have been opened and counted in favor of the union
for which they were cast.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">WHEREFORE</b><span style="">, </span>the order of October 1, 1963 and the
resolution of January 16, 1964 are hereby reversed and the case is remanded to
the Court of Industrial Relations for determination of the results of the
election in accordance with this decisi<span style="">on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>No costs.</p>
