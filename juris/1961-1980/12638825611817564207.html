				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Court acting upon respondent People's recommendation modifies
the penalty imposed by the Court of Appeals on petitioner-accused for the crime
of slight oral defamation by removing the 11-day prison term and in lieu
thereof imposing a P<span style="">20</span>0. - <span class="GramE">fine</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals in its judgment under review found petitioner-accused
guilty of the crime of slight oral defamation, she having uttered insulting
words against complainant Atty. Pedro T. Garcia in his office "in the heat
of anger with some provocation <span style="">on </span>the
part of the offended party"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and reduced the penalty imposed by the trial court for grave oral defamation
(one month and one day of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span><u> mayor</u>
as minimum to four months and one day of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span><u>
mayor</u> as maximum with P1,500.00 as moral and/or consequential damages
without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency) to <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">menor</span></u> in its medium period or eleven (11) <span style="">days of imprisonment with P500.00 as damages
without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency on the basis of its
findings, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The
admitted antecedents of the incident in question and the subjective considerations
involved all tend credence to the truth of the charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Garcia was then in his law office
preparing for the trial of a case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appellant, accompanied by her daughter, arrived in said office to demand that
Atty. Garcia give to her the sum of P150.00 which Atty. Garcia received from <span class="SpellE">Araceli</span> <span class="SpellE">Escudero</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant was then in desperate need of
money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She could not possibly understand
why, although she was the agent who negotiated the sale of the properties of
the Ando family to <span class="SpellE">Virgilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gamboa</span>
from which she expected a commission of P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>,
Atty. Garcia would be paid ahead, even partially.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant had not yet received a centavo
of her expected com<span style="">mission, and she
suspected that Atty. Garcia advised <span class="SpellE">Araceli</span> <span class="SpellE">Escudero</span> not to pay the appellant her commission until the
transaction shall have been finally consummated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Claiming that the said sum was paid to him by
way of attorney's fees, Atty. Garcia naturally denied the demand of the
appellant for the delivery to her of the sum of P150.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not denied that appellant's temper is
easily aroused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was aggravated by the
admitted remark of Atty. Garcia, which he claimed to have been jokingly made
but was evidently taken in a different light by the appellant, that the latter
was evading the payment of the proper taxes due from her as a real estate
broker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances,
although the words shown to have been uttered by the appellant are indeed
insulting in nature, the crime committed by the appellant is only that of
slight oral defamation, they having been uttered in the heat of anger with some
provocation on the part of the offended party (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Doronila</span>,
[C. A.] 40 O.G. <span class="SpellE">Suppl</span>. 1, p. 231; People vs.
Dominguez, [C.A.] 51 O.G. 2983).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
agree with the Solicitor General that no mitigating circumstance attended the
commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proper
penalty should accordingly be in the me­dium period of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">menor</span></u> or eleven (11) days of imprisonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We also reduce the indemnity to P500.00.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The factual findings of the appellate court as supported by the
evidence of record are beyond review by this Court, but the Court issued its
Resolution of June 6, 1977 requiring the Solicitor General on behalf of
respondent People "to comment as to the proper penalty (fine instead of
imprisonment) imposable on petitioner after considering all the circumstances
and antecedents of the case as stated in the Court of Appeals' decision x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." In compliance
therewith, respondent thru Acting Solicitor General Vicente V. Mendoza filed
the comment of June 29, 1977, wherein it is manifested that while the penalty
imposed was "legally correct" and within the range of the penalty
provided by law<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>,
<u>"Petitioner's Age, Sex and Status Pre-dispose Towards Leniency</u> -
The petitioner is a woman who, in 1969 or thereabouts, appeared to have been 58
years old and a widow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Today, 8 years
later, petitioner must be above 65 years of age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the respondent Court of Appeals legally
imposed imprisonment of 11 days upon the petitioner, it could have legally
imposed a fine not exceeding P200.00, instead of imprisonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the age, sex and status of the
petitioner as a widow, and considering as well, the other circumstances recited
in the above-quoted decision of the respondent Court, the undersigned counsel
would have no objection to the imposition upon the petitioner of a fine not
exceeding P200.00 instead of 11 days of imprisonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This imposition of a fine would serve the
ends of justice as well as the imposition of imprisonment in the instant
case." Respondent People therefore submitted "that a fine not
exceeding P200.00 may be legally imposed upon the petitioner instead of the 11
days imprisonment meted out on her by the respondent Court of Appeals."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court accepts the Solicitor General's recommendation of
leniency and will eliminate the prison term and instead impose the lesser
penalty of a P200. - <span class="GramE">fine</span> within the range of the
penalty provided by law, with the P500. - <span class="GramE">damages</span>
awarded by the appellate court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court further expresses the hope that petitioner may have mellowed with the
passing of the years and learned better to hold her temper in check and stay
out of trouble.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the Court modifies the penalty imposed in the
judgment under review and sentences petitioner-accused to pay a fine of Two
hundred pesos (P200.00), to indemnify the offended party in the amount of P500.00
as damages without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay
the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
