<blockquote>"Norman Lacson, Jimmy Pitalio, Carlos Tan and Enrique Masacote
were neighbors in General Tiburcio de Leon, Valenzuela, Bula­can.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about noon on January 23, 1972, Carlos Tan
invited Masacote and Pitalio to the birthday party of his son in their
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While they were eating and
drinking <span style="">in </span>the yard, Tan told
Pitalio that the laborers of Lacson were leaving <span style="">their </span>work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tan also
asked Pitalio to find out whether the latter could get the balance of his
unpaid wages from Lacson.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pitalio went
to Lacson's residence, kicked open the gate of ap<span style="">pellant's residence, and forced his way inside the yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant and his wife had just arrived and
were alighting from their car when Pitalio, under the influence of liquor,
confronted Mrs. Lacson and asked her to produce their truck driver named Sera­fica,
saying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Pag hindi mo siya hina­rap sa
akin ay may mangyayari.' Ap­pellant remonstrated with Pitalio </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">abide by the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This enraged
Pitalio who replied:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Ano ang batas, ito
ang batas!' Taking the Magnum .22 caliber pistol of his wife from her handbag,
the appellant then fired it once at Pitalio's chest."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thereafter Mrs. Lacson brought Pitalio to the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There Pitalio's gunshot wound was treated and
operated <span style="">on </span>(Exhibit 'A').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pitalio's confine<span style="">ment in the Jose R. Reyes Memorial Hos</span>pital lasted from January
23 to February 2, 1972.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The medical
certificate issued unto him stated that his injury would incapacitate him for
more than thirty (30) days."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In its analysis of the
evidence for the prosecution and for the defense, the trial court found that:</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Jimmy Pitalio, on the witness stand, admitted that at the
time of the incident he had drunk beer in the house of Carlos Tan but denied
being drunk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court believes,
however, that at the time he was under the in­fluence of liquor so much so that
although he knew that the balance of his salary which was a measly P1.00 in amount
was due to him from the driver, he pressed Mrs. Lacson for the non­-payment and
as a matter of fact, ac­cording to him, he told Mrs. Lacson 'Never mind, Mrs.
Lacson, alam kong ginigipit ninyo ako.' Again, the fact that Jimmy Pitalio was
known as a per­son of bad character in the locality is shown by the
uncontradicted testi­mony of the accused who testified that Carlos Tan and
Masacote warned him about Jimmy Pitalio and, by the fact <span style="">that </span>Jimmy Pitalio was convicted of
serious physical injuries against his own uncle (Exhibit 4), and likewise by
the fact that he admitted having stoned the house of accused Norman Lacson
together with other companions."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner invoked self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His evidence is that Jimmy Pitalio attacked
him with a knife, and in order to prevent or repel the aggression he took the
gun of his wife from her handbag and shot at the offended party.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court rejected petitioner's theory of com­plete
self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it ruled that
there was un­lawful aggression on the part of the offended party, Jimmy
Pitalio, stating thus:<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"Considering, therefore, the fact that at the time of the
incident the offended party, Jimmy Pitalio, was drunk and considering his bad
character, the Court believes, therefore, that there was unlawful aggression on
the part of Jimmy Pitalio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was Jimmy
Pitalio who provoked the incident by going in a drunken condition to the house
of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that Pitalio was
of a violent temperament, strong and ag­gressive, previously convicted of serious
physical injuries against his own uncle, plus the fact that he entered the resi­dence
of the accused in this case, makes the Court conclude that there was unlaw­ful
aggression on the part of the of­fended party in this case."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court held that there was no reasonable necessity of
the means employed to repel the unlawful ag­gression but found that there was
lack of sufficient pro­vocation on the part of the accused because:<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"That there was lack of sufficient provocation on the part of
the accused in this case is very clear because it was Jimmy Pitalio who himself
provoked the incident by accusing the wife of the accused of depriving him of
his wages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court therefore finds
that although there was no reasonable necessity of the means employed to
prevent or repel, the first requisite of unlawful aggression was present, as
well as the third requisite of lack of sufficient provoca­tion on the part of
the person defend­ing himself."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The main issue raised by the petitioner is whether or not he is entitled
to acquittal on the ground of complete <span style="">self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court and the Court of Appeals
found the presence of unlawful aggression on the part of the offended party and
lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both said courts, however, found the use of
the gun by the petitioner as an unreason­able means to repel the unlawful
aggression of the offended party, Jimmy Pitalio, apparently on the belief that
the latter did not have any weapon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner testified
that the offended party was armed with a "kris-like" knife when he
confronted Mrs. Lacson and the accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court found that when the petitioner remonstrated with Pitalio
to abide by the law, Pitalio was enraged and replied "<u>Ano ang batas,
ito ang batas</u>!" Implicit in this statement of Pitalio is that he was
referring to something as "<u>ito ang batas</u>." This statement of
Pitalio tends to corroborate the testimony of the petitioner that the offended
party was armed with a "kris-like" knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court did not state to what
Pitalio, the offended party, referred when he said "x x x <u>ito ang batas</u>!"
before he was fired at by the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The statement could not have simply referred to the fists of the
offended party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is contrary to normal
human be­havior for the petitioner to have taken the pistol of his wife from
her handbag and fired at Pitalio if Pitalio did not have any weapon at
all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only logical conclusion is that
Pitalio had a knife when he said "<u>Ano ang batas, ito ang batas</u>!<span class="GramE">".</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The phrase
"<u>ito ang batas</u>" could only have referred to a weapon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In People vs.
Boholst-Caballero,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> this Court said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In cases such as the one now before Us where there are
directly conflicting versions of the incident object of the accusation, the
Court in its search for the truth perforce has to look for some facts or
circumstances which can be used as valuable aids in evaluating the pro­bability
or improbability of a testimony, for after all the element of probability is
always involved in weighing testimonial evidence, so much so that when a court
as a judicial fact-finder pronounces judg­ment that a set of facts constitute
the true happening it does so not of its own personal knowledge but as the
result of an evaluating process of the probability or improbability of a fact
sought to be proved."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Considering the findings
of the trial court and the Court of Appeals that Jimmy Pitalio, the offended
party, was drunk at the time he was shot; that Pitalio was known as a person of
bad character in the locality; that Pitalio had been convicted of serious
physical injuries committed </span>against his own uncle; that on a previous
occasion, Pitalio admitted having stoned the <span style="">house </span>of petitioner, Norman Lacson; and the fact that Pitalio
had intruded into the residence of the accused, the use by the petitioner of a
gun as the only available weapon to repel the aggression cannot be considered
as an unreasonable means of defending himself and his wife from the offended
party.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court explained the meaning of reasonable means employed thus:</p>

<blockquote>"That there is reasonable necessity<span style=""> </span> of the means employed by herein appellant to prevent or repel the
unlawful aggression cannot seriously be disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Reasonable necessity of the means employed
does not imply material commensurability between the means of attack and
defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the law requires is
rational equivalence, in the consideration of which will enter as principal
factors the emergency, the immi­nent danger to which the person attacked is
exposed, and the instinct, more than the reason, that moves or impels the de­fense,
and the proportionateness thereof does not depend upon the harm done, but rests
upon the imminent danger of such in­jury xx xx.' As WE stated in the case of
People vs. Lara, in emergencies of this kind, human nature does not act upon
pro­cesses of formal reason but in obedience to the instinct of
self-preservation; and when it is apparent that a person has reasonably acted
upon this instinct, it is the duty of the courts to sanction the act and hold
the act irresponsible in law for the consequences."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, there was an imminent danger to the lives of
the petitioner and of his wife from the unlawful attack of an enraged, drunken,
and armed Pitalio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The gun in the bag of
his wife, who was beside him, afforded the petitioner the only reasonable means
to ward off the attack.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner is entitled to acquittal on the ground of complete
self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is no longer necessary
to dis­cuss the other errors assigned by him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals sought to
