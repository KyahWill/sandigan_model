				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Bureau of Telecommunications seeks the review of a decision
of the Public Service Commission, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> <span style="">part of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the said respondent is hereby
directed to submit to this Commission within thirty (30) days from receipt of
this decision, a copy of the schedule of rates it follows, in the operation of
its tele­phone services, local as well as long distance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon receipt of this decision, the respondent
Bureau of Telecommunications is hereby en­joined from enforcing its present
rates on its long distance service and local telephone service, without the
approval of the PSC previously obtained, unless the said rates are identical to
the rates already authorized by the Commission to the complainant herein and
other parties in the same areas where they are presently op­erating.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company is a public
utility corporation and the grantee of a legislative franchise to install,
maintain and operate telephone systems throughout the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 18, 1965, the Com­pany filed,
with the Public Service Commission, a complaint, against the Bureau of
Telecommunications, alleging that the same had "been operating its
telephone services within the City of Manila and other areas in the
Philippines, without submitting" to the Commission, "for its
approval, the rates actually being charged by it" (the Bureau) for
"said telephone services" and that the Bureau had "inaugurated a
long distance service bet­ween the Cities of Iloilo, <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, and
Manila," charging <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> rates "very much
lower than those authorized" by the Commission for the Company, and
praying that the Bureau be required to show cause why no disciplinary action
should be taken against it for enforcing or charging rates unauthorized by the
Commission, and to submit for approval the schedule of<span style=""> rates of the Bureau in connection with its long distance services, and
that the Bureau be restrained from engaging in long distance service until such
time as the Commission shall have approved its schedule of rates, or, should
the Bureau be allowed to con­tinue rendering said long distance service, that
it be required "to adopt, charge and follow the rates schedule
authorized" for the Company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In its answer, the Bureau contested the jurisdiction of the
Commission, upon the ground that it (the Bureau) is in op­eration, not for
general business purposes, but only to serve governmental needs, and alleged, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that any income derived by the Bureau
from private sources is incidental to the performance of its governmental
functions, and that its aim is merely to fill the requirements of public
service which other public services can not fully meet.</p>

<p class="BODY">After appropriate proceedings, the Commission rendered, on <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1965</st1:date>, its
aforementioned decision in favor of the Company and against the Bureau.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reconsideration of said decision having
been denied, the Bureau filed the present petition for review, with a prayer
that, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> thereof, the execution of
the appealed decision be stayed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
the filing of said petition, <span class="GramE">We</span> granted this temporary
relief.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only question for our determination is whether or not the
Bureau is a "public service" as the term is used in the Public
Service Act, as amended by Republic Act No. 2677, <span style="">Section 13(b) of which we quote:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The term 'public service' includes every
person that now or hereafter may own, operate, manage, or control in the
Philippines, for hire or compensation, with general or limit­ed clientele, whether
permanent, occasional or accidental, <u>and done for general business purposes</u>,
any common carrier, railroad, x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>wire or wireless communications system, wire or
wireless broadcasting stations and other similar public services x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><i><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE"><span style="">the</span></span><span style=""> authority of
the Commission being limited to the exercise of “jurisdiction, supervision, and
control over all public ser­vices” for section 13(a) of Republic Act No. 2677
reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission shall have jurisdiction,
supervision, and control over all public services and their franchises,
equipment, and other properties, and in the exercise of its authority, it shall
have the necessary powers and the aid of <u>public</u> force:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, That public services owned or
operated by government entities or government-owned or controlled corporations
shall be regulated by the Commission in the same way as privately-owned public
services, but certificates of public convenience or certificates of public
convenience and necessity shall not be required of such entities or corporations:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And provided, further, That it shall have no
authority to re­quire steamboats, <span class="SpellE">motorships</span> and
steamship lines, whether privately-owned, or owned or operated by any
Government controlled cor­poration or instrumentality to obtain certifi­cate of
public convenience or to prescribe their definite routes or lines of
service."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Caro</span></span><span style=""> vs. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Rilloraza</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> described a "business" as
"the means by which a party <u>habitually or regularly earns a liveli­hood

meaning of business is restricted to activities or <u>affairs where profit is

"that which occu­pies time, attention, and labor of men <u>for the purpose
of liveli­hood</u> or profit."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no allegation in the complaint of the Company that the
Bureau is engaged in telephone operation, either for the purpose of gain or
profit, or as a means of livelihood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, the Bureau is not even authorized to use its income, or any part thereof,
and <span style="">its </span>expenses are met through
annual appropriations made by Congress.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the Bureau has no corporate existence and it is admittedly
"discharging a governmental or State responsibility" or function,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to Republic Act No. 51, otherwise known as the
Reorganization Act of 1947, the Bureau was created by Executive Order No. 94 of
the President, series of 1947, Section 81 of which transferred to the Bureau
"(a)<span class="SpellE">ll</span> the personnel, powers, functions,
activities, appropriations, properties, equipment, supplies, records and
documents pertaining to or intended for <span style="">the
electrical communication service under the Bureau of Posts," the duties
and functions of which, as well as those enumerated in said Executive Order No.
94, as pertaining specifically to the Bureau of Telecommunications,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> do not indicate or suggest that the latter
has been created for "general business purposes.” Indeed, its rates are
much lower than those of the Company and, although 20% to 30% of its telephone
subscribers are private subscribers, the services given thereto are merely
incidental to <span style="">its </span>governmental
function, to meet the telecommunication needs of the Government and the people.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, it is our considered view that the Bureau
of Telecommunications is neither a "public service" nor engaged in
the operation of telephone services for "general business purposes,"
as the two (2) terms are used in the Public Service Act, and, hence, is not
subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission, and that the
appealed decision thereof should be, as it is hereby reversed, and the complaint
of the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company dismissed, with costs against
the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
