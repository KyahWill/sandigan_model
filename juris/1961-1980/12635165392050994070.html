the Commissioner of Immigration filed this petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> with preliminary injunction on February 8, 1965, against
respondent Judge, the Honorable <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span> of the Court of First Instance of Manila, for the
release on bail of respondents Jose <span class="SpellE">Tobiano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tobiano</span> during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of their habeas corpus proceeding, the allegation
being that such an order of respondent Judge was in excess of jurisdiction or
with grave abuse of discretion, the above decisions speaking to the effect that
the power to release on bail in exclusion or deportation cases is vested not in
a court of first instance but in the Bureau of Immigration.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court, in a resolution of <st1:date year="1965" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1965</st1:date>, gave due course to the petition, giving
respondents 10 days within which to answer the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A writ of preliminary injunction was likewise
issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the answer filed by respondents on <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1965</st1:date>, the dismissal of the petition
was sought on the ground of it being premature, no motion for reconsideration
having been filed with the respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was further alleged that <i style="">certiorari</i>
does not <span style="">lie </span>as petitioner had <span style="">the </span>remedy of appeal, the jurisdiction
of respondent Judge over the parties and the subject matter not being disputed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, on March 30, 1965, an urgent petition was filed by
respondents, other than the respondent judge, stating that Jose <span class="SpellE">Tobiano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tobiano</span> had, as of that time, been under detention in
Engineering Island, Bureau of Immigration, for about six months, contending
that <span style="">a </span>detainee,
in a case under consideration by the Court of Appeals, the facts being not
dissimilar, was allowed bail by such court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the reply to such urgent petition filed by the Commissioner of
Immigration, on <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1965</st1:date>,
while his stand was reiterated, his counsel, the Solicitor General, like­wise
informed the court that he would leave "the matter of granting bail to
respondents entirely to [our] sound discretion."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our resolution of <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="4">April 5, 1965</st1:date>, deferred action on such urgent
petition "until this case is taken up on the merits."</p>

<p class="BODY">Then came on April 8, 1965, a manifestation and a motion for
reconsideration filed by respondent, stressing that the Solicitor General was
not opposed to the granting of petition for bail, suggesting only certain
conditions <span style="">to </span>accompany such a
grant, from which <span style="">fact </span>the assertion was made that there appeared to be "no
real contentious issue concerning the granting of bond for the provisional
release" of the two above-named respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was an oppo­sition to such a motion for
reconsideration filed by petitioner on <st1:date year="1965" day="10" month="4">April
 10, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1965</st1:date>,
there was a reiteration of the above petition for us to grant the two
above-named respondents liberty under bail.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Barely two weeks later, on May 17, 1965, such a plea was again raised by
<span style="">respondents </span>in another petition,
this time invoking not only what they considered would be the primacy that
should be accorded liberty and an appeal to mercy but likewise the <span class="SpellE">insanitary</span> and unhealthy conditions in Engineering Island,
which at that time had one hundred five detainees of whom one is a leper,
twelve are <span class="SpellE">tuberculars</span>, another an invalid with sores
all over his body, with the sick and healthy detainees being crammed together
in a dilapidated building "where conditions are humanly intolerable.” The
newspaper article cited in support of such motion made mention of the diet of
such detainees "of sub-nutrition level" with rooms insufficient to
accommodate all of them, resulting in their having to "sleep <span style="">on </span>the dirty bare floors along the
corridors." The newspaperman likewise noted their "pale and
haggard" look as well as the "hollowed cheeks" and "sunken
eyes."</p>

<p class="BODY">Not content with the above motion, respondents Jose and <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tobiano</span>, on June <span style="">17, </span>and <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1965</st1:date>, again sought for reasons
already stated the <span style="">release on </span>bail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On July 9,
1965, a manifestation was filed by the then Solicitor General to the effect
that he would "leave it to [our] sound discretion * * * to grant the bail
in the interest of justice for the provisional release of said respondents,
considering that there has been an apparent delay in the determination of the rather
complicated issues of law involved," with the result that "it might
take much more time before the case can be finally decided."</p>

<p class="BODY">Encouraged by such <span style="">a </span>manifestation, the above-named re­spondents,
on <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1965</st1:date>, filed
an urgent motion reiterating the urgent petition to bail making reference anew
to Commissioner of Immigration v. Fernandez.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
There was subsequent plea, a manifestation filed on <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1965</st1:date>, where the accusation was
launched against petitioner to the effect that he "was apparently actuated
by an unexplained intent to be unduly harsh to the two [respondents, Jose and <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tobiano</span>]." There was
naturally a denial of such accusation in a reply to the manifestation filed by
the Solicitor General on August 26, 1965, and a reiteration of his stand that,
based on the above cases, respondent Judge could not have allowed bail to the
other respondents during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the habeas
corpus proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, the
Solicitor General, following the other manifestation, left it to our sound
discretion to allow the bail or not subject to other conditions as may be
imposed by us.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then came our resolution of <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1965</st1:date>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"In G.R. No. L-24139 (Commissioner of Immigration v. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>, etc., et
al.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of our resolution in G.R.
No. L-22696 (Commissioner vs. Fernandez) which case is similar to this; our
injunction order of Feb. 10, 1965 is hereby amended in the <span style="">sense </span>of
permitting respondent judge to grant bail to Jose <span class="SpellE">Tobiano</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tobiano</span> (P25,000
each) subject to conditions similar to those granted by the Court of Appeals in
the suit referred to in L-22696.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
release on bail shall be subject to the decision to be promulgated in this
litigation.’”</p>

<p class="BODY">By virtue of the above resolution, the matter of release on bail
has become moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true
that the legal question raised is of significance and may result in the re-examination
of the previous doctrine announced.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, in the light of the above resolution, it would <span style="">be well </span>to wait for a more propitious
occasion where the parties in an antagonistic proceeding would have the
opportunity of raising what undoubtedly is a question of the utmost importance.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b><span style="">,</span>
this petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> with
preliminary injunction is dismissed, without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
