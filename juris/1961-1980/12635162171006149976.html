the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which is as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, the Court hereby finds the accused, SANTOS RAMOS,
LUCILO ESMA, <span style="">PEDRO ALEMANIA</span> and
ALFONSO ESMA, guilty, beyond <span style="">reasonable
doubt, of the crime of Murder, defined and penalized under Art. 248 of the </span><span style="">Revised Penal </span><span style="">Code, with the accused Santos Ramos as principal, and the accused <span class="SpellE">Lucilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Esma</span>, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Alemania</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">and Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Esma</span> as
accomplices, and there being no mitigating nor aggravating circumstances to
consider for or against said accused, and applying the provisions of the
Indeterminate Sentence Law as regards the accomplices, imposes upon the accused
Santos Ramos the </span><span style="">penalty of
RECLUSION PERPETUA, and upon <span class="SpellE">Lucilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Esma</span>, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Alemania</span> and Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Esma</span></span><span style="">, </span><span style="">the pe­nalty </span><span style="">of not less </span><span style="">than TEN (10) YEARS of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> mayor, as
minimum; to not more than SEVENTEEN (17) YEARS and FOUR (4) MONTHS, </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">RECLUSION TEMPORAL; both with the accessory penalties provided by law;
to indemnify jointly end severally the heirs of the victim </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the sum of P6,000.00; plus the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the accused are to be credited with
one-half of the detention period."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The evidence shows that appellant Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Esma</span>
was<span style=""> a </span>resident of Barrio <span class="SpellE">Magpayang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mainit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> Norte, where he owned
end operated a restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Living with
him in the house where such business was conducted were his cousin, appellant <span class="SpellE">Lucilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Esma</span>, and their
co-appellants Santos Ramos end Pedro <span class="SpellE">Alemania</span>, the
three being Alfonso's helpers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Early <span style="">in </span>the evening of January 24, 1960, a man known <span style="">as </span><span class="SpellE">Feling</span>
entered the restaurant in a drunken condition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">Probably
to avoid untoward incidents in his eating place, A</span>lfonso pushed him
outside with such violence that <span class="SpellE">Feling</span> fell to the
ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was soon thereafter that <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> <span class="SpellE">Montaner</span>, Jr. also
entered the restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thinking
probably that the new arrival was the same person ousted <span class="SpellE">som­<span style="">time</span></span><span style=""> </span>before or
that he was also in a drunken condition, <span class="SpellE">Lucilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Esma</span> approached him and put his right arm over his left
shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span>
did not like <span style="">this
for he tried to free </span>himself, but while <span class="SpellE">Lucilo</span>
still had his right arm over <span class="SpellE">Agapito’s</span> shoulder,
appellant Santos Ramos approached him from behind and thrust a double-bladed
dagger into the left side of his body.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Immediately thereafter, appellant Pedro <span class="SpellE">Alemania</span>
also attacked <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> with fist <span style="">blows on </span>the
face, while Alfonso Erma pushed him toward outside the restaurant, this also
causing the victim to fall on the pavement face upward and shouting for help.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> was then taken by some
passersby to the <span style="">house </span>of the
Barrio Lieutenant and later to a hospital where he died fifteen minutes after
arrival due to hemorrhage as a result of the wound inflicted upon him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also snowed a <span style="">contusion on the </span>left lower jaw
(Exhibits A and B, Medical Certificate and Certificate of Death, respectively).</p>

<p class="BODY">As against the foregoing, tree defense’ version of the incident
runs as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">That on the evening in question a drunkard known as <span class="SpellE">Feling</span> entered Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Esma's</span>
restaurant asking the people therein:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Who <span style="">is </span>tough
here?"; that <span class="SpellE">Pedo</span> <span class="SpellE">Alemania</span>
answered him saying that nobody in the place was tough, but that he should get
out because he <span style="">was </span>drunk, at
the same time giving him a violent push which caused him to stumble; that
Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Esma</span><span style=""> </span>then
appeared and also told <span class="SpellE">Feling</span> to go home; that <span class="SpellE">Lucilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Esma</span> then came and he led <span class="SpellE">Feling</span> outside; that at that juncture <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Montaner</span>, Jr. arrived also asking "Who is tough
here among you?", and as nobody answered, he <span style="">hit S</span>antos <span style="">Ramos on </span>the
stomach and attempted to pick <span style="">up a </span>big
stone; that as he was in the act of picking up the stone, Santos Ramos stabbed
him on the left <span style="">side </span>of the
body.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even in accordance with the defense version, therefore, it is a
fact that Santos Ramos stabbed the deceased <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> <span class="SpellE">Montaner</span>, Jr. on the left side of the body - the wound thus
inflicted having caused his death soon thereafter.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The other aspects of the
story given by appellants and their witnesses, however, can not </span><span style="">stand a</span><span style="">gainst, much </span>less overcome the
findings invade by the judge a quo who, after a careful consideration of the
evidence of record, stated them briefly as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"It has been proven to the full satisfaction of the Court that
in the fatal day in question <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> <span class="SpellE">Montañer</span>, Jr., suspected to be drunk, was held around the
neck by the accused <span class="SpellE">Lucilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Esma</span>
and as he was struggling to extricate himself, he was given <span style="">a </span>blow from
behind with a dagger by the accused Santos Ramos hitting the deceased on the
left side piercing his lung end causing his death less than an hour later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After he had been wounded, the accused Pedro <span class="SpellE">Alemania</span> gave the victim a fistic blow <span style="">on his </span>face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, as if not satisfied with the injury that
had already been inflicted on the de<span style="">ceased,
the owner of the restaurant, the accused Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Esma</span>,
pushed <span class="SpellE">Montañer</span>, Jr. out of </span><span style="">the res</span><span style="">taurant and <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Montañer</span>, Jr. fell on his back to the ground."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The first and third assignments of error made in appellants’
brief deal exclusively with the alleged insufficiency of the prosecution
evidence and of the evidence <span style="">as </span>a
<span style="">whole to support
</span>the above findings and the judgment of conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a careful consideration of the evidence
of record <span class="GramE">We</span> find no justification at all <span style="">to reverse nor </span>even
modify both <span style="">or
either.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Another question raised by appellants in their brief is that
Santos Ramos, if at all, should have been convicted of homicide only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is also <span style="">untenable in the light of the evidence clearly showing that </span>he
stabbed <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> <span class="SpellE">Montaner</span>,
Jr. from behind and while the latter was, to a certain degree, helpless because
<span class="SpellE">Lucilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Esma</span> had his right
arm over his left shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus it is
clear that he was attacked treacherously.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision being in accordance with
law and the evidence, the same is hereby affirmed, with costs, except as to the
<span style="">indemnity</span><span style=""> which</span><span style=""> hereby increased </span>to P12, 000.00.</p>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>, Sanchez,
Castro, Fernando, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> Capistrano, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span><span style="font-style: normal;"> concur.</span></span><br>
