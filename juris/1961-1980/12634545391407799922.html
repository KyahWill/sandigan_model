close to <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> in <span class="SpellE">Ampinican</span>, <span class="SpellE">Salay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental, on an occasion that should have been
attended with joy and gaiety, a ball for the canvassing of votes to determine
who would be the barrio queen, tragedy struck unexpectedly and
unaccountably.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The president of the
local Parents-Teachersâ€™ Association, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span>,
was shot dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant, Felipe <span class="SpellE">Gumahin</span>, then a municipal policeman of <span class="SpellE">Salay</span>,
was indicted for murder, tried, and having been found guilty, sentenced to
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the law, the case was sent
up to us for automatic review.</p>

<p class="BODY">The information for murder filed before the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental charged appellant of
having "with impunity and with abuse of official position <span style="">as a </span>municipal policeman, and with
the qualifying circumstance of <span class="SpellE">alevosia</span> and the
generic aggravating circumstance of known premeditation," <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously attacked, assaulted
and fired on the day and place above-mentioned "at Antonio <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span> with <span style="">a </span>service
revolver inflicting upon him mortal wounds on the vital parts of his body, as a
result of which the said Antonio <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span>
died."</p>

<p class="BODY">At the trial before the Hon. <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> Z.
<span class="SpellE">Arrieta</span>, Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental, evidence was introduced by the
prosecution and defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the
accused, as above noted, was<span style=""> </span>found
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder, qualified by treachery
and attended by the aggravating circumstances of impunity and abuse of official
position, as charged in the information, contrary to and in violation of Article
248 of the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
sentenced "to suffer the supreme penalty of death, to indemnify the heirs
of the deceased, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span>, in the sum of
P6,000.00 and to pay the costs."</p>

<p class="BODY">From the evidence introduced at the trial by both the prosecution
and defense, there was no dispute <span style="">as </span>to
the antecedents of the fatal occurrence, the protagonists therein, and the
gunshot wounds inflicted an the deceased, one of which was mortal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were different versions as to how the
deceased met his untimely end.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the evening of <st1:date year="1960" day="23" month="4">April
 23, 1960</st1:date>, a dance was held at the cemented tennis court beside the
old public school building in <span class="SpellE">Ampinican</span>, a barrio of <span class="SpellE">Salay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The affair was attended by many people, among
them the late Antonio <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>,
there was a lull to allow for the counting of the ballots cast in the beauty
contest for the approaching barrio fiesta.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Before the canvass could begin, the accused Felipe <span class="SpellE">Gumahin</span>,
armed with <span style="">a </span>.38 cal. Smith
&amp; Wesson service revolver, with another policeman, <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Excelise</span>, armed with a carbine, suspecting that a
certain Abraham <span class="SpellE">Salarda</span>, then standing outside the
tennis court by the gate, was carrying a firearm, went to and pointed their
weapons at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Gumahin</span> confronted him with this accusation:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Don't move; you are a wise guy; where
is your arm."</p>

<p class="BODY">A conflict of evidence developed as to what transpired next, but
it was undeniable that the deceased, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span>,
did protest against the treatment to which <span class="SpellE">Salarda</span>
was subjected and that soon thereafter, he lay dead from <span style="">a </span><span style="">fatal </span>gunshot wound coming from the
revolver of appellant <span class="SpellE">Gumahin</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There was no dispute
either as to the number of wounds stained by the deceased disclosed by an
autopsy performed on his remains the next </span><span style="">day </span><span style="">by the municipal
health officer </span><span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Salay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>There
was a contused wound on the left ear as large as a twenty-centavo coin; a
bullet wound on the outer left arm about 3 or 4 inches below the shoulder,
traversing the muscle and coming out towards the back; and the fatal bullet
wound on the left chest at the level of the nipple penetrating the diaphragm
downward, the bullet coming out on the right flank at the region of the 12th
rib on the right side of his body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was the view <span style="">of </span>the doctor that
this chest wound which pierced the heart and the liver caused internal
hemorrhage and instantaneous death.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to what happened after appellant and the other policeman
confronted <span class="SpellE">Salarda</span>, there was a conflict of
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the witnesses for
the prosecution, <span class="SpellE">Salarda</span> himself, one <span class="SpellE">Timoteo</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabud</span>, and two
eyewitnesses who saw the whole unfortunate event, Fernando Ala-an and <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span>, after <span class="SpellE">Salarda</span> was confronted with the accusation that he was <span style="">"a </span>wise
guy" and that he had a firearm with him, came the answer that he did not
have any.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This notwithstanding,
appellant ordered his companion to search him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was done, but nothing was found on <span class="SpellE">Salarda</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span style="">was </span>not satisfied; he ordered the
latter to remove his clothes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
obeyed, the latter starting to unbutton his shirt.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was at this stage that the deceased, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span>, approached the group, requesting appellant and <span class="SpellE">Excelise</span> to refrain from compelling <span class="SpellE">Salarda</span>
to undress in public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He pointed out
that even if he had committed <span style="">a </span>crime, he should be taken to the municipal
building, where the search could be continued in private.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant was incensed by this action of the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an angry tone, he asked if <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span> was siding with <span class="SpellE">Salarda</span>
and whether he wanted to fight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
same time he struck him at the left ear with the barrel of his revolver,
causing <span style="">his </span>victim
to stagger from the blow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wishing to
avoid aggravating the incident, <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span> walked away
towards the direction of the orchestra <span style="">but
appellant, his ire, apparently uncontrolled, went after him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The crowd because of what was happening perceptively
thinned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even <span class="SpellE">Salarda</span>
hurriedly left the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:state><st1:place>Ala</st1:place></st1:state>-an
and <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span>
remained and witnessed the unfortunate occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Locating the deceased near the orchestra,
appellant struck him with his revolver which simultaneously exploded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased staggered and fell to the
ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was in that position that
appellant shot him on the left shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span> though feeling the effects of the wound
tried to rise up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before he could assume
<span style="">a </span>standing position, appellant
put his left hand on his right hand, pressed his revolver against his breast
and shot him on the left nipple at the same time pushing him aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wound as above noted was fatal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonio <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span>
fell lifeless on the cement floor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Salay</span>, who was
at that time in the canvassing table <span style="">a few </span>meters away, then ordered the
appellant and the other policeman to bring the deceased to the municipal
building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They dragged the corpse at the
roadÂ­side, appellant holding the shoulder and his companion the right
foot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching the highway, they
put it into <span style="">a </span>bus which took it
to the municipal building.</p>

<p class="BODY">What <span style="">was </span>the
version of the defense?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When placed on
the stand, appellant narrated that while maintaining peace and order at the
dance held that evening of <st1:date year="1960" day="23" month="4">April 23,
 1960</st1:date>, with Pat. <span class="SpellE">Excelise</span>, he was told by
the latter to be careful because <span style="">a </span>certain
woman had informed him that "somebody would make trouble in this dance."
They did agree to stay in the corner to observe the people in the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime later, they noticed a certain person
unknown to them leaning by <span style="">a </span>post who apparently "observed every person that used to
pass by." The two getting suspicious agreed to approach that unknown
individual and searched his body to find out whether he had any weapon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did so and <span class="SpellE">Excelise</span>
was able to search him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before he could
finish the job, the deceased, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span>, came
and in a harsh voice shouted:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"You
are abusive policemen."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Excelise</span> approached <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span>
and took him to the place where the orchestra was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant wanted to continue <span style="">the </span>search
but was unable to do so as he saw the deceased come towards him, at the same
time reprimanding him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant believed
that <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span> <span style="">"was </span>going to rush at me because I saw
two persons trying to stop him." The deceased was however able to
extricate himself from those two.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Noticing that, appellant took out his "revolver and fired <span style="">a </span>warning
shot." Then according to appellant, the deceased was able to reach him
holding his right hand with his two hands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was unÂ­able to free himself from such a hold, and both of them fell
down the cement pavement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then according to appellant, while in that position he
"heard a shot." At that time his right hand was being held by the
right hand of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span>, who was on top of
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he fell on the cement
pavement, with his head hitting it, and with Antonio <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span>
on top of him he "noticed that his [<span class="SpellE">Galamitonâ€™s</span>]
grasp was already weak." So he pushed him aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He tried to get up but could not do so right
away as half of the body of <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span> was also
"on top of [his] leg." He was able to stand up finally and saw the
Chief of Police standing nearby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
asked what had happened, appellant answered that deceased was "trying to
grab my revolver." It was then that the Chief of Police told them that <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span> be brought to <span class="SpellE">Salay</span> for
treatment.</p>

<p class="BODY">This he did, being helped in the process by the other policemen, <span class="SpellE">Excelise</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They carried
him, appellant holding the upper portion of his body while the latter held his
feet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They rode with him on <span style="">a </span>Mindanao
Bus, but upon their arrival at the municipal building, <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span>
was "already dead." It was only later on that he found out that the person
searched by them was Abraham <span class="SpellE">Salarda</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other policeman, <span class="SpellE">Excelise</span>,
corroborated in the main the above version.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Three other defense witnesses testified to their having seen the
deceased rush towards the appellant and try to get hold of his revolver which
exploded twice during that incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court in convicting the appellant chose to believe the
testimony for the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A judicious appraisal
of the testimonies of the witnesses persuades the <span style="">court that the weight of the evidence supports the charge against the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The theory of accidental
shooting which the defense endeavored to weave through its array of witnesses
finds no substantial basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from
the evident bias and untrustworthy behavior manifested by the witnesses for the
defense during their turn on the witness stand, their given version of the
incident appears strained because it cannot be reconciled with physical facts
and the natural course of events.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
instance, the bullet wound at the rear of the upper left arm of the deceased
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span> and the rip across the back part of
his shirt which, according to the <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>
testimony of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span>
must have been produced by the bullet after cutting through the flesh do not
fit into the theory of the defense."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The second circumstance, according to the lower court, reflecting
on the probability of the version of the defense <span style="">"is </span>the location of the bullet wound on the chest of the
deceased <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span> above his left nipple." From
the testiÂ­mony of the municipal health officer, "this wound, which carried
heavier powder, burns than the left arm wound took <span style="">a </span>downward course passing through the heart, the diaphragm and
the liver and came out on the right flank of the deceased at the level of the
last floating rib." The trial court<span style="">
correctly observed that no one of the witnesses for the defense could tell how
this particular wound was inflicted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the other hand, the testimony of both the eyewitnesses, Ala-an and <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span>, to the
effect that the deceased </span><span style="">was in
a </span><span style="">squatting position when
appellant held him by the left arm and shot him at close range would
satisfactorily explain its location.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is this other circumstance which in the opinion of the
lower court cannot be reconciled with the contention <span style="">of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It "is the
fact that his clothes were never smeared with the blood of his victim except
for a few spots on his left <span class="SpellE">trouser's</span> pocket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Dr. <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span>,
the death of </span><span style="">said victim was </span><span style="">instantaneous due to the rupture of the heart
and other vital organs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The human body
is of such </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">nature that blood spurts out immediately in
large quantity when the heart is pierced.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since the accused was lying on the pavement </span><span style="">on </span><span style="">his back as he claims when with the deceased stop him was wounded on
the left breast, it is inconceivably strange why the front of his uniform was
not spilled with his victim's blood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
only goes to show that their bodies were not actually in contact when said
accused wounded his victim."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, twelve errors were assigned by counsel for the
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first dealt with the
alleged failure to conduct the first stage of the preliminary investigation
before the arrest of the accused notwithstanding his objection against being
held in custody without such <span style="">a </span>procedure being followed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering how fairly conducted was the trial of his case and how
carefully his rights were protected, this alleged irregularity merits no
further consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The remaining errors dealt with the credibility accorded the
testimony of the municipal health officer and other witnesses for the
prosecution and the refusal to uphold the theory of the defense that it was the
deceased who attacked appellant; the lower court, so it was alleged,
consequently erred in not acquitting appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The above assignments of errors do not carry persuasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The findings of the lower court embodied in a
well-written decision cannot only stand the test of the most rigid scrutiny but
also has in its favor the well-settled principle that as far as credibility is
concerned, the findings of the lower court which had the opportunity to see,
hear and observe the witnesses testify and to weigh their testimonies will be
accorded the highest degree of respect by this Tribunal.</p>

<p class="BODY">As this Court stated in People v. <span class="SpellE">Tila</span>-on:<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
"Finally, the rule is now firmly established to the point of becoming
elementary in this jurisdiction and elsewhere that where there is an
irreconcilable conflict in the testimony of witnesses, the appellate court will
not disturb the findings of the trial court when the evidence of the successful
party, considered by itself, is adequate to sustain the judgment appealed
from." To the same effect:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Appellate courts as a rule desist from disturbing the findings of
the trial court on the credibility of witnesses, for the latter is in <span style="">a </span>better
position to appreciate the same, having seen and heard the witnesses themselves
and observed their behavior and manner of testifying during the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no reason to depart from this settled
practice, since it has not been shown that the trial court has overlooked
certain facts of substance and value that, if considered, might affect the
result of the case."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The latest formulation of such a doctrine follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Time after time, this Court has
declared that the matter of assigning values to declarations at the witness
stand is best and most competently performed or carried out by the trial judge
because the latter, unlike appellate magistrates, can weigh such testimonies in
the light of the <span class="SpellE">declarant's</span> demeanor, conduct and
attitude at the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * Of course,
this rule admits of exceptions <span style="">as </span>when patent inconsistencies in the
statements of witnesses are ignored by the lower court or when the conclusions
arrived at are clearly unsupported by the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants herein, however, have not
established the existence of any such exception in this case."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That is all there is to this case then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vigorous effort on the part of counsel
for appellant to exculpate appellant while no doubt in keeping with the
principle that a lawyer should exert his utmost to serve his client's cause,
does not warrant a reversal; it affords no legal basis for the acquittal of the
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sad and dismal fate
suffered by the deceased calls for the corresponding penalty to be meted the
culprit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is all the more regrettable
that the deceased in trying to uphold human dignity <span style="">and </span>in striving to prevent the
abusive exercise of authority met a tragic death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The least this Court can do under the circumstances
is to make clear to all and sundry, especially to members of police forces,
that the authority conferred on them to maintain peace and order should be
exercised with due regard to the constitutional rights, most especially so of
those who belong to the lower-income groups.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If in a <span style="">case </span>like the
present, the full force of the penal statute is not felt by the perpetrator of
the misdeed, then the law itself stands condemned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This we should not <span style="">allow </span>to happen.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court believes however
that while murder, qualified by treachery, was committed by the appellant, the
aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation, impunity and abuse of
official position, as charged in the information, were not duly proved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the penalty imposed by the lower court is
hereby modified; the accused is condemned to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, to indemnify the heirs of the
deceased, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Galamiton</span> in the sum of P6,000.00
