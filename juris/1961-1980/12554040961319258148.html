				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of Tax
    Appeals confirming substantially the assessment of income
    tax deficiencies of the petitioner Jose Avelino for the years
    1946, 1947 and 1948. The assessments approved by the
    Court of Tax Appeals for the said years are as follows:

	<p align="justify"> In the brief of the petitioner various assignments of
    errors are made, each error raising specific questions of
    law and of fact. The errors will now be considered one
    by one, each independently of the others.    </p>
		<p align="center">I    </p>
		<div align="justify">THE
COURT OF TAX APPEALS ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT THE NET WORTH METHOD
USED BY RESPONDENT IN DETERMINING PETITIONERS TAXABLE INCOME IS WITHOUT
JUSTIFIABLE BASIS. </div>
		<p align="justify"> It is contended under this assignment
of error that there is no reasonable certainty of the amount taken as
an opening net worth, there being no sufficient basis for establishing
such opening net worth. Included in the opening net worth as of January
1, 1946, both according to the petitioner as well as to the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, are P700.00 and P5,500.00,
representing cash in bank, PNB savings account and PNB current account,
respectively. But petitioner claims that the cash on hand in the
opening net worth should be, on December 31, 1945 (or January 1, 1946),
not P100.00 as estimated by respondent but P47,300.00, for the reason
that in an income tax return submitted by the wife of the petitioner,
Mrs. Enriqueta Avelino, she made it appear that she netted a profit of
P55,000.00 from her business of importation of shoes, operation of a
bar, and of a restaurant, shortly after liberation. The income tax
return submitted by her for the year 1946 was submitted in the year
1949 and was presented at the hearing as Exhibit "A". Petitioner
asserts that his wife made a gain of P55,000.00 during the year 1946,
but the supposed copy of the income tax return that she has submitted
as evidence does not show how that amount had been earned. If she did
actually earn that amount Exhibit "A" would have contained the details
indicating the transactions in which the big sum was earned. Why none
of that amount or the greater part thereof appears to have been
deposited in a bank has not been explained. Apparently the court below
considered the return as a self-serving statement, and we agree that on
the basis of that income tax return, without any other explanation how
the gains were used or invested or deposited, there is no reason to
disturb the action of the court below in giving no credence to the said
alleged existence of the cash net worth existing at the beginning of
the year 1946. We therefore declare that the alleged error has not been
committed.</p>
		<p align="center">II </p>
		<div align="justify">THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS IN COMPUTING THE DEFICIENCY
    INCOME TAX ALLEGEDLY DUE PROM THE PETITIONER, ERRED
    IN NOT DEDUCTING FROM THE INCREASE IN NET WORTH OF
    THE PETITIONER FOR THE YEAR 1948. THE SUM OF P6,508.00
    REPRESENTING ONE-HALF (l/2) OF THE CAPITAL GAIN REALIZED PROM THE SALE OF TWO PARCELS OF LAND (CAPITAL
    ASSETS) MADE IN 1948.   
		</div>
		<p align="justify">The respondent denies that this error has been committed. In Annex I, the yellow working sheet prepared
    by Examiner Lasquety, it is shown that the sum of
    P6,508.00 was deducted in the year 1948 as the taxable
    capital gain. This deduction was sustained by the Court
    below. The alleged error, therefore, is disproved by
    Annex I.</p>
		<p align="center"> III    </p>
		<div align="justify">THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS ERRED IN DISALLOWING THE
    AMOUNT OF P9,816.78 AS DEPRECIATION ON RENTAL PROPERTIES IN DETERMINING THE PETITIONER'S NET WORTH FOR
    THE YEAR 1948.    
		</div>
		<p align="justify">This supposed error was not committed as evidenced
    by an examination of Annex I, which shows that P9,816.78
    was allowed as deduction for 1948 under the heading "Reserve for Depreciation, Building".    </p>
		<p align="center">IV    </p>
		<div align="justify">THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS ERRED IN FAILING TO REFLECT
    OR TAKE UP IN 1947 THE IMPROVEMENTS VALUED AT
    P35,000.00, ERECTED IN 1947 IN THE QUEZON CITY LOT OF
    PETITIONER. 
		</div>
		<p align="justify">This error again is disproved by Annex I, the yellow
    working sheet prepared by Bureau of Internal Revenue
    Examiner Lasquety. This working sheet was adopted by
    the Court of Tax Appeals and it shows that P35,000.00
    alleged to have been omitted was actually taken into
    account in the computation of the 1947 accounts of the
    petitioner, as improvements on four buildings.    </p>
		<p align="center">V      </p>
		<div align="justify">THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE
        PETITIONER AND HIS WIFE HAD INVESTMENT IN THE TALISAY LUMBER COMPANY IN THE SUM OF P29,000.00, WITHOUT
        CONSIDERING AN OFFSETTING LIABILITY IN THE SAME
        AMOUNT. 
		</div>
		<p align="justify">Neither do we find any merit in this assignment of
    error. According to the evidence, the articles of incorporation of the Talisay Lumber Company, which is under
    oath, petitioner and his wife invested the sums of P28,000.00
    and P1,000.00 in the company. If these sums were not
    furnished by the petitioner but by the organizer of the
    company, still the total amount of P29,000.00 should be
    considered as a gift, or an income received by the petitioner and his wife from the said organizer of the Talisay
    Lumber Company, which income is liable to tax.	</p>
		<p align="center">VI</p>
		 <div align="justify">THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE
    PETITIONER HAD INVESTMENT IN AVELINO, BAGTAS, ALZATE
    AND COMPANY IN THE SUM OF P5,000.00 FOR EACH OF THE
    YEARS 1946 TO 1950.
		 </div>
		 <p align="justify"> Under this assignment of error, petitioner argues that
    the appearance of the said amount as having been contributed to the partnership by petitioner is no proof that
    that amount was petitioner's actual investment in the company. The same reasons obtaining in the case of the
    investment of P29,000.00 of the spouses in the Talisay
    Lumber Company obtain in the case of the petitioners
    investment in the partnership of Avelino, Bagtas, Alzate
    and Company.</p>
		<p align="center">VII    </p>
		<div align="justify">THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE
    LOAN OF P10,000.00 FROM ROSARIO GRAY DE HAYS AND ANOTHER LOAN OF P30,000.00 PROM ANGELA M. VDA. DE BUTTE
    NEVER EXISTED.
		</div>
		<p align="justify">
In support of this assignment of error, petitioner contends that he
owed the sum of P10,000.00 to Rosario Gray de Hays, which amount
represents one-half of the price of P20,000.00 which was the
consideration for the sale of certain property described in Exhibit
"C". But the original of the document shows that the amount of the
consideration was P22,000.00 and the vendor was Severina de Casal, and
nothing is said in the original of the document that any part of the
amount under consideration has not been paid. </p>
		<p align="justify">It is also alleged in support of this error that the petitioner is indebted to Angela M. Vda. de Butte in 1948 in
    the sum of P30,000.00. Mrs. Butte testified that petitioner
    owed her the amount of P30,000-00; that the debt was in
    the form of a cheek and that in 1949 Mr. Avelino, the
    petitioner, paid P15,000.00, and that he paid the balance
    in 1951, no interest on the loan having been demanded
    and paid. Evidence of this character has, as a rule, been declared insufficient for purposes of the income tax law.
    (Eugenio Perez <i>vs</i>. Court of Tax Appeals, et al., G.R. No.
    L-10507, May 30, 1958; Aurelio P. Reyes <i>vs</i>. Collector
    of Internal Revenue, G.R. Nos. L-11534 &amp; L-11558, Nov.
    25, 1958.) We declare that in consonance with the rule
    which appears to be reasonable, the alleged loan cannot be
    declared as actually existing.    </p>
		<p align="center">VIII</p>
		 <div align="justify">THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE
    PETITIONER COMMITTED FRAUD IN FILING HIS INCOME TAX
    RETURNS FOR THE YEARS UNDER REVIEW.
		 </div>
	    <p align="justify"> Under this alleged error it is contended that there was
    no evidence of fraud committed by the petitioner. We find
    that the acts of the petitioner in declaring an income of
    only P5,258.99 in the year 1946 when he had an actual
    income of P106,223.06; his act in submitting an income
    tax return for 1947 only for the amount of P12,219.96
    when he actually had a net taxable income of P43,504.34;
    and lastly his act in reporting an income for the year 1948 which is only ten percent of the actual taxable
    income of P38,885.81—all these circumstances justify the
    finding of the court below that there has been fraud
    subject to be penalized by law. </p>
		<p align="center"> IX      </p>
		<div align="justify">THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE
        RESPONDENT'S ASSESSMENTS HAVE NOT YET PRESCRIBED.
		</div>
		<p align="justify"> In this assignment of error it is contended that the
          liability of the petitioner for income tax for the years
          1946, 1947 and 1948 has already prescribed. The contention is without merit as it has been found out that the
          petitioner has been guilty of fraud. The period within
          which he may be subjected to liability in case of fraud
          begins from the moment the fraud is discovered and not
          when the income tax return was presented. (Sec. 332,
          Internal Revenue Law)          </p>
		<p align="center">X            </p>
		<div align="justify">THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT
              THE PETITIONER LIABLE FOR P57,788.16 AS DEFICIENCY
              INCOME TAX FOR THE YEARS 1946, 1947, AND 1948. 
		</div>
		<p align="justify">This supposed error is the result of the previous errors
                and need not be considered.                </p>
		<p align="justify">Finding
no error in the conclusion of fact and of law made by the respondent
court, we hereby affirm the assessments made by it as above indicated,
with costs against petitioner. </p>
