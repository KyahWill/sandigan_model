Acting Referee Roberto Blanco of Regional Office No. 4, the claim of Angel de
Castro, Jr. was dismissed on the alleged ground that said office was without
jurisdiction inasmuch as the death of the employee occurred on </span><st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="2"><span style="">February

held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"We shall affirm the order of dismissal grounded on lack of
jurisdiction because the record shows that from the period beginning January 3,
1975 to January 31, 1975, the claimant was not on sick leave of absence or on
vacation leave of absence and must have been working for the respondent
immediately prior to her fatal attack causing death on <st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1975</st1:date> which was congestive heart
failure and rheumatic heart disease with <span class="SpellE">mitral</span> <span class="SpellE">stenosis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her death
on <st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1975</st1:date> is

Compensation Commission.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the order appealed from is
hereby, as it is affirmed without prejudice to the filing of this claim with
the Government Service Insurance System, as the case may be, and with the
further pronouncement that no service fee shall be charged against any of the
parties as cost of review." (p. 28, <span class="SpellE">rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The claim is now before Us through this Petition filed by Angel
de Castro, Jr. for a review of the decision of the respondent, now defunct,
Workmen's Compensation Commission.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner asserts that the Workmen's Compensation Commission gravely
erred in disclaiming jurisdiction and in not awarding disability and/or death
compensation to the claimant considering that the cause of action or right to
claim for such compensation accrued from the very moment the employee Aida de
Castro became sick as early as January, 1974, and was disabled to continue with
her work until she succumbed to her illness on February 1, 1975.</p>

<p class="BODY">To Us the merit of petitioner's submittal on the questions of
jurisdiction and compensability is self-evident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aida de Castro's ailment occurred in the course
of her employment, it was aggravated by the nature of her work, it disabled her
from continuing with her classroom teaching since <st1:date year="1973" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1973</st1:date>, and there was no timely <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> by the employer notwithstanding its knowledge
of the illness since said date, as will be shown below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that Aida's death occurred during
the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the New Labor Code did not divest
the Workmen's Compensation Commission of its jurisdiction over the claim for
compensation as the death was the direct result of an illness which supervened
at a time when the Workmen's Compensation Act was in full force and effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his Comment on this petition <span style="">for </span>review, the Solicitor General speaking for respondent
Republic of the Philippines, argues, however, that what was filed here was a
death claim and consequently, the cause of action arose not in 1974 but on
February 1, 1975, the date of death; that no claim for sickness <span style="">or </span>disability benefits was ever filed
by the employee during her lifetime which could be transmitted to her heirs
upon her death; that inasmuch as the approved leave of absence of the employee
ended on <u>January 2, 1975</u>, it is to be assumed that she was no longer
sick and was able to return to work after that date during which time the New
Labor Code was already in effect and the Government Service Insurance System
and the Employees' Compen­sation Commission had acquired jurisdiction over the
claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is truly lamentable that a short-sighted appraisal of the
situation resulted in the denial of petitioner's claim for compensation for the
illness and death of Aida de Castro.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is undisputable that, as found by Dr. Yolanda <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span>, Aida de Castro was afflicted with chronic rheumatic
heart disease which resulted fatally into congestive heart failure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Heart or cardiac failure is a disease of the
heart caused, among others, by infection,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">The gravity of the illness of Aida was attested by no less than
her "separation record" prepared by the respondent employer, Bureau
of Public Schools, stating that Aida's <u>last day of actual service was
December 19, 1973,</u> and <u>since that date she was on sick leave</u> at
first with pay and later without pay after consuming her leave credit, <u>until
she died on February 1, 1975 which was the "effective date of her

<p class="BODY">All these facts were laid before respondent Commission by Aida's

in whose favor a Special Power of Attorney was executed by Angel de Castro, Jr.
on <st1:date year="1975" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1975</st1:date>,
granting her authority to prosecute the claim.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Segunda</span> <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span> likewise
submitted a letter to the Chief of Regional Office No. 4 re­questing that her
claim <u>be amended to one for sickness benefits</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
but this communication was simply ignored by the Regional Office as well as by
the Workmen's Compensation Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">With t<span style="">he </span>amendment
of petitioner's claim We hold that there was no legal impediment to an outright
award for disability compen<span style="">sation
although the employee, Aida de Castro, had not filed any claim during her
lifetime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The right to compensation for an illness which supervened and was
aggravated in the course of employment is one that may be enforced by the heirs
of the employee upon the latter' s death notwithstanding the failure of <span style="">the </span>employee to file a claim for
disability compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is the
ruling of this Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Adelaida</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Calado</span>, et al. vs.
Workmen's Compensation </u><u><span style="">Commis</span>sion

L-26149, <st1:date year="1971" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1971</st1:date>,
which We reiterate.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Calado</u></span>, the employee, Tomas <span class="SpellE">Calado</span>, contracted tuberculosis in the course of his
employment with <span class="SpellE">Acoje</span> and his illness was known to
his employer, so much so, that the latter persuaded him to resign from the
company; two years thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Calado</span> died of the
same sickness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The widow and children of
the deceased employee then filed a claim for death benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Acting Referee who heard the case denied
death benefits but granted physical disability benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On a motion for reconsideration of <span class="SpellE">Acoje</span>, the Workmen's Compensation Commission reversed the
Referee's decision and absolved the employer holding <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> that the heirs of the employee were not
entitled to recover physical disability benefits because it is a right that
personally belongs to the sick worker which is not transferable to his
dependants upon his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court
set aside the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission and held among
others, in the words of Justice Antonio <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>:</p>

<blockquote>"We do not hesitate to reverse the Commission's decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear to Us that the Acting Referee's
decision which the Commission refused to affirm is more in consonance with the
humane spirit of the Workmen's Compensation Act as a measure of social
justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, to recognize
petitioner's claim as covered by the law, one does not have to resort to
generous liberality in construing its provisions; all that needs be done is to
apply them fairly and reason­ably so that the clearly discernible noble
objective of their enactment may not be defeated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>. . . .</blockquote>

<blockquote>"xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</blockquote>

<blockquote>". . . had the respondent Commission only properly analyzed
all the relevant circumstances of this case…..it would have undoubtedly
realized <u>that </u><u><span style="">in the law in </span></u><u><span style="">e</span></u><u><span style="">quity</span></u>, and precisely because <span class="SpellE">Acoje</span>
failed to comply with the mandatory requirement of the Act for it to report <span class="SpellE">Calado's</span> illness and controvert its resulting liability <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> an omission for whose consequences it should
naturally suffer, <span class="SpellE"><u>Calado</u></span><u> should be deemed a

required </span>claim for disability compensation</u>,<u> </u>within the
meaning of Section 25 of the Act, the moment he reported to the company
hospital and physician and was actually diagnosed and treated thereat for
tuberculosis, a statutory compensable disease . . . . <u>as a matter of law</u>,
<span class="SpellE">Calado</span> <u>must be considered as having actually filed
the required claim</u>, and, in consequence, <u>his right to compensation for
disability</u> corresponding to the period up to his demise, <u>had already
accrued before his death</u> and, accordingly, <u>the same constitutes an asset
of his estate transmissible</u><u><span style=""> to
his</span> heirs</u>, herein petitioners, free, on account of its special
nature, from any liens or obligations." (38 SCRA 567, 573, 583, 584)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The statement in the Comment of the Solicitor General (p.3.) that
the <span class="SpellE">Calado</span> decision is not applicable to the case at
bar because in <span class="SpellE">Calado</span> "the deceased-employee
filed a disability claim during his lifetime" is completely
erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot but emphasize that
such mistaken assertions which may mislead the Court are to be avoided.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Aida de Castro is
similarly situated as Tomas <span class="SpellE">Calado</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In the <span style="">case of Aida de Castro, her employer, respondent Bureau of Public
Schools, had knowledge of her illness and of its serious nature when she did
not return to work from December 19, 1973, and was on con­tinued leave of
absence due to such illness as shown in her service record, and yet the
employer did not controvert the compensability of the illness as required in
Section 45 of the Workmen's Compen­sation Act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Like Tomas <span class="SpellE">Calado</span>, Aida de Castro is <u>deemed
under the law</u> to have actually filed a claim for compensation for her
disability from the time she was unable to resume her classroom teaching, and
her right to compensation survived upon her death and is enforceable by her
heirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her failure to ask for
continuation of her leave of absence from January 3, 1975, is understandable
because as explained by petitioner herein at that time Aida was in a critical
period being "already in her last stretch against her battle with
death" and it is a cruel and gratuitous assertion to assume that because
there was no application for extension of sick leave from January 3, 1975, she
was strong enough to go back to her work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Failure to controvert
results in </span>ultimate <span style="">admission of
compensability and an employer cannot escape liability even if no formal notice
</span>was <span style="">given by the employee of his
claim for compensation when it is shown that the employer had in fact knowledge
of the illness.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The compensability of the
ailment of Aida de Castro cannot be questioned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her heart disease was incurred in the course of her employment and was
aggravated by the strenuous work of teaching school children of tender
age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a number of cases decided in the
year 1976 this Court upheld the compensability of heart failure of an employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Talip</u></span><u>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Catibog</u></span>, it is worthy to note
that Socorro <span class="SpellE">Catibog</span>, a public school teacher, filed
on <u>March 10, 1975</u> a claim for compensation benefits under the Workmen's
Compensation Act for her illness of high blood pressure which occurred sometime
on or <u>prior to July, 1974</u> and caused her to go on sick leave on various
occasions and eventually to retire on December 20, 1974.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her claim for compensation was granted by the
Referee of Regional Office No. 5 for failure of the respondent employer to
controvert the claim, but this was set aside by the Workmen's Compensation
Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From that decision Socorro <span class="SpellE">Catibog</span> appealed to this Court and during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of her appeal the Court received a notice of death

The New Labor Code, which took effect on <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="11">November 1, 1974</st1:date>, abolished the Workmen' s Compensation
Commission and in its stead, the Employees' Compensation Commission was
created. The Code vests the original and exclusive jurisdiction over claims
arising from disability of private employees on the Social Security System and
of government employees on the Government Service Insurance System. To allow
the Workmen's Compensation Commission to wind up its affairs and "to
enable the Department of Labor, the Social Security System, the Government
Service Insurance System and the Philippine Medical Care Commission to perfect
the organiza­tion of the Employees' Compensation Commission and all the
programs under it," Presidential Decree No. 608 was issued, suspending the
<span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the operation of Titles II and III or
Book IV of the same Code on "Employees' Compensation and State Insurance
Fund" and "Medicare", respectively, from November 1, 1974 to
January 1, 1975. To provide guidelines as to the disposition of claims arising
during the transition period, Presidential Decree No. 626 was likewise issued,
thus introducing new provisions to the New Labor Code, Title II, Book on
Prescription of Offenses and Claims of the original Labor Code finally reads as
