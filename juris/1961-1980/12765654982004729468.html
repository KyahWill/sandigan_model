				<BR><BR><p>Jose Malimit and Esteban Degamo were opposing candidates for mayor, whereas 
Vicente Acain ran for vice-mayor, of Carmen, Agusan, in the general elections 
held on November 10, 1959. On the 16th of said month the municipal board of 
canvassers, by a vote of five to three, proclaimed Malimit as mayor-elect but 
suspended the canvass and corresponding proclamation in relation to the position 
of vice-mayor, at the request of Acain who claimed that the election returns for 
two precincts had been tampered with. As the three members of the board of 
canvassers who voted against the proclamation of Malimit refused to sign the 
certificate of canvass on the ground that the municipal treasurer's copy of the 
election returns for precinct No. 6 had been tampered with by making it appear 
therein that Malimit had obtained 139 instead of 39 votes, the matter was 
submitted to the Commission on Elections who, on November 24, 1959, nullified 
the canvass and proclamation made on November 16, and authorized its 
representative in Agusan to appoint substitutes for the five members of the 
board of canvassers who voted in favor thereof. </p>
<p>On December 3, 1959, Malimit filed with Us a petition for certiorari and 
prohibition, with a prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction, to annul the 
above-mentioned resolution of the Commission on Elections and prevent its 
enforcement, but the same was dismissed for lack of merit.</p>
<p>After a recanvass of the votes for mayor and vice-mayor the reconstituted 
board of canvassers, on December 7,1959, proclaimed Degamo and Palarca as mayor 
and vice-mayor elect by 1,012 and 944 votes, respectively, as against their 
closest opponents, Malimit and Acain, who obtained 957 and 483 votes, 
respectively. </p>
<p>On December 14, 1959 Malimit instituted quo warranto proceedings against 
Degamo in the Court of First Instance of Agusan. The complaint was later amended 
to include the office of vice-mayor (Special Case No. 97), and on December 21, 
1959 Malimit also filed an election protest against Degamo in the same court 
(Election Case No. 16). </p>
<p>On January 4, 1960 Malimit and Acain filed a petition for certiorari, 
mandamus and prohibition, with preliminary injunction, with Us (G. R. No. 
L-16445) to annul the proclamation of Degamo and Palarca and prohibit them from 
assuming office. On May 23, 1960, We dismissed the petition holding that "upon 
the filing of the aforementioned petition for a writ of quo warranto and 
election protest on December 17 and 28, 1959, respectively, the Court of First 
Instance of Agusan acquired exclusive authority to inquire into and pass upon 
the title of Degamo and the validity of the proclamation made by the municipal 
board of canvassers on December 7, 1959", and that "We cannot, upon the 
authority of the petition herein filed on January 4, 1960, determine said 
questions without encroaching upon the jurisdiction of said court of first 
instance, which is the duty of this body, as the highest Court of the land, not 
only to respect, but, also to uphold". </p>
<p>On October 8, 1960, the Court of First Instance of Agusan, after a 
preliminary hearing, issued a resolution dismissing the petition for quo 
warranto mentioned heretofore for having been filed out of time and for lack of 
jurisdiction, the pertinent portions thereof reading as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After a careful examination of the record of the case, the Court finds that 
on December M, 1959, Jose Malimit, thru Counsel, bailed to the Clerk of Court of 
First Instance or Agusan one, Copy of a petition fur quo warranto against 
Esteban Degamo on the ground that the latter was not eligible for the Office of 
Mayor of Carmen, Agusan, for lack of residence. This letter was received by the 
Clerk of Court on December 17, 1950. Jose Malimit's counsel in the preliminary 
hearing manifested that a money order for the amount of P16.00 to cover the 
docketing fee was enclosed in the envelope containing the petition but this is 
contradicted by Official Receipt 177450 which shows that the amount of P16.00 
was actually received on January 5, 1960, the date when said official receipt 
was issued." </p>
<p>"On January 7, 1960, according to the note of the docket clerk written at the 
bottom of the petition, said petition was brought to the attention of the Court 
for the first time and forthwith an order was issued requiring respondent 
Esteban Degumo to answer the petition within five days from receipt of said 
order which shall be served upon the latter by the Sheriff." </p>
<p>"For failure to pay the sheriff's fees, the order of the Court of January 7, 
1960 was not served upon the respondent immediately. Not until March 14, 1960 
when the fee was paid that the sheriff transmitted said order to the Chief of 
Police of Carmen, Agusan, for service upon the respondent. This is more than two 
months from the date of its issuance by the Court." </p>
<p>"On June 3, I960, without leave of Court, the original petition amended. The 
amended petition included two quo warrantos, one for the office of Mayor and the 
other for Vice-Mayor. The consolidation of these two quo warrantos in one single 
case is, in the opinion of the Court, improper, following the spirit of Section 
171 of the Revised Election Code which provides that each contest shall refer 
exclusively to one office. Granting, however, that this consolidation is legal, 
still the amended petition could no longer confer jurisdiction upon the Court 
because it was filed out of time, to be exact nearly six months after the 
proclamation of the respondents as mayor and vice-mayor of Carmen." </p>
<p>"In fact, even the original quo warranto for the office of mayor was filed 
out of time. The proclamation of Esteban Degamo as mayor took place on December 
7, 1959 and although the petition for quo warranto was mailed on December 14, 
1959 to the Clerk of Court and under the Rules, the date of mailing is consdered 
the date of filing, yet for lack of docketing fee and extra of the petition, 
said petition was only docketed on January 7, 1960, <i>one month</i> after the 
proclamation of respondent Esteban Degamo. The petition was considered only 
filed on the date the docketing fee was paid." </p>
<p>"Under section 173 of the Revised Election Code, a petition <i>a quo</i> 
warranto must be filed <i>within one week</i> after proclamation and shall be 
decided <i>within thirty days</i> from the filing of the complaint From the 
records, it is evident that both the original petition and the amended petition 
for quo warranto were filed out of time and the period of thirty days for 
hearing and decision has long expired thru Urn inaction of the petitioner." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>The court likewise dismissed the election case of Malimit against Degamo for 
failure on the part of the former to prosecute his case, and for lack of 
jurisdiction. We agree with the trial court that the quo warranto proceeding was 
commenced after the expiration of the period of one week after proclamation 
provided therefor by law (Section 173, Revised Election Code). True, the 
original petition was mailed and addressed to the Clerk of the Court of First 
Instance of Agusan on December 14, 1959, but it is likewise true that the 
required docket fee3 were paid only on January 5, I960. This latter date must be 
deemed to be the real date of filing of the aforesaid petition and not the date 
when it was mailed. Before the payment of docket fees the case is not deemed 
duly registered and docketed (Lazaro vs. Endencia, 57 Phil., 552; In the matter 
of the petition for citizenship of Jimmy Lee, G. R. No. L-15027, January 81, 
1964). </p>
<p>It not being disputed that the proclamation of Degamo as mayor-elect was made 
on December 7, 1959, it is clear that the petition for quo warranto was filed 
out of time. </p>
<p>With respect to the election protest mentioned heretofore, the record 
discloses that the same was dismissed not for lack of jurisdiction — as 
appellant claims in his third assignment of error — but due to his failure to 
prosecute the case (Order of the lower court of July 18, 1960), </p>
<p>Consequently, appellant's contention in this regard is without merit. </p>
<p>Wherefore, the orders appealed from are affirmed, with costs. </p>
<p><i>Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Regala, 
Bengzon, J. P.</i> and <i>Zaldivar, JJ.</i> concur. </p>
