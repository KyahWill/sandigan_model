				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On April 8, 1960, respondents Northwest Airlines Philippines Employees 
Association, Antonio Suarez, Brigido Sibug, and Louise Mateu filed with 
respondent Court of Industrial Relations a joint petition for injunction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> against petitioner Northwest Airlines, 
Inc. alleging, <i>inter alia</i>, that respondents Suarez, Sibug, and Mateu are 
employees of petitioner company; that on January 28, 1958, respondents Suarez 
and Sibug filed with respondent Court an unfair labor practice case docketed as 
Case No. 1553-ULP, and respondent Mateu also filed with the same court an unfair 
labor practice case docketed as Case No. 1205-ULP against petitioner company; 
that Case No. 1205-ULP was amicably settled, while in Case No. 1553-ULP, 
respondents Sibug and Suarez were ordered reinstated to their positions, under 
the same terms and conditions before their dismissal;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> that on February 29, 1960, respondents 
Suarez, Sibug, and Mateu received from petitioner company a notice of 
termination of their services on May 1, 1960 in Manila, but that if they wished 
to, they could be reemployed in Tokyo; that said termination of employment is 
contrary to the decision of respondent Court in Case No. 1553-ULP and to the 
settlement entered into between the parties in the case of respondent Mateu in 
Case No. 1205-ULP; that petitioner company is making said termination of 
employment because they have filed cases against it with respondent Court; that 
by re-employing respondents in Tokyo as an alternative to their dismissal, 
petitioner company seeks to have them outside of the protection of Philippine 
labor laws; that petitioner company will terminate their employment unless they 
accede to re-employment in Tokyo on May 1, 1960, and the same will terminate 
their employment unless they accede to in Case No. 1553-ULP; and that great and 
irreparable injury will be sustained by respondents, in case their employment is 
terminated by petitioner company, or if they refuse to accede to being 
re-employed in Tokyo. Respondents, therefore, prayed that pending final 
determination of the case, respondent Court issue a writ of preliminary 
injunction enjoining petitioner company from carrying out the termination of 
their employment.
<p>On April 26, 1960, petitioner company received notice of hearing from 
respondent Court as to Case No. 1553-ULP, set for April 28, 1960. The notice of 
hearing did not mention Case No. 1205-ULP. Pursuant thereto, the parties through 
their respective counsel, appeared before respondent Court on said date. At the 
hearing, petitioner company manifested that having received notice of hearing as 
to Case No. 1553-ULP only, it was limiting its appearance to said case. Hearing 
proceeded accordingly, both parties presenting their respective evidence.</p>
<p>On April 30, 1960, respondent Court granted a writ of preliminary injunction 
to respondents Association, Suarez, Sibug, and Mateu, in an order which 
reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"ORDER</p>
<p>"Complainants Northwest Airlines Philippine Employees Association (NAPEA), 
Antonio Suarez, Brigido Sibug, and Louise Mateu pray that a preliminary 
injunction be issued against respondent Northwest Airlines, Inc., to enjoin it 
from terminating the services of Antonio Suarez, Brigido Sibug, and Louise Mateu 
before judgment.</p>
<p>"The facts are these: Suarez, Sibug, and Mateu are employees of the company. 
On January 28, 1958, Suarez and Sibug filed Case No. 1553-ULP and on February 
11, 1957, Mateu filed Case No. 1205-ULP, all against the company. While Case No. 
1205-ULP was amicably settled and Mateu continued in the services of the 
company, in Case No. 1553-ULP, Suarez and Sibug were ordered reinstated as 
flight attendants of the company.</p>
<p>"On February 29, 1960, respondent company sent a notice to Suarez, Sibug, and 
Mateu that their services would be terminated an May 1, 1960, unless they accept 
re-employment in Tokyo (Exhibits A and B).</p>
<p>"By re-employing the complainants in Tokyo, as an alternative of their 
dismissal, the respondent places them outside of the protection of the 
Philippine Labor Laws and violates the decision in Case No. 1553-ULP and the 
settlement in Case No. 1205-ULP.</p>
<p>"Respondent claims that Suarez was offered another position in Manila but 
that he refused to accept because, being supervisory, it is a non-union job. By 
accepting the same, Suarez would lose the protection of his union.</p>
<p>"Since an injunction may be granted in order to preserve the status quo until 
the title can be determined (Golding vs. Balatbat, 36 Phil., 941) this Court, 
after notifying the respondent and hearing both parties and after a bond in the 
amount of P1,000.00 has been filed by complainants, hereby orders the respondent 
to desist and refrain from terminating the services of Suarez, Sibug, and Mateu 
and in case it has already dismissed them, to put them back to their former 
positions, under the same terms and conditions before their dismissal, pending 
the termination of this litigation, or unless a contrary order is issued by this 
Court.</p>
<p>"SO ORDERED."</p></blockquote>
<p>On May 4,1960, petitioner company filed separate motions for reconsideration 
in Cases Nos 1553-ULP and 1205-ULP. In his motion for reconsideration relating 
to Case No. 1205-ULP, he alleged that (1) said case had been dismissed in 1957, 
which dismissal is final and respondent Court "had no jurisdiction" to issue the 
order of April 30, 1960; (2) that there was no hearing on said case and hence, 
there is also no jurisdiction to issue said order; and (3) there was no previous 
award or order in said case, and no labor dispute was alleged in respondents' 
petition for injunction which, if proven, could be the basis for issuance of 
preliminary injunction. To said motions for reconsideration, respondents filed a 
reply on May 7, 1960 alleging that the records will show that their petition for 
injunction filed on April 8, 1960 referred not only to respondents Suarez and 
Sibug, but also to respondent Mateu as may be seen from the caption of said 
petition; that while the clerical error committed in the notice of hearing 
received by petitioner company made it appear that only Case No. 1553-ULP was 
being heard, the records will show that the matter being heard was "the 
injunction petition and not the unfair labor practice cases"; that petitioner 
cannot claim lack of notice, because it was duly informed by the allegations 
contained in said petition for injunction which it had received and to which it 
replied; and that the injunction with reference to respondent Mateu is 
preliminary and, therefore, interlocutory in nature and is improper for 
reconsideration and should be brought only in the hearing on the merits. On May 
13, 1960, respondent Court denied said motions for reconsideration in its 
resolution <i>en banc</i> of the following tenor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"RESOLUTION</p>
<p>"These are motions filed by counsel for respondents for the reconsideration 
of the Order of Trial Court dated April 30, 1960. After a careful perusal of the 
records as well as the arguments of both parties, the Court <i>en banc</i> fails 
to find sufficient justification for altering or modifying the aforesaid 
Order.</p>
<p>"BOTH MOTIONS DENIED.</p>
<p>"SO ORDERED ."</p></blockquote>
<p>On September 2, 1960, petitioner company filed with this Court the present 
petition for certiorari, insofar only as Louise Mateu (Case No. 1205(1)-ULP) is 
concerned, with a prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction to enjoin 
respondent Court pending the determination of the case on its merits from 
executing its order of April 30, 1960 with respect to respondent Louise Mateu. 
In due time, we issued the preliminary injunction prayed for.</p>
<p>We find merit in petitioner-company's contention that respondent Court acted 
without or in excess of its jurisdiction in granting the writ of preliminary 
injunction insofar as respondent Mateu is concerned. The writ was granted on a 
mere verified motion presented as an incident in Case No. 1205-ULP which was 
dismissed on May 30, 1957.</p>
<p>As far as can be gathered from the records before us, that case involved the 
propriety or legality of the deductions made by the company from the salary of 
respondent Mateu covering medical bills advanced by the company in Tokyo for 
Miss Mateu. Claiming that the deductions were not authorized by law, Miss Mateu 
filed said Case No. 1205-ULP. Miss Mateu having questioned the deduction, the 
company felt it could not under the law withhold a part of the employee's wages 
as it was strictly not a debt due but a disputed obligation. Hence, the company 
refunded the deduction and the parties amicably settled the case. Respondent 
Court upon agreement of the parties dismissed the case on May 30, 1957, in an 
order which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"ORDER</p>
<p>"It appearing that respondents, thru their counsel, and with the conformity 
of the herein complainant (respondent Mateu herein), moved for dismissal cf the 
above-entitled case on the ground that they have already amicably settled the 
same, let this case be, as it is hereby, DISMISSED.</p>
<p>"SO ORDERED."</p></blockquote>
<p>As it appears, the only matter involved in that Case No. 1205—ULP was the 
payment of medical expenses incurred by Miss Mateu while in Japan. At most, it 
concerned the question as to who was liable for such payment, the employee or 
the company, and whether the same was deductible from the employee's salary. 
Nothing was mentioned nor was there anything from the pleadings or the order of 
dismissal from which it could be inferred about the continuance or 
discontinuance of Miss Mateu in the service of the company. Upon the other hand, 
the present petition for injunction seeks to enjoin petitioner company from 
terminating the employment of respondent Mateu on entirely different ground. 
There is clearly no connection whatsoever between the two cases, both in issue 
and subject matter. True it is, that under Section 17 of Commonwealth Act No. 
103, the Court of Industrial Relations may, on application of an interested 
party, and after due hearing, "alter, modify in whole or in part, or set aside 
any such award, order or decision, or reopen any question involved therein" 
during the effectiveness of said decision or award, and that if the effectivity 
is not therein specified, any of the interested parties may terminate the 
effectiveness of the decision or award three (3) years thereafter. But this 
applies only where the subsequent matter is incidental or related to the 
original or main case and not where, as in the instant case, the new controversy 
has absolutely no relation or is alien to the original or main case. To hold 
otherwise would be to grant to respondent Court excessive or broad powers, not 
conferred or contemplated by the statute. The question of employment and lay off 
of respondent Mateu, it is recalled, was never an issue in the original or main 
Case No. 1205-ULP filed and dismissed in 1957. In the circumstances, it would be 
unfair to restrain petitioner company by injunction from terminating her 
(Mateu's) employment in a case filed merely as an incident to a main case of an 
entirely different issue and subject matter.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the herein petition for certiorari and prohibition is granted and 
the order of respondent Court (dated April 30, 1960) as well as its resolution 
en bane (of May 13, 1960) affirming said order insofar as respondent Louise is 
concerned, are hereby set aside, without prejudice to the right of respondent 
Mateu to question her lay-off in a separate appropriate proceeding. The 
preliminary injunction heretofore issued by this Court is made permanent. No 
costs. So ordered.</p>
