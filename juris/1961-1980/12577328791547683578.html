				<BR><STRONG>REGALA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal &nbsp;from the &nbsp;order &nbsp;dated November &nbsp;3, 1959 of &nbsp;the Court &nbsp;of First Instance of Pangasinan, Dagupan &nbsp;Branch, &nbsp;Hon. &nbsp;Emmanuel &nbsp;M. &nbsp;Munoz, &nbsp;Presiding Judge,&nbsp; denying defendants' motion &nbsp;to &nbsp;quash &nbsp;the writ &nbsp;of execution. &nbsp;&nbsp;The &nbsp;appeal, originally brought to &nbsp;the Court of Appeals, was certified to this Court &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;ground &nbsp;that only questions of law are involved. <p>In an action for the collection of a sum &nbsp;of money in the lower court, &nbsp;the parties &nbsp; hereto &nbsp;entered into a &nbsp;compromise agreement which reads:</p> <blockquote> <p>"Now &nbsp;come &nbsp;the &nbsp;parties, &nbsp;assisted &nbsp;by their &nbsp;respective attorneys, and &nbsp;to this Hon. Court respectfully &nbsp;submit the following agreement and &nbsp; settlement of his &nbsp;case:</p> <p>1. &nbsp;That &nbsp;the defendants &nbsp;herein admit &nbsp; having &nbsp;been &nbsp;indebted &nbsp;to the plaintiffs in the amount of P6,475.26 and hereby confess judgment thereto in &nbsp;favor of the plaintiffs;</p> <p>2. That herein defendants agree and covenant to effect payment of said obligation on &nbsp;the &nbsp;following terms:</p> <blockquote> <p>(a) That the &nbsp;sum of P1,000.00 should be paid by the defendants to the plaintiffs on &nbsp;or &nbsp;about January &nbsp;20, 1959;<br> (b) &nbsp;That the defendants likewise should pay to &nbsp;the &nbsp;plaintiffs the sum of P475.26 on or about March 20<br> (c) &nbsp;That the &nbsp; remaining &nbsp;balance of &nbsp;P5,000.00 shall be paid by the defendants to the. plaintiffs &nbsp; within a period of one &nbsp;(1) year at &nbsp;12% &nbsp;interest &nbsp;from March 20, &nbsp;1951) &nbsp;in equal monthly installments &nbsp;with &nbsp;corresponding &nbsp;interest as &nbsp;computed. </p> </blockquote> <p>3. That &nbsp;to &nbsp;secure &nbsp;the &nbsp;faithful &nbsp;compliance &nbsp; and &nbsp;&nbsp;performance of said obligation, defendants herein, &nbsp;by &nbsp;those &nbsp;presents, cede &nbsp;and convey &nbsp;by &nbsp;way cf security, &nbsp;free from &nbsp;any &nbsp;lien the following real properties &nbsp;which are owned &nbsp;by them, &nbsp;and &nbsp;all and whatever proprietary rights, interest, or participation which &nbsp;they &nbsp;have therein: (Here follows &nbsp;a description of the &nbsp;parcel of land.)</p> <p>4. In the event defendants fail to &nbsp;pay the above-mentioned obligation under the terms herein &nbsp;set forth, &nbsp;or in &nbsp; default of two &nbsp;of &nbsp;the installments, &nbsp;whatever &nbsp;balance remaining shall &nbsp; immediately become due and payable and herein plaintiffs can secure the immediate execution of the judgment in &nbsp;the case, and the defendants waive &nbsp;whatever right a mortgagor m;iy &nbsp; have &nbsp;short&nbsp; &nbsp;of foreclosure proceedings. A penal &nbsp;clause &nbsp;is inserted in &nbsp;this agreement &nbsp;to &nbsp;the effect &nbsp;that if defendants fail to perform&nbsp; their obligation &nbsp;an additional &nbsp;10% shall be charged in addition to the &nbsp; interest, agreed upon, &nbsp;to cover damages of plaintiffs."</p> </blockquote> <p>This agreement was &nbsp;approved &nbsp;by the lower court &nbsp;in &nbsp;its decision dated December &nbsp;12, 1959 &nbsp;in &nbsp;which it enjoined the parties to comply with &nbsp;the &nbsp;terms&nbsp; of &nbsp; the agreement.</p> <p>Alter &nbsp;paying the &nbsp;first two installments &nbsp;of &nbsp;P1,000 and P475.26, &nbsp; however, the &nbsp;&nbsp;defendants &nbsp;failed &nbsp;to make further payments, prompting the &nbsp; plaintiff's to &nbsp;ask for the execution of the decision.</p> <p>The trial &nbsp;court granted &nbsp;the motion and directed the issuance &nbsp;of a writ &nbsp;of &nbsp;execution. &nbsp;&nbsp;For some &nbsp;reason, the Writ expired &nbsp;without being served and so, &nbsp;an alias &nbsp;writ of execution &nbsp;was &nbsp;later &nbsp;issued, &nbsp;commanding &nbsp;the sheriff&nbsp; to cause the satisfaction of &nbsp;the balance &nbsp;of P5,000, plus &nbsp;P300 as interest and P500 as penalty, out of the three parcels&nbsp; of land given as security and &nbsp; providing that "if the three (3) &nbsp;above described &nbsp;real &nbsp;properties &nbsp;are not sufficient or cannot be found whereof to satisfy this execution and lawful fees &nbsp;thereon, then we command you, that of the other goods and &nbsp;chattels of the said defendants, &nbsp;to make the said sum of money in the manner required by law * * *,"</p> <p>Defendants moved &nbsp;to quash &nbsp;the writ on &nbsp;the ground that the above quoted portion varies the decision of the court and, when their motion &nbsp;was denied, they appealed.</p> <p>The main issue hinges on the interpretation of the judgment of the court based upon the compromise of the parties. Is the writ of execution &nbsp;issued by the court in accordance &nbsp;with the judgment?</p> <p>Defendants &nbsp;contend &nbsp;that it must &nbsp;first &nbsp;be shown that the three &nbsp;lots are &nbsp;insufficient before &nbsp;the sheriff &nbsp;may be authorized to levy on &nbsp;other properties. In support of their stand, defendants &nbsp;cite Section 34 &nbsp;of Rule &nbsp;39 of the Rules of Court which provides:</p> <blockquote> <p>"When &nbsp;an execution issued in accordance with law against &nbsp;the property of a judgment &nbsp;debtor, or any of several debtors in &nbsp;the same judgment, is returned unsatisfied, in &nbsp;whole or in &nbsp;part, &nbsp;the judgment &nbsp;creditor, at any time after &nbsp;such return is made, shall be entitled to an order from a judge of the Court of First Instance of the province in which the judgment was rendered or from which the execution was &nbsp;returned, &nbsp;requiring such &nbsp;judgment &nbsp;debtor &nbsp;to appear and &nbsp;answer concerning his &nbsp;property &nbsp;and income before &nbsp;such judge of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Court &nbsp;of &nbsp;First Instance, or &nbsp;before a &nbsp;commissioner appointed by him, at a specified time and place; and such proceedings may thereupon be had for the application of the property and income of the judgment &nbsp;debtor &nbsp;towards the satisfaction &nbsp;of the judgment. But no judgment debtor shall &nbsp;be &nbsp;so &nbsp;required to appear before a judge of first instance or commissioner but of the province in which such &nbsp;debtor resides or &nbsp;is found."</p> </blockquote> <p>The above- quoted provision &nbsp;applies to a situation where execution cannot be satisfied because the judgment debtor has concealed all his properties in order to prevent execution. &nbsp;Here there is no concealment of properties.</p> <p>While it is true that the compromise agreement refers to the three parcels of land given as security for the satisfaction of the judgment, yet the said judgment &nbsp;did not state or limit that if the said properties are found insufficient the other properties of the defendants may not be held liable. </p> <p>We believe that the order of writ of execution substantially conforms with &nbsp;the judgment. &nbsp;&nbsp;However, &nbsp;execution should &nbsp;first be directed against the three parcels &nbsp;of &nbsp;land before the other properties of the defendants may be levied.</p> <p>Wherefore, the order appealed from is affirmed with costs against the defendants.</p> <p><i>Bengzon, C. J., &nbsp;Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, &nbsp;Concepcion, &nbsp;Barrera, &nbsp; Paredes, &nbsp;Dizon,</i> &nbsp;and &nbsp;<i>Makalintal, &nbsp;JJ.,</i> concur.</p> </div>
