and Santiago <span class="SpellE">Tilos</span> were detention prisoners in the <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental provincial jail situated in <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
January 6, 1965, they were removed from their cells and taken to the yard, also
within the jail, by and under the custody of Francisco Castillo, one of the
provincial guards.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was the practice of the Guards to take out from the cells some
prisoners and assign them some work in their households inside the jail or at
the yard therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such cases, the
guard who takes the prisoners signs for their custody.</p>

<p class="BODY">At around eleven o'clock that evening, Rolando Cas­tillo, son of
provincial guard Francisco Castillo, who lived with his father inside the jail,
came from the dance hall about 100 meters in front of the jail, where there was
a dance, and went inside the jail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
there he in­vited detention prisoners Santiago <span class="SpellE">Tilos</span>
and Rolando <span class="SpellE">Ban­hao</span> to go with him to the dance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first <span class="SpellE">Banhao</span>
said that he did not want to go without the permission of Ro­lando Castillo's
father, their custodian.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rolando
Castillo, however, told him not to worry as he, Rolando Cas­tillo, will answer
for the consequences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, thereupon,
the three went out through the prison's rear gate and proceeded towards the
dance hall.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the dance hall's entrance, Rolando Castillo and Santiago <span class="SpellE">Tilos</span> bought tickets.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rolando <span class="SpellE">Banhao</span> preferred to stay outside,
saying that he did not know how to dance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rolando Castillo and Santiago <span class="SpellE">Tilos</span> entered
the dance hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rolando <span class="SpellE">Banhao</span> stood near the dance hall by the side of its gate;
his two companions were able to dance.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a while, there was a shower.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rolando Castillo and Santiago <span class="SpellE">Tilos</span> were standing near <span class="SpellE">Banhao</span>,
after hav­ing brought the girls they were dancing with to their res­pective
places.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since there was a shower, the
people in the dance hall went out of said hall.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At this point, while people were going out, Rolando <span class="SpellE">Banhao</span>
saw Santiago <span class="SpellE">Tilos</span> stab a man in white shirt, hitting
the latter in front.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said man who was
stabbed went back to the dance hall.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Shouts of stabbing followed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Santiago <span class="SpellE">Tilos</span> and Rolando Castillo ran back
to the provincial jail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rolan­do <span class="SpellE">Banhao</span> followed them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And there, inside the jail, <span class="SpellE">Banhao</span> overheard
his two companions talk about the stab­bing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The person stabbed, identified as <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Olivas</span>, died the next day in the provincial hospital
of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, due to a stab wound, two inches
long, which penetrated and cut through his abdominal cavity, causing severe
internal hemorrhage.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing is the substance of the prosecution's evidence
against defendant Santiago <span class="SpellE">Tilos</span> in support of the
information for murder filed against him on September 9, 1965 in the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rolando Castillo also included in said
information, was at large and thus not included in the trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense sought to establish, on the other hand, that Santiago
<span class="SpellE">Tilos</span> never left the jail that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from his own testimony to this effect,
defendant through counsel presented the prison's "Custodians Report of
Prisoners for January 6, 1965" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1)<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
which shows Ro­lando <span class="SpellE">Banhao</span> in the list of those
under protective cus­tody (taken out of the cell) that day, but does not in­clude
defendant's name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Francisco Castillo,
the provin­cial guard, was also presented by the defense to prove that
defendant never got out of the jail on the date in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, defendant was found guilty, as charged, of murder
and sentenced to suffer <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>,
to indemnify the deceased's heirs in the amount of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
and to, pay the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appeal was taken
by defendant to the Court of Appeals which properly certified the same to this
Court, in view of the penalty imposed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present case turns on the credibility of prose­cution
eyewitness Rolando <span class="SpellE">Banhao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant contends that said witness merely
"invented" the story against him because they had previously <span class="SpellE">quarrelled</span>, and almost came to blows, over the rationing of
food in the jail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an incident,
though capable of producing some bad feelings between the two, cannot suffice
to cause Rolan­do <span class="SpellE">Banhao</span> to testify falsely against
the defendant and impute on him the grave offense of murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The friction engendered by such quarrel,
therefore, does not impair Rolando <span class="SpellE">Banhao's</span>
credibility, as found and sustained by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule to follow here is that the finding
of the trial court in regard to credibility of a witness shall not be disturbed
in the absence of serious, forceful and cogent reasons that render the
testimony un­acceptable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in this
case, <span class="GramE">We</span> found none.</p>

<p class="BODY">The so-called list of persons taken out from the cells in the
"Custodian's Report" for the day is not con­clusive evidence that
defendant was not so taken out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, his
own witness, provincial guard Francisco Castillo, testified that he took
defendant that day out of his cell and into his custody (TSN, <span class="SpellE">Akot</span>, p. 34), and that, on January 6, 1965, he was the guard
in custody of Rolando <span class="SpellE">Banhao</span> and the defendant (TSN, <span class="SpellE">Akot</span>, p. 42).</p>

<p class="BODY">As well observed by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, the trio could
have easily passed through the rear gate, considering that Rolando Castillo was
the son of one of the provin­cial guards.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither was said rear gate heavily guarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Francisco Castillo testified that it had only
"a guard" (TSN, <span class="SpellE">Akot</span>, p. 40).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General in his brief recommends that defendant be
found guilty only of homicide, stating that, in his view, treachery is not
borne out by the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
consideration, however, of the facts shown in the record, particularly Rolando <span class="SpellE">Banhao's</span> testimony, convinces <span class="GramE">Us</span>
that treachery has been adequately esta­blished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As recounted by said witness, defendant
stabbed the deceased at the time when, on account of the shower, people were
going out of the dance hall to seek for cover.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Advantage was therefore taken by defendant of the rela­tive confusion
created by the shower on the crowd, so that his act and identity would not be
detected by the people in the dance hall, and so that his escape would be
facilitated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record, therefore,
fully supports defendant's conviction for murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sentence imposed is correct.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appealed judgment is affirmed, without
costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let a copy of this decision be
sent to the Hono­rable Secretary of Justice, for proper action with reference
to the continuation of the prosecution of Rolando Castillo.</p>
