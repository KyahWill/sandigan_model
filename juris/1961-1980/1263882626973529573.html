				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In Civil Case No. 3849-M of the Court of First Instance of
Bulacan, <u>Malolos branch</u>, <span class="GramE">the</span> provincial sheriff
filed an interpleader action on <st1:date year="1969" day="7" month="10">October
 7, 1969</st1:date> against Rafael A. Santos, Jr. and Hermogenes Reyes,
Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sheriff prayed that <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
and Reyes should litigate their claims with respect to certain parcels of land
which were mortgaged by <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> to
the Second Bulacan Development Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the foreclosure sale, they were sold to Reyes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> claimed to have redeemed
the lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, Reyes and <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
had conflicting claims over those said lands.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, on October 13, 1969 Santos filed in the <u>Valenzuela
branch</u> of the same court a complaint against Hermogenes Reyes, Jr., Belen
A. Carlos, Dolores Alarilla, Leoncio Carlos, Manuel A. Carlos, Second Bulacan
Development Bank, Flor F. Resurreccion (the provincial sheriff in the
interpleader case), Jose F. Reyes (deputy sheriff), Soledad Banzon de Jesus
(register of deeds of Bulacan), and Hermogenes Puatu, (deputy register of
deeds).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
prayed <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u> that the contracts regarding the same parcels
of land be declared void, that the new titles for the said lands issued to
Reyes be cancelled, and that <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>'
old titles be reinstated (Civil Case No. 545-V).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1969</st1:date>
<st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> filed a motion in the
Malolos interpleader case for its dismissal or at least its consolidation with
the Valenzuela case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge
denied the motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Valenzuela case the defendants filed a motion to dis­miss
some of the causes of action because of the pendency of the Malolos case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Valenzuela court in its order of January
21, 1970 announced that, if within ten days from notice, the sheriff did not
move for the dismissal of the Malolos case, which admittedly involved issues
being litigated in the Valenzuela case, or if the parties could not secure a
directive from the Secretary of Justice that the two cases should be tried in
only one branch, then the Valenzuela court would forward Civil Case No. 545-V
to the Malolos court so that it could be tried jointly with Civil Case No.
3849-M.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of those orders of the Malolos and Valenzuela branches, <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,
through his lawyer, Ruben L. Roxas, filed in this Court on <st1:date year="1970" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1970</st1:date> the instant <i>certiorari</i> and
prohibition case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He prayed that the
Malolos case be consolidated with the Valenzuela case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1970</st1:date>
this Court issued a writ of preliminary injunction, restraining the Malolos
Judge from taking cognizance of the interpleader case and from interfering with
the trial of the Valenzuela case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
virtue of that injunction, the Malolos case was frozen and the trial of the
Valenzuela case proceeded.</p>

<p class="BODY">The parties herein in their joint manifestation of <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1977</st1:date> stated that the
judgement rendered in the Valenzuela case on <st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1975</st1:date> had become final and that the Malolos case
and the instant case have become moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this case is dismissed for having become
moot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
