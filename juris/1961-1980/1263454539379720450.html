				<H3>PERFECTO D. KORDOVEZ, PETITIONER-APPELLANT,
VS. SOFRONIO C. CARMONA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS MAYOR OF
THE CITY OF SAN CARLOS, RESPONDENT-APPELLEE.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner Perfecto D. <span class="SpellE">Kordovez</span> was a
desk sergeant of the police force of the City of <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Carlos</st1:place></st1:city>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental</st1:placename></st1:place>,
with the required civil service eligibility.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Having been charged administratively by the respondent mayor for
violation of law or duty, he was suspended from office on <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due investigation of the charges, the Municipal Board, on <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1962</st1:date>, rendered a
decision dismissing him from the service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Thereupon and within the period provided for in Republic
Act No. 557, he appealed to the Com­missioner of Civil Service.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Sixty days after the date of his suspension (September 19, 1962)
petitioner asked the respondent mayor to order <span style="">his </span>reinstatement pending appeal, invoking the provisions of <span style="">Section 35 of Republic Act No. 2260,
otherwise known as the Civil Service Act of 1959, in relation to Section 3 of
Republic Act No. 557, and our ruling in the case of <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
Garcia vs. the Hon. Executive Secretary, et al.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent having refused to do so, the petitioner filed with the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental a petition for
Mandamus to secure an order for his reinstatement, to recover back salaries
from </span><st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="11"><span style="">November 19, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, the date which he claimed </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">the end of his 60-day
preventive suspension, and damages </span>(Civil <span style="">Case No. 6862).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After due trial, however, the lower court rendered its decision
dismissing the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this appeal.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To secure a reversal of
the appealed decision, the petitioner relies solely upon the proposition that
under </span>the provisions of Section 35 of Republic Act 2260, otherwise known
as the Civil Service Act of <span style="">1959, he is
en</span>titled to reinstatement because the Commissioner of Civil Service has
not decided his appeal within the period of<span style=""> </span>sixty (60) days after the date of his preventive suspension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no merit in this contention.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law applicable to the present case is Republic Act No. 557,
Section 3, and not the one relied upon by the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to his view, <span class="GramE">We</span>
are of the opinion that no provision of the latter had repealed the
former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Republic Act No. 2260 is a
general law which <span style="">covers public </span>officials
and employees, civil service <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span> <span style="">or not, while Republic </span>Act No. 557 is<span style=""> </span><span style="">a special law </span><span style="">which
applies </span>only to provincial guards, city and municipal policemen with
civil service eligibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of <span style="">conflict between </span>the two kinds of
legislative enactment, <span style="">the rule </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">that the one general in character shall </span>not be deemed to <span style="">have repealed the special law un</span>less
that is expressly and clearly provided in the former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason for this is that the special <span style="">law </span>evinces the particular
legislative intent more clearly.</p>

<p class="BODY">That Section 3 of Republic Act No. 557 was not repealed by
Section 35 of Republic Act. No. 2260 may also be inferred from the fact that
Section 16 of Republic Act No. 4864, otherwise known as the Police Act of 1966
- which took effect on September <span style="">8, </span>1966
- reproduces the last part of Section 3 of Republic Act No. 557 as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Provided, however, That if
the delay in the disposition of the case is due to the fault, negligence, or
petition of the respondent, the period of the delay shall not be counted in
computing the period of suspension herein provided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent shall be entitled to his
salary for the period of suspension upon exoneration."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In connection with such
provision, We have held here­tofore that although under Republic Act No. 557 a
suspended policeman is entitled to reinstatement if the administrative case
against him has not been finally decided within sixty (60) days after his
preventive suspension, such reinstatement can not be demanded if the delay in
the dis­position of his case is due to his own fault or petition </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">when the cause of the delay was the appeal to
the Com­missioner of Civil Service taken by him (<span class="SpellE">Alacar</span>
vs. City etc., 104 Phil. 1018; Martinez vs. Municipal Mayor etc., 103 Phil.
634. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Martinez</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> case (supra), we</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">said the following which applies squarely to
the one before <span class="GramE">Us</span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It will be noticed however, that on the sixtieth day the
council voted by resolution to remove the petitioner from his position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such resolution would have decided the mat­ter
finally if petitioner has not filed <span style="">a </span>notice
of appeal to the Commissioner of Civil Service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, his <span style="">case </span>was
not finally disposed of because of his own voluntary act of appealing which
amounted to a petition for review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
petition excused any delay in the definite disposition of the charges.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Indeed, it would be contrary to the spirit of mandamus
proceedings to compel reinstatement of <span style="">a
</span>suspended officer after the latter had been found guilty and dropped
from the service by the competent official body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such suspended official, it may be said, did
not have a clear legal right (to return) enforceable by mandamus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the court's discretion should not be
exercised in <span style="">a way </span>injurious to
public interest; nor should mandamus issue where it <span class="GramE">would</span>
not promote substantial justice."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with
costs.</p>
