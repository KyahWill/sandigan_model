				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The Commissioner of Immigration has
resorted to this Court in quest of a writ of certiorari with preliminary
injunction, to review and set aside the preliminary injunction issued on
September 26, 1962 by the respondent judge of the Court of First Instance of
Manila, in its case No. 51699, as well as his order, dated, July 29, 1963,
refusing to dissolve said injunction, alleging that the same were issued in
excess of jurisdiction and abuse of discretion. <o:p></o:p><p></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The essential facts are not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>. On June 15, 1960, respondents Chua <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> King alias <span class="SpellE">Insa</span> Lim, wife of
Lim <span class="SpellE">Chiao</span> <span class="SpellE">Cun</span>, then a
Chinese resident of Manila, applied to the Philippine Consulate General at <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> for a non-immigrant Passport Visa for' the
Philippines for her and her three minor children, Richard, Helen, and Douglas
Lim, had with Lim <span class="SpellE">Chiao</span> <span class="SpellE">Cun</span>.
She stated that she and her children desired to enter the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> to visit her husband for three
months, and that upon termination of their stay in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> they would <span class="GramE">proceed</span>
to <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>. On the strength of the application, the
Consulate issued, on </span><st1:date month="6" day="24" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 24, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, a non-immigrant visitor's visa,
valid until </span><st1:date month="6" day="23" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 23, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">At the time of the application for
visa, Lim <span class="SpellE">Chiao</span> <span class="SpellE">Cun</span>.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="GramE">had</span>
already applied for naturalization as a Filipino citizen (Civil Case No. 42020
of the Court of First Instance of Manila), but no mention was made of the fact.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The husband and father Lim <span class="SpellE">Chiao</span> <span class="SpellE">Cun</span>, in his turn, applied
to the Bureau of Immigration for temporary admission of his wife and children,
and posted a cash bond of P22<span class="GramE">,000</span> upon condition,
inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, that the entrants would maintain their
status at admission, and would not violate any limitation or condition of their
admission. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Arriving on </span><st1:date month="6" day="25" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June
 25, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">,
the wife and her children were admitted as temporary visitors with an
authorized stay of 3 months, until </span><st1:date month="9" day="25" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 25,
 1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.
After four extensions and a refusal of further delay, the visitors applied to
the Office of the President, and obtained a fifth prorogation of stay for 15
days from </span><st1:date month="7" day="11" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 11, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Pursuant to a cabinet resolution of
February 9, 1956, empowering the Secretaries of Justice and Foreign Affairs to
act on petitions for extension of temporary stay of visitors, the Secretary of
Foreign Affairs, F. Serrano, on July 17, 1961, referred the matter to the
Secretary of Justice, in an <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">indorsement</span></span>
stating: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><blockquote>"Respectfully returned to the
Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Manila, hereby approving the extension up to June
9, 1963 of the stay of CHUA GIOK KING alias INSA LIM, RICHARD LIM alias LIM WAI
LIM, seven (7) years old, LIM TONG <span class="SpellE">TONG</span>, two (2)

businessman whose petition for naturalization was granted by the "Court of
First Instance of Manila in a decision rendered on June 9, 1961, it appearing
that no appeal has been taken by the Office of the Solicitor General from said
decision (see attached Certificate of the Clerk of Court dated July 15, 1961,
and the Certification of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> Z. <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span>, Chief, Docket Division, Office of the Solicitor
General, dated July 17, 19(51). The herein petitioners will become citizens by
operation of law, if "otherwise qualified, when the decision of the court
becomes <span class="SpellE">executory</span> "after two years from its
promulgation", pursuant to Republic Act No. 520. <span class="GramE">(Opinions

shall secure reentry permits to <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> valid at
least two months over and beyond their extended stay and that they shall
maintain their cash bonds filed with the Bureau of Immigration. This approval
is also subject to the condition that the corresponding fees shall be paid to
the said Bureau."</blockquote><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Upon the advent of a new
administration after the 1961 elections, the new Secretaries of Foreign Affairs
and Justice ruled that the power to extend the stay of aliens was vested by Law
not in them but in the Commissioner of Immigration; and, accordingly, said
officer, on August 29, 1962, issued Immigration Circular No. <span class="GramE">V-l0l,
approved by the Secretary of Justice, abrogating all extensions of stay of
temporary visitors.</span> Private respondents, Lim <span class="SpellE">Chiao</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cun</span>, his wife Chua <span class="SpellE">Giok</span>
King, and their children then filed action in the Court of First Instance of
Manila to enjoin the petitioner, Commissioner of Immigration, from enforcing,
as to them, and their bond, the aforesaid Circular. The lower court issued a
writ of preliminary injunction to that effect. <span class="GramE">After issue
was joined, and after several incidents, the Commissioner, represented by the.</span>
Office of the Solicitor General, petitioned on <st1:date month="6" day="25" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 25,
 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> for
the lifting of said injunction since the extension granted by Secretaries
Serrano and <span class="SpellE">Mabanag</span> to the respondent visitors had
already expired on </span><st1:date month="6" day="9" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 9, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. But upon opposition of the
latter, the Court refused to dissolve the injunction. Thereupon, the
Commissioner resorted to this Court, alleging abuse of discretion amounting to
excess of jurisdiction. <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Up to the present, Lim <span class="SpellE">Chiao</span> <span class="SpellE">Cun</span>, husband of respondent
Chua <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> King, and father of respondent minors
Richard, Helen, and Douglas Lim, has not assumed Filipino citizenship. While
declared entitled to naturalization by final judgment, his right to take the
oath of allegiance at the end of the probationary period set by statute was
contested by the Solicitor General, and his case is still pending appeal. His
wife and children, therefore, remain aliens. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Many questions have been raised in
the case now at bar, such as (a) whether or not the President of the
Philippines, being empowered by section 47 of the Immigration Act (C.A. No. 613
as amended) "to admit as non-immigrants, aliens not otherwise provided
for, who are coming for temporary period only", has authority to change
the status of temporary visitors and relieve them from the obligation imposed
expressly by section 9 of the law, as amended by Republic Act No. 503) to
depart first to some foreign country and secure the proper visa before
permanent admission; (b) whether, assuming that the President has any such
power, he may delegate it to a Department Secretary; and (c) whether an
extension of stay granted to a temporary visitor may be revoked before
expiration of the extension. However, we deem it unnecessary to rule upon these
questions, which are also pending decision on, the merits in the court below, '
because we agree with the Solicitor General that, even if these visitors were
validly granted by the Secretaries of Justice and Foreign Affairs (Serrano and <span class="SpellE">Mabanag</span>) an extension up to June 9, 1963, and the
prorogation had not been revoked, these aliens are now subject to expulsion by
the Commissioner of Immigration, their extended period of stay having expired
without further prolongation by competent authority. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is argued for these visitors
that the <span class="SpellE">indorsements</span> of the Secretaries of Justice
and Foreign Affairs (heretofore quoted) effected a change, in their status from
temporary visitors, to special non-immigrants, entitled to residence until the
naturalization, case of the husband, Lim <span class="SpellE">Chiao</span> <span class="SpellE">Cun</span>, is finally decided. We find this proposition
untenable, because both <span class="SpellE">indorsements</span> clearly specify
that they were only granted "a period of stay up to </span><st1:date month="6" day="9" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June
 9, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">",
a fixed date that can not imply an indefinite stay. It is to be presumed that
both Secretaries knew that the final acquisition of Filipino citizenship by the
husband Lim <span class="SpellE">Chiao</span> <span class="SpellE">Cun</span> can
not be set, under the existing law, at any definite date after a judgment
declaring him qualified for naturalization, since later on he may be found
unfit to take the oath of allegiance; and that a definite terminus for the stay
of his wife and children is incompatible with an intent to let them stay until
the end of the naturalization proceedings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Another circumstance indicating
that the terminal date, June 9, 1963, was wholly unconnected with Lim <span class="SpellE">Chiao</span> Can's naturalization case is the requirement of the
Secretary of Justice that the visiting wife and children "shall secure
re-entry permits to <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> valid at least two
months over and beyond their extended stay"; for this condition connotes
the idea that the visitors must leave within 2 months from the expiry date of
the extension, without regard to the result of the naturalization case. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Finally, an extension of an alien's
period of stay, being a matter of grace, and not of right, should be strictly
interpreted. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As it is not disputed that further
staying here of these visitors has not been authorized, the refusal of the court
to dissolve its preliminary injunction after June 9, 1963, as prayed for by the
petitioning Commissioner, in so far as the stay of these visitors are
concerned, was against the law, and, therefore, in abuse of discretion and
excess of jurisdiction. We have heretofore discussed the imperative reasons for
requiring temporary visitors to adhere strictly to their authorized periods of
sojourn, and need not repeat them here (<span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Se <span class="SpellE">Lun</span> <i>vs.</i> Board of Immigration 95 Phil., 785; <span class="SpellE">Kua</span> <span class="SpellE">Suy</span> <i>vs.</i> Commissioner
of Immigration, L-18790, October 31, 1963; Choy <span class="SpellE">Fa</span> <i>vs.</i>
Commissioner, L-20597, November 29, 1963). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">That the preliminary injunction
issued by the respondent judge Area sought to restrain also the confiscation of
the bond given by Lim <span class="SpellE">Chiab</span> <span class="SpellE">Cun</span>
until final adjudication does not justify his refusal to permit the
Commissioner of Immigration to proceed with the expulsion of respondents Chua <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> King and her three children, whose authorized stay had
incontestably expired. The propriety and legality of the confiscation of the
bond can be litigated independently. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the writ of certiorari.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> prayed for is granted, and the
preliminary injunction issued by respondent Judge Francisco Area, in Case No.
51699 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, as well as his order of July
29, 1963, in so far as they restrain the Commissioner of Immigration from
compelling the departure from the Philippines of respondents Chua <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> King alias <span class="SpellE">Insa</span> Lim, with
her children Richard, Helen, and Douglas, surnamed Lim, are hereby annulled and
set aside, without prejudice to further proceedings conformable to this
opinion. <span class="GramE">Costs against the respondents above-named.</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
