				G.R. No. L-23656, May 15, 1967</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF TEOFILO YAP TO BE ADMITTED
A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, TEOFILO
YAP, PETITIONER-APPELLEE, VS.
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR-APPELLANT.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by the Solicitor General from a decision of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City, holding that peti­tioner
<span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> Yap is eligible for naturalization <span style="">as </span>citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a review of the record, we find that the appeal is well
taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, the notice of the
filing of the petition herein was published in the "Clarion" which,
accord­ing to the lower court, is of general circulation <u>in the City of </u><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><u>Zamboanga</u></span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 9 of the Naturalization Law provides,
however, that said notice be published in a newspaper of gene<span style="">ral circulation in the province</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and the "Clarion" does not meet
this qualification.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, a naturalization case is a proceeding <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span> and, as such, publication is required in order
that the court may acquire jurisdiction over the whole world, which would be
bound by the decision it may render, if the requirements of due process were
complied with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In consequence, however,
of the failure to cause said publication to be made in the manner provided by
law, the lower court did not acquire, in this case, the jurisdiction necessary
to render a binding decision, and, hence, the decision appealed from is null
and void.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Although this conclusion may, at first blush, appear to be rather
technical, it is not so from the viewpoint of the substance of due process,
particularly of the purpose of said publication in naturalization
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, notice of the
filing of the petition therein is required to be published, <u>not</u> <u>only</u><span style=""> </span>in the Official Gazette, but, also, in
a newspaper of general circulation <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>province</u> where
the peti­tioner resides, in order that <span style="">as
</span>many people therein who know the petitioner may be informed of his
application for naturalization, and be induced to submit to the authorities
such data relevant thereto as may be in their possession or within their
knowledge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, an undesirable
alien may ef­fectively prevent such data from reaching the authorities, <span style="">by </span>causing the notice <span style="">to </span>be published in a newspaper of
gene­ral circulation in a local subdivision <u>other</u> than his home town.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Then again, Section 7 of
the Naturalization </span><span style="">Law</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">re­quires that each petition for
naturalization be supported by the affidavit of two (2) "credible
persons." Referring to the meaning of this phrase, we had occasion to say,
as early as </span><st1:date year="1958" day="30" month="5"><span style="">May 30, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Within the purview of the Naturali­zation Law, a ‘credible’ person is, to our
mind, not only an individual who has not been previous­ly convicted of a crime;
who is not a police char­acter and has no police record; who has not per­jured
in the past; or whose 'affidavit' or testi­mony is not incredible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What must be 'credible' is not the
declaration made, but the <u>person</u> mak­ing it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This implies that such person must have a <u>good
standing in the community</u>; that he is <u>known to be honest and upright</u>;
that he is <u>reputed to be trustworthy and reliable</u>; and that his word may
be taken on its face value, as a good warranty of the worthiness of the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Thus, in
Cu vs. Re­public, G. R. No.</span> L-3018 (decided on <st1:date year="1951" day="18" month="7">July 18, 1951</st1:date>), we declared that said affiants
'are in a way <u>in­surers of the character of the candidate concerned</u>.'
Indeed, by their affidavits, they do not merely make the statements herein
contained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also vouch for the
applicant, attest to the merits of his petition and sort of <u>underwrite</u>
the same." (<span class="SpellE">Ong</span> vs. Republic, 103 Phil., 964.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
attesting witnesses of petitioner herein do not appear to belong to this
category.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of them, Leticia C.
Alvarez, is a teacher in the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> Chinese
School, in which he had been her pupil for two (2) years in the elementary
department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The other, <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span>, is shop
superintendent of the Bureau of Public Highways, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without, in the least, underrating
the profession or occupation of each, the fact is that there is absolutely
nothing in the record to indicate, even if remotely, that any of them has the
sta­tus contemplated in the Naturalization Act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This <span style="">is
</span>not to cast any doubt upon the moral fabric of said witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It simply indicates that their honesty and
integrity - even if the same were assumed to be a fact - are insufficient to
place them within the class envisaged by law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is, also, necessary that each one possess such a high degree of repu­tation
in the community for honesty and integrity that "his word may be taken on
its <span style="">face </span>value
as a good warranty of the worthiness of the petitioner."</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision appealed from should be, as it <span style="">is </span>hereby,
