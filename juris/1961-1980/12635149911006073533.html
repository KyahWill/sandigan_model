extend its life by amend­ment of its articles of incorporation effected during
the three-year </span><span style="">statutory period for liquidation </span>when its original term of
existence had already expired? – the answer of the Securities and Exchange
Commissioner was in the negative.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Offshoot is this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That problem emerged out

 15, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that date, it ceased transacting business,
entered into a state of liquidation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thereafter, a new

- within <st1:city><st1:place>Alhambra</st1:place></st1:city>'s three-year
statutory period for liquidation - Republic Act 3531 <span style="">was </span>enacted into law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
amended Section 18 of the Corporation Law; it empowered domestic private
corporations to extend their corporate life beyond the period fixed by the
articles of incorporation for a term not to exceed fifty years in any one
instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Previous to Republic Act 3531,
the maximum non-extendible term of such corporations was fifty years.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 15, 1963, at a special meeting, Alhambra's board of
directors resolved, to amend paragraph "Fourth" of its articles of
incorporation to extend is corporate life for an additional fifty years, or a
total, of 100 years from its incorporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1963</st1:date>
<st1:city><st1:place>Alhambra</st1:place></st1:city>'s stockholders,

approve the foregoing resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
“Fourth" paragraph of <st1:city><st1:place>Alhambra</st1:place></st1:city>'s
articles of incorporation was thus altered to read:</p>

articles of incorporation as so amended, certified correct by its president,
and secretary and a majority of its board of directors, were filed with
respondent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 1, 1963, SEC, however, returned said amended articles
of incorporation to Alhambra's counsel with the ruling that Republic Act 3531 <span style="">"wh</span>ich took effect only on June 20, 1963, cannot be availed
of by the said corporation, for the reason that its term of existence had al

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Alhambra</st1:place></st1:city>
relies on Republic Act 3531, which amended Section 18 of the Corporation
Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, it is to take note of the old
and the new statutes <span style="">as </span>they
are framed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 18, prior to and
aster its modification by Republic Act 3531, covers the subject of amendment of
the articles of incorporation of private corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A provision thereof which remains unaltered
is that a corporation may amend its articles of incorporation by a majority
vote of its board of directors o trustees and x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> by the vote or written assent of the stockholders
representing at least two-thirds of the subscribed capital stock x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>".</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But prior to amendment by
Republic Act 3531, an explicit prohibition existed in Section </span><span style="">16, </span><span style="">thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <u>Provided</u>,
<u>however</u>, That the life of said corporation shall not be extended by said
amend­ment beyond the <span style="">time fixed in </span>the
original articles: <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This was displaced by Republic Act 3531 which enfranchises all
private corporations to extend their corporate existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus incorporated into the structure of
Section <span style="">18 </span>are the following:</p>

<blockquote>" x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Provided however, That should the amendment consist in extending the corporate
life, the extension shall not exceed fifty years in any one instance:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u> <u>further</u> the original
articles, and amended articles together shall con­tain all provisions required
by law to be set out in the articles of incorporation: <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>".<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As we look in retrospect
at the facts, we find these: From July 15 to October </span><span style="">28, 1963, when </span><span style="">Alhambra made its attempt to extend its corporate existence, its
original term of fifty years had already expired (January 15, 1962); it was in
the midst of the three year grace period statutorily fixed </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">Section 77 of the Corporation Law, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 77, Every corporation whose charter expires by its own
limitation or is annulled by forfeiture or otherwise, or whose corporate
existence for other purposes is terminated in any other manner, shall
nevertheless be continued <span style="">as a body
corporate for three years after the time when it would have been so dissolved, <u>for</u>
<u>the</u> <u>purpose</u> <u>of</u> <u>prosecuting and</u> <u>defending</u> <u>suits</u>
</span><u>or</u> <u>against</u> <u>it</u> <u>and</u> <u>of</u> <u>enabling</u> <u>it</u>
gradually <u>to</u> <u>settle</u> <u><span style="">and</span></u><span style=""> <u>close</u> <u>its</u> <u>affairs</u>, <u>to</u>
<u>dispose</u> <u>of</u> <u>and</u> <u>convey</u> <u>its</u> <u>property</u> <u>and</u>
<u>to</u> <u>divide</u> <u>its</u> <u>capital</u> <u>stock</u>, <u>but</u> <u>not</u>
<u>for</u> <u>these</u> <u>of</u> <u>continuing</u> <u>the</u> <u>business</u> <u>for</u>
<u>which</u> <u>it</u> <u>was</u> <u>established</u>".</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plain from the language
of this provision is its meaning: continuance of a "dissolved"
corporation </span><span style="">as a </span><span style="">body corporate for
three years has for its purpose the final closure of its affairs, <u>and</u> <u>no</u>
<u>other</u> the corporation is specifically enjoined from "continuing the
business for which it was established".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The liquidation of the corporation's affairs set forth in Section 77
became necessary precisely because its life had ended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason alone, the corporate
existence and juridical personality of that corporation to do business may no </span>longer
be extended,</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Worth bearing in mind, at
this juncture, is the basic development of corporation law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The common law rule, at
the beginning, </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">rigid and inflexible
in that upon its dissolution, a corporation became legally dead for all
purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Statutory authorizations had
to be provided for its continuance after dissolution "for limited and
specified purposes incident to complete liquidation of its affairs".</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
the moment a corporation's right to exist as an "artificial person"
ceases, its corporate powers are terminated "just as the powers of a
natural person to take part <span style="">in </span>mundane
affairs cease to exist upon his death".</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> There is nothing left but to conduct, as it </span>were,
the settlement of the estate of a deceased juridical person.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Republic let 3531,
amending Section 18 of the Corporation Law, is silent, is true, as to when such
act <span style="">of extension </span>may be
made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even with superficial knowledge
of corporate principles, it does not take <span style="">m</span>uch
effort to reach a correct conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For, implicit in Section 77 heretofore quoted is that the privilege
given <u>to</u> <u>prolong</u> corporate life under the amendment must be
exercised before the expiry of the term, fixed in the articles of
incorporation;</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Silence of the law on the
matter </span><span style="">is
</span><span style="">not hard to understand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Specificity is not really necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The authority to prolong corporate life was inserted
by Republic Act 3531 into a section of the law that deals with the <u>power</u>
of a corporation <u>to</u> <u>amend</u> its articles of incorporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(For, the manner of prolongation is through
an amendment of the articles).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, it
should be clearly evident that u</span>nder <span style="">Section 77 </span><span style="">no
corporation in a state of liquidation </span><span style="">can act in any way, much less <u>amend</u> <u>its</u> <u>articles</u>,
"for the purpose of continuing the business for which it was
established".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">All
</span><span style="">these dilute </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Alhambra</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">'s position that it could revivify its
corporate life simply because when it attempted to do so, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Alhambra</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> was still in the process of
liquidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is surely impermissible
for us to stretch the law - that merely empowers a corporation to act in
liquidation to inject therein the power to extend its corporate existence,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not that we are alone in
this view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fletcher has written:
"Since the privilege of extension is purely statutory, all of the
statutory conditions precedent must be complied with in order that the
extension maybe effectuated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And generally
these conditions must be complied with, and the steps necessary to effect the
exten­sion must be taken <u>during</u> <u>the</u> <u>life</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
<u>corporation</u> <u>and</u> <u>before</u> <u>the</u> <u>expiration</u> <u>of</u>
<u>its</u> <u>term</u> <u>of</u> <u>existence</u> <u>as</u> <u>originally</u> <u>fixed</u>
<u>by</u> <u>its</u> <u>charter</u> <u>or</u> the <u>general</u> <u>law</u>, <u>such</u>
<u>as</u> a <u>rule</u> <u>the</u> <u>corporation</u> <u>is</u> <u>ipso</u> <u>factor</u>
<u>dissolved</u> <u><span style="">as</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>soon</u> <u><span style="">as</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>that</u> <u>time</u> <u>expires.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>So where the extension is <span style="">by </span>amendment of the articles of
incorporation, the <u>amendment</u> <u>must</u> <u>be</u> <u>adopted</u> <u>before</u>
<u>that</u> <u>time</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, similarly,
the filing and recording of a certificate of extension after that time cannot
relate back to the date of the passage of a resolution by the stockholders in
favor of the extension so as to save the life of the corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contrary is true, however, and the
doctrine of relation will apply, where the delay is due to the neglect of the
officer with whom the certificate is required to be filed, Or to a wrongful
refusal on his part to receive it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
statutes in some states specifically provide that a renewal may be had within a
specified time before or after the time fixed for the termination of the
corporate existence".<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The logic of this
position is well expressed in a four-square case decided by the court of
Appeals of </span><st1:state><st1:place><span style="">Kentucky</span></st1:place></st1:state><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> There, </span>pronouncement was made as

Association expired on <st1:date year="1905" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1905</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that date, by the mandate of the
statute, it could continue to act for the purpose of closing up its business,
but for no other purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proposed
amendment was not made until <st1:date year="1908" day="16" month="1">January

the terms of the articles of incorporation. <span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span><u>When</u> <u>the</u> <u>corporate</u>

was proposed nearly three years after the corporate life of the association had
expired to revivify the dead body, and to make that relate back some two years
and eight months in other words, the association for two years and eight months
had only existed for the purpose of winding up its business, and, after this
length of time, it </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">proposed to revivify it and.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Make it a live corporation for the two years

effect on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="6"><span style="">June 20, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, while the original term of <span class="SpellE">AlhambraI's</span> existence expired before that date - on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="1"><span style="">January
 15, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mischief that flows from this theory is
at once apparent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would certainly
open the gates for all defunct corporations - whose charters have expired even
long before Republic Act 3531 came into being - to resuscitate their corporate
existence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

brings into <st1:place><st1:placename>argument</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Republic</st1:placetype></st1:place>
Act 1932, which amends Section 196 of the Insurance Act, now reading as follows</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 196.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any
provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, every domestic life insurance
corporation, formed for a limited period under the provisions of its articles
of incorporation, may extend its corporate existence for a period not exceeding
fifty years in any one instance by amendment to its articles of incorporation
on or before the expiration of the term so fixed in said articles x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>”.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To be observed is that
the foregoing statute - unlike </span>Republic <span style="">Act 3531 - expressly authorizes domestic insurance corporations to
extend their corporate existence "on or before the expiration </span>of
the <span style="">term" fixed in their articles
of incorporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Republic Act 1932 was
approved on </span><st1:date year="1957" day="22" month="6"><span style="">June 22, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="">, long before the passage of Republic Act
35311n 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congress, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Alhambra</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> points out, must have </span>been <span style="">aware of Republic Act 1932 when it passed
Republic Act 3531.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Since <span style="">the phrase "on or before" etc., was
omitted in Republic Act 3531, which contains no similar limitation, it follows,
according to Alhambra, that it is not necessary to extend corporate existence
on or before the expiration of its </span><span style="">original
term.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That Republic Act 3531
stands mute as to when extension of corporate existence may be made, assumes no
relevance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have already said, in the
face of a familiar precept, that a defunct corporation is bereft of any legal
faculty not otherwise expressly sanctioned by law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Illuminating here is the
explanatory note of H.B 1774, later Republic Act 3531 now in dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its first paragraph states that
"Republic Act </span><span style="">No. </span><span style="">1932 allows the automatic extension of the
cor­porate existence of domestic life insurance corporations upon amendment of
their articles of incorporation on or before the expiration of the terms fixed
by said articles".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The succeeding
lines are decisive: "This is a good law, a sane and sound one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>There</u> </span><u><span style="">appears</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">to</span></u><span style=""> <u>be</u> <u>no</u> <u>valid</u> <u>reason</u>
<u>why</u> <u>it</u> <u>should</u> <u>not</u> <u>be</u> <u>made</u> <u>to</u> </span><u><span style="">apply</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">to</span></u><span style=""> <u>other</u> <u>private</u> <u>corporations</u>".</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The situation here
presented is not one where the law under consideration is ambiguous, where
courts have to put in harness extrinsic aids such as a look at another statute
to disentangle doubts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an
elementary rule in legal hermeneutics that where the terms of the law are
clear, no statutory construction may be permitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the basic conceptual scheme under which
corporations operate, and with Section 77 of the Corporation Law particularly
in mind, we find no vagueness in Section 18, as amended by Republic Act
3531.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we view it, by directing
attention to Republic Act 1932, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Alhambra</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> would seek to create obscurity in the law;
and, with that, ask of us a ruling that such obscurity be explained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, we dare say, cannot be done.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The <span class="SpellE"><u>pari</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">materia</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>rule of statutory construction, in
fact, com­mands that statutes must be harmonized with each other.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> So harmonizing, the conclusion is clear that
Section 18 of the Corpora­tion Law; </span>as <span style="">amended by Republic Act 3531 in reference to exten­sions of corporate
existence, is to be read in the same light as Republic Act 1932.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Which means that domestic corporations in
general, as with domestic insurance companies, can extend corporate existence
only on or before the expiration of the term fixed in their </span><span style="">charters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">5. <st1:city><st1:place>Alhambra</st1:place></st1:city> pleads for
munificence in interpretation, one which brushes technicalities aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bases for this posture are that Republic Act
3531 is a remedial statute, and that extension of corporate life is beneficial
to the economy.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Alhambra</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">'s stance does not induce assent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Expansive construction is, possible <u>only</u>
