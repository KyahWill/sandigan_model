				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Contenders for City Secretary in the election held by the Municipal Board<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
of Cagayan de Oro City, at its January 2, 1964 inaugural session, were
petitioner Primitivo P. Quiem and respondent Anastacio Abas. A secret
ballot was taken. Result: Three councilors voted for petitioner, three
for respondent. One councilor abstained-he cast a blank ballot. Because
of the tie, Vice-Mayor Jesus Seriña, the presiding officer, voted for
petitioner, who thereupon took his oath of office before the
Vice-Mayor. The following day, January 3, petitioner took another
similar oath before Judge Agustin Antillon of the Cagayan de Oro City
Court. The same day, January 3, respondent Abas challenged the validity
of the alleged election of petitioner, City Mayor Justiniano R. Borja
refused to recognize petitioner as the duly elected secretary. The
mayor, on January 7, called the board to a special meeting for 3
o'clock in the afternoon of that day, to discuss, act and resolve Abas'
protest. No decision was reached at that meeting or at the session of
January 9. The Board agreed to meet again on January 10, at 3:00 p.m.
for the same purpose.
  <p> On the morning of January 10, petitioner went to court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
on prohibition with a petition for preliminary injunction to restrain
respondents from conducting another balloting before the legality or
illegality of petitioner's election is resolved and, after hearing, to
grant him "such other remedy as may be just, fair and equitable".</p>
  <p> Upon a P1,000 bond, the court, on January 10, promptly issued the writ of preliminary injunction prayed for.</p>
  <p>Respondents' answers to the petition raised the question:
                
Was there a failure of election of City Secretary?</p>
  <p>Parenthetically, on January 14, the board designated Orlando Bodriguex, one of its stenographers, as Acting Secretary.</p>
  <p>On January 20, 1964, the court issued, and petitioner's counsel received, notice of trial for January 30, 1964 at 8:30 a.m.</p>
  <p>On
January 22, respondent Abas moved to dissolve the writ of preliminary
injunction. Petitioner, on January 23, registered his opposition
thereto.</p>
  <p>On January 30, 1964, the Court, after a preliminary
hearing that morning, issued an order, as follows: "the preliminary
injunction is hereby DISSOLVED and the petition is hereby DISMISSED,
without pronouncement as to costs". The verbal notion to reconsider -
after the foregoing order was dictated in open court-was overruled.</p>
  <p>Petitioner,
on February 10, 1964, cane to this Court on certiorari with a prayer
for preliminary prohibitory and preliminary Mandatory injunction,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> This Court, on February 11, 1964, dismissed the petition for the reason that appeal was the remedy.</p>
  <p>Promptly,
that is, on February 12, 1964, petitioner registered below his notice
of appeal from the order of January 30, 1964 aforesaid and filed a cash
bond. On February 13, 1964, the court <i>a quo</i> gave due course to the present appeal.</p>
  <p>Thereafter, on February 24, 1964, the board proceeded to the election of the secretary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
Respondent Abas garnered 5 affirmative votes and was thereupon declared
duly elected. Since then, abas has been performing the functions of
secretary. </p>
  <ol><li>Petitioner presses upon us the threshold question that he was
denied due process. He complains that the Court did not give him an
opportunity "to prove his allegations".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></li></ol>

  <p>Petitioner,
it would seem, misconceives the reach of due process. Nothing in the
minutes of the trial held en January 30, 1964 suggests that he ever
offered to present any evidence at all. And this, in spite of the fact
that he was represented thereat by a number of lawyers. The parties
were heard from3:30 a.m. to 11:50 a.m. on that date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The presumption is that official duty had been regularly performed;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> that a judge will not do any act contrary to his official duty or omit to do anything which such duty nay require;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> that he will not violate his official oath;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and that a judicial proceeding was regular and that all the steps required by law to be taken on a matter, had been so taken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p>
  <p>But,
was there any necessity to take evidence? Respondents' affirmative
defense to the petition below is that petitioner was not lawfully
elected because he did not obtain the required number of votes, and
that therefore he lacks a cause of action. The pivotal facts bearing on
this issue are not disputed: There was an election; votes were cast
therein; the number of votes received by the two candidates were
tallied. Solely questions of law are presented. On the issues of law, a
preliminary hearing was bad, in petitioner's language - in a
"question-and-answer method".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
The merits and demerits of the defense of lack of cause of action was
thus openly discussed. This is as it should be. Because, lack of cause
of action - a ground for a notion to dismiss -<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
may be pleaded as aa affirmative defense, "and a preliminary hearing
nay be had thereon as if a motion to dismiss had been filed".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Sufficiency of the averments in a petition can only be determined by considering the facts averred, and nothing more.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Of course, the hearing has to be summary. Prohibition is summary in nature.
    
</p>
  <p>The familiar safeguards of notice, hearing and opportunity
to present his side, were fully accorded petitioner. He was given his
day in court. He cannot complain. </p>
  <ol start="2"><li>Petitioner next avers that the Vice-Mayor is not a member of the board.
</li></ol>

  <p>We find this argument less than compelling. By
express legal mandate, the Vice-Mayor of Cagayan de Oro City is a
member of the board. That city's original charter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> calls for an appointive Vice-Mayor<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> who <i>"shall be a member</i> of the Municipal Board",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> "the legislative body of the city".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
The law amendatory to the Cagayan de Oro charter made the Vice-Mayor
elective, and reiterated that he "shall be a member of the Municipal
Board".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p>
  <p>But
then, on June 19, 1959, Congress enacted another statute "making
elective" the offices of Mayor, Vice-Mayor and Councilors with the
proviso that "the Vice-Mayor shall be the presiding officer of the City
Council or Municipal Board <i>in all chartered cities"</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
    
</p>
  <p>Petitioner stresses the fact that this last-named
legislative enactment is silent as to whether the Vice-Mayor, the
presiding officer, is a member of the board. Upon the premise that what
the law does not include, it excludes, petitioner puts forth the claim
that the Vice-Mayor is not a member, but a mere presiding officer of
the board.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
      
</p>
  <p>Petitioner's argument is off the mark. <i>First</i>, it is now a commonplace in our law that implied repeals are not favored. <i>Second</i>,
the charter provisions making the Vice-Mayor a member of the board can
be harmonized with the later law (Republic Act 2259) naming him the
presiding officer thereof. <i>Third</i>, absent is a plain indication
from Congress - in the law just adverted to - that the Vice-Mayor has
ceased to be a member of the Municipal Board. In this setting, we find
no warrant to declare that he has so ceased. Because, Section 9 of
Republic Act 2259 stipulates that only when a law is inconsistent
therewith shall it be declared thereby repealed. We see no repugnance. </p>
  <ol start="3"><li>Having reached the conclusion that the Vice-Mayor of Cagayan de Oro
City is a member of the board, our next problem is whether he may vote
in the selection of the city secretary. The power to so elect is lodged
with the Municipal Board.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
Logic suggests that, being a board member, the Vice-Mayor is entitled
to vote in the election of said official. If other members can vote,
why should the Vice-Mayor - also a member - be singled out and refused
that right? There is nothing in our statute books which says that
simply because he happened to be also the presiding officer, he shall
have no right to vote.</li></ol>

  <p>True, in Rivera et al., <i>vs</i>. Villegas,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
we held that the Vice-Mayer "possesses in the Municipal Board of Manila
no more than the prerogatives and authority of a 'presiding officer' as
such" and "to vote in case of tie". But the Manila Vice-Mayor stands on
another level. For, the Manila charter, in language indubitable, <i>withheld</i>
from the Vice-Mayor the right to vote "except in case of a tie". No
such delimitation of powers appears in the Cagayan de Oro charter; it
should not be imported therein. Differences in law beget differences in
legal effects.</p>
  <p>Bagasao, et al., <i>vs</i>. Tumangan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
is appropriately to be read as controlling on this point. There as
here: The Vice-Mayor is a member and the presiding officer of the
board; the charter is silent on whether the presiding officer may cast
a vote as a member or only in case of a tie. We there held that the
Vice-Mayor may "<i>exercise his right to vote as a member</i> on any proposed ordinance, resolution or motion" and that "To <i>limit his right to a vote</i> to a case of deadlock or tie <i>would curtail his right and prerogative</i> as a member of the Municipal Board <i>which is not authorized by the provisions of the charter</i>".</p>
  <ol start="4"><li>With
what we hare stated thus far, we return to the January 2 balloting.
Three votes went for petitioner, three for respondent Abas, one
abstained. The Vice-Mayor thereupon oast his ballot for petitioner.
This vote should be counted, independent of whether his intention was
to break a tie or otherwise. For, to vote was his right. The result is
that petitioner garnered <i>four</i> votee to Abas' <i>three</i>. But
there are eight elective members of the board - the Vice-Mayor and
seven councilors - all of whom were present at the balloting.</li></ol>
  <p>By law, Section 5, Republic Act 2259, the city secretary <i>"shall be elected by majoritv vote of the elective city council or municipal board"</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p>
  <p>Petitioner urges upon us the proposition that the statute just quoted merely requires "a simple majority of a quorum".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>
This, we believe, is a warped construction of the statute. The law
exacts a majority vote of the elective board. And the elective board
consists of eight members. So that, a majority of at least <i>five</i> votes will carry the day for a candidate. Authorities are not wanting in support of this view.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> And neither is it short of reason.</p>
  <p>The
law does not exact that a city secretary be drawn from the roll of
civil service eligibles. He is to serve during the term of office of
the board that elected him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>
It is not an easy matter to uproot him from his position-because of
fixed tenure. The discussions on the floor of Congress reveal that the
wording of the statute - Sec. 5, Republic Act 2259 - was arrived at
having in mind that a secretary "is supposed to enjoy the <i>confidence of the body to which he is acting as secretary</i>".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>
How can a secretary enjoy the confidence of the elective municipal
board unless the majority of the elective members thereof gives him the
nod? If the voting be decided by a mere majority of a quorum present at
the meeting, the probability of a secretary being elected by a <i>minority</i> of the elective members is not remote. In this situation, the secretary is <i>not</i>
of the confidence of the "body". Really, it it was the intention to
limit to a simple majority of the quorum the matter of election, it is
the function of Congress - not this Court - to spell out such provision
expressly. But, Congress did not. As it is, Congress has chosen to
employ in the statute the term "majority vote of the elective"
municipal board, no less. We cannot pass the line that circumscribes
the Judicial department and tread on legislative ground. Therefore, a
vote of five is necessary to elect a secretary.</p>
  <p>At any rate,
this point offers no area for genuine dispute. No quorum is involved.
Because all - not a mere quorum - of the eight elective board members
were actually present at the January 2 balloting. And five still is the
required majority. </p>
  <ol start="5"><li>In our opinion, the controlling legal issue here is whether the blank ballot, as petitioner claims,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>
is to be recorded as a vote for petitioner. For, if it be so counted,
petitioner's votes will be five to Abas' three. Contrariwise, the
voting stands four to three, with the result that there was a failure
of election.</li></ol>

  <p>We are here reminded th&amp;t the post
of city secretary is filled by election, by members of the board as
individual electors. Election is defined as: "Choice; selection. The
selection of one person from a specified class to discharge certain
duties in a state, corporation, or society".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>
When Congress took it upon itself to provide for a city secretary, by
election, it is to be presumed that it had in mind the word election in
common and approved usage and the normal contemporary workings of an
election to an office. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>
Under our system of elections, abstention is not a vote. For, implicit
in a vote for an office is a deliberate, positive act, such as by <i>viva voce</i> or secret ballot. As Bouvier puts it, we cannot "go beyond the ballot to ascertain the intention of the voter." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>
</p>
  <p>Indeed, we cannot speculate on a voter's Intention; we
cannot here rightfully assume the role of mind readers. Imponderables
there could be, considerations there Bight be, which stay the hand of a
voter from writing the name of one candidate or the other, (tee who
casts a blank ballot chooses not to stand up and be counted. His blank
ballot is but an expression of lack of intention. It evidences nothing,
except that he throws away his vote. To consider a blank ballot as a
vote for one candidate as against the other, is to dignify deviation
from truth. Blank ballot in a contested election is thus a nullity. It
cannot be tallied.
</p>
  <p>To be sure, authorities are not wanting which would show that abstention could be counted in a voting. Thus, in Cromarty <i>vs</i>.
Leonard, et al., 216 N.Y.S. 2d., 619, the county executive submitted to
the Board of Supervisors (the legislative and policy determining body)
the name of a person whom he proposed for the office of County
Attorney. The vote thereon was five in favor, four opposed, and one not
voting. The chairman ruled that petitioner's abstention should be
counted as a negative vote. The county executive - who had a casting
vote in case of tie - then voted to approve the appointment of his
nominee. A divided court held that abstention should be counted as a
negative vote, that a tie was thus created, and that the county
executive's vote resulted in the adoption of the resolution approving
the appointment. This and cases of similar import,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and others where abstention is counted in the affirmative,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> are of little help here. They do not parallel the factual situation in our case. There, the positions involved <i>are not contested</i>.
A board member just had to say "yes" or "no" or keep silent as to the
sole nominee. Not so here, where two are candidates for the same post.
The elector is called upon not to adhere but to make a choice.</p>
  <p> Illuminating is the decision in People, <i>ex rel</i>. Floyd, <i>vs</i>.
Conklin, 7 Hun. 138, cited in the same Cromarty case, where the statute
incorporating a savings institution required the vote of a majority of
the trustees present, for the election of an officer. At a meeting,
twelve trustees being present, six voted for relator, four for
defendant, one for a third person and one cast no vote. Held: No
choice, since affirmative positive action by a majority of the trustees
present was contemplated by the statute, and "it could not be presumed
that the trustee not Toting 'practically voted' for relator".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> As Dillon<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> aptly observed, "the weight of authority, and, as we think, the better view is, that <i>the blank ballot</i> (cast by a member of a city council at an election for an officer) <i>is a mere nullity:</i> that it cannot be counted for or against either of the candidates voted for".</p>
  <p>In the end, we say that the situation remains as it was: Petitioner received <i>four</i> votes, respondent Abas <i>three</i>. Petitioner is one vote short of the required majority. He failed to be elected. He has no cause of action.</p>
  <p>Viewed in the light of the undisputed facts and the law, the order of the court <i>a quo</i>
of January 20, 1964 dissolving the preliminary Injunction and
dismissing the petition, is hereby affirmed. No costs. So ordered. </p>
