Commissioners of Immigration, respectively, from a decision of the Court of
First Instance of Manila, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of
which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Without pronouncement as to costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that on January 1, 1962, herein petitioners Go
Oh and Helen, James, William and Henry, all surnamed Go Oh, arrived in the
Philippines from <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> with certificates of regis­tration
and identity Nos. 1061 to 1065 issued by the Philippine Con­sulate in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1962</st1:date>, a Board of Special
Inquiry of the Bureau of Immigration conducted an investigation to deter­mine
petitioners' political status.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
such investigation, the Board rendered, on <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1962</st1:date>, a decision excluding the petitioners
from the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pertinent parts of said decision are of the
following tenor:</p>

<blockquote>"So it is that Go Oh and her children rely for their admission
on the Philippine citizenship of Go <span class="SpellE">Oh's</span> alleged
father, <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Roon</span>, but
it is a funda­mental concept of our immigration laws and regula­tions that the
burden of proof lies with an applicant to prove her right to be admitted into
the Philippines on whatever ground such laws and regulations permit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, the herein applicants are
forced to lean upon the citizenship of a supposed father whose very status
himself as it now stands has toppled over into grave doubt. Go Oh and her
children cannot be expected to have a stronger claim than their very
predecessor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It has been argued, and as a matter of fact it has been made
the basis of an urgent motion to post­pone the present case indefinitely, that
the decision of this case should be held in abeyance pending the final
adjudication on the issue of <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Roon's</span> citi­zenship.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Board cannot sustain such an argument precisely for the reason
stated in the next preceding paragraph that Go Oh and her children have the <u>onus</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>probandi</u></span> of proving their right to
admission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further­more, what if the <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Roon</span> case should drag on
from agency to agency and from court to court for ten years or more? Should the
Bureau of Immigration in the meantime sanction the questionable stay of the
herein applicants when the fact is they have never been legally admitted
before? The questions beg the answers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It should also be mentioned that the cancellation of the
alien registry of Go Len Sing, Go <span class="SpellE">Chong</span> Chiu and Go
Song <span class="SpellE">Hiap</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
have likewise been set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the
time being, therefore, they hold no probative value in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As for the certificates of registration and
identity issued by the Philippine Consulate General in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>,
the events and circumstances of the last few months of 1961, the mad scramble
of alleged Phil­ippine citizens into the country duly equipped with similar
certificates, the scandal and the investigations now being conducted by police
and other agencies of the government, all these militate against giving
evidentiary credit to these highly unsound certificates.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At most, Go Oh must now rely on her testimony to bolster her
right to admission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in this score
her declarations before the Board fail to satisfy the standards set up by the
rules on evidence and simple logic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
examination, she admitted that the minor applicants, her children allegedly,
have only come to use the names mentioned in the caption of this decision in
1961, the truth being that before then they have been using the names Tan <span class="SpellE">Yan</span> <span class="SpellE">Hui</span>, Tan Hong <span class="SpellE">Yan</span>, Tan <span class="SpellE">Sui</span> Lin and Tan Sit <span class="SpellE">Lian</span>, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What does this ad­mission prove?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Simply this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that their names were
changed to make it appear that they are the natural or illegitimate children of
Go Oh in furtherance of an at­tempt to prove that Go Oh and her husband Tan Man
Eng were never legally married, and this on the in­formation that under
Philippine law illegitimate child­ren or natural ones follow the surname of
their putative mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is exactly
the pattern followed in a mul­titude of cases that have come before the
official scru­tiny of this Board.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Required to submit a record of birth of her children from the <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> Government, the suspicion noted above is further
corroborated by the entry in one such certificate that the minor now registered
as Henry <span class="SpellE">Gooh</span> was in fact registered at the time of
his birth in 1959 as <span class="SpellE">Shek</span> Lin, being the child of
Chan Man <span class="SpellE">Loun</span> and Ng <span class="SpellE">Choi</span>
Lam.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We note the <u>idem</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>sonans</u></span> between Sit <span class="SpellE">Lian</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Shek</span> Lin.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We also note with special attention that the same birth record makes
possible two or more conclusions, namely, that Go <span class="SpellE">Oh's</span>
real name is Ng <span class="SpellE">Choi</span> Lam or that Henry <span class="SpellE">Gooh</span>, also known as Tan Sit <span class="SpellE">Lian</span>,
also known as Chan <span class="SpellE">Shek</span> Lin, is not the son of Go Oh!</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As we examine the true marital status of Go Oh and Tan Man
Eng, the Board finds that if we must be­lieve Go <span class="SpellE">Oh's</span>
simple statement that she and the minor applicants' father were not legally
married in the fac<span style="">e </span><span style="">of the above birth record, then we shall go
against fundamental presumptions in our civil law, among them that the
legitimacy of a child is presumed, and that all intendments of the law lean
toward the exist­ence and validity of a marriage.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Board is forced to observe at this juncture that there is
no civil registry of births, deaths and mar­riages in mainland <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither, it seems, is there a distinct line
which separates common law marriage and ceremonial marriage. Under such a
system of civil intercourse and relationship dominated not by law but by
customs and practices outdating even Western civilization, a <span class="SpellE">prober</span> must perforce rely on testimony to ferret out such
matters as the existence or non­existence of a marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the evasive and general­ized answers of Go
Oh <span style="">tending </span>to <span style="">parry </span>the <span style="">issue of </span>whe­ther she married her co-applicants' father or not,
the Board is not convinced that she is not actually married.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, we must assume that Go Oh or Ng <span class="SpellE">Choi</span> Lam or by whatever other identity she is known was in
fact mar­ried to Tan Man Eng (Chan Man <span class="SpellE">Loun</span>), and in
the ab­sence of proof that her husband mentioned was a Filipino citizen, this
Board declares that Go Oh is likewise a Chinese subject thru marriage.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"FOR ALL THE FOREGOING REASONS, this Board of Special Inquiry
resolves to exclude Go Oh and her four co-applicants in view of her failure to
prove her claim to Philippine citizenship, and with Go Oh the failure of the
minors to prove any better right."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1963</st1:date>,
petitioners received a letter of the Se­cretary of the Board of Commissioners,

<blockquote>"NOW THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority granted in the

<p class="BODY">Soon after, or on September 28, 1963, petitioners herein filed,
with the Court of First Instance of Manila, a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
and prohibition with preliminary injunction against the Board of Commissioners,
praying, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span><u>,</u> that the
aforementioned deci­sion thereof be declared null and void; that petitioners be
declared <span style="">entitled to reside in the
Philippines permanently; that respondents and their subordinates be prohibited
permanently from arresting and excluding the petitioners from the Philippines;
and that a writ of preliminary injunction be issued restraining respondents
from enforcing said decision during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="10"><span style="">Octo­ber
 11, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, the lower
court issued the writ of preliminary injunc­tion prayed for and, subsequently,
or on </span><st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="7"><span style="">July 15, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">,
it rendered, after appropriate proceedings, the appealed decision in favor of
petitioners herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The main issues in this case are (1) whether petitioners have
been denied due process, owing to the fact that notice of the deci­sion of the
Board of Special Inquiry had not been served upon them prior to its <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> by the Board of Commissioners, and (2) whe­ther
the Board of Commissioners had acted in excess of its juris­diction in affirming
said decision of the Board of Special Inquiry.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the first issue, it is not denied that
petitioners herein had been heard and had ample opportunity to introduce their
evidence before the Board of Special Inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their alleged denial of due process is predicated upon the failure to
give them notice of the decision of said Board, before it was reviewed <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> and
affirmed by the Board of Commissioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners maintain that they were thus deprived of the opportunity to
interpose their own appeal before the Board of Commissioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon a review of the record, We are satisfied
that petitioners herein have not been denied due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraphs (b) and (c) of Section 27 of Commonwealth Act No. 613,
as amended by Section 9 of Republic Act No. 503, provide:</p>

<blockquote>"(b) A board of
special inquiry shall have author­ity (1) to determine whether an alien seeking
to enter or land in the Philippines shall be allowed to enter or land or shall
be excluded, and (2) to make its findings and recommendations in all the cases
provided for in section twenty-nine of this Act wherein the Commis­sioner of
Immigration may admit an alien who is other­wise inadmissible. For this
purpose, the board or any member thereof, may administer oaths and take evi­dence
and in case of necessity may issue <u>subpoena</u> and/or <u>subpoena <span class="SpellE">duces</span> <span class="SpellE">tecum</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hearing of all cases brought before a
board of special inquiry shall be con<span style="">ducted
under rules of procedure to be prescribed by the Commissioner of Immigration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of any two members of the board
shall prevail and shall be final unless reversed on appeal by the Board of
Commissioners as hereafter stated, or, in the ab­sence of an appeal, unless
reversed by the Board of Commissioners after a review by it, <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> of the
entire proceedings within one year from the pro­mulgation of said
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the conclusion of the
hearing of any case, the board of special inquiry shall at once proceed to
deliberate and decide on the merits thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The decision shall be promulgated and the findings and recommendation,
in proper cases, sub­mitted not later than two days from the date of the
deliberation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should the board of
special inquiry need more time to make a written decision of findings and recommendation
in view of the nature of the case, the chairman thereof shall report the case
to the Commis­sioner of Immigration who may grant an extension of time if he
considers it necessary.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(c) An alien
excluded by aboard of special in­quiry or a dissenting member thereof may
appeal to the Board of Commissioners, whose decision in the case shall be
final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision on appeal shall be
put in writing and promulgated not less than seven days from the time the case
is submitted for decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In appeal cases,
the alien shall have the right to be re­presented by an attorney or counsel who
shall have access to the record of the board of special inquiry in the
particular case on appeal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to these provisions, the decision of a Board of Spe­cial
Inquiry may be reviewed by the Board of Commissioners, either on appeal taken
by an alien excluded by said decision, or <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>pro­prio</u></span> "within one year from the
promulgation of said decision." The proceedings before the Board of
Special Inquiry "shall be conducted under the rules of procedure to be
prescribed by the Commissioner of Immigration," pertinent provisions of
which are:</p>

<blockquote>"When an alien is excluded by a board of special inquiry he
shall be advised of the decision together with the reason or reasons <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>; also of his right to ap­peal his case to the
Board of Commissioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In every case
the alien shall be furnished with a copy of the deci­sion upon promulgation
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the applicant appeals, he
shall thereupon be informed of his right to be repre­sented by attorney or
counsel in prosecuting his appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An
attorney or counsel representing an appellant shall have access to the records
of the proceedings of the board in the particular case, and may also appear in
person before the Board of Commissioners on behalf of his client."
(Section 14)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Appeals must be in writing and filed with the board of
special inquiry which decided the case, with­in forty-eight hours from the time
a copy of the deci­sion is furnished the applicant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No appeal filed after this period shall be
accepted. " (Section 16, subdivision B, Rule 2)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The record of the hearing and all documents considered by a
board of special inquiry in reaching its decision shall be forwarded, within
two days from the date of notice of intention to appeal is filed, to the
Commissioner of Immigration for considera­tion by the Board of
Commissioners." (Section 17)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to these rules, an alien whose exclusion has been
ordered by a Board of Special Inquiry "shall be advised of the de­cision,
together with the reason or reasons <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>; also of
his right to appeal his case to the Board of Commissioners," and the
appeal "must be in writing and filed with the board of special in­quiry x <span class="SpellE">x</span> within forty-eight hours from the time a copy of the de­cision
is furnished the applicant." In the case at bar, it is conce­ded that
petitioners herein had no notice of said decision of the Board of Special
Inquiry until September 20, 1963, when they re<span style="">ceived the communication of the Secretary of the Board of Com­missioners
enclosing copy of the decision thereof dated December 20, 1962, affirming that
of the Board of Special Inquiry, dated Sep­tember 8, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said decision of the Board of Commissioners
explicitly stated that "in a decision, dated </span><st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="9"><span style="">September 8, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, " the Board of Special Inquiry had
"decided to exclude" the petitioners "for failure to prove their
claim to Philippine citizenship." This was sufficient notice of said
decision of the Board of Special Inquiry, so that, if pe­titioners wanted to
appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, they could have done so within the
period prescribed in the aforementioned rules, but petitioners herein did not
do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, said decision
of the Board of Special Inquiry has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
owing to petition­ers' failure to appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> or
to move that the decision of the Board of Commissioners be reconsidered or set
aside, so that they (petitioners) could appeal from the decision of the Board
of Special Inquiry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the Board of Commissioners is assailed as null
and void, upon the ground that the authority of that Board to <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> review
the proceedings may be exercised only "within one year from the
promulgation" of the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry of September
8, 1962, or not later than September 8, 1963, and that notice of the decision
of the Board of Commis­sioners was not serve upon petitioners herein until
September 20, 1963, or twelve (12) days after the expiration of said
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The flaw in this argument is
manifest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is based upon the
assumption that the action of the Board of Commissioners is coetaneous with the
service of said notice, which is obviously false.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the record shows that the Board of Commissioners had
gone over the records of the case and voted thereon <u>on </u><st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="12"><u>Decem­ber 20, 1962</u></st1:date>, or well
within the aforesaid period of one year from <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This fact has been fully established by the vot­ing slip of said Board,
by the testimony of its Secretary, <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Noche</span>, and by the Memorandum <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
H of Victor F. de <span class="SpellE">Romas</span>, the Chief of the Law and
Investigation Division of the Bureau of Immigration It is already settled that
"the operative date of the Commissioners <span style="">action is that when the resolution of exclusion was <u>voted and
adopted</u> by them as a Board, regardless of the date when the decision <u>in</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>extenso</u></span> was prepared, written and
signed," for, in the language of Mr. Justice J. B. L. Reyes:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the
decision <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>extenso</u></span> must relate back to
the day the resolution to exclude was ac­tually adopted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily, the extended opinion <span style="">had to be posterior to the day when the
Commis­sioners voted and resolved to reverse the findings of the Board of
Special Inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Secretary's
certificate (Annex F, L-24853) shows that the Board of Immigration Commissioners
acted upon not less than eight immigration cases (including that of the <span class="SpellE">Gatchalians</span>) on July 6, 1962; and it was of course
impracticable to prepare and sign fully reasoned decisions in all these cases
on the same day. "</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

vote for <span style="">landing, a note thereof shall
be made and the alien shall, <u>without</u> waiting for the <u>decision</u> to

of the written decision of the board is furnished to an alien.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, section 12 contemplates an alien
who is under 'custody', while section 14 contemplates a case of an alien
'excluded by a board of special in­quiry'. Nonetheless, there seems to be no
reason why the same rule would not apply to the case at bar, where the
petitioner, who was 'unanimously voted' for admission by the Board of Special
Inquiry No. 1, was at liberty pending the conclusion of the investigation of
his <span class="SpellE">filiation</span> and paternity to a Filipino
citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in any of these
circumstances, the date of promulgation is the date when the Board of Special
Inquiry in question voted and resolved to admit an alien, and this date can be
ascertained from the mi­nutes of the proceedings had before such board. x <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In short, the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry was re­viewed
and affirmed by the Board of Commissioners on <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1962</st1:date>, or within the period prescribed by law
<span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the decision of the Board of Commissioners is perfectly valid, ap­art
from the fact that, independently of said decision, that of the Board of
Special Inquiry may be deemed final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
owing to petitioners' failure to appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may not be amiss to note, also, that petitioners have never
assailed the correctness of the findings made and the conclusions reached in
either decision. Referring to a comparable situation, in connection with taxes,
it has been held:</p>

<blockquote>"Yet further, the confessed purpose of the mo­tion of <st1:date year="1940" day="9" month="4">April 9, 1940</st1:date>, condemns it, and the
action on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legislative policy of
speeding the disposal of income tax controversies by limiting the time for
review cannot be thus nullified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside
from the statement attributed to the Board member, the purpose of the procedure
is evident on the face of the motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The sole reason it offered for vacating the decision was that a copy had
not been served.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not asserted
that the decision was incorrect or irregular in itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What sense would there be in vacating a
correct decision in order to serve another identical decision? x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." [Commis­sioner of
Internal Revenue v. Realty Operators, Inc., 118 F. 2d 286, 288-289.]</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J.</i>: </p>

<p class="BODY">I concur.</p>

<p class="BODY">I find it necessary, however, to make it clear that the reason
for my concurrence is because I agree with the holding that the Board of
Commissioners has acted, contrary to petitioners' contention, well within its
prerogatives and within the period allowed to it by law within which to act,
rather than because I con­sider the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry as
having already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Truth to tell, I feel very strongly that the
admitted failure of the immigration authorities to serve on petitioners notice
of the decision of <span style="">the </span>Board of
Special Inquiry before the Board of Commissioners took up and decided the case <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">proprio</span></u></span> is somehow short of being fair, even <span style="">as I agree, </span>not without reluctance
which I shall explain, that from the strict technical viewpoint, such failure
did not constitute a denial of due pro­cess, specially in the procedural sense.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated in the <span style="">main </span>opinion,
the pertinent le­<span style="">gal </span>provision
is the following paragraph of the Philip­pine Immigration Act, Commonwealth Act
613, as amended:</p>

<blockquote>"(b) A board of
<span style="">special </span>inquiry shall have
authority (1) to deter­mine whether an alien seeking to enter or land in the
Philippines shall be allowed to enter or land or shall be excluded, <span style="">and (2) to </span>make its findings and
recommenda<span style="">tions in all the </span><span style="">cases </span><span style="">provided for in section twenty-nine of this Act wherein the
Commissioner of Immigra</span>tion may admit an alien who is otherwise
inadmissible. For this purpose, the board or any member thereof, may administer
oaths and take evidence and in case of ne­cessity may issue <u>subpoena</u>
and/or <u>subpoena</u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>duces</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>tecum</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hearing of all cases brought before a
board of special inquiry shall be conducted under rules of procedure to be
prescribed by the Commission­er of Immigration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The decision of any two members of the Board shall prevail and shall be
final unless reversed on appeal by the Board of Commissioners as hereafter
stated, or, in the absence of an appeal, unless reversed by the Board of
Commissioners after a review by it, <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> of the entire proceed­ings within one year
from the pro­mulgation of said decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the conclusion of the hearing of any case, the board of special
inquiry shall at once proceed to deliberate and decide on the merits
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision shall be
promulgated and the findings and recommendation, in proper cases, submitted not
lat­er than two days from the date of the deliberation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should the board of special inquiry need more
time to make a written decision of find­ings and recommendation in view of the
nature of the case, the chair­man thereof shall report the case to the
Commissioner of Immigration who may grant an extension of time if he considers
it necessary.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(c) An alien
excluded by a board of special inquiry or a dissenting member thereof may
appeal to the Board of Commissioners, whose deci­sion in the case shall be
final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision on appeal shall be
put in writing and promulgated not less than seven days from the time the case
is submitted for decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In appeal
cases, the alien shall have <span style="">the right
to be represented by an attorney or counsel who shall have access to the record
of the board of special inquiry <span style="">in </span>the
particular case on appeal." </span><span style="">(Sec­tion
</span><span style="">27, Commonwealth Act 613, as
amended by Section 9 of Republic Act No. 503.)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the applicable provisions of the rules
prescribed by the Commissioner of Immigration pur­suant to authority under the
same law<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>read thus:</p>

<blockquote>“14. When an alien
is excluded by a board of special inquiry, he shall be advised of the decision
together with the reason or rea­sons <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>; also,
of his right to appeal his case to the Board of Commissioners. In every case,
the alien shall be furnished with a copy of the decision upon pro­mulgation
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the appli­cant appeals, he
shall thereupon be informed of his right to be re­presented by attorney or
counsel in prosecuting his appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An
attorney or counsel representing an appellant shall have access to the records
of the proceedings of the board in the particular case, and may also appear in
person be­fore the Board of Commissioners on behalf of his client." (Rule
1, Subdivision <span style="">E, Par. 14, Immigra­tion
Rules and Regulations of Jan­uary 1, 1941.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“15. An alien
desiring <span style="">to </span>appeal may do <span style="">so </span>personally, or through any relative
or friend, or through any person, including attorneys permitted to practice
before immi­gration authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Where such an appeal has been taken, any fur­ther
appeal shall be disregarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appeals
purporting to be filed on behalf of an alien but without his knowledge or
consent previously obtained, may be ignored.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A board member who dissents from a majority vote to admit, also may take
an appeal by observing all the rules concerning appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a case, the alien shall be allowed
the same opportunity for representation as though the appeal were his, but his
brief or argument must be submitted at the same time that the board member's
appeal is forwarded to the Board of Commissioners." (Rule 2, Subdivision
A, Par. 15, Ibid.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"16. Appeals
must be in writing and filed with the board of special inquiry which decided
the case, <u><span style="">within </span></u><u><span style="">forty</span>-eight
hours</u> from the time a copy of the decision is fur­nished the
applicant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No appeal filed after this
period shall be accepted." (Rule 2, Subdivision B, Par. 16, Ibid.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>“17. The record of
the hearing and all documents considered by a board of special inquiry in
reaching its decision shall be forwarded, <u>within two days</u> <span style="">from the date notice of intention to appeal
is filed, to the Commissioner of Immigration for con­sideration by the Board of
Commis­sioners.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"18. The
applicant or his attor­ney or counsel may submit a memoran­dum, if he so
desires, to the Board of Commissioners <u>within five days </u>from the date he
is notified of the receipt in the Office of the Commis­sioner of Immigration of
the records of the proceedings of the board of special inquiry." (Rule 2,
Pars. 17 &amp; 18, <span class="SpellE">Subidivision</span> C, Ibid.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>“21. The
Commissioner of Immigra­tion, in his discretion, may allow or permit the alien
applicant or his counsel to argue orally his case be­fore the Board of
Commissioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this purpose, the
applicant shall be given <u>one</u> <u>hour</u>, which period may be extended
in the discretion of the Commissioner of Immigration." (Rule 3,
Subdivision A, Par. 21, Ibid.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>“22. The decision of
any two mem­bers of the Board of Commissioners shall prevail, and said decision
in the case shall be final.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“23. At any time
before the alien is deported, but not later than <u>seven days</u> from the
date he receives notice of the decision on appeal of the Board of
Commissioners, the applicant or his attorney or counsel may file a petition for
rehearing only on the ground of newly discovered evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such petition shall be in writing and shall
set forth the nature of the evidence discovered and the reason or reasons why
it was not produced be­fore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If in the
judgment of the Board of Commissioners such evidence is ma­terial and not
merely cumulative and is of such a nature as to warrant, in the opinion of the
above-mentioned Board, a change in the decision of the hoard of special
inquiry, and a proper showing is made that the existence of such new evidence
was unknown at the time of the hearing and could not by reasonable diligence
have been found and produced, the Board of Commission­ers may remand the case
to the same or another board of special inquiry for rehearing which shall have
the effect of staying the order of deport­ation. The procedure of hearing and
appeal as discussed under Rules 1 and 2 shall be observed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“24. Not more than
one motion for rehearing and no motion for reconsideration of the decision of
the Board of Commissioners shall be entertained." (Rule 3, Subdivi­sion A,
Par. 21; Subdivision B, Par. 22; Subdivision C, Pars. 23 &amp; 24, Ibid.)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Reading the legal provision and implementing rule together, I am
convinced that the so-called right of an alien or applicant for admission into
the Philippines to appeal from an adverse decision of the Board of Special
Inquiry is not such a substantive one as to render with­out legal efficacy a
review thereof by the Board of Com­missioners even when no appeal has been
taken thereto by the excluded party, either due to his own fault or any other
cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law appears to be very clear
in that even without any appeal, the Board of Commissioners, may <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">proprio</span></u></span> review the decision of the Board of Special
Inquiry within one year from the promulgation of the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It follows, therefore, that in every case
where the Board, of Commissioners exercises this power of review <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">proprio</span></u></span><u><span style="">, </span></u>any
right to appeal on the part of the excluded alien is a mere formality adding
nothing either to the reviewing faculty of the Board or to the scope of the
action that it may take within its authority.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Adding strength <span style="">to </span>this
conclusion is the fact that as may be seen in the above provisions of the law
and the rules, any member of the Board who dissents from a majority ruling of
exclusion may appeal in his own name, and in such a case, such ap­peal inures
to the benefit and may be availed of by the excluded party.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of this discussion, when does a deci­sion of the
Board of Special Inquiry adverse to an appli­cant become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>? Both the law and the rules have no specific
provision on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the
exception of the provision in the rules that no ap­peal filed after forty-eight
hours after the applicant is furnished with a copy of the decision of the Board
of Special Inquiry may be accepted, there is nothing else to indicate what
happens to said decision should no appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
be opportunely made either by the appli­cant or any member of the Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I cannot imagine, how­ever, that it becomes
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> upon the expi­ration of the above
forty-eight hours without any appeal being taken, for such a view would in
effect negate the power of the Board of Commissioners to act thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The most then that can be said in such regard
is that after said forty-eight hours, the applicant may no longer assail the
decision of the Board of Special Inquiry upon his own initiative and that he is
thereafter left, <span style="">in </span>a manner of
speaking, to the mercy of the Board of Commis­sioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, under the rules, no motion
for reconsideration of the decision of the Board of Com­missioners is allowed,
only a motion for rehearing on the sole ground of newly discovered evidence and
filed within seven (7) days from the date notice of the decision is received by
the aggrieved party may be entertained, and so it is the decision of the Board
of Commissioners that may be said to become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
whether such be by virtue of an appeal of the applicant or member of the Board
of Special Inquiry or a <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> review by the Board of Commissioners upon
the expiration of the said seven (7) days.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Of course, if no appeal is taken and the Board of Commissioners does not
act within one year, then the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry becomes
auto­matically final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> upon the
expiration of such one year period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I
see it, therefore, there is no in­stance when the decision of the Board of
Special Inquiry becomes final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> merely
because of the expira­tion of the period of forty-eight hours within which the
excluded applicant may appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is only in the light of the foregoing views and the fact that
it does not appear that petitioners are questioning at this stage the
correctness of the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry that I find it
possible to overlook the admitted complete failure of the immigra­tion office
to notify petitioners in this case of the ad­verse decision of the Board of
Special Inquiry. Other­wise, I would hold that such incomprehensible lack of no­tice
is not only an <span class="SpellE">unexcusable</span> dereliction of duty and a
censurable act of plain injustice but also a ground for setting aside the
proceedings in the Board of Commission­ers, so that petitioners may be given
the chance to ap­peal, the possibility of the Commissioners being already
probably inclined against them notwithstanding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, it is only because, as I have stated, I do not find that
our immigration law makes the appeal from a de­cision of the Board of Special
Inquiry a substantive right protected by the due process requirements of the
Constitution that I concur in the result of this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated in the main opinion, the first time peti­tioners were
notified of the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry adverse to them was on
<st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1963</st1:date> when
they were at the same time notified of the <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">proprio</span></u></span>
review by the Board of Commissioners and of their decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, it is not clear to me
that in the said notice of <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="9">September
 20, 1963</st1:date>, petition­ers <span style="">were
even informed of the reasons why they were excluded by the Board of Special
Inquiry, in violation of </span>the rules I have quoted above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much less does it appear that they were
furnished with a copy of said decision as required by said rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am at a loss to understand how, under such
circumstances, the decision of the Board of Special <span style="">Inquiry </span>in the case at bar could have become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> by reason of the failure of the peti­tioners to
appeal the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I find unacceptable the
pro­position, seemingly implied in the main opinion, that such appeal could
still have been made even after the Board of Commissioners had already decided
the case after a review <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">proprio</span></u></span>
of the decision of the Board of Special In­<span style="">quiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It is simply beyond
me how such an appeal could have been made, and if what is meant by such view
is that anyway, the right to file a motion for reconsideration is in effect a
mode of giving petitioners a chance to present or voice their side before the
Board of Commissioners, as an alternative to their lost right to appeal, I
cannot see how even this could have been done because, as already demonstrated,
no motion of such kind may be filed under the<span style=""> </span>rules.</p>

<p class="BODY">Frankly, I cannot escape the conclusion that herein petitioners
were deprived of their opportunity to appeal to which they are entitled
specifically under the law and the procedure for which is outlined completely
with ela­borate details in the rules.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not for nothing has the law granted such right and the rules fixed such
an elaborate procedure <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, while such denial is in a sense
lamentable, because once a right is granted, it best that it is respected no
matter how legally insubstantial it may be, in another sense, petitioners have
very little cause for complaint, since the Board of Commissioners has reviewed
their case and found the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry against them
to be correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, as I have
earlier observed, petitioners do not question in this proceeding the merits of
the said decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their alleged causes
of action here are limited to the alleged lack of jurisdiction of the Board of
Commissioner to act and illegality of the denial to them of their right to
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On these two scores, and for the
considera­tions I have already discussed above, I have no reason to disagree
with the main opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I
have to also vote to reverse the judgment of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo.<o:p></o:p></u></p>
