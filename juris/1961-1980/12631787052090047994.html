				G.R. No. L-17996, January 30, 1965</h4>
				<H3>PHILIPPINE TRANSPORT AND GENERAL WORKERS ORGANIZATION (PTGWO-ITF) PETITIONER, VS. HON. JUDGE JULIO VILLAMOR AND NORTHWEST AIRLINES, INC., RESPONDENTS.
RESOLUTION</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REGALA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This Court, in a resolution dated December 18, 1964, requested the parties to 
show cause why the petition in this case should not be dismissed for the reason 
that the strike of the Northwest Airlines Flight Engineers in the United States, 
which precipitated the action of the petitioner, has already been settled. The 
petitioner, in its manifestation, stated that the dispute of the International 
Association of Machinists, in behalf of the Flight Engineers of the Northwest 
Airlines, which gave rise to the labor dispute, had already been submitted to an 
arbitration board in America. The petitioner further admitted that the picketing 
in the strike of the Flight Engineers-had therefore ceased.</p>
<p>However, the petitioner feels that the question to be decided is whether the 
term "affiliation" provided in Republic Act No. 875 in the interpretation of 
section 9(d) therefor would be construed to mean an international affiliation, 
and this question should still be decided by the Supreme Court as a guide for 
future labor disputes. Hence, the petitioner wants this case to be decided in 
the interest of jurisprudence.</p>
<p>This Court, however, feels that the case has become moot and academic, hence, 
tihe petition is hereby dismissed. Without costs.</p>
