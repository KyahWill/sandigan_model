sued the petitioner, among four other defendants, in Civil Case No. Q-54 of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, for the expropriation
of about 1,360,000 square meters of land owned by it and situated within the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As petitioner correctly
puts it, the only question to decide here is whether or not in determining the

expropriated property, for income tax purposes, portion of the purchase price
paid in the form of tax-exempt bonds issued under Republic Act </span><span style="">No. 333 </span><span style="">should be included.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The pertinent provisions
of law involved are found in Section 9 of the Act abovementioned which reads as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President
of the Philippines is authorized to <span style="">issue,
in </span>the name and behalf of the Republic of the Philippines, bonds in an
amount of twenty mil<span style="">lion pesos, the
proceeds of which shall be used as a revolving fund for the acquisition of
private estates, the subdivision of the area, and the construction of streets,

of the Republic of the Philippines or by any political or municipal
subdivisions thereof, which fact shall be stated upon their face, in accordance
with this Act, under which the said bonds are issued</u>."<u> [</u>Underscoring
supplied]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner maintains that
the portion (paid in tax-exempt Government Bonds) of the profit it derived from
the expropriation of its property should not be made subject to income tax, for
the reasons that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the Republic of
the Philippines gave no concession to petitioner in the compromise agreement
involved in this case except that, as testified to by the lawyer who represented
petitioner in the negotiations which led to the compromise agreement in
question, it was understood between the parties, and it was precisely the only
inducement, according to the witness, that made petitioner accept payment of
P625,315.90 in Government Bonds instead of cash, that said bonds would be
"tax-free"; now, it is argued that by tax-free is meant that by
acceptance of the bonds rather than cash, petitioner would not also have to pay
income tax on the exchange gain from said bonds;</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">(2) that the third paragraph of Section 9 of
the Act granting tax exemption on bonds issued <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>
was inserted in the law as a further inducement to private land owners within
the new capital site to part away with their properties in favor of the
Government other than for cash, which legislative history of the law allegedly
sustains the position of petitioner; and (3) Congress must have really intended
such income tax exemption under Republic Act No. 333 since, similar provisions
in Republic Act No. 1400,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> likewise involving the expropriation of </span>private'
estates, expressly declare that the price paid by the Government for the lands
acquired for resale to ten­ants under the authority of said Act (Republic Act
No. 1400) shall not be considered as income of the landowner for purposes of
the income tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This- reasoning was
brushed aside by the respondent Court of Tax Appeals in its decision under
review, on the following rationale:</p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner contends that since the Government bonds which it
received as part payment of the price of its lot were exempt from taxation, the
deficiency assessment made by respondent against it is not in order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, respondent claims that the
exemption of Government bonds refers only to documentary stamps on the bonds
and does not include income tax on the income derived by petitioner which was paid
to him in the form of bonds.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The pertinent portion of Section 9 of Republic Act No. 333,
which is the sole basis of petitioner's claim for exemption, provides:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘Said bonds shall be exempt from taxation by the Government of the
Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or by any political or municipal subdivision thereof, which fact shall be
stated upon their face, in accordance with this Act, under which the said bonds
are issued.'</p>

<blockquote>"There can be no question that petitioner is taxable on its
income derived from the sale of its property to the Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that a portion of the purchase price
of the property was paid by the Government <span style="">in </span>the form of tax exempt bonds does
not operate to exempt said income from income tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The income from the sale of the land in question
and the bonds are two different and distinct taxable items so that the exemption
of one does not operate to exempt the other, unless the law expressly so
provides.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is alleged that to deny exemption from income tax on the
amount represented by the said bonds would be to nullify the purpose of the law
in granting exemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question has
been asked:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If income or gain derived
from the acceptance of such bonds in exchange for private estates would be
taxed, what inducement did such provision of Republic Act No. 333 give to land
owners to accept payment in bonds for their properties in the proposed site of
the Capital City?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To our mind, there is
sufficient inducement, and that is, the exemption not only of the bonds from
documentary stamp tax but also <span style="">of </span>the
interest derived from such bonds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 29(b) (4) of the National Internal Revenue Code exempts interest
derived from such bonds from income tax to the extent provided in the law
authorizing the issue thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Counsel for petitioner also allege that the prevailing rule <span style="">obtaining in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> before removal of exemptions of
government obligations was <span style="">to exempt </span>such
bonds from income tax both as to principal and interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To quote from the memorandum of counsel:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘x x <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Actually,
most of the Federal Treasury Bonds issued by the U.S. Government from 1921 to

exemptions on obligations issued by the United States and its agencies and instrumentalities,
were ?</p>

<p class="2Q">‘"exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation
now or hereafter imposed by the United States, any State, or any of the
possessions of the United States, or by any local taxing <span style="">authority, </span>except (a) estate or
inheritance taxes, and (b) graduated additional income taxes, known as
surtaxes, and excess profits and war-profits taxes, now or hereafter imposed by
the United States, upon the income or profits of individuals, partnerships,
associations, or corporations." (I <span class="SpellE">Mertens</span>, Law
of Federal Income Taxation, pp. 297-313).' [See page 12, Memorandum of counsel
for petitioner, <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1963</st1:date>.]</p>

<blockquote>"Apparently the import of the ruling quoted above from the
book of <span class="SpellE">Mertens</span> has not been clearly understood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We </span>think that the exemption referred to
therein of both principal and interest has reference to the exemption from income
tax of the income derived from the sale or exchange of the bonds and the
interest paid by the <span style="">U.S. </span>Government on such bonds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The opinion quoted from <span class="SpellE">Mertens</span> is
inapplicable to the instant case because it does not refer to any income
derived by petitioner from the sale or exchange of bonds received by petitioner
from the Government under Republic Act No. 333.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The tax here involved is on the income derived from the sale of
petitioner's property to the Government, not the income derived from the sale
or exchange of the bonds.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Mention has been made of Republic Act No. 1400, Section 22 of
which provides that 'the purchase price paid by the Government for any
agricultural land acquired for resale to tenants under the authority of this
Act, whether by negotiation or expropriation, shall not be considered as income
of the landowner concerned for purposes of the income tax.' It is argued that since
Republic Acts Nos. 333 and 1400 are in <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">pari</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>materia</u></span>, </span>both should be
construed together, and since Republic Act <span style="">No. </span>1400 exempts income derived from the sale of property to the
Government under said Act, the same <span style="">exemption
</span>should also apply to income derived from the sale of property to the
Government under Republic Act No. 333.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is precisely because Republic Act No. 1400 contains an express
exemption from income tax of the income derived by property owners from the
sale of their lands under said Act and the absence of a <span style="">simi</span>lar provision in Republic Act No. 333 which <span style="">indicates plainly that Congress intended not
to grant such exemption to </span>landowners under Republic Act No. 333.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If Congress had intended to grant exemption
from income tax with respect to income derived by a person from the sale of his
property under Republic Act No. 333, it should have expressly made an express
provision to that effect as it did in Republic Act No. 1400; that it did not,
is a clear indication that its purpose was to withhold such exemption."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>We find no cogent reasons
to disturb the above holding of the Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been the constant and uniform holding
of this Court that exemption from taxation is not favored and is never
presumed; in fact, if it is granted, the grant must be strictly construed
against the taxpayer.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Affirmatively put, the law requires courts to frown on alleged exemptions from
taxation, hence, an exempting provision in a legislative enactment should be

This Court has been most consistent in this holding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Asiatic Petroleum Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
it was explained beyond any possibility of miscomprehension that:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Exemptions from taxation are highly disfavored, so much so that they may almost
be said to be odious to the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He who
claims an exemption must be able to point to some positive provision of law
creating the right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be allowed
to exist upon a vague implication x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The books are
full of very strong expressions on this point.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As was said by the Supreme Court of Tennessee in Memphis vs. U. &amp; P.
Bank (91 Tenn., 546, 550), ‘The right of taxation is inherent in the
State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a prerogative essential to
the perpetuity of the government; and he who claims an exemption from the
common burden, must justify his claim by the clearest grant of organic or
statute law.' Other utterances equally or more emphatic come readily to hand
from the highest authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Ohio Life
Ins. and Trust Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Debolt</span> (16 Ho­ward, 416), it
was said by Chief Justice Taney, that the right of taxation will not be held to
have been surrendered, 'unless the intention to surrender is manifested by
words too plain to be mistaken.’ In the case of the Delaware Railroad Tax (18
Wallace, 206,226), the Supreme Court of the United States said that the
surrender, when claimed, must be shown by clear, unambiguous language, which
will admit of no reasonable construction consistent with the reservation of the
power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a doubt <span style="">arise as </span>to the intent of the
legislature, that doubt must be resolved in favor of the State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Erie Railway Company vs. <st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">Com</span>monwealth</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Pennsylvania</st1:placename></st1:place>
(21 Wallace, 492, 499), Mr. Justice Hunt, speaking of exemptions, observed that
a State cannot strip itself of the most essential power of taxation by doubtful
words.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'It cannot, by ambiguous
language, be deprived of this highest attribute of sovereignty.’ In <st1:state><st1:place>Tennessee</st1:place></st1:state>
vs. Whitworth (117 <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
129, 136), it was said: 'In all cases of this kind the question is as to the
intent of the legislature, the presumption always being against any surrender
of the taxing power.' In Farrington vs. <st1:state><st1:place>Tennessee</st1:place></st1:state>
and <st1:place><st1:placetype>County</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Shelby</st1:placename></st1:place>
(95 <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> 679, <span style="">685), </span>Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Swayne</span>
said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> When exemption is
claimed, it must be shown indubitably to exist.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the outset, every presumption is against it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A well-founded doubt is fatal to the claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only when the terms of the concession
are too explicit to admit fairly of any other construction that the proposition
can be supported.’"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above rules should be applied to the case at bar where the
law invoked (Section 9 of Republic Act No. 333) does not make any reference
whatsoever to exemption of income derived from the sale of expropriated
property <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>, unlike under Republic Act No.
1400 where, re­lative to the price paid by the Government for any agricultural
land acquired for resale to tenants, there is an express declaration that the
same "shall not be considered as income of the landowner concerned for
purposes of the income tax." <span style="">Nor </span>are We convinced by the argument that the
particular provision of Republic Act No. 333 relied upon which grants exemption
on bonds issued <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> for purposes of inducement
to private land owners within the new capital site to part away with their
properties in favor of the Government other than for cash should be taken to
mean that said property owners need not pay income tax on their income derived
from the sale of such properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
pertinent Congressional Record of the proceedings held during the consideration
of the bill which later became Republic Act No. 333,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
does not show that Congress had intended to exempt said property owners from
the payment of income tax on the proceeds of the sale of their properties when
the same is paid in government bonds issued under the said law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, even were We to assume, for the
sake of argument, that the Capitol City Planning Commission and other officials
of the government did make some assurance or promise to herein petitioner that
the portion of the price of its expropriated property paid in tax-exempt
government bonds would not be made subject to income tax payment, such
assurance or promise, made without statutory sanction, cannot bind the
Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same amounts to a
surrender of the State's power to require payment of income tax, which in this
case is not explicitly granted by Republic Act No. 333.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a well-known rule that erroneous
application and enforcement of the law by public officers do not block
subsequent correct application of the statute,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
and that the Government is never <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> by mistake
or error on the part of its agents.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
In the present circumstances, the Collector of Internal Revenue is right in
assessing a­gainst petitioner the deficiency income tax in question, consonant
with the proposition that income from expro­priation proceedings is income from
sales or exchange and therefore taxable.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>
