				<BR><STRONG>CASTRO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Submitted for consideration is the petitioners' "Motion <span class="GramE">For</span> Clarification," dated <st1:date year="1977" day="16" month="3">16 March, 1977</st1:date>, of a portion of the Court's Resolution of <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1977</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court's Resolution, among others, directed the payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> in their total equivalent of <u>three</u> years
without qualification and deduction, without, however, a pronouncement as to
the rates of computation to be used as bases.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question is whether the payment of the three (3) years' <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> shall be at the pay rates as of <st1:date year="1958" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1958</st1:date> (date of the act of
discrimination, that is, date of discharge) or the current pay rates for
positions similar or comparable to those previously held by the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We have had occasion to
squarely resolve a similar issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Davao</span></u></span></st1:place></st1:city><u><span style=""> Free Workers Front vs. Court of Industrial
Relations</span></u><span style="">, L-29356, </span><st1:date year="1975" day="27" month="10"><span style="">October
 27, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">, 67 SCRA
418, </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">the</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">Court
held as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The Court declares that the computation of the said <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> for over 17 years and strike-duration pay for
five years is <u>at the rate</u> that the petitioners entitled thereto were <u>actually
receiving</u> and <u>being paid at the time of dismissal and strike</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is self-evident from the clear,
unambiguous and express emphasis made by the Court in its opinion as well as in
the judgment itself that such record full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
as well as the strike duration pay <u>are</u> awarded '<u>without deduction and
qualification</u>' as stressed by petitioners themselves in their opposition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This simply means that the workers were to be paid their <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> fixed as of the time of their dismissal or strike
<u>without deduction</u> for their earnings elsewhere during their layoff and <u>without
qualification</u> of their <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> as thus fixed, <u>i</u>.<u>e</u>.
<u>unqualified</u> by any wage increases or other benefits that may have been
received by their co-workers who were not dismissed or did not go on strike.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Otherwise, the main objective of the judgment, of thereby
precisely avoiding the protracted delay in extended post-judgment hearings to
prove or disprove such earnings elsewhere and/or increases received by other
co-workers in similar positions (which in some cases took as long a time, if
not longer, to resolve as the case on its merits) to the grave prejudice of the
workers, would be rendered nugatory."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the respondents notified the
petitioners-strikers to report back for work on <st1:date year="1958" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1958</st1:date>, which the latter did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A great number of them, however, were refused
readmission because there were criminal charges against them pending in the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> office, although non-strikers who were also facing
criminal indictments were readily readmitted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These strikers who were refused readmission on <st1:date year="1958" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1958</st1:date> can thus be categorized as
discriminatorily dismissed employees as of such date and are entitled to <span class="SpellE">backpay</span>, as we so held.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, in line with the above ruling, the pay rates shall be those which
the petitioners were <u>actually receiving and being paid at the time of dismissal</u>,
<u>i</u>.<u>e</u>., <st1:date year="1958" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1958</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With the above
clarification, there appears to be no more <span class="GramE">impediment</span>,
legal or otherwise, to the immediate payment of the amounts due to the
petitioners as <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="">This resolution is
final and immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span></span></u><span style="">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>
