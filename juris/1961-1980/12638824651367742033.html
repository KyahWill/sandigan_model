				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the
decision of the Honorable Court of Appeals, promulgated on <st1:date month="6" day="1" year="1977">June 1, 1977</st1:date>, in CA-G.R. No. SP-06104-R,
affirming the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
dated <st1:date month="7" day="14" year="1976">July 14, 1976</st1:date>,
dismissing the petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed by petitioner against <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> Municipal Judge C. G. <span class="SpellE">Larrobis</span>
and private respondent <span style="">Antonio </span><span class="SpellE">Manabat</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As found by the Court of
Appeals, the facts of this case are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Record shows that on <st1:date month="1" day="8" year="1976">January
 8, 1976</st1:date> herein petitioner filed a complaint for forcible entry
against private respondent Antonio <span class="SpellE">Manabat</span> before the
Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> and the same was docketed as
Civil <span style="">Case No. <span class="GramE">R-118.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was set for hearing on January 30,
1976 but petitioner requested for a postponement of the hearing by sending a
telegraphic message on January 29, 1976 to the Municipal Court, as well as to
the respondent's counsel, on the ground that petitioner's counsel, Atty.
Enrique C. <span class="SpellE">Llenes</span>, died on January 26, 1976, or four
(4) days before the scheduled hearing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The telegram was received by the Municipal Judge on </span><st1:date month="1" day="29" year="1976"><span style="">January
 29, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">, at </span><st1:time hour="15" minute="0"><span style="">3:00</span></st1:time><span style=""> in the afternoon but, despite the said
telegraphic motion for postpone­ment, the Municipal Judge, on </span><st1:date month="2" day="25" year="1976"><span style="">February
 25, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">, dismissed
the complaint on the ground of non-suit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A motion for reconsideration was filed on </span><st1:date month="3" day="3" year="1976"><span style="">March 3, 1976</span></st1:date><span style=""> but again the Municipal Judge, in an order
dated </span><st1:date month="3" day="20" year="1976"><span style="">March 20, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">,
denied the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the filing of
the petition for <i>certiorari</i> before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> on the ground that respondent Judge acted with grave
abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction when he dismissed the
complaint on the ground of non-suit.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"On </span><st1:date month="7" day="14" year="1976"><span class="GramE">July 14, 1976</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, for lack of
merit, dismissed the petition for <i>certiorari</i>" (pp. 18-19, rec.).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The record further shows that on <st1:date month="8" day="8" year="1976">August <span style="">8, </span>1976</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said motion, was however, denied in an order
dated <st1:date month="8" day="25" year="1976">August 25, 1976</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="9" day="15" year="1976">September 15, 1976</st1:date>,
petitioner perfected his appeal to the Court of Appeals and thereafter filed
his "Brief and/or Memorandum" to which neither respondent <span class="SpellE">Manabat</span> nor respondent Municipal Judge filed a reply brief
or memorandum (p. 4, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">The dismissal of petitioner's complaint for forcible entry
against respondent <span class="SpellE">Manabat</span> by <span style="">respondent <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> Municipal Judge was,
according </span><span style="">to </span>the
municipal judge, on the ground of non-suit, or lack of interest on the part of
petitioner in prosecuting his complaint in view of his failure to appear on the
scheduled first hearing of the case on <st1:date month="1" day="30" year="1976">January
 30, 1976</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is not denied by
respondents that petitioner dispatched two telegrams -- one to the court </span>presided
by respondent judge and another to respondent <span class="SpellE">Manabat</span>,
through his counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner,
therefore, never lost interest in the prosecution of his complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent municipal judge acted hastily
when he dismissed the complaint and certainly committed grave abuse of
discretion when in an order dated <st1:date month="3" day="20" year="1976">March
 20, 1976</st1:date> he denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration filed on
<st1:date month="3" day="3" year="1976">March 3, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When a person dies, the first impulse of
anyone who learns of his death is to express words of sympathy and compassion
to the persons affected by his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
client of a lawyer who dies while the case of his client is still pending trial
is one such person who deserves compassion and sympathy upon the untimely death
of his lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is the normal
feeling and reaction of a civilized man.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is most unkind to take advantage of a person's death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A trial judge, whose duty is to administer
justice as law and common sense command him to do, should exhibit such
exemplary understanding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, a
resetting of the case to another date to enable plaintiff to secure the
services of another counsel would not in any way prejudice the substantial
rights of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Manabat</span>, the defendant
in a forcible entry case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
contrary, one such postponement would doubtless be to his benefit, since it
would have the effect of prolonging, through no fault of his, his possession of
the property subject of the proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Of course, WE do not
overlook the fact that the failure of petitioner to appear on the very hour and
date of the first scheduled hearing may authorize the respondent Judge to
dismiss the complaint for non-suit, pursuant to the provision of Sec. 11, Rule
5 of the Revised Rules of Court, which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 11.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Dismissal upon plaintiff's
failure to appear.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- If the
plaintiff does not appear at the time and place designated <span style="">in </span><span style="">the summons or in a subsequent order, the justice of th</span><span style="">e </span><span style="">peace or municipal judge may dismiss the action for failure to
prosecute, and render judgment for the defendant to recover his costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But such dismissal without hearing shall not
be a bar to a subsequent action for the same cause."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">But, then, after the dismissal, when a
motion for reconsideration was filed on well-founded ground, respondent
municipal judge should not have resorted to legal technicalities in maintaining
his order of dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">To compel a party to <span class="SpellE">refile</span> the case
under Section 11 of Rule 5 <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">aforecited</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> would be to subject him to more expenses and to further
delay in the prosecution of his case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Time and time again WE have emphasized that the Rules of Court
should not be interpreted to sacrifice substantial rights of a litigant at the
altar of technicalities to the consequent impairment of the sacred principles
of justice (Alonzo vs. <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>, 16 Phil. 315; Case
&amp; <span class="SpellE">Nantz</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Jugo</span>, 77
Phil. 517, 522).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WE ruled that the Rules
of Court frown upon hair-splitting technicalities that do not square with their
liberal tendency and with the ends of justice (Case &amp; <span class="SpellE">Nantz</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Jugo</span>, <u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">).<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, WE find both respondents Municipal Judge and Court of
Appeals seriously abused their discretion by refusing to liberally construe and
interpret the Rules of Court, which require our courts of justice, in the
exercise of their <span style="">functions, to act
reasonably and not capriciously, and enjoin them to apply the said rules in
order to promote their object and to assist the parties in obtaining a just,
speedy, and inexpensive determination of their cases (Sec. 2, Rule 1, Revised
Rules of Court).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
