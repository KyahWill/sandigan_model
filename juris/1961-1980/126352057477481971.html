				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The answer to the pivotal legal issue in this appeal on a
question of law from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> is supplied by <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Tina
v. Avila,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> a
<i>certiorari</i> proceeding with the petitioner, the debtor, seeking to quash
a writ of execution in favor of one of the respondents, Tan <span class="SpellE">Ching</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ji</span>, plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in
this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the opinion of the Court
penned by Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, the unequivocal holding
is that the five-year period under Rule 39, Section 6 as to when a judgment may
be executed on motion<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
is to be counted not from the date "the judgment became final in the sense
that no appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> could be taken, but when it
became <span class="SpellE">executory</span> in the sense that it could already
be enforced." There is thus sufficient legal basis for plaintiff's
rescission suit, now before this Court on appeal, to set aside the auction sale
of <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Tina's properties, the debtor being the same
petitioner in the aforementioned <i>certiorari</i> proceeding, in favor of
defendant Philippine National Bank,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
sole appellant, insofar as it would adversely affect four specific items
subject to prior attachment lien secured by plaintiff, included in the very
same order of execution issued five years after the finality of the judgment
but within such period counted from the time it could be executed and
enforced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the lower court held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus apparent that its decision cannot
be said to be vitiated by any error. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>We
affirm, but subject to modification as will be hereinafter indicated.</p>

<p class="BODY">As set forth in the appealed decision, plaintiff Tan <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> <span class="SpellE">Ji</span> filed a complaint for
the rescission of an auction sale of certain properties of <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
Tina in favor of defendant, now appellant Philippine National Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was shown in such complaint that in a
civil case<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
for the recovery of the sum of money, he obtained a first lien upon the
properties of defendant <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Tina by means of writs of
attachment duly issued by the same court of first instance and that
subsequently he obtained a judgment in his favor in the sum of P23,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In another civil case filed against the same
debtor, defendant Philippine National Bank was awarded the sum of
P8,772.76.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It then sued out a writ of
execution and caused to be levied upon and sold at public auction the very same
properties already attached by plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The facts were substantially admitted by defendant but as affirmative
defense it was alleged that as a third party it was not bound by a writ of
attachment issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a pre-trial
and thereafter a compromise agreement on both of which occasions there was an
admission on the part of defendant Philippine National Bank that two parcels of
land in the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Dulawan</span>, province of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, a commercial lot in the same municipality as well
as a two-storey commercial and residential building, also in the same
municipality, had been the subject of attachment in favor of plaintiff in his
suit against the debtor, <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Tina.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The decision in the suit between plaintiff and <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
Tina rendered on February 4, 1954 awarded, as noted above, the sum of
P23,000.00 to plaintiff, but upon agreement of the parties defendant <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Tina was given a period of six years within which to
pay, during which time he could hold and enjoy the fruits of such
properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment debt, however,
remained unsatisfied and it was not until <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1962</st1:date> that there was an order for execution
based on such judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
meanwhile, as far back as <st1:date year="1959" day="23" month="2">February 23,
 1959</st1:date>, the very same property, subject of the attachment, had been
acquired by defendant Philippine National Bank in an execution sale resulting
from a judgment in its favor in a suit filed by it against the same debtor for
the amount of P8, 772,76.</p>

<p class="BODY">On those facts, the lower court sustained plaintiff Tan <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> <span class="SpellE">Ji</span>, its decision of
February 5, 1963, specifically declaring "the first and prior attachment
lien in favor of the plaintiff, Tan <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> <span class="SpellE">Ji</span>, on the properties of the defendant <span class="SpellE">Campua</span>
<span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Tina in Civil Case No. 536 valid and subsisting,
and superior to the levy on execution and sale at public auction in favor of
the Philippine National Bank in Civil Case No. 467. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Consequently, the Court declares the levy on
execution, the auction sale, and the Certificate of Judicial Sale, Exhibit 'H',

[fourth parcels], * * * [which] shall be held and remain as they were before

<p class="BODY">The principal legal question on which appellant Philippine
National Bank would seek a reversal of the aforesaid decision is the nullity of
an order of execution upon mere motion filed after five years from the date it
became final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its appeal is doomed to
failure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a contention was
categorically rejected in <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Tina v. <st1:city><st1:place>Avila</st1:place></st1:city>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
referred to at the opening of this opinion, with the very same debtor, <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Tina, as petitioner and plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Tan <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> <span class="SpellE">Ji</span> as one of the
respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">The background facts of the above <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
Tina <i>certiorari</i> proceeding are set forth in the opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span> thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"In Civil Case No. 536 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, Tan <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> <span class="SpellE">Ji</span>, plaintiff, vs. <span class="SpellE">Campua</span> <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Tina, defendant, the parties executed a compromise
agreement, which was submitted to and approved by the Court in its decision
dated February 4, 1954.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under that
agreement the defendant obligated himself to pay the plaintiff the sum of
P23,000.00 'without interest, within a period of six (6) years from date
hereof.' It was also stipulated that certain properties which had been attached
as security would not be released until full payment and that the defendant
'during the period of six (6) years, shall hold and fully enjoy the fruits of
said properties.’"<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
After which came the following recital:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"On <st1:date year="1960" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1960</st1:date>,
after the six-year period had expired, plaintiff Tan <span class="SpellE">Ching</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ji</span> filed a motion for execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was granted and the writ was
issued on <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant <span class="SpellE">Campua</span> <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Tina moved to reconsider on <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1962</st1:date>, announcing in his motion that
he was going to file an ordinary action to enjoin the enforcement of the
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This he did on the following
September 18 (Civil Case No. 1843). On <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="10">October
 20, 1962</st1:date> the court denied the motion for reconsideration in Civil
Case No. 536, and on <st1:date year="1963" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1963</st1:date>
another writ of execution was issued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Several other motions were subsequently filed by the defendant – to
quash the writ of execution or stay its enforcement – but they were all denied
by the Court in its order dated <st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="2">February
 11, 1963</st1:date>."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was at that stage that <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Tina filed
the petition for <i>certiorari</i> to have the writ of execution issued on <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1962</st1:date> and all subsequent
proceedings thereafter annulled and set aside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He invoked "Rule 39, Section 6, which provides that a judgment may
be executed on motion within five (5) years from the date of its entry, and
that after the lapse of such time and before it is barred by the statute of
limitations, a judgment may be enforced by action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention is that since the decision
approving the compromise agreement was rendered on <st1:date year="1954" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1954</st1:date>, it could no longer be executed by mere
motion when respondent, plaintiff below, moved for that purpose on <st1:date year="1960" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1960</st1:date>, more than five
years having then elapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
would have respondent file an ordinary action in order to realize the amount to
which he is unquestionably entitled."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
In the answer of respondent Judge Avila, it was stated "that entry of
judgment in Civil Case No. 536 was made by the Clerk of Court only on February
5, 1960, because it was only then that the judgment had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, and consequently the writ of execution issued on
August 14, 1962 was well within the period of five years provided for in Rule
39, Section 6. Petitioner, on the other hand, argues that said period should be
counted from the date the judgment became final, which was immediately upon its
rendition because it was a judgment on compromise."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Then came the holding in the opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, speaking for the Court:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>
statement of respondent Judge that judgment was entered only in 1960 should be
sufficient to dispose of this petition on the basis of the literal terms of
Rule 39, Section 6, as invoked by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But even irrespective of the date of entry of judgment, the decisive
issue here is not when the judgment became final in the sense that no appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> could be taken, but when it became <span class="SpellE">executory</span> in the sense that it could already be
enforced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it would be idle to speak
of execution or to try to obtain a writ for that purpose if the judgment was
not yet enforceable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rule 39, Section 6,
in providing that a judgment may be executed on motion within five (5) years
from the date of its entry, clearly and logically contemplates the usual situation
wherein such judgment is susceptible of execution or enforcement the moment it
acquires the character of finality."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no disputing the validity of the conclusion reached
by us in the <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Tina decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Could defendant, petitioner here, be
compelled to comply with his obligation under the judgment and, upon failure to
do so, could his properties be levied upon, at any time within six (6) years
from the rendition of the judgment on February 4, 1954?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer is obvious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was given that period within which to
pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His obligation was one with a term
and the term was indubitably for his benefit, as shown by the fact that the
obligation carried no interest liability and that in the meantime he continued
in possession and enjoyment of the properties which were under attachment for
purposes of security.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Article 1193
of the Civil Code an obligation with a term is demandable only when the term
expires.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had respondent demanded payment
from petitioner before the expiration of the term given to him, he could very
well have refused to pay on the ground that his obligation had not yet become
due.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A writ of execution would have been
as futile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since such writ could only
have been effectively issued after the lapse of six (6) years from <st1:date year="1954" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1954</st1:date>, respondent court
committed neither error nor abuse of discretion when he did issue it upon
motion on <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1962</st1:date>
pursuant to Rule 39, Section 6."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The question has thus been definitely set at rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The compelling force of the above decision
leaves appellant without any support for his stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision on appeal is not vitiated
therefore by the allegations in the three related assigned errors that the
order of execution in 1962 is without legal basis as the judgment in favor of
plaintiff had ceased to be enforceable by a mere motion under Section 6 of Rule
39.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor would it call for a reversal of
the appealed decision even if the first assigned error to the effect that the
lower court should have allowed an amendment of the answer of appellant to include
additional affirmative defenses, since even if it were thus, the authoritative
force exerted by <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Tina v. Avila precludes a
reversal of the appealed decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the appealed decision, however, the lower court declared
"the levy on execution, the auction sale, and the Certificate of Judicial
Sale, Exhibit 'H', rescinded and null and void and without any legal effect
with respect only to the properties of <span class="SpellE">Campua</span> <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Tina denominated in the said Exhibit 'H' as [first],
[second], [third] and [fourth parcels], * * * [which] shall be held and remain
as they were before the levy on execution and judicial sale on February 23,
1959, to await the execution and satisfaction of the judgment in Civil Case No.

It should not have gone that far.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
suffices that such "levy on execution, the auction sale, and the
certificate of Judicial Sale, Exhibit 'H'," be deemed as subject to the
rights of the plaintiff Tan <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> <span class="SpellE">Ji</span>
by virtue of the prior and superior attachment lien, which he may now enforce
according to law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the lower court decision of <st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1963</st1:date> is affirmed, with the
