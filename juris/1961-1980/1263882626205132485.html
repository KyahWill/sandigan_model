				<H3>HEIRS OF D. TUASON, INC., HON. WENCESLAO G. CORNEJO, JUDGE
OF THE CITY COURT OF MANILA, BRANCH V, AND CITY SHERIFF OF MANILA, PETITIONERS,
VS. HON. SIMEON M. GOPENGCO, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF

				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The city court of Manila in a decision dated March 9, 1970
ordered Enrique C. Salinas, doing business under the name of Kentucky Fried
Chicken Restaurant, to vacate a lot located at Ramon Magsay­say Boulevard,
Manila, owned by the Heirs of D. Tuason, Inc., and to pay back rentals (Civil
Case <span style="">No.186982).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That </span>judgment
became final.  To enjoin the exe­cution
of that judgment, Salinas filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila a
petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition against the Heirs of D. Tuason,
Inc., the city court and the sheriff of Manila (Civil Case No. 80223).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of First Instance enjoined the execu­tion of the city
court's judgment but, on motion to set aside filed by the Heirs of <span style="">D. </span>Tuason, Inc., the lower court
dissolved the injunction.  Salinas <span style="">in turn </span>filed a motion for
reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court in its order of March 2, 1971 revived the
injunction.  That order was assailed in
the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <span style="">prohibition.  </span>Salinas
answered the petition.  <span style="">The case </span>was <span style="">submitted </span>for decision on July 23, 1971.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span>December 14,
1971 the Heirs of D. Tuason, <span style="">Inc. </span>filed
a motion to dismiss the petition on the ground that in Civil Case No. 80223 the
said firm and Salinas <span style="">had </span>entered
into a compromise which was approved by the lower court in its decision of
October 18, 1971.  Salinas manifested
that he had no objection to the dismissal of the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this <span style="">case
is </span><span style="">dismissed
</span><span style="">for </span>having become moot
and academic.  No costs.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
