				<H3>CHAMBER OF TAXICAB SERVICES, INC., ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an original action for certiorari on the ground of lack of jurisdiction and/or grave abuse of discretion filed against the Public Service Commission and other parties. The order of the Commission complained of was issued on March 5, 1964 and granted to each of one-hundred twenty-five applicants and oppositor counter-applicants <i>provisional permits</i> to operate taxicab units principally in the City of Manila totaling in all 1,000 units.<br><br>On September 25, 1964 Jose M. Silva, one of the respondents, filed a motion to dismiss the present case upon the ground that on September 4 of the same year, the respondent Commission had rendered its decision granting <i>permanent certificates of public convenience</i> to him and h herein co-respondents, either confirming or increasing the number of units granted to each of them under its order of March 5, 1964 mentioned in the preceding paragraph; this obviously rendering the present action for certiorari moot and of no practical importance. A copy of the said decision rendered by the respondent Commission was attached to the motion to dismiss.<br><br>Required to answer the motion aforesaid, petitioners, on October 26, 1964, made of record that they interpose no objection to the dismissal of the following cases:<br><blockquote><table Â ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">Public Service Commission</td><td width="50%">Applicant (Respondent)</td></tr><tr><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td><td width="45%">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Case No. 63-4264 </td><td>Arturo Miranda </td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Case No. 62-4704 </td><td>Ambrosio E. Ona</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>Case No. 62-6073 </td><td>Iluminada Gonzales</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>Case No. 63-6002 </td><td>Milagros Macasaet </td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>Case No. 63-2733 </td><td>Jose M. Silva </td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td>Case No. 63-5224 </td><td>Jose M. Silva </td></tr><tr><td>7.</td><td>Case No. 63-6010 </td><td>Romeo Silva</td></tr><tr><td>8.</td><td>Case No. 62-7102 </td><td>Servillano Manguiat </td></tr><tr><td>9.</td><td>Case No. 63-6017 </td><td>Benedicto Katigbak</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>As a result, on January 31, 1966 We issued a resolution dismissing the present action in relation to the cases enumerated above.<br><br>Considering, however, that the order complained of and whose annulment is sought in the present action for certiorari granted a mere provisional permit to the respondents, and the same was necessarily deemed superseded by the final decision rendered by the Public Service Commission on September 4, 1964, We are of the opinion that the present case has, as a whole, become academic.<br><br>Wherefore, the present petition is dismissed, without costs.<br><br><i>Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez</i> and <i>Ruiz Castro, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br>Petition desmissed.</div>
