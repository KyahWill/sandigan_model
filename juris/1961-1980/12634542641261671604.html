<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">On
the same day, petitioners through counsel appeared before respondent Judge and
opposed the issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction on the ground of
lack of jurisdiction, alleging that the case involved </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">labor dispute and that a charge of unfair labor practice had already
been filed with the Court of Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">They also requested that they be given until the next </span><span style="">day, </span><st1:date year="1962" day="9" month="11"><span style="">November 9, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, to file a memorandum on the matter, with

filing of the plaintiff of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">bond
of P5,000.00, which maybe increased or decreased as circumstances may afterward

United Seamen's Union of the Philippines, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Januario</span>
T. Seno, and all persons, agents and sympathizers to refrain from molesting,
disturbing, or in any manner whatsoever hindering the free movements of all the
employees of plaintiff's vessels, all actual and prospective shippers of
plaintiff's vessels, and all persons engaged in the loading and unloading of cargoes
of plaintiff's vessels.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning, to give the defendants another opportunity
to show cause if any, why the aforementioned writ of preliminary injunction
should be dissolved."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="9" month="11"><span style="">November
 9, 1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> petitioners
moved to reconsider, but the motion was denied on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="11"><span style="">November 13, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners have come to us contesting the juris­diction of the
lower court in taking cognizance of the case (Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">R-7743).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to one of the prayers in the
petition we issued a writ of preliminary injunction on <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1962</st1:date>, ordering respondent Judge to
desist from further proceeding in the case and from enforcing the injunction he
had issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of the contention that the Industrial Court and not
the Court of First Instance has exclusive jurisdiction over the matters
involved in Civil Case No. R-7743 petitioners claim:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that a labor dispute exists and (2) that
their dismissal constitutes an unfair labor practice, being an act of
discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that a labor dispute arose when petitioners
were dismissed from their employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under Section 2(j) of Republic Act 875 a question involving tenure of
employment is included in the term "labor dis­pute."</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
main issue, however, is whether such dismissal cons­titutes an unfair labor
practice so as to bring the case under the jurisdiction of the </span><st1:street><st1:address><span style="">Industrial Court</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sus­taining
the affirmative of the issue, petitioners contend that the closed shop
agreement between the United Seamen's Union of the Philippines and the
respondent company, on the strength of which petitioners were dismissed, is
null and void for being <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of Sections 4(a)
(1) and 4(a) (4), of Republic Act 875, inasmuch as the matter of union
representation of the employees was still pending before the Court of
Industrial Relations at the time said closed shop agreement was executed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The following facts are
pertinent to the resolution of the issue:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On October 4, 1957 respondent company entered into a collective
bargaining agreement with the United Seamen's Union of the Philippines,
effective for a period of two (2) years, and thereafter for another period of
one (1) year unless either party should notify the other </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">writing, not less than sixty (60) days prior
to the expiry date, of its intention and election to terminate the agreement as
of the end of the current term.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="18" month="7">July 18, 1959</st1:date>
said collective bargaining agree­ment was extended for another period of two
(2) years, counted from <st1:date year="1959" day="4" month="10">October 4,
 1959</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 6 and 31, 1959 the Philippine Labor Federation and the
General Maritime Stevedores Union of the Philippines filed separate petitions
for certification election with the Court of Industrial Relations, to which the
United Seamen's Union of the Philippines presented an opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="1">January
 17, 1961</st1:date> respondent company and the United Seamen’s <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
renewed their collective bargaining agreement, with additional conditions for a
period of five (5) years counted from its execution.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with respondent company that the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the petitions for certification election did not bar or preclude the renewal
of the collective bargaining agreement with the United Seamen's <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Other­wise
there would be a gap or interregnum during which no agreement would govern,
that is, from the time the old collective bargaining contract expired to the
time the peti­tion for certification election is decided and a new agreement
entered into with the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> that may be duly certified <span style="">as </span><span style="">the proper bargaining unit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without any <span style="">agreement to govern the relations between labor and management in the
interim, the situation would well be productive of confusion and result in
breaches of the </span></span><span style="">law </span><span style="">by either party (<span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> </span><span style="">Milling
Co. <span style="">vs. <span class="SpellE">Victorias-Manapla</span>

L-18467 &amp; 18470, </span></span><st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="9"><span style="">Sept. 30, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question may be asked:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">What
would <span style="">be the effect on the renewed
bargaining </span>agreement <span style="">if a union
other than </span>the <span style="">one </span>that
executed it should </span><span style="">be </span><span style="">certified?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">In </span></span><span style="">a <span style="">similar case </span></span><span style="">it has been </span><span style="">held that the <span style="">union thus certified would have to respect the contract, </span>but that
it may bargain with the management to shorten the life of the <span style="">contract if it </span></span><span style="">is </span><span style="">too long (General Maritime Stevedores Union of </span><span style="">the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">, et al., vs. South Sea Shipping Lines, et <span style="">al., 108 Phil. 1112).<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Section
4(a) of the Industrial Peace Act provides that it shall be unfair labor
practice for an employer:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to
discriminate in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition
</span>of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organ­ization:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, That nothing <span style="">in </span>this Act or in any other Act or
statute of the Republic of the Philippines shall preclude an employer from
making an agreement with a labor organization to require as a con­dition of
employment membership therein, if such labor organization is the repre­sentative
of the employees as provided in section twelve, but such agreement shall not
cover members of any religious sects which prohibit affiliation of their
members in any such labor organization." <span class="GramE">(As amended by
Republic Act 3350 which took effect <span style="">on
June </span>17, 1961).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The dismissal of
petitioners was in compliance with an existing collective bargaining agreement,
the validity of which is sanctioned by the provision just quoted, and therefore
does not constitute an unfair labor practice exclusively cognizable by the
Industrial Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Because of their
dismissal petitioners picketed the vessels of respondent company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This gave rise to the complaint in the Court
of First Instance (Civil Case No. R-7743) to enforce the contract with the
United Seamen's Union of the Philippines, to recover damages, and at the same
time to restrain petitioners from "molesting, </span><span style="">stopping, </span><span style="">obstructing, and interfering with the free move­ments of the employees
of plaintiff’s vessels and all its passengers, prospective and actual, as well
as shippers, prospective and actual, within the port of the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Actually, the intention of respondent company in filing the action was
to shift to the union the liabilities that arose </span>by virtue of petitioners<span style="">'</span> dismissal as provided in the renewed
collective bargaining contract, particularly the first paragraph of Article II,
which states:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>" <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>provided, however,
that <span style="">the </span><span style="">UNION </span>shall assume <span style="">all the </span>responsibilities and shall answer for
any and all liabilities that may arise by virtue of such dismissal."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As the issue involved in
the instant case, although arising from a labor dispute, does not refer to one
affect­ing an industry which is indispensable to the national </span>interest
and certified by the President to the Industrial Court, nor to minimum wage
under the Minimum Wage Law, or to hours of employment under the Eight-Hour
Labor Law, nor to an unfair labor practice, but seeks the enforcement <span style="">of </span><span style="">a </span>provision of the collective bargaining agreement, and to recover
damages occasioned by the alleged unlawful acts of petitioner, jurisdiction
pertains to the ordinary courts and not to the Industrial Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(PAFLU et al. vs. Tan &amp; REMA, Inc., 99
Phil. 854; Dee <span class="SpellE">Cho</span> Lumber Workers' Union vs. Dee <span class="SpellE">Cho</span> Lumber Co., 101 Phil. 417; <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>

Factory vs. Bautista, G. R. No. L-15994, <st1:date month="11" day="23" year="1960">Nov. 23, 1960</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The remaining question to
be resolved is whether or not the procedure followed by the lower court in is­suing
the injunction is correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In associated
Watch­men &amp; Security Union vs. Union States Lines, et </span><span style="">al., (101 </span><span style="">Phil. </span><span style="">896), </span><span style="">it was held that if a labor dispute exists
the provisions of the Magna Charta of Labor (R.A. 875) should be strictly
followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same ruling was laid down
in PAFLU vs. TAN, et al., </span><u><span style="">sup</span></u><u><span style="">ra</span></u><span style="">,</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">and in PAFLU vs. <span class="SpellE">Barot</span>, et </span><span style="">al. </span><span style="">(99
Phil. </span><span style="">1008).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">On
the other hand, if no labor dispute exists the court may issue an ordinary in­junction
in accordance with the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the trial court had jurisdiction to take cognizance of the case,
the injunction issued by it </span><span style="">was
</span><span style="">nevertheless void because the
procedure laid down by Section 9 (d) of R.A. 875 was not followed in its
issuance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law provides that the
testimony of witnesses </span><span style="">in</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">open court (with </span><span style="">opportunity for
cross-examination) in support </span><span style="">of
the allegations of the complaint made under oath, and the testimony in op­position
thereto, if offered, should be heard and that a finding of fact by the court
must be made, to the effect that unlawful acts have been threatened and will be
com­mitted unless restrained; that substantial and irreparable injury to
complainant's property will follow; that as to each item or relief granted
greater injury will be inflicted upon complainant by the denial of relief than
will be inflicted upon defendants by the granting of relief; that complainant
has no adequate remedy at </span><span style="">law; </span><span style="">and that public officers charged with the
duty to protect complainant's property are unable or unwilling to furnish
adequate pro</span><span style="">tection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The instant case being an outgrowth of a
labor dispute, the trial court cannot grant the injunction merely under Section
6, Rule 60 of the Rules of Court (now Section 6, Rule 58), but must follow what
is provided for in R.A. 875 (Allied Free Workers' Union, et al. vs. Hon. Judge
Segundo <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span>, et al., 102 Phil. 292).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">Wherefore</b><span style="">, the order of the lower court dated </span><st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="11"><span style="">November
 8, 1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> is set aside
