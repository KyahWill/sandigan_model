				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petition for a writ of <em>mandamus</em> to the Court of First
Instance of Rizal (Quezon City Branch) to approve and certify the
notice and record of appeal submitted by petitioners in Civil Case No.
6144 of said Court.
<p>We glean from the record that, on September 18, 1961, the
petitioners, spouses Iluminado Motus and Lourdes Laserna Motus, filed a
complaint in the respondent Court of First Instance of Rizal (Branch V,
Quezon City) against the other respondents, J. M. Tuason &amp; Co. and
G. Araneta, Inc., which was docketed as Civil Case No. 6144 of said
Court. The complaint averred that in 1949 plaintiffs had purchased a
lot in Tatalon, Quezon City, from Florencio Deudor for the sum of
P4,500.00; that plaintiffs took possession of the lot, upon making a
down payment of P850.00; that by a compromise agreement, in Civil Case
Q-135 of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, between Florencio Deudor
and J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc., the latter acquired all the rights of
Deudor to the Tatalon Estate, allegedly under obligation to recognize
the rights of certain listed purchasers of lots from Deudor, among
which was the plaintiff, Lourdes Motus; that plaintiffs, tendered
payment to Tuason &amp; Co., Inc., in compliance with the terms of
their contract with Deudor, but Tuason &amp; Co Inc., demanded a new
contract at a higher price. The action sought to compel said defendant
to accept the price tendered and convey to the plaintiffs the lot
occupied by them, and also to pay damages.</p>
<p>Defendants interposed a motion to dismiss, on the ground that the
complaint stated no cause of action, and the court upheld the motion
and dismissed the compliant, and subsequently denied plaintiffs' motion
to reconsider. Thereupon, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the
Court of Appeals, deposited the appeal bond in cash, and submitted a
record of appeal. Upon objection of defendants Tuason &amp; Araneta,
Inc., the lower court refused to allow the appeal on the ground that,
there being only a question of law, the case could not be appealed to
the Court of Appeals, which lacked jurisdiction to take cognizance of
plaintiffs' appeal.</p>
<p>The court having refused to heed the pleas of appellants Motus, the latter instituted <em>mandamus</em>
proceedings in the Court of Appeals (Case CA-GR No. 31549-R); but on
May 3, 1963, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition for <em>mandamus</em>,
for want of jurisdiction, because the proposed appeal involved a pure
question of law that lay within the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court. Review of this decision was denied in G. R. No. L-21611
(Motus <em>vs</em>. Court of Appeals, et al.).</p>
<p>On November 19, 1963, spouses Motus filed in the Supreme Court the present petition for <em>mandamus</em> to have their record certified to this Court.</p>
<p>Obviously, the petition for mandamus has to be dismissed. The
respondent Judge was never asked, and at no time refused, to certify
the plaintiffs' record of appeal to this Court; and there is no ground
now to compel him to do so. What he rejected was to certify the record
to the Court of Appeals (as plainly appears from his order of August 4,
1962), and his Honor's resolution has been upheld by the appellate
courts, and is now final. No writ of <em>mandamus</em> can lie where there was no refusal. That is beyond argument.</p>
<p>Nor can this Court now pass upon the merits of the dismissal of the
petitioners' complaint by the court below, since the matter has not
been brought to it properly, and no record of appeal has been duly
certified to it by the court below.</p>
<p>While the resolution of October 16, 1962, in G. R. L-21611,
dismissing the appeal against the decision of the appellate court that
denied <em>mandamus</em>, stated that the dismissal was "without prejudice to the filing of a petition for <em>mandamus</em>
in this Court", this reservation was on the assumption that the court
below would refuse to elevate the records to the Supreme Court, but
which it never did. The resolution, therefore, was no warrant for
appellants' dispensing with the requisite steps to perfect the appeal
to this Court. Petitioners should have first asked the trial court to
certify their record of appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Wherefore, the petition for a writ of <em>mandamus</em> is denied, with costs against petitioners Motus.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Zaldivar,</em> and <em>Sanchez, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
