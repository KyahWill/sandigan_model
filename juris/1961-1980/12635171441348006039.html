				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petition now before <span style="">us, </span>originally for mandamus filed by Jose C. <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>, Councilor of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, who received the highest number of votes in the last
general elections of 1967, to compel the Provincial Governor and/or the
Provincial Board of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> under Section 13 of the
Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act to sus­pend <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>
Mayor <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> and
others, soon branched out to include quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> to
have petitioner declared to be entitled to act as Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and, thereafter further expanded to add a
prayer for injunction against newly named party respondents, Judges <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> B. Flores and <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> C.
Mariano, both of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
and the Court of Appeals, because said judges and the Court of Appeals have
restrained or enjoined the sus­pension of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span>
and others.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be well to state right at the outset that the issues
herein may not perhaps be properly understood unless the necessary facts are
presented in their peculiar setting, thus:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the general elections
of November 14, 1967, the following were declared elected municipal officials
of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>:
Mayor <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span>;
Vice-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Teotimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gealogo</span>;
Councilors (1) Jose C. <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>, (2) <span class="SpellE">Justino</span> Ventura, (3) Johnny Wilson, (4) Pedro P. <span class="SpellE">Ison</span>, (5) Bernardo P. <span class="SpellE">Nonato</span>, (6)

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
January 18, 1969, First Assistant Provincial Fiscal B. Jose </span>Castillo
instituted Criminal Case 18821 in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> against <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> Mayor <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span>, Vice-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Teotimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gealogo</span>, Councilors <span class="SpellE">Justino</span> Ventura, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Ison</span>,
Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Babasa</span>, and Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Nonato</span>
(respondent elective municipal officials) and others, for violation of Sections
3-G and 4-B of Republic Act 3019, otherwise known <span style="">as </span>the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">The criminal information <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> substantially </span>charged that, on or about
July 26, 1967, Mayor <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> and his co-accused,
conspiring and confederating together, unlawfully entered into a contract with
JEF Enterprises for delivery and installation of 59 traffic deflectors valued
at P1,426.50 each, 34 units thereof having been delivered, installed and paid
for in the total amount of P48,841.00, less 10% which <span style="">was </span>retained, such contract being manifestly and grossly dis­advantageous
to the municipal government of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> and to the
latter's prejudice.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Because of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the foregoing case, the Provincial Governor
requested the Provincial Fiscal for legal advice </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">to whether Mayor <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> and other municipal officials charged were to be
suspended by him or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">Provincial </span>Fiscal, in turn, asked the
Secretary of Justice, Hon. <span style="">Juan Ponce <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>, </span>for guidance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1969" day="12" month="2"><span style="">February 12, 1969</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Secretary of Justice rendered the
opinion sought declaring that under Section 13 of Republic Act 3019, it was the
mandatory duty of the </span><span style="">Provincial </span><span style="">Governor </span><span style="">to suspend Mayor <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> and the other elective municipal officials who
were pro­secuted with the latter, pending final judgment in Criminal Case
18821.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Secretary's opinion was, on
February 26, forwarded by the Fiscal to the Governor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On that same day,
February 26, respondent elective municipal officials of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Makati</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> registered an injunction suit - Civil Case
11593 - </span>in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
against the Provincial Governor, to prevent the latter from suspending them.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Averment was there made, amongst others, that the suspension threatened by the
Governor before the final determination of the criminal case and/or
administrative charge against plaintiffs therein was <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of constitutional due process and that the power of pre­ventive suspension is
now vested exclusively in the Provincial Board pursuant to Section 5 of the
Decentralization Act of 1967 and in line with our decision in <span class="SpellE"><u>Sarcos</u></span> <u>vs.</u> <u>Castillo</u> (G.R. L-29755,
January 31, 1969) 26 SCRA 853.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 27, 1969, respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span>
B. Flores issued ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> in said Civil Case 11593 a
restraining order directing the Provincial Governor "to refrain or desist
from suspending" re­spondent municipal officials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, on April 26, 1969, Judge Flores
replaced the restraining order with another for the issuance of a writ of
preliminary injunction in favor of herein respondent municipal officials upon a
P5,000-bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meanwhile, on March 18, 1969, as stated at the start of
this opinion, petitioner, in his capacity as No. 1 Councilor of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> and as a private citizen residing in <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, commenced the present mandamus proceedings in this
Court; on March 25, 1969, the mandamus petition was amended to include quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> as another cause of action and to <span class="SpellE">implead</span> respondent local officials of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, on <st1:date year="1969" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1969</st1:date>,
Judge Andres Reyes rendered judgment in Criminal Case 18821 earlier adverted
to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Herein respondent municipal
officials, with others, were convicted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision
material to the present case reads:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Court finds the accused Mayor <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> and the Councilors
<span class="SpellE">Teotimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gealogo</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Justino</span> Ventura, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Ison</span>,
Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Babasa</span> and Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Nonato</span>,
the Municipal Treasurer Eduardo S. Francisco, the Provincial Auditor <span class="SpellE">Gualberto</span> San Pedro, the Chief of Police Jose San Mateo and
the Chief of the Traffic Control Bureau, <span class="SpellE">Lutgardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span>, all of the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>,
Province of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, guilty beyond reasonable doubt, of
violating Section 3, paragraph G of Republic Act 3019 otherwise known as
Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, as charged in the Information, and
sentences each of them to suffer imprisonment for a period of SIX (6)
YEARS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition to this, the same
accused are hereby per­petually disqualified to hold office.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sec. 13 of R.A. No. 3019 states that the accused shall be suspended
from office upon the filing of the Information.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The law is wise, for a public official who has violated his oath of
office by committing graft and corrupt practices should not stay in office even
for a single minute until he is cleared of those charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the accused should be suspended upon the
filing of the Information, there is more reason to remove them after a judgment
of conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, if eventually
they are exonerated, they are entitled to reinstatement and all the benefits
attached to their office during suspension.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In view thereof, the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
is hereby ordered to remove said accused, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teotimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gealogo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Justino</span> Ventura, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Ison</span>, Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Babasa</span>, Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Nonato</span>, Eduardo S. Francisco, <span class="SpellE">Gualberto</span>
San Pedro, Jose San Mateo and <span class="SpellE">Lutgardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span>, from office immediately and to furnish the Court
a return hereof within twenty-four (24) hours upon receipt of a copy of this
decision."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Per the Sheriff's return and supplemental return, he was unable
to implement the order of "removal" of the accused Mayor, Vice-Mayor
and Councilors within the 24-hour period as directed by the decision of Judge
Reyes because they could not be located and because he (the sheriff) was served
with a temporary restraining order ema­nating this time from respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> C. Mariano of the same Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The temporary restraining order last mentioned came about in this
manner:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On May 20, 1969, Mayor <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> and his Secretary, <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alano</span>, filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (Civil Case 11802, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span>, Petitioners, versus Jose <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>,
Respondent") what appears to be a case for injunction with prayer for
preliminary injunction against petitioner Jose C. <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>,
to stop the latter from assuming the post of Mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition averred <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> that although the decision of Judge Reyes
ordered the removal from office of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> and
his other co-accused within 24 hours after receipt of the decision, they appealed
to the Court of Appeals on the same day that the decision was promulgated; that
in view of the appeal, said decision had not become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and could not be executed in any way; that said
appeal notwithstanding, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> had publicly
announced that he would assume on that day, May 20, the post of Mayor in the
company of Philippine Constabulary soldiers, sheriffs, and other agents and men
with the threat of using force and violence; that such forcible assumption was
improper and contrary to law because there was no vacancy to be filled, and
even if there was, it was the Provincial Governor who could fill up the vacancy
by appointment; and that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> also
threatened to dis­miss therein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Alano</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the foregoing allegations, Judge <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span>
C. Mariano set the hearing for preliminary injunction for <st1:date year="1969" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1969</st1:date> and directed as follows -</p>

<blockquote>"In the meantime, and in order to maintain <span style="">the status quo, </span>respondent Jose <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> and <span style="">any </span>and all Philippine Constabulary officers
and soldiers, sheriffs, agents, and all persons acting for and in their behalf,
are hereby temporarily restrained from performing the acts sought to be
enjoined, to wit, from removing or attempting to remove, in any mode or manner,
the petitioners and defendants in <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No.
18821 from their respective offices, from molesting or impeding them in the
performance of their duties in any way, and from installing or placing
respondent <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> or any other persons in their
offices in any way, until further orders from this Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The May 27 hearing was held but Civil Case 11802 was ordered
dismissed by Judge Mariano upon joint petition of the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a separate development, on May 20, 1969 - the very same day
that respondent <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> and his secretary presented
in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Civil Case
11802 just mentioned - <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> and the other
respondent municipal officials of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> went to the
Court of Appeals, allegedly in aid of the latter's appellate jurisdiction in
Criminal Case 18821, on certiorari, prohibition and mandamus with prayer for
preliminary injunction against Judge Andres Reyes and Provincial Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> <span class="SpellE">Salaysay</span>, to stop the
latter two in their attempt to enforce the removal order contained in the
decision of Criminal Case 18821.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>It <span style="">was </span>there alleged, amongst others,
that, in view of therein petitioners' appeal, "said decision has not
become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and its execution or
enforcement has been and is stayed"; that therein respondent <span class="SpellE">Salaysay</span> had been directed by Judge Reyes to continue to
enforce and execute his decision of "removal"; and that respondent
Judge Reyes threatened to cancel the bail bonds of therein petitioners and
cause their arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1969</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order against therein
respondents, upon a P1<span style="">,</span>000-cash
bond, the pertinent part of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"NOW, THEREFORE, you are hereby ORDERED, jointly and
separately, to desist from executing or enforcing the Decision in <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No. 18821 of the Court of respondent judge, from
<span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> the bail bonds of the petitioners and
thereafter ordering their arrest, or if the bail bonds have already been
cancelled by respondent Judge, to re-instate the said bail bonds and desist
from arresting the petitioners or any of them, until further orders from this
Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On June 6, 1969, after hearing, the Court of Appeals superseded
the foregoing temporary restraining order with an order for the issuance of the
writ of preliminary injunction upon a P1,000-bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meantime, on May 21, 1969, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>
filed before this Court in the present case a motion for preliminary mandatory
injunc­tion to order the Provincial Governor and/or Provincial Board to
immediately suspend respondent elective municipal officials of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> and to either install petitioner or recognize his
right as Acting Mayor pending final determination of this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1969" day="22" month="5">May
 22, 1969</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> amended the motion to
include respondent Judges Flores and Mariano.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On May 27, <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>, as stated earlier, filed a
<span class="SpellE">reamended</span> petition with preliminary mandatory and
prohibitory injunction which also took in as respondents Judges Flores and
Mariano and the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1969</st1:date>,
respondent municipal officials of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>
moved to dismiss the present case on the ground that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> had "lost any and all personality, standing
and right to prosecute this case." Ground for this assertion is the fact
that on May 30, 1969, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Provincial Fiscal
Benjamin H. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, now Judge of First Instance,
filed with the <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> court a criminal informa­tion

violation of Section 3, paragraphs (a) and (e), Republic Act 3019.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

Provincial Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> be prohibited from filing </span>and
<span style="">causing to be docketed the May 29, 1969

said criminal information be declared invalid, null and void; and that therein

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On June 5, 1969, we
dismissed the foregoing petition "without prejudice to petitioner's filing
in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in Criminal
Case 19346 an appropriate motion praying:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) that a preliminary investigation of the said criminal case be

preliminary investigation."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The returns having been

<p class="BODY">1. The first problem we are to grapple with is the legal effect
of the reelection of respondent municipal officials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said respondents would want to impress upon
us the fact that in the last general elec­tions of <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1967</st1:date> the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city> electorate reelected all of
them, except that Vice-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Teotimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gealogo</span>, a councilor prior thereto, was elevated to
vice-mayor. These respondents contend that their reelection erected a bar to
their removal from office for misconduct committed prior to <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be recalled that the acts averred in
the criminal information in Criminal Case 18821 and for which they were
convicted allegedly occurred on or about <st1:date year="1967" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1967</st1:date>, or prior to the 1967 elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They ground their position on <span class="SpellE"><u>Pascual</u></span> <u>vs.</u> <u>Provincial</u> <u>Board</u> <u>of</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>Nueva</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Ecija</u></span>,
106 Phil. 466, and <span class="SpellE"><u>Lizares</u></span> <u><span style="">vs.</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Hechanova</u></span>, 17SCRA 58.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A circumspect view leaves
us unconvinced of the soundness of respondents' position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two cases relied upon have laid down the </span>precept
that a reelected public officer is no longer amenable to <u>administrative</u>
sanctions for acts committed during his former tenure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the present case rests on an entirely
different factual and legal setting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
are not here confronted with <u>administrative charges</u> to which the two
cited cases refer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here involved is a
criminal prosecution under a special statute, the Anti-Graft and Corrupt
Practices Act (Republic Act 3019).</p>

<p class="BODY">A cursory look at Republic Act 3019 leads one to conclude that it
makes no time distinctions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
heavy compulsion there is for us to say that the Act's statement of policy
clearly points the other way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 1
of said Act reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is the
policy of the Philippine Government, in line with the principle that a public
office is a public trust, to repress certain acts of public officers and
private persons alike which constitute graft or corrupt practices or which may
lead thereto." Implicit in the foregoing lines is congressional respect
for the sacredness of a public office which must be kept clear of grafting and
corrupting officials who, every­one knows, are the bane of public
administration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this context, it is
immaterial <u>when</u> a repressible act is committed by a public officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More specifically, <span style="">we </span>cannot draw a line between acts
done during a former term of office of a particular public officer and acts
done during a later term.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law does
not distinguish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is impermissible for
us to do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">And more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the
penalties that attach under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, it must
be noted, is “<u>perpetual disqualification</u> from public office."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The relevance here of this penalty is that it extends beyond a particular term
of office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, the disqualification is
perpetual.</p>

<p class="BODY">What should clinch the point is the realization that normally
crime is not to be condoned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Crimes
under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act only prescribe in ten (10)
years, by its Section 11.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The argument
that reelection condones previous criminal acts of an elective official
punishable under the anti-graft legislation makes no eminent sense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For if this were so, then, after the
reelection of an official, no crime committed by him prior thereto becomes
repressible even if the time marked by the statute of limitations has not <span style="">yet </span>run
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some such notion is patently
offensive to the objectives and the letter of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt
Practices Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stand the possibility
of being con­fronted with the stark reality that an official may amass wealth
thru graft and corrupt practices and thereafter use the same to purchase
reelection and thereby launder his evil acts.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We, accordingly, hold
that under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, reelection of a public
official does not bar prosecution for crimes committed prior thereto by said
official.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2. We next consider the question:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Is the suspension mentioned in Section 13 of Republic Act 3019
automatic?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A view suggested is that said
suspension <u>ipso</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>jure</u></span> results upon the
filing of the criminal information without the need of an act of suspension by
any superior au­thority. Said Section 13 provides:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Suspension</u>
<u>and</u> <u>loss</u> <u>of benefits</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- Any public officer against whom any criminal prosecution under a valid
information under this Act or under the provisions of the Revised Penal Code on
bribery is pending in court, shall be suspended from office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should he be convicted by final judgment, he
shall lose all retirement or gratuity benefits under any law, but if he is
acquitted, he shall be entitled to reinstatement and to the salaries and
benefits which he failed to receive during suspension, unless in the meantime
administrative proceedings have been filed against him."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The language of the law can be no clearer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It provides that any public officer charged
under a valid information "<u>shall</u> <u>be</u> sus­pended from
office".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not say "is
suspended" <span style="">or "is deemed </span>suspended".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It uses the word "shall".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We think it evident upon the terms of the
statute that there must be someone who shall exercise the act of suspension.</p>

<p class="BODY">Adding strength to this view is that in line with the statutory
text of Section 13, the suspension spoken of follows the <span class="SpellE"><u>pendency</u></span>
in court of a criminal prosecution under a "<u>valid</u>
information".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Adherence to this <span class="SpellE">rigoristic</span> requirement funnels us down to no other conclusion
than that there must, first of all, be a determination that the informa­tion
filed is <u>valid</u> before suspension can be effected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This circum­stance militates strongly against
the notion that suspension is auto­matic.</p>

<p class="BODY">Suspension is, however, mandatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The word "shall" used in Section 13
is an express index of this conclusion.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, hold that the suspension envisioned in Section 13
of Republic Act 3019 is mandatory but is not self-operative.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proceeding from our
holding that suspension is not auto­matic, who should exercise the mandatory
act of suspension under Section 13 of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act?</p>

<p class="BODY">Three theories have been advanced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One is that the power of suspension - where a
criminal case has already been filed in court - still is with the Provincial
Governor, relying on Section 2188 of the Revised Administrative Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another is that, follow­ing the ruling in <span class="SpellE"><u>Sarcos</u></span> <u>vs.</u> <u>Castillo</u> (1969), 26 SCRA
853, because the main respondents are elective municipal officials, that power <span style="">of suspension must be held to repose in the
Provincial Board, under Section 5 of the <span style="">Decentralization Act </span>of 1967 (Republic Act 5185).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third is that, by Section 13 of the
Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, solely the court in which the criminal case
has been filed shall wield the power of suspension.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We opt for the third.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Common sense and the scheme of the law so dictate.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true to say that nothing in Section 13 of the Anti-Graft
and Corrupt Practices Act grants with specificity upon the Court of First
Instance the power to suspend an official charged with a violation
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would seem to us though that
suspensions by virtue of criminal proceedings are separate and distinct from
sus­pensions in administrative cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An
accurate reading of Section 13 <span style="">yields
two methods of investigation, one separate from the other:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>one criminal before the courts of justice,
and the other administrative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
the plain import of the last sentence of Section 13, which </span><span style="">says </span><span style="">that if acquitted, defendant in an Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices
case "shall be entitled to reinstatement and to the salaries and benefits
which he <span style="">failed to receive during
suspension, <u>unless</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> </span></span><u><span style="">meantime</span></u><span style=""> <u>administrative</u> </span><u><span style="">proceedings</span></u><span style=""> <u>have</u> <u>been</u> <u>filed against</u>
</span><u><span style="">him</span></u><span style="">."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Our interpretation but preserves, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">it should, the substantial symmetry between the first part of Section
13 and the last part thereof just quoted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">And so, there is in this legal provision a recognition that once
a case is filed in court, all other acts connected with the discharge of court
functions - which here include suspension - should be left to the Court of
First Instance.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Not that this view finds

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Anti-Graft and

Officials" - upon which the <span class="SpellE"><u>Sarcos</u></span>
decision was anchored - provided in its first paragraph that [<span style="">a</span>]<span class="SpellE">ny</span>

</span>For, <span style="">said Section 5 solely
embraces administrative investigations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Proof that the anti-graft legislation is outside the ambit of Section 5
of the Decentralization Act is furnished by the second, third and penulti­mate
paragraphs of said section, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The last proviso of the
penultimate paragraph above-quoted sets the administrative case apart from the
criminal; and the limitations on the penalties of suspension and removal
above-quoted contradict the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act which punishes
the offender to, amongst others, "perpetual disqualification from </span><span style="">public </span><span style="">office."<span style=""> </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As for the Provincial
Governor, we find no cause or reason why we should break away from the view
espoused in <span class="SpellE"><u>Sarcos</u></span> that since the passage of
the Decentralization Act of 1967, his power of suspension has been abrogated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is reasonable
ground to believe that Congress did really apprehend danger should the power of
</span>suspension in con­sequence of a <span style="">criminal
case under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act be lodged in any authority
other than the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quite apart from
the fact that the court has a better grasp of the situation, there is one other
factor, and that is, the rights of the person accused. The court could very
well serve as a <span style="">lever to </span>balance
in one equation the public interests involved and the interests of the
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And then, there is the danger
that partisan politics may creep in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
hand of political oppression cannot just be ignored especially if the majority
members of the Provincial Board and the defendant public local elective officer
are on opposite sides of the political fence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Power may be abused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conversely,
if both are of the same political persuasion, the suspending authority will
display reluctance in exercising the power of suspension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus that the statute should catch up
with the realities of political life.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is indeed the <span style="">dispiriting
lesson that </span></span><span style="">in </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">clash between political considerations and
conscience it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">the latter that quite often gets dented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hard to pigeonhole </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">the timely observation made by Mr. Justice Fernando in <span class="SpellE"><u>Sarcos</u></span> <u>vs.</u> <u>Castillo</u>, <u>supra</u>,
thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Such a restraining influence is indeed needed for the
undeniable facts of the contem­porary political scene bear witness to efforts,
at times disguised, at other times quite blatant, on the part of local
officials to make use of their positions to gain partisan advantage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Harassment <span style="">of those belonging to opposing factions or groups is not unknown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, no stigma seems to attach to
what really amounts to a misuse of official power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The truism that a public office </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">a public trust, implicit in which is the recognition that public
advantage and not private benefit should be the test of one's conduct, seems to
have been ignored all too often.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The</u>

<p class="BODY">Therefore, since suspension is incident to removal and should
proceed from one who should logically do so, and considering that in the
operation of a given statute fairness must have been in the mind of the
legislators, we brush aside needless refinements, and rule that under Section
13 of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, once a valid information upon

by mandate of Section 13 of the law, said respondents "shall be entitled

<p class="BODY">The foregoing section in the Local Autonomy Act, we must say, is
meant to cover all cases of succession in elective positions <span style="">for mayors and vice-mayors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provisions have been made for permanent
vacancies and temporary incapacities, and even situations where mayors-elect
die before assumption of office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
cannot </span><span style="">assume that Congress
intended to leave gaps in legislation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That Section 21(a) of the
Revised Election Code</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">provides for the filling up of temporary vacancies of elective municipal
offices by appointment of the provincial governor with the consent of the
provincial board, should not stand in the way of said Section 7, Local Autonomy
Act, above-quoted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the extent that </span><span style="">said Section 21(a) conflicts with Section 7
of the Local Autonomy Act, a later legislation, the former should yield.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot escape the broad sweep of the term
"any </span><span style="">temporary
incapacity" </span><span style="">expressed in
the third paragraph of Section 7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
phrase catches within its reach the present situation before us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incapacity, a dictionary quote tells us, is
the "lack of physical or intellectual power or of natural or <u>legal</u> <u>qualification</u>."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Embraced in the foregoing is the legal
inability of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> and Vice-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Gealogo</span> to perform the functions of their respective
offices, by reason of their suspension by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Because of this, the
suggestion that the rule of <span class="SpellE"><u>ejusdem</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>generis</u></span> should limit the incapacity referred to <span class="SpellE">to</span> physical disability appears pointless; it siphons off
one significant import of the term - lack of legal qualification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the statutory set-up, and the meaning
we attribute to the phrase "temporary incapacity", that
interpretation </span><span style="">would
unreasonably constrict legislative intent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is thus our conclusion
that, because of the temporary incapa­city of the Mayor and Vice-Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, the Councilor who </span><span style="">obtained the largest number of votes among
the incumbent </span><span style="">Councilors in </span><span style="">the local election immediately preceding who,
in this </span><span style="">case, is petitioner Jose
C. <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>, should, by the law, ordinarily
"perform the duties and exercise the powers of the mayor" except </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">the statute so directs - the power to appoint, suspend or dis­miss </span><span style="">employees, </span><span style="">which after all is not inherent in one acting in a temporary capacity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Second</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
suspension of petitioner from office by the Provincial Governor is null and
void, the reason being that, <span style="">as </span>heretofore
stated, having been prosecuted under the provisions of <span style="">the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, the authority to suspend </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">not lodged with the
Provincial Governor but </span>with the Court of First Instance where he was charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents argue that
petitioner should have intervened <span style="">in </span>Civil
Case 11593 before Judge Flores.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to
be recalled that said case was a suit by respondent <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city> elective officials against
the Provincial Governor to restrain the latter from suspending them pending the
result of the criminal case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents' argument loses potency in the face of our ruling that the
power to suspend does not lie with the <span style="">Provincial
Governor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Referring now to </span>respondent
Judge Mariano, it is true that he has temporarily restrained enforcement of the
judgment of <span style="">Judge Reyes in Criminal
Case 18821.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case before Judge
Mariano, however, has since been dismissed on joint petition of the parties
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His restraining order has,
therefore, become <span class="SpellE"><u>functus</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, said restraining order is null
and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Long familiar </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">the rule that a judge of a branch of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">court may not inter­fere
with the proceedings before a judge of another branch of the same court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pointedly applicable </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">the statement of this Court found in <u>Lacuna</u> </span><u><span style="">vs.</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Ofilada</span></u></span><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"But the rule is infringed where the Judge of a branch of the court
issues a writ of prelim­inary injunction in a case to enjoin the sheriff from
carrying out an order of execution issued in another case by the Judge of
another </span><span style="">branch </span><span style="">of the same court."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The injunction issued by respondent Court of Appeals insofar <span style="">as </span>it operates to stop the suspension
of respondent municipal elective officials of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city> cannot be maintained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, for the reason that <span style="">as we </span>construe the provisions of
Section 13 of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, it was the mandatory
duty of the trial court to order their suspension.</p>

<p class="BODY">7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise to be resolved
in these proceedings is the claim petitioner Jose C. <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>
advances that he should now be allowed <span style="">to
sit as Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent elective municipal officials </span>oppose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These respondents' pose is that <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> - subsequent to <span style="">the filing of the present case before this Court - was charged with a
violation of the very same law for which they were indicted; that the
prosecution against petitioner </span><span style="">is
</span><span style="">pending before the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>; and that in fact he was
suspended by the Provincial Governor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But, that suspension by the Provincial Governor, we have here said, is
null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unless petitioner is
suspended by the Court of First Instance, no reason exists why he should not be
allowed to sit </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">Acting Mayor. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>His own qualifi­cations to fill the office
have not been disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We should
respect his right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
