<p class="BODY">This is not the first time that an incident in the
above-mentioned Case No. 1099-V of the CIR has reached this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>G.R. No. L-24864, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> etc.,
petitioner, vs. Court of Industrial Relations &amp; <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>
Bus Drivers &amp; Conductors Union (PTGWO), Respondents", was also an
appeal by certiorari from a 1955 resolution of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> in
the same case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the initial
background of the present petition constitutes also that of the previous
one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is set forth in the decision
which this Court rendered therein on <st1:date year="1968" day="26" month="2">February
 26, 1968</st1:date> (22 SCRA 785) as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On November 30, 1957, <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>, doing business under the name and style of '<span class="SpellE">Halili</span> Transit', and the <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>
Bus Drivers and Conductors Union (PTGWO) entered into a three-year Col­lective
Bargaining Agreement (Annex A to the petition for certiorari; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 30) by virtue of which the former recognized the
latter as exclusive bargaining agent of the drivers and con­ductors employed by
<span class="SpellE">Halili</span>, and accord­ing to which they both agreed to
abide by the schedule of the <u>hourly regular and overtime rates of drivers
and con­ductors</u> set forth in Annex 'B' of the Agreement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On August 20, 1958, the union filed with the Court of
Industrial Relations a petition docketed as Case No. 1099-V, which it
subsequently amended on December 9, 1958, charging viola­tion by <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> of Commonwealth Act No. 444 (the Eight-Hour Labor
Law) in that he deducted from, and did not include in, the hours of work of the
drivers and conductors the time consumed for filling gas or for taking the bus
from the '<span class="SpellE">carbarn</span>' and vice-versa, the time for trip
intervals when the bus is waiting for passengers, and the time consumed on
minor repairs of the en­gine and other parts of the bus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It therefore prayed the court to fix the
compensable hours of work of the dri­vers and conductors, members of said
union, according to the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 444, and to order <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> to pay the drivers and conduc­tors the compensable
hours of work-pre­viously rendered by them from October 1, 1956 up to the
filing of the petition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Halili</span> filed his amended answer on <st1:date year="1958" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1958</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After trial, the Court of Industrial Relations on <st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1961</st1:date> rendered a decision (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 51) finding <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>
guilty of having violated Commonwealth Act No. 444.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It thereupon required the Examining Division
of the Court of In­dustrial Relations to compute the compensable hours of work
rendered by the drivers and conductors who were members of the union, from
October 1, 1956 (This, instead of November 30, 1957 which was the date of the
Collective Bargaining Agreement, is the starting date of computation because in
his ans­wer to the complaint against him by the union before the Public Service
Commis­sion in Case No. 48603-C, <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> aver­red 'that
effective last Monday, Octo­ber 1, 1956, all drivers and conductors of the
respondent are on fixed salary basis, that is to say, conductors are paid at
the rate of P0.50 an hour and drivers are paid at the rate of P0.60 an hour,
thereby making their wages in <span class="SpellE">comformity</span> with the
order of this Ho­norable Commission and with Republic Act 602, known as the
Minimum Wage Law.' [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 53-54; italics
supplied] until the date of the decision, at the rate of P0.60 for drivers and
P0.50 for conductors per hour, and the man­agement of <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>
Transit to facilitate the examination by giving access to the Court examiner of
all trip reports, time records, time books, payrolls, vouchers, ledgers,
journals and all other pertinent records for the speedy computation of the
compensable hours of work.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On August 14, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> filed a
motion for clarification and for recep­tion of additional evidence, wherein he
questioned the decision for not defin­ing the compensable hours therein which
may be credited to the drivers and con­ductors, claiming that in said order the
court did not direct the Examining Division to determine the amount of
compensation actually received by the particular employees on any particular
day, and contending further that the decision was not a judgment, because it
did not determine any right or duty.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Court of Industrial Relations, on <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1961</st1:date>, issued an order wherein it
clarified compensable hours as referring to work rendered over eight hours and
the computation based on the trip report per hourly rate at P0.60 for drivers
and P0.50 for con­ductors from <st1:date year="1956" day="1" month="10">October
 1, 1956</st1:date> until the date of the order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It further stated that the complainants were
working more than eight hours since they start from 5:30 A.M. and stop at
night, and declared that the judgment as to the liability of <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> was categorically concluded in the decision but the
amount of said liability could not be determined until after the Court Examiner
renders his report.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Acting on <span class="SpellE">Halili's</span> motion for
reconsideration, the Court of Industrial Relations on April 6, 1962 entered a
resolution (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 58) <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
affirming the decision of August 7, 1961, but remanding the case to the Court
of Industrial Relations trial Judge for determination as to union membership of
the claimants referred to in the de­cision because:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'The determination of who are members of the
petitioner union, especially that the decision would cover a period, from
October 1, 1956, is a judicial determination which entails the use of
discretion and can not be left to the determina­tion by the Court Examiner,
upon the expediency of the examination of the books, records, payrolls, etc.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"No judicial determination of the membership of the union was
however made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> appeal from the decision nor from the <span class="SpellE">clarifica­tory</span> resolution of the same dated <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> on
motion for reconsideration dated <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="4">April
 6, 1962</st1:date> was not appealed by <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1965</st1:date>,
the Court of Industrial Relations issued an order (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 70.) directing the Court Examiner, assisted by a union representative, to
investigate and examine all trip reports, time records, time books, payrolls,
vouchers, ledgers, journals, and all other perti­nent records of <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> Transit, and compute the compensable hours of work
rendered by the drivers and con­ductors pursuant to the decision, dated August
7, 1961, for the period from January 1, 1961 up to the date of the order.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1965" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1965</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Halili</span> moved for a reconsideration of the
aforementioned order, and op <st1:date year="1965" day="24" month="4">April 24,
 1965</st1:date>, filed his memorandum in sup­port thereof - on the ground that
the same is contrary to law, the facts and evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was denied by the Court of
Industrial Relations in its resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 83.) dated <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1965</st1:date>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It was from said order of <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="4">April
 7, 1965</st1:date> and <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> resolution of <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1965</st1:date> that <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> brought the first appeal by certiorari in G. R. No.
L-24864, putting in is­sue:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) Whether
or not the trial court erred in holding him liable for the payment under
Commonwealth Act No. 444 of the compensable hours of work rendered by the
drivers and conductors who are members of respondent union; (2) Whether or not
the decision dated August 7, 1961 is in­complete and interlocutory and
therefore the respondent court erred in enforcing it by entering its order
dated April 7, 1965 and promulgating its resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> dated
July 12, 1965; and (3) Whether or not the respond­ent court erred in directing
its Examiner to examine and investigate the records of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> from January 1, 1961 up to the present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the facts set out above, this Court
rendered the following judgment:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the appealed order and resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
are hereby affirmed and the Court of Industrial Relations is hereby enjoined to
make a judicial determination of the union membership of the claimants, while
the Examining Division of said court shall proceed with its computation of the
compensable hours of work rendered by, and the corresponding compensation
payable to, the drivers and conductors admitted by both parties to be union
members since October 1, 1956 and those contended by the union to be
such-members but disputed by the employer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So ordered."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It appears that while this appeal in G.R. No. L-24864 was still
pending resolution in this Court, and while, on the other hand, proceedings
were being had in Case No. 1099-V before the Court of Industrial Relations for
the purpose of determining the membership of the herein respondent union as of
October 1, 1956 - pursuant to the order of the CIR dated January 3, 1966 -
because this Court had denied herein petitioner's prayer for the is­suance of a
restraining order, <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>
died on December 29, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
notice of such death was given to herein private respondents who, on January
13, 1967, filed a motion in the CIR praying that the legal representative of
the deceased <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>
be ordered to appear to be substituted for him, or the appointment of a legal
representative be procured should none appear, or, the heirs of the deceased be
substituted for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That motion was
opposed by herein petitioner who, thru counsel, alleged that after the death of
<span class="SpellE">Halili</span> a petition for letters of administration had
been filed before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ri­zal</span>
in its Spec. Proc. No. Q-10852; that herein petitioner was duly appointed as
special administration in said proceeding; and, that Case No. 1099-V of the
respondent CIR, being a money claim against the deceased <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
F. <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>, should be dismissed and thereafter
prosecuted in the manner especially provided in the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CIR resolved that incident on <st1:date year="1967" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1967</st1:date>, by ordering herein
petitioner to appear before it within 30 days from receipt of the corresponding
order and to be substituted for the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner herein did not comply with the said order; but counsel for
the decease <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>,
on <st1:date year="1967" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1967</st1:date>, filed a
manifestation informing the CIR that herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span>
de Vera <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> had
been appointed regular <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> of the
intestate estate of <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>
in Special Proceedings No. Q-10852 of the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
whereupon the CIR, taking such manifestation ad a substan­tial compliance with
its order of <st1:date year="1967" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1967</st1:date>,
entered an order dated <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1967</st1:date>,
appointing herein petition­er <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> as the legal representative of, and or­dering her
substituted for, the deceased <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same
order, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> directed a CIR commissioner to continue
the reception of the evidence of the parties on the question of the herein
respondent union's membership as of <st1:date year="1956" day="1" month="10">October
 1, 1956</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1967</st1:date>,
certain attorneys entered a special appearance for herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> de Vera <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>, in her capacity both as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
of the in­testate estate, and as heir, of <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
F. <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> "for the purpose only of the matter of
her being required to substitute for her deceased husband."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, she filed a motion seeking
reconsideration of the above-mentioned order of <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1967</st1:date>, which motion, however, was denied by the
CIR in its <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> resolution dated <st1:date year="1967" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the present petition for review on ap­peal by certiorari from the
last mentioned order and <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her brief, petitioner makes the following assign­ment of
errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"THAT RESPONDENT COURT ERRED AND COM­MITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF
DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF JURISDICTION (1) IN APPOINTING PETITIONER, IN
HER CAPACITY AS THE ADMINISTRATRIX OF THE IN TESTATE ESTATE OF DECEASED
FORTUNATO F. HALILI, THE LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE OF SAID DECEASED IN CASE NO.
1099-V; (2) IN ORDERING HER, IN THE SAME CAPACITY, SUBSTITUTED FOR THE SAME
DECEASED IN THE SAME CASE; AND (3) IN DIRECTING ITS HEARING EXAMINER TO
CONTINUE RE­CEIVING THE EVIDENCE OF THE PARTIES IN CASE NO. 1099-V AND TO
SUBMIT HIS RE­PORT IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER, INSTEAD OF HOLDING'THAT THE ACTION
OF RESPONDENT UNION AGAINST DECEASED FORTUNATO F. HALILI INVOLVES ONE 0THICH
DOES NOT SURVIVE AND THEREFORE OUGHT TO BE DISMIS­SED AND PROSECUTED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 21, RULE 3 IN RELATION TO RULES 86 OF THE REVISED RULES

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"II.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"THAT <st1:street><st1:address>RESPONDENT COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
ERRED IN ACTING FURTHER IN CASE NO. 1199-V FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION OVER THE
SUBJECT-MATTER OF THE-CASE AND THE NULLITY OF ALL PROCEEDINGS HAD IN THE
CASE."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious that it is the second assignment of error
concerning the jurisdiction of the respondent Court of Industrial Relations
that raises the more substantial issue, even if We find, as will be explained
later, that petitioner may not be very serious in raising the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner takes the position that cases
involving claims for overtime compensation should in all its aspects be within
the jurisdiction of regular courts, to the exclu­sion of the CIR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She contends that respondent CIR had no, as
it never could have acquired jurisdiction over the subject-matter of Case No.
1099-V; consequently, all the proceedings had in said case, including the
judgment, the order of April 27, 1967, and the <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> resolution
of May 25, 1967, are entire, nullities which cannot be the source of any right
or obligation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's position is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Casino <span class="SpellE">Es­pañol</span>
de Manila vs. CIR, G.R. No. L-18159, December 17, 1966, this Court already said
definitely), "it is already a settled matter which need not be further
discussed x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> that the
Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction, among others, over cases
involving hours of employment under the Eight-Hour Labor Law and claims arising
<span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> by an employee or an ex-employee seeking
reinstatement." We emphasized this again in <span class="SpellE">Rheem</span>
of the Phil., Inc., et al vs. <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>, et al., G.R.
No. L-22979, <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1967</st1:date>,
19 SCRA 130, 134 wherein We said, "[A]<span class="SpellE">fter</span> the
passage of Republic Act 875, this Court has (always) x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> upheld the industrial court's assumption of
jurisdiction over cases for salary differentials and overtime pay."</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no disagreement here that what the mem­bers of the
respondent union claim is the payment of over­time wages for work rendered by
them during the <u>hours</u> <u>de­ducted</u> by the predecessor of herein
petitioner from their daily compensable working time in the company's payrolls,
in violation of the Eight-Hour Labor Law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of fact, this Court stressed the nature of the basic issue
between the parties herein in that earlier case, G. R. No. L-24864, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The matter in issue in the main case below (Case No. 1099-V)
is whe­ther or not petitioner <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> is guilty of
violating the Eight-Hour Labor Law (C.A. No. 444) in that he deducted from the
working hours of the drivers and conductors, members of respondent union, the
time spent for taking the buses from the <span class="SpellE">carbarn</span> and
filling it with gas, oil or, water; the interval for waiting for passengers;
and the repair of the engine and other parts of the bus in case of
breakdown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court found him
guilty of the charge and held him <u>'liable</u> <u>categorically</u>' for the
compensable hours and overtime pay from October 1, 1956 up to the present at
the rate of P0.60 for dri­vers and P0.50 for conductors per hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This finding of the trial court in its
decision of August 7, 1961, as clarified in its order of August 17, 1961 and
affirmed in all respects - except the 'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> de­termination
as to the union member­ship of the claimants referred to in the decision x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x' - by the court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> in its resolution
of April 6, 1962, is a finding of fact which is final and conclusive and not
subject to review, no appeal having been in­terposed therein."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's reliance on Our decision in the earlier unreported
case of Mindanao Bus Employees Labor Union (PLUM) vs. The Mindanao Bus <st1:place>Co.</st1:place>
and the CIR,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
is unavail­ing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already pointed out
above, this Court has con­sistently held otherwise in all subsequent cases
involving the same issue, hence Mindanao Bus should be deemed to have been
abandoned even as early as in Red V Coconut Pro­ducts, Ltd. vs. CIR, et al., G.
R. No. L-21348 decided <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1966</st1:date>,
if not earlier, at least impliedly, in the cases decided previous thereto by
this Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Withal, why petitioner did not raise this issue in G. R. No. L-­24864 wherein
it was an appropriate one would seem incomprehensible, if there were
seriousness in bringing it up here now.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When We decided G. R. No. L-24864 in 1968 or even when it came up here
in 1965-1966, Mindanao Bus was no lon­ger the rule and it can be presumed
petitioner's counsel then was acquainted with such development in labor law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's first assignment of error, on the other hand,
revolves around the applicability or inapplicability to the situation here
presented of the following provi­sions of the Rules of Court:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 17 (Rule 3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Death</u>
<u>of</u> <u>party</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- After a party
dies and the claim is not thereby extinguished, the court shall order, upon
proper notice, the legal representative of the deceased to appear and to be
substituted for the deceased, within a period of thir­ty (30) days, or within
such time as may be granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
legal repre­sentative fails to appear within said time, the court may order the
oppos­ing party to procure the appointment of a legal representative of the de­ceased
within a time to be specified by the court, and the representative shall
immediately appear for and on behalf of the interest of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court charges involved in procur­ing such
appointment, if defrayed by the opposing party, may be recovered as costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The heirs of the deceased may be allowed to
be substituted for the deceased, without requiring the appointment of an
executor or adminis­trator and the court may appoint guard­ian <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>litem</u></span> for the minor heirs."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sec. 21 (Rule 3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Where</u>
<u>claim</u> <u>does</u> <u>not</u> <u>survive</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- When the action is for recovery of money,
debt or in­terest thereon, and the defendant dies before final judgment in the
Court of First Instance, it shall be dismissed to be prosecuted in the manner
espe­cially provided in these rules."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is her contention that Case No. 1099-V in the CIR is one for
the recovery of overtime compensation al­legedly due and owing to the members
of the respondent union for their services to the deceased <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
F. <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>; and since the same is <u>a money claim
which does not survive</u> within the contemplation of the above-quoted pro­visions
of Section 21 of Rule 3, by clear mandate of the same provisions, the said
action should be dismissed and thereafter prosecuted in the manner especially
provided in the Rules, <span class="SpellE">i</span>. e., the money claim
referred to must be dismissed in the CIR and then filed instead, if not yet
barred, in the intestate estate of the late <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
F. <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> in Special Proceedings No. Q-10852 of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in the manner
provided under Rule 86 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is therefore maintained by her that the procedure provided in Section
17 of Rule 3 requiring the substitution of a deceased party by his le­gal
representative - is not applicable to the present case, and, consequently, the
respondent CIR erred and committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack
of jurisdiction when, in its impugned order of April 27, 1967, it appointed
herein petitioner as legal representa­tive of, and substituted for, the
deceased <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>,
and directed the Hearing Examiner of said court to continue receiving the
evidence of the parties, instead of declaring that the action against said
deceased did not survive and should be dismissed and prosecuted in the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the sake of clarity, it must be stated that the basic theory
of petitioner's first assignment of error is that if the respondent or
defendant, who is a natural per­son, in a case before the CIR for payment of
overtime pay dies during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the same,
the CIR loses juris­diction to continue with the same and, instead, the corres­ponding
claim should be re-filed with the appropriate regu­lar court of first instance
having jurisdiction of the testate or intestate estate of the deceased
respondent or defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the point
is undoubtedly important, We do not deem it necessary to pace upon the same in
this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For even if the injunction in
Section 21, Rule 3, in relation to Rule 86 of the Rules of Court, were to be
followed in this case, the questioned orders of respondent CIR must stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
acted pre­cisely in accordance with the provisions invoked by peti­tioner when
it appointed her as legal representative of her deceased husband and
substituted her for him in the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 21 of Rule 3 provides very clearly that actions for recovery of
money, debt or interest thereon, as the one here involved, "shall be
dismissed to be pro­secuted in the manner especially provided in the(se)
rules" only <u>when</u> "the defendant dies before final judg­ment".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no gainsaying that such is not the
case of petitioner - where the decision in the court below has already long
ago, become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner should recall that in her deceased
husband's first appeal to this Court in G.R. No. L-24864, it was already argued
that the respondent CIR erred "in holding him liable for payment under
Commonwealth Act No. 444 of the compensable hours of work rendered by, the
drivers and conductors who are members of respondent union", and this
Court therein disposed of said-argument by declaring that the "issue is
not properly raised x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
because the decision of the Court of Industrial Relations dated August 7, 1961
and its <span class="SpellE">clarificatory</span> resolution of August 17, 1961
already became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, the petitioner
not having appealed <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the situation in this case, it is
obvious that it does not come within the pur­view of Section 21 of Rule 3
invoked by petitioner; and the lower court was right in appointing her as legal
representative of, and ordering her substituted for, the deceased <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>, in
accordance with the pro­cedure indicated in Section 17 of the same Rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, in that decision in G. R. No. L-24864, this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"The decision, therefore, is a final adjudication on the main
issue submitted to the court, and cannot be considered as interlocutory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main case is now at its execution stage
and what only remains to be threshed out is the precise compen­sable hours of
work rendered by, and the amount of compensation owing to, the drivers and
conductors who are members of the respondent union from <st1:date year="1956" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1956</st1:date> to date."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Under the circumstances, the respondent
CIR cannot be held to have abused-its discretion in directing the Hearing
Examiner of said court to proceed with the re­ception of the evidence of the
parties in this case after herein petitioner was appointed legal representa­tive
of, and was substituted for, her deceased husband.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well to emphasize, perhaps, that the rationale of the
procedure here involved is that after an action for money has been tried and
decided by a competent court, it would be a useless repetition of proceedings
to have it again tried and decided by a probate court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Enlightening on this point are the following
words in Testate Estate of Jose <span class="SpellE">Laserna</span> <span class="SpellE">Paro</span> y <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> [u]<span class="SpellE">pon</span> the facts and circumstances of the present case, the
claim of Jose <span class="SpellE">Altavas</span>, although it did not survive
the deceased, need not have to be presented before the committee on claims and
appraisal principally because that claim is al­ready an adjudicated claim by
final pronouncement by this Court in G. R. No. L-40038.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To countenance appel­lant's theory would be
to convert a claim duly passed upon and determined not only by the Court of
First Instance but by this Court into a contested claim, once again, in the
language of the trial court, 'giving the committee on claims more power than
the courts of justice' and 'obliging a creditor whose claim had already been
passed upon by the Court to submit himself to the committee on claims and to
pass over again through the endless process of presenting his evidence which he
had already done.' x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>
