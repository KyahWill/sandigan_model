failed </span>to confront the MPS with the <span style="">copies </span>of the discharge tally sheets furnished by the U.S. Lines.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rizal</span></span><span style=""> Surety's motion to </span><span style="">reconsider <span style="">was </span>denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">On </span>appeal to the Court of Appeals, the
<span style="">decision was </span>affirmed on two
grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the U.S. <span style="">Lines was </span></span><u><span style="">unnecessarily made </span>a party defendant</u>
<span style="">and (2) <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> </span><span style="">Surety's
claim against it was “clearly unfounded”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rizal</span></span><span style=""> </span>Surety <span style="">filed this petition </span>for review of the decision of the Court of
Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's first submission is that both courts erred in
holding that the U.S. Lines was <u>unnecessarily</u> made a party defendant
because of the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> omission in not confronting
MPS with the tally sheet copies, thus entitling the latter to attorney's fees
under par. 2 of Article 2208 of the <span style="">Civil
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This </span>provision authorizes
the award of attorney's fees when the defendant's act or o<span style="">mission </span>has caused plaintiff - the
U.S. Lines as counterclaimant - to unnecessarily incur <span style="">expenses </span>to protect its <span style="">interests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The submission is meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no </span>proof that had petitioner
confronted the MPS with the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">verifax</span></span><span style=""> copies </span>of
the good order tally sheets, the latter <span style="">would
have immediately </span>admitted its liability before the lapse of the <span style="">one </span>(1) <span style="">year prescriptive </span>period for filing the <span style="">action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span>the contrary,
there is evidence on record <span style="">that the
MPS could not have admitted its liability and </span>paid <span style="">petitioner's valid claim </span>before <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="5">May 15, 1962</st1:date>, <span style="">when payment was actually made, because its </span>records were not
immediately <span style="">available.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><i><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span><span class="SpellE">impleading</span> U.S. Lines as <span style="">alternative </span>defendant <span style="">in </span>the
lower court, petitioner acted <span style="">pursuant
to Section </span>13, <span style="">Rule 3 of the
Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to respondent's
claim, there is <u>uncertainty</u> </span>here, <u>as <span style="">far as petitioner </span></u><u><span style="">was
concerned</span></u><span style="">, because <span style="">prior to the </span></span><span style="">filing </span><span style="">of the <span style="">complaint </span></span>neither respondent U.S. Lines nor the MPS
admitted liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The </span>answers of both to the <span style="">complaint also </span>denied <span style="">liability for the loss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, the appellate court's </span>finding
of fact even stated that the <span style="">loss of </span>the
<span style="">shipment was "due to the
negligence of either or </span>both the [MPS]<span style=""> </span>and the <span style="">defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> [U.S. </span><span style="">Lines]".</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, par. 2 of
Article 2208 is not applicable </span>to the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court granted attorney's fees to
respondent U.S. Lines as litigation expenses unnecessarily incurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First of <span style="">all, the litigation expenses reco</span>verable therein are those
incurred <span style="">in suing </span>third persons,
upon the premise that such expenses were unnecessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">expenses
mentioned in </span>the second <span style="">situation
in </span>said par. 2 are therefore <span style="">non-litigation;
otherwise, </span>there would have been no justification for the
distinction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the article in
question starts out with the general rule:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"In the absence of stipulation, <u>attorney's fees and expenses of
litigation</u>, other than judicial costs, <u>cannot be recovered</u> <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.”<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Now a
party sued in court is compelled – under pain of default - to become a party
defendant either necessarily or unnecessarily.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If necessarily, he can not recover the attorney's fees and litigation
expenses incurred <u>even if he should win</u>, since <span style="">it is </span>not the fact of <span style="">winning
alone </span>that <span style="">entitles </span>recovery
of such items but rather the attendance <span style="">of </span>special circumstances - the enume­rated
exceptions in Article 2208 - <span style="">in </span>addition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, <span class="SpellE">everytime</span>
a defendant wins, automatically plaintiff must pay attorney's fees, thereby
putting a premium on the right to litigate, which should not be so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For those expenses <span style="">then, the law deems the </span>award of costs as sufficient
reimbursement.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
On the other hand, if a party is <u>unnecessarily</u> made a defendant <span style="">it will </span><u>not be</u> par. 2 of the
article <u>but</u> par. 4 of the article that <span style="">will </span>apply, because the term “unnecessarily" connotes the
idea that the cause of action against such party was <u>clearly unfounded</u>
in the first place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This brings <span class="GramE">Us</span> then to the second point raised.</p>

<p class="BODY">Following the very words of the law, in order that plaintiff -
here, respondent as, <span class="SpellE">caunterclaimant</span> - may be
entitled to its prayer, the suit must be "<u>clearly unfounded</u>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore necessary to examine the
facts which force petitioner - as the defendant in the counterclaim - to file
the complaint to protect its rights under the law and ask some pertinent
questions in connection therewith.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <span style="">first place it </span>is
not disputed that the goods were received by the consignee in bad order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For petitioner to recover, judicial action must
be commenced within a certain limited period of time granted to the consignee,
into whose shoes it stepped into, counted from the date of the delivery of the
goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Claim for the loss was timely
presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in answer to the
same, the MPS stated that the claim was "under careful
consideration".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Addressing itself
to the U.S. Lines, petitioner was shown and given the <span class="SpellE">verifax</span>
copies of the tally sheets purportedly signed by the <span style="">representatives </span>of the MPS and the U. S. Lines certifying that the
goods were discharged in good order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the Rules of Court <span style="">give the </span>petitioner the right to sue the U.S. Lines and the MPS in
the alternative, <span style="">as </span>it did, the following questions become pertinent:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was petitioner bound to accept immediately
the <span class="SpellE">verifax</span> copies of the tally sheets presented by
the U.S. Lines giving them full probative value?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being mere copies, they cannot be considered
the best evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Which of the two,
U.S. Lines or petitioner, is more interested to show that the U.S. Lines was
not responsible?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Definitely,
the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE">U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE"> Lines.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Surely, it was </span>incumbent upon U.S.
Lines to persuade and convince petitioner that it has no responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was petitioner under obligation to go to MPS
and <span style="">insist </span>that it was the only
one responsible because of the <span class="SpellE">verifax</span> copies of the
tally sheets, the authenticity, and genuineness of which the MPS could possibly
doubt?<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">We </span>believe not because for
petitioner, it is immaterial as to which of the two defendants paid the claim,
so long <span style="">as </span>it
is paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, why should petitioner take
the trouble of establishing or helping respondent U.S. Lines to establish the
latter's own defense to the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> prejudice?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We therefore believe that if there was the
duty to show non-liability, it was incumbent upon U.S. Lines not merely to show
to petitioner the <span class="SpellE">verifax</span> copies of the tally sheets,
which incidentally did not bind the consignee because only the U.S. Lines' and
the MPS' representatives signed them, but to convince codefendant MPS that it
is the only one responsible to pe­titioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was not done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>U.S. Lines
expected petitioner to accept blindly the copies of the tally sheets at their
face value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And because petitioner did
not, but instead tried to enforce its claim, availing itself of the right to sue
in the alternative, it is contended that pe­titioner is liable to pay
attorney's fees for filing a "clearly unfounded <span style="">civil </span>action".</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus pressed by the limited period within which to file a suit,
aggravated by the work of operating its own business, facing an uncertainty
under the MPS' statement that the claim <span style="">was
</span>"under careful consideration", notified by the U.S. Lines that
it has no responsibility based <span style="">on </span>mere
copies of the tally sheets and observing apathy <span style="">on </span>the part of both prospective defendants - who would be
favored by the lapse of the one year <span style="">period
</span>- in the settlement of what it honestly believed to be <span style="">a </span>legitimate
money <span style="">claim, it is </span>reasonable to
expect petitioner <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rizal</span></span><span style=""> </span>Surety to act the <span style="">way i</span>t did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The suit is, in <span class="GramE">Our</span>
view, not “clearly unfounded” as the Court of Ap­peals erroneously held.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, to be "clearly unfounded", the cause of
action must be<span style=""> <span class="GramE">so</span></span>
untenable as to amount to gross and evident bad faith.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
There might have been such bad faith on petitioner's part if it knew before
filing the complaint against U.S. Lines that MPS would admit liabi­lity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the facts on record negative this
hypothesis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">legal </span>counsel for MPS recommended settlement of peti<span style="">t</span>ioner's claim only after <span style="">the complaint </span>and its answer thereto
denying <span style="">responsibility </span>had been
filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the claim was paid even much
later - ten months from the filing of the complaint, to be specific.</p>

It is reasonable to assume that MPS would not have immediately changed the
tenor of its reply to petitioner even in the face of the <span class="SpellE">verifax</span>
copies of the tally sheets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The MPS
would still have to verify their authenticity against its own copies, which however
were not immediately available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
effect, such action on the part of MPS would have constituted a <span style="">denial - albeit provisionally - </span>of
