27824-R) for the reason that only questions of law are involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case was originally commenced by defendants-appellants in
the municipal court of Manila in Civil Case No. 43073, for <span class="SpellE">eject­ment</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having lost therein, defendants-appellants
appealed to the court <u>a quo</u> (Civil Case No. 30993) which also rendered a
decision against them, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
which follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the court hereby renders judgment in favor of the
plaintiffs and against the defendants, ordering the latter to pay jointly and
severally the former a monthly rent of P200.00 on the house, subject-matter of
this action, from March 27, 1956, to January 14, 1957, with in­terest at the
legal rate from April 18, 1956, the filing of the complaint, until fully paid,
plus attorney's fees in the sum of P300.00 and to pay the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It appears on the records that on 1 September 1955 de­fendants-appellants
executed a chattel mortgage<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>

strong materials located at No. 550 Int. 3, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
Boulevard, <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span>, Manila, over Lot Nos. 6-B and 7-B,
Block No. 2554, which were being rented from Madrigal &amp; Company, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mortgage was registered in the Registry
of Deeds of Manila on <st1:date year="1955" day="2" month="9">2 September 1955</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The herein mortgage was executed to guarantee
a loan of P4,800.00 received from plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>,
payable within one year at 12% per annum.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The mode of payment was P150.00 monthly, starting September, 1955, up to
July 1956, and the lump sum of P3,150 was payable on or before August,
1956.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was also agreed that default in
the payment of any of the amortizations would cause the remaining unpaid
balance to become immediately due and payable, and -</p>

<blockquote>"the Chattel Mortgage will be enforceable in accordance with
the provisions of Special Act No. 3135, and for this purpose, the Sheriff of
the City of Manila or any of his deputies is hereby empowered and authorized to

settle the financial debts of P4, 800.00, plus 12% yearly interest, and

<p class="BODY">When defendants-appellants defaulted in paying, the mortgage was <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span> foreclosed, and on <st1:date year="1956" day="27" month="3">27 March 1956</st1:date>, the house was sold at public
auction pursuant to the said contract.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As highest bidder, plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> were

Thereafter, on <st1:date year="1956" day="18" month="4">18 April 1956</st1:date>,
plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> commenced Civil Case No. 43073
in the municipal court of Manila, praying, among other things, that the house
be vacated and its possession surrendered to them, and for
defendants-appellants to pay rent of P200.00 monthly from <st1:date year="1956" day="27" month="3">27 March 1956</st1:date> up to the time the possession is

On <st1:date year="1956" day="21" month="9">21 September 1956</st1:date>, the
municipal court rendered its decision -</p>

<p class="BODY">“. . . . . . . ordering the defendants to vacate the premises
described in the complaint; ordering further to pay monthly the amount of
P200.00 from March 27, 1956, until such (time that) the premises is (sic)

<p class="BODY">Defendants-appellants, in their answers in both the munici­pal
court and court <u>a quo</u> impugned the legality of the chattel mortgage,
claiming that they are still the owners of the house; but they waived the right
to introduce evidence, oral or documentary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead, they relied on their memoranda in support of their motion to
dismiss, predicated mainly on the grounds that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(a) the municipal court did not have jurisdiction to try and decide the
case because (1) the issue involved is ownership, and (2) there was no
allegation of prior possession; and (b) failure to prove prior demand pursuant
to Section 2, Rule 72, of the Rules of Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the appeal to
the Court of First Instance, defendants-appellants failed to deposit the rent
for November, 1956 within the first 10 days of December, 1956 as ordered in the
decision of the municipal court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
result, the court granted plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>'
motion for execution, and it was actually issued on <st1:date year="1957" day="24" month="1">24 Jan­uary 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the judgment regarding the surrender of possession to
plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> could not be executed because
the subject house had been already demolished on <st1:date year="1957" day="14" month="1">14 January 1957</st1:date> pursuant to the order of the court in a
separate civil case (No. 25816) for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> against
the present defendants for non-payment of rentals on the land on which the
house was constructed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The motion of plaintiffs for dismissal of the appeal, execution
of the <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond and withdrawal of deposited
rentals was denied for the reason that the liability <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
was disclaimed and was still being litigated, and under Section 8, Rule 72,
rentals deposited had to be held until final disposition of the appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1957" day="7" month="10">7 October 1957</st1:date>,
the appellate court of First Instance rendered its decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which is quoted earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said decision was appealed by defendants
to the Court of Appeals which, in turn, certified the appeal to this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
failed to file a brief and this appeal was submitted for decision without it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants-appellants submitted numerous assignments of error
which can be condensed into two questions, namely;</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(a)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Whether the municipal court from which the case

legally bound to pay rentals to the plaintiffs during the period of one (1)
year provided by law for the redemption of the <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span>
foreclosed house.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We will consider these questions <u>seriatim</u>.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants-appellants mortgagors question the
jurisdiction of the municipal court from which the case originated, and
consequently, the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance <u>a
quo</u>, on the theory that the chattel mortgage is void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">initio</span></u> whence would follow that the extrajudicial
foreclosure, and necessarily conse­quent auction sale, are also void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the ownership of the house still
remained with defendants-appellants who are entitled to possession and not
plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, it is argued by defendants -appellants, the issue of
ownership will have to be adjudicated first in order to determine
possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is contended further that
ownership being in issue, it is the Court of First Instance which has
jurisdiction and not the municipal court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants-appellants predicate their theory of nullity of the
chattel mortgage on two grounds, which are:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(a) that their signatures on the chattel mortgage were obtained through
fraud, deceit, or trickery and (b) that the subject matter of the mortgage is a
house of strong ma­terials, and, being an immovable, it can only be the subject
of a real estate mortgage and not a chattel mortgage.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the charge of fraud, deceit or trickery, the Court of First Instance
found defendants-appellants' contentions as not supported by evidence and
accordingly dismissed the charge,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
confirming the earlier finding of the municipal court that "the defense of
ownership as well as the allegations of fraud and deceit . . . . . . are mere
allegations ".<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It has been held in <span class="SpellE">Supia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Batiaco</span> vs. Quintero and Ayala<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
that "the answer is a mere statement of the facts which the party filing
it expects to prove, <u>but it is not evidence</u>";<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
and further, that when the question to be determined is one of title, the Court
is given the authority to proceed with the hearing of the cause until this fact
is clearly established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Dalman</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein the defendant was also a successful bidder in an auction sale, it was
likewise held by this Court that in <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> cases
the claim of ownership "is a matter of defense and raises an issue of fact
which should be determined from the evidence at the trial that determines
jurisdiction are the allegations or averments in the complaint and the relief
asked for.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, even granting that the charge is true, fraud or deceit
does not render a contract void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">initio</span></u>, and can only be a ground for rendering the
contract <span class="SpellE">voidable</span> or annullable pursuant to Article
1390 of the New Civil Code, by a proper action in court.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
There is nothing on record to show that the mortgage has been annulled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is it disclosed that steps were taken
to nullify the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
defendants-appellants' claim of ownership on the oasis of a <span class="SpellE">voidable</span>
contract which has not been voided fails.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is claimed in the alternative by defendants-appellants that
even if there was no fraud, deceit or trickery, the chattel mortgage was still
null and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">initio</span></u>
because only personal properties can be subject of a chattel mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule about the status of buildings as
immovable property is stated in Lopez vs. <span class="SpellE">Orosa</span>, Jr.
and Plaza Theatre, Inc.,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
cited in Associated Insurance Surety Co., Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Iya</span>,
et al.,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
to the effect that -</p>

<blockquote>“ . . . . . . . . it is obvious that the inclusion of the building,
separate and distinct from the land, in the enumeration of what may constitute
real pro­perties (art. 415, New Civil Code) could only mean one thing - that <u>a
building is by itself an immovable property</u> irrespective of whether or not
said structure and the land on which it is adhered to belong to the same
owner."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Certain deviations, however, have been allowed for various
reasons, In the case of <span class="SpellE">Manarang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Manarang</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Ofilada</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court stated that " it is undeniable that the parties to a contract
may by agree­ment treat as personal property that which by nature would be real
pro­perty", citing Standard Oil Company of New York vs. Jaramillo.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
In the latter case, the mortgagor conveyed and transferred to the mortgagee by
way of mortgage "the following described <u>personal property</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
The "personal property" consisted of leasehold rights and a
building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, in the case of Luna vs.
<span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
the subject of the contract designated as Chattel Mortgage was a house of mixed
materials, and this Court held therein that it was a valid Chattel mortgage
because it was so <u>expressly designated</u> and specifically that the
property given as security "is a house of mixed materials, which by its
very nature is considered personal property".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the later case of Navarro vs. Pineda,<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court stated that –</p>

<blockquote>"The view that
parties to a deed of chattel mortgage may agree to consider a house as per­sonal
property for the purposes of said contract, 'is good only insofar as the
contracting parties are concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
based, partly, upon the prin­ciple of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>'
(Evangelista vs. Alto Surety, No. L-11139, <st1:date year="1958" day="23" month="4">23 April 1958</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
a case, a mortgaged house built on a <u>rented land</u> was held to be a
personal property, not only because the deed of mortgage considered it as such,
but also because it did not form part of the land (Evangelis­ta vs. <span class="SpellE">Abad</span>, (CA); 36 O. G. 2913), for it is now settled that an
object placed on land by one who had only a temporary right to the same, such
as the lessee or <span class="SpellE">usufructuary</span>, does not become im­mobilized
by attachment (Valdez vs. Central <span class="SpellE">Al­tagracia</span>, 222 U.
S. 58, cited in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Sawmill Co., Inc. vs. Castillo,
et al., 61 Phil. 709).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, if a house
belonging to a person stands on a rented land belonging to another person, it
may be mortgaged as a personal property as so stipu­lated in the document of
mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Evangelista vs. <span class="SpellE">Abad</span>, <u>supra</u>.) <u>It should be noted, however, that
the principle is predicated on statements by the owner declaring, his house to
be a chattel, a conduct that may conceivably <span class="SpellE">estop</span>
him from subsequently claiming otherwise</u>." (<span class="SpellE">Ladera</span>
vs. C. N. Hodges, (CA) 48 O. G. 5374).<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the contract now before Us, the house on rented land is not
only expressly designated as Chattel Mortgage; it specifically provides that
"the mortgagor . . . . . . . . voluntarily CEDES, SELLS and TRANSFERS <u>by
way of Chattel Mortgage</u><a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
the property together with its leasehold rights over the lot on which it is
constructed and participation. . . . . . "<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Although there is no specific statement referring to the subject house as
personal property, yet by ceding, selling or transferring a property <u>by way
of chattel mortgage</u> defendants-appellants could only have meant to convey
the house as chattel, or at least, intended to treat the same as such, so that
they should not now be allowed to make an inconsistent stand by claiming
otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the subject house
stood on a rented lot to which defendants-appellants merely had a tem­porary
right as lessee, and although this can not in itself alone deter­mine the
status of the property, it does so when combined with other factors to sustain
the interpretation that the parties, particularly the mortgagors, intended to
treat the house as <span class="SpellE">personalty</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, unlike in the <span class="SpellE">Iya</span>
cases, Lopez vs. <span class="SpellE">Orosa</span>, Jr. and Plaza Theatre, Inc.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
and Leung Yee vs. F. L. Strong Machinery and Williamson,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein <u>third persons</u> assailed the validity of the chattel mortgage,<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a> it
is the defendants -appellants themselves, as debtors - mortgagors who are
attacking the validity of the chattel mortgage in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
therefore applies to the herein defendants-appellants, having treated the
subject house as <span class="SpellE">personalty</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Turning now to the question of possession and
rentals of the premises in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court of First Instance noted in its decision that nearly a year after the
foreclosure sale the mortgaged house had been demolished on 14 and 15 January
1957 by virtue of a decision obtained by the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
of the land on which the house stood.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For this reason, the said court limited itself to sentencing the
erstwhile mortgagors to pay plaintiffs a monthly rent of P200.00 from 27 March
1956 (when the chattel mortgage was foreclosed and the house sold) until 14
January 1957 (when it was torn down by the Sheriff), plus P300.00 attorneys'
fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants mortgagors question this award, claiming that they
were entitled to remain in possession without any obligation to pay rent during
the one year redemption period after the foreclosure sale, i.e., until 27 March
1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this issue, We must rule for
the appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">Chattel mortgages are covered and regulated by the Chattel
Mortgage Law, Act No. 1508.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
Section 14 of this Act allows the mortgagee to have the property mortgaged sold
at public auction through a public officer in almost the same manner as that
allowed by Act No. 3135, as amended by Act No. 4118, provided that the
requirements of the law relative to notice and registration are complied with.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

property sold at the extra judicial foreclosure sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 7 of the same Act<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
allows the purchaser of the property to obtain from the court the possession
during the period of redemption:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but the
same provision expressly requires the filing of a petition with the proper
Court of First Instance and the furnishing of a bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only upon filing of the proper motion
and the approval of the corresponding bond that the order for a writ of
possession issues as a matter of course.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No discretion is left to the court.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
In the absence of such a compliance, as in the instant case, the purchaser can
not claim pos­session during the period of redemption as a matter of
right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a case, the governing
provision is Section 34, Rule 39, of the Revised Rules of Court<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a> <u>which
also applies to properties purchased in extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
Construing the said section, this Court stated in the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
case of Reyes vs. Hamada,</p>

<blockquote>"In other words, before the expiration of the 1-year period
within which the judgment-debtor or mortgagor may redeem the property, the
purchaser thereof is not entitled, as a matter of right, to pos­session of the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, while it is true that the
Rules of Court allow the purchaser to receive the rentals if the purchased
property is occupied by tenants, he is, nevertheless, accountable to the judgment-debtor
or <u>mortgagor as the case may be</u>, for the amount so received and the same
will be duly credited against the redemption price when the said debtor or
mortgagor effects the redemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Differently
stated, the rentals receivable from tenants, although they may be collected by
the purchaser during the redemption period, do not belong to the latter but
still pertain to the debtor or mortgagor</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rationale for the Rule, it seems, is to secure for the benefit of
the debtor or mortgagor, the payment of the redemption amount and the conse­quent
return to him of his properties sold at public auction." (Emphasis
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Hamada case reiterates the previous ruling in Chan vs. <span class="SpellE">Espe</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Since the defendants-appellants were occupying the house at the
time of the auction sale, they are entitled to remain in possession during the
period of redemption or within one year from and after <st1:date year="1956" day="27" month="3">27 March 1956</st1:date>, the date of the auction sale, and
to collect the rents or profits during the said period.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be noted further that in the case at bar the period of
redemption had not yet expired when action was instituted in the court of
origin, and that plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> did not choose
to take possession under Section 7, Act No. 3135, as amended, which is the law
selected by the parties to govern the extrajudicial fore­closure of the chattel
mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither was there an
allegation to that effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' right to possess was not yet
born at the filing of the complaint, there could be no violation or breach
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wherefore, the original
complaint stated no cause of action and was prematurely filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, the same should be ordered
dismissed, even if there was no assignment of error to that effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court is clothed with ample
authority to review palpable errors not assigned as such if it finds that their
considera­tion is necessary in arriving at a just decision of the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It follows that the court below erred in requiring the mortgagors
to pay rents for the year following the foreclosure sale, as well as attorney's
fees.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>FOR THE FOREGOING</b> <b>REASONS</b>, the decision appealed
from is reversed and another one entered, dismissing the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With costs against plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</p>
