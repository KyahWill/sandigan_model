				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On June 21, 1968, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Wenceslao</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Zubiri</span> <span style="">filed a </span>verified
complaint with this Court against respondent <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> <span class="SpellE">Jumapao</span>, praying, on the basis of the facts alleged
therein, that said respondent be disbarred.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 10 of the same year, respondent <span style="">filed </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">verified </span>answer <span class="SpellE">controverting</span> the
charges made against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 15 of the same year, we referred the case for
investigation to <span style="">the </span>Office of
the Solicitor <span style="">General
who, upon motion of the complainant to have the hearings of </span><span style="">the </span>case held in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
City for the convenience of the parties concerned and their witnesses, referred
the case to the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> for
investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 11, 1970,
said Provincial <span style="">Fiscal submitted his
report and recommendation, the pertinent <span style="">portions </span>of which are quoted </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"With due notice to both parties concerned, the investigation
was set for April <span style="">8, </span>1969 in the
Office of the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, Provincial
Capitol, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Parties not being ready to present evidence on said date, the
investigation was reset for May 10 of the same year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On May 10, 1969 both parties, represented by
their lawyers, jointly moved for postponement of the investigation to June 10,
11 and 12, 1969, on the ground that they needed more time to prepare evidence
to be <span style="">presented
in connection with the complaint and the </span><span style="">answer </span><span style="">thereto, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On June </span>10, 1969, after a brief
discussion on the procedure to be taken in the fact-finding investigation and
the necessity of issuing notices and/or subpoena <span class="SpellE">duces</span>
<span class="SpellE">tecum</span> to witnesses of the complainant, the hearing of
the administrative case was again reset for July 24 and 25, 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On July 24, 1969 the investigation of the
case had to be postponed once more to August <span style="">8, </span>1969, in view of the fact that Atty. Napoleon <span class="SpellE">Dejoras</span>, one of the lawyers for the <span style="">complainant, had left for Manila for an important matter and could not
be present to represent the complainant.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>On August <span style="">8, </span>1969,
the complainant, instead of presenting evidence to sustain the charges embodied
in the complaint filed with the Supreme Court, submitted a motion entitled motion
to drop complaint, a copy of which is attached hereto <span style="">as </span>Annex X and made an integral part
of this report, stating in substance that (a) said complainant is 'no longer
interested in prosecuting the case,' (b) his witnesses 'are no longer
available,' and (c) there is no evidence at hand 'to warrant finding of
probable cause.' (What complainant probably meant is that he could not present
substantial evidence to prove the main recitals of the complaint).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant <span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span>
(Ben) <span class="SpellE">Zubiri</span> moved for the 'dropping or dis­missal'
of the administrative case against Atty. <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> N. <span class="SpellE">Jumapao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attached to
the said motion <span style="">is </span>an affidavit - subscribed and sworn to before the Clerk of
Court of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> -
executed by the same complainant stating that one of his witnesses, a certain
Dr. Pedro <span class="SpellE">Alda</span>, is 'no longer in a position to
testify in view of the fact that he is leaving for the United States for
medical treatment, 'and that his other witnesses from <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span>
City have failed to come to <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City to testify in
spite of repeated issuance of notices and subpoena <span class="SpellE">duces</span>
<span class="SpellE">tecum</span> which were served upon them.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>In spite of the motion to dismiss filed by the complainant, the
latter was directed to furnish or submit to this investigator a list of other
available witnesses who may have knowledge of the facts constitutive of the
charges embodied in the <span style="">complaint, so </span>that
a fact-finding investigation may proceed even in the absence of the said
complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incidentally, the
complainant died on November 9, 1969 in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> <span style="">City of 'acute coronary insufficiency'
without </span>having submitted a list of witnesses who may be able to testify
against the respondent.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">For failure of the </span>complainant
to prosecute the <span style="">case </span>and substantially prove the charges embodied in the complaint,
the undersigned investigator hereby respect­fully recommends that the said
complaint be dismissed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of the facts contained in the report quoted above, we
have no alternative but to approve the recommendation therein made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the present case is dismissed.</p>
