forgery of petitioner's signature on the bail bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By virtue of that order the Clerk of Court forthwith
sent by registered mail to herein petitioner Juan <span class="SpellE">Apurillo</span>,
to municipal judge Antonio <span class="SpellE">Brillo</span> before whom the
bail bond appears to have been subscribed and sworn to by the petitioner, and
to <span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span> Yu, Martin <span class="SpellE">Narido</span>

office on July 29, 1964 at 8:00 a.m., attaching to the notice the said order of
the court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Of those notified, only the petitioner and Judge <span class="SpellE">Brillo</span> appeared for the investigation.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Both gave their respective testimonies, which were reduced to writing in
question-and-answer form and sworn to by them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the investigation, respondent Clerk of Court submitted to the
court a report of his findings, attaching thereto the sworn statements of Judge
<span class="SpellE">Brillo</span> and of the petitioner<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting upon the report of the Clerk of Court,
and on his "findings that the signature of the bondsman Juan <span class="SpellE">Apurillo</span> is genuine as a result of his in­vestigation of
the matter," respondent Judge, in an order dated <st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1964</st1:date>, denied petitioner's motion to be
excluded as bondsman.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Without asking for the reconsideration of that order of August
13, 1964, petitioner filed with this Court the present action, alleging that in
denying his motion to be excluded as bondsman respondent Judge acted with grave
abuse of discretion for not affording him due process, and that he is left
without any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his prayer, petitioner asks this Court to
issue a writ of prohibition ordering the respondents to desist from further
proceeding with the confiscation of petitioner's property offered as bond; to
require the respondents to grant the petitioner a fair hearing to determine the
question of whether his signature <span style="">was </span>forged or not; and for such other relief
<span style="">as </span>may
be just and equitable in the premises.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petition was given due course by this Court and ordered the issuance
of a writ of injunction, prayed for, upon petitioner's posting of a bond in the
sum of one <span style="">thousand pesos </span>(P1,000.00).<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Among the respondents,
only the Clerk of Court filed an answer to the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, however, the Solicitor General,
acting as counsel for all the respondents and for the Republic of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">, filed a memorandum to amplify and further
clarify res</span>pondents' position in addition to what have already been
stated in the answer <span style="">of </span><span style="">the </span>Clerk of Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
In said memorandum, the Solicitor General submits that the petitioner was not
denied due process or law and that petitioner's signature on the bail bond is
not a forgery.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is well settled that a
writ or prohibition will </span>not issue, unless it appears that the party
against whom it is sought has acted without or in excess <span style="">of </span>jurisdiction or with grave abuse of
discretion, and that there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy and adequate
remedy in the ordinary course of law<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the primary question to
be resolved is whether the respondent Judge had acted with grave abuse or discretion,
as claimed by petitioner, allegedly for not affording him due process of law in
denying his motion to be excluded as bondsman.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The order of denial, according to petitioner, was based on the report of
the Clerk of Court who, aside from making an arbitrary finding without giving
him an opportunity for a fair hear­ing, is not competent to make a
determination of the genuineness or the signature in question because he is not
a handwriting expert.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find that petitioner's
claim that he was not afforded due process is belied by the record, which shows
the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the court, with power
to hear and determine the motion of the petitioner to be excluded </span>as
bondsman, heard said motion on July 18, 1964; (2) without abdicating its
judicial power, the court, per order dated July 18, 1964, referred to the Clerk
of Court, as Commissioner, for investigation the matter regarding the alleged
forgery or petitioner's signature on the bail bond; (3) petitioner was notified
of the investigation conducted by the Clerk of Court, first, by virtue of the
said order of the court, presumably during the hearing of the motion, and
second, by the notification sent by the Clerk of Court through registered mail,
to which notification the order of the court was attached; (4) petitioner
appeared before the Clerk of Court on July 29, 1964, the date set for the
investigation, and presented his side, testifying under oath and his statements
were reduced to writing; (5) during the investigation, petitioner had the
opportunity to confront the sole adverse witness, Judge <span class="SpellE">Brillo</span>,
who testified that the bail bond was subscribed and sworn to before him by the
petitioner; (6)after the investigation, the Clerk of Court submitted to the
court his findings, supported by the sworn declarations of the petitioner and
of Judge <span class="SpellE">Brillo</span>; (7) the respondent Judge, in
resolving petitioner's motion, took into consideration the findings or the
Clerk of Court and, presumably, was guided by the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">expediente</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>or Criminal Case No. 1030, more
particularly, the documents mentioned in the report as containing the
signatures of the petitioner (pp. 9-11, 77, 88 and 340).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, with all these circumstances
disclosed by the record, it cannot be said that the petitioner was not given
"an opportunity for a <span style="">fair hearing."
We hold that he was fully accorded due process of law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Due process is satisfied if the following conditions are
present:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) there must be a court or
tribunal clothed with judicial power to hear and determine the, matter before
it;(2) <span style="">jurisdiction must be lawfully acquired
over the person of the defendant or over the property which is the subject of
the proceeding; (3) the defendant must be given an opportunity to be heard; and
(4) judgment must be rendered upon lawful hearing."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In order that the claim

jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words,
prohibition must be issued only after the reviewing tribunal shall have
convinced itself that the lower court has exercised its power in an arbitrary
or despotic manner, by reason of passion or personal hostility, and it must be
so patent and gross as would amount to an evasion, or to a virtual refusal, to
perform the duty enjoined by law.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In the case now before Us no act of

procedure he adopted, in referring to the Clerk of Court (as Commissioner) for
investigation the matter regarding the alleged forgery of petitioner's
signature, is sanctioned by the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;

wise:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Neither is there merit in the claim that there was
irregularity in the proceedings before the trial examiner due to the
non-observance of the procedure prescribed by sections 10 and 11 of Rule 34
(now Rule 33) or the Rules of Court, that is, notice to the parties of the
filing of the report or a trial commissioner <span style="">and </span>the setting of such report for hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> Trading
&amp; Supply Co. vs. Philippine Labor Union, 71 Phil. 539, it was held:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'When the Court of Industrial Relations refers a case to a commissioner
for investigation, report and recommendation, and at such investigation the
parties are duly represented by counsel, heard or at least given an opportunity
to be <span style="">heard, the requirements of due
process has been satisfied, even if the Court failed to set the report for
hearing, and a decision on the basis of such report; with the other evidence of
the case, is a decision which meets the requirements of a fair and open
hearing.'"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While the foregoing ruling was made in a case elevat­ed to this
Court from the Court of Industrial Relations, in the proceedings of which the
Rules of Court have <span class="SpellE">suppletory</span> application, We find
no legal bar to the application of the principle evolved in said ruling to
cases similarly situated before the ordinary courts of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">One more thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
general rule applicable to actions for prohibition, as in the special civil
action for certiorari, against a tribunal, board or officer, is that the
aggrieved party must first seek a reconsideration of the decision or order
complained of, so that the tribunal, board or officer will have an opportunity
to correct the error or mistake in the decision or order<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such reconsideration was asked by
petitioner in the court below before filing the present action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An action for prohibition would lie only in <span style="">the </span>absence of appeal, or any other
plain, speedy and adequate remedy in <span style="">the
</span>ordinary course of law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner had still the remedy of a motion for reconsideration <span style="">which </span>he did not avail of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstances of this case are <span style="">such </span>that petitioner cannot be
exempted from the <span style="">general rule </span>that
he should first seek a reconsideration, as a plain and adequate remedy, available
to him, before he resorts to the special civil action of prohibition.</p>
