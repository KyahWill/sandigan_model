<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="23" month="8">August 23, 1967</st1:date>,
the Clerk of this Court sent notice to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
F. <span class="SpellE">Pariñas</span> requiring him in thirty (30) days from
notice to file his brief as counsel for <span class="GramE">defendants-appellants</span>
who were convicted as principals of the crime of murder and sentenced, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> to life imprisonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel received this notice on <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because as late as December 17, 1968, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Pariñas</span> had failed
to file his brief within the period which expired on October 7, 1967, this
Court, on said date, Decem­ber 17, 1968, required him to show cause within ten
(10) days from notice thereof why disciplinary action should not be taken
against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pariñas</span>
received copy of this resolution on <st1:date year="1969" day="13" month="1">January
 13, 1969</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 10, 1969, for failure to comply, within the period which
expired on January 23, 1969, with the resolution of this Court requiring him to
show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against him, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pariñas</span> was declared in contempt of court and a fine of
P100 payable to this Court within fifteen (15) days from notice thereof was
imposed upon him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pariñas</span> received copy of this resolution on <st1:date year="1969" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">was </span>only on <st1:date year="1969" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1969</st1:date> when this Court first heard from Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pariñas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this
date, March 25, 1969, this Court received a motion for reconsideration dated
March 21, 1969 wherein he asked that "the undersigned be meted out a
disciplinary action in the form of a stern warning not to repeat the omission
which he committed in the instant case at bar." By resolution of <st1:date year="1969" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1969</st1:date>, this Court denied the
motion just adverted to.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
was appointed for defendant Domingo <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>, it
appearing that by letter of <st1:date year="1969" day="18" month="3">March 18,
 1969</st1:date>, the other defendant, Sergio Nicolas, had informed this Court <span style="">that </span>he was
no longer interested in the prosecution of his appeal and had expressed a
desire to serve his sentence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second motion for reconsideration dated <st1:date year="1969" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1969</st1:date> of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pariñas</span>,
filed on May 15, was denied by this Court in its resolution of <st1:date year="1969" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel was again required to pay the fine
within ten (10) days from receipt of notice thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1969" day="16" month="6">June
 16, 1969</st1:date>, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pariñas</span> moved for an
extension of ten (10) days up to <st1:date year="1969" day="20" month="6">June
 20, 1969</st1:date> within which to pay the fine upon a plea of recent
expenditures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was granted in
the resolution of this Court of June 19, 1969.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In another motion filed on June 25, 1969, allegedly because of
"tight money", further aggravated by the circumstances that counsel
had to pay for his car's license, matriculation of his two children in college
and others, he averred that it was financially impossible for him "to make
good further monetary obligations", and thereupon prayed for another
extension of ten (10) days, that is, up to June 30, 1969 within which to pay
the fine imposed upon him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel's plea of inability to pay the fine of P100 does not
impress us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, taken in conjunction
with his previous actuations heretofore cited, it exhibits an utter lack of
regard on the part of counsel for the orders of this Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>

obediently and respectfully.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS</b>, counsel is he<span style="">r</span>eby directed to pay to this Court the
fine of P100 imposed upon him within five (5) days from notice hereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In the event of his failure
so to do, let an order of arrest be issued for his confinement in jail for a
period of ten <span style="">(10) </span>days.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Let a copy of this resolution be entered in the personal file in
this Court of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Pariñas</span>
as member of the Bar.</p>
