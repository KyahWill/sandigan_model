First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> — presided over by
respondent, Honorable Jaime de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Angeles, Judge —
to order the execution of the decision of said Court in Civil Case No. 373
thereof, as modified by this Court <span style="">in </span>Case
No. G.<span style="">R. L-20950, entitled "Re­public
of the Philippines, Plaintiff-Appellant, versus </span><span style="">Ayala Y <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cia</span></span>. <span class="GramE">and/or</span> Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>, et al.,

<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, et al., <span class="SpellE">In<span style="">tervenors</span></span></span>-Appellants."
The basic facts are set forth in said decision, from which we quote:</p>

<blockquote>"In an amended complaint dated May 12, 1960 filed in the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> (Civil Case No. 373)
against Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., Alfonzo <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Zobel</span></span><span style="">, </span><span class="SpellE">Antonino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>,
Lucia <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>,<span style=""> </span>Ruben
<span class="SpellE">Adelaida</span> D. Reyes, <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span>
D. <span class="SpellE">Degollacion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Di­zon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, the plaintiff Republic of the Philippines sought the
annulment of files allegedly <span style="font-size: 12pt;">obtained by the defendants over portions of territorial waters of the
public domain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was alleged that the
defendant company caused the survey and preparation of a composite plan of
Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>, increasing its area from
9,652.583 hectares (as evidenced by TCT No. 722) to 12,000 hectares, by taking
or including therein lands of public dominion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus plaintiff also prayed for recovery of possession of such areas in
excess of those </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">covered </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">by TCT No. 722, and for which fishpond permits were
already issued in favor of bona fide applicants; for damages in the sum of P500<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, and for a restraining order to enjoin defendants
from exercising further acts of ownership.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> and 22 others alleged holders
of fishpond permits issued by the Bureau of Fisheries over the areas supposedly
outside the boundaries of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>, were
allowed to intervene in the case and make demand for recovery of possession of
said areas and claim for damages for the deprivation of possession thereof al­</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">legedly
</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">by the illegal
acts of defendants.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Defendants, while admitting that there really existed a
difference between the area (of the Hacienda) as <span style="">appearing in TCT No. </span>722 and the plan
prepared by the commissioned private surveyor for the company, contend that the
excess (of area) was insignificant in <span style="font-size: 12pt;">nature and attributable to the inaccuracy of
the magnetic survey that was used in the preparation </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">of the plan upon which OCT
No. 20 (and later, TCT 722) was based.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"After trial, during which the parties presented documentary
and testimonial evidence, the court ren­dered judgment annulling TCT No. T-9550
of the Re­gister <span style="font-size: 12pt;">of
Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, issued to defendant <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> covering Lots 360,362,363 and 182 as well as other
subdivision titles issued to Ayala y <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cia</span></span>.
<span class="GramE">and/or</span> Hacienda de <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>
over the areas outside its private property covered by TCT No. 722, and
ordering defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> to vacate Lot. 360 in
favor of <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
and all the defendants to pay said <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>,
jointly and severally compensatory damages in the sum of P3,000.00 a year per
hectare of Lot 360, until he is placed in possession thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants were also restrained from exer­cising
acts of ownership over said lots 360,362,363, and 182 of <span class="SpellE">Psd</span>
40891.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This ruling was based upon the
finding that the disputed areas form part of the navigable water, or are
portions of the sea, beach and foreshores of the bay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, as the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>,
other than Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, failed to establish with
particularity the lots allegedly covered by their respective permits or to name
the present possessors or occupants thereof, and as Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>.,
Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>, and the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>
were he only ones <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as parties defendants,
the judgment was made effective exclusively against them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Lot No. 360, included in TCT No. T-9550
in the name of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, and proved by <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> Mi­guel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> to
be the portion covered by the fish­pond permit issued to him, was ordered by
the court </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">delivered </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">to said <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">consequence
</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">of this
decision, a writ of preliminary mandatory in­</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">junction, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">to
place the plaintiff and <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> in </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">session
</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">of the disputed
properties, was issued by the court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, by order of May 3, 1961, the same was set aside on the ground
that in the issuance thereof, the defendants were not given their day in
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for reconsideration of
this order was denied on October 5, 1962, for the reason, among <span class="GramE">others, that</span> as defendants have always been in </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">posses­</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">sion of the areas in
question, to order delivery of such possession to the other parties at this
stage of the pro­ceeding will result in injuries </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">and promote </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">confusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Both parties
appealed directly to this Court:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the
plain<span style="font-size: 12pt;">tiff and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> claiming that the court erred in not awarding
damages to the <span class="GramE">plaintiff</span> State; in holding that the
areas claimed by the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> other than Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> were not duly identified; and in suspending the
writ of preliminary mandatory injunction which had been executed and served by
the Provincial Sheriff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants, on
the other hand, claim that the trial court was in error in finding that Lots
360, 362, 363, and 182 of Psd-40891 are outside the boundaries of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>, as delimited in TCT 722, and in order­ing for
their reversion to the public dominion; and in or­dering the latter to deliver <span style="">possession of Lot 360 to <span class="SpellE">inter­venor</span>
Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>; in ordering defendants </span>to
pay said <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> compensatory damages, and in not
declaring the defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> entitled to
reimbursement <span style="">of all neces­sary
expenses made on the properties </span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">in
</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">question."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After going over the </span>evidence,
this Court "found no reason to disturb the factual findings of the trial
court," as well as its conclusion to the effect "that the areas in
dispute were <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>portions of the foreshore, beach or
navigable water itself;" that the same are "not x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>capable of registration:" that
"their inclusion in a certificate of title does not convert the same into
properties of private ownership or confer title on the registrant;" and
that "as the lots covered by TCT No. T-9550, issued in the names of
defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> (and which were purchased by the
latter from defendants Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>. and/or Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>) were x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> portions of the foreshore or of the territorial waters,
the lower court Committed no error in rendering judgment against said
defendants and or­dering the reversion of said properties to the public
domain."</p>

<p class="BODY">We further ruled, however, that "there being no showing that
defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> are not purchasers in good faith
and for value, <u>they have a </u><u><span style="">right
to retention </span>of the property</u> until <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>reimbursed
of the necessary expenses made on the land" and that, accordingly, <u>they
"can</u><u><span style="">not also be held </span></u><u><span style="">liable for damages allegedly suffered by
other parties on account of their</span></u><span style="">" (<span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span>)</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">"possession
of the property-" The last two (2) paragraphs of the decision of this
Court were:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing, the revocation of the writ <span style="">of preliminary mandatory injunction
previously issued by the lower court, and the suspension </span>of the delivery
of pos­session of the properties to plaintiff and <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, were in order.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, thus modified, the decision of the lower court
appealed from is hereby affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Soon after our decision had become final, the records of the case
were returned to the Court of <span style="">First
Instance </span>of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, which, on motion of the
Republic and the <span class="SpellE">Intervenors</span>, ordered, on <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1965</st1:date>, the <span style="">issuance of </span>the corresponding writ of
execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same was forthwith issued
on the same date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1966</st1:date>, the defendants moved
to quash said writ, and this motion was granted by the lower court on <st1:date year="1966" day="2" month="2">February 2, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="2">February
 8, 1966</st1:date>, it, likewise, issued an order denying a motion of the
Republic and <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
for the <span style="">iss</span>uance <span style="">of another writ of execution of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision in question, which is
of the following tenor:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(<span class="GramE">a</span>) Declaring null and void Transfer
Certificate <span style="">of
</span>Title No. T-9550 (or Exhibit ‘24’) of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, and other subdivision titles issued in favor of
Ayala Y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., and/or Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>
over the areas outside its private land covered by TCT No. 722, which,
including the lots in T-9550 (Lots 360,362,383 and 182) are hereby reversed to
public domain."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A reconsideration of said orders of February 2 and 8 having been
denied, on April 13, 1966, the Republic, <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
and the other <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> in the principal case
commenced, in the Supreme Court, the present action for certiorari and
mandamus, to annul said orders of January 18, February 2 and 8, and April 13,
1966, upon the ground that the same had been issued with grave abuse of
discretion and in excess of jurisdiction, it being the ministerial duty of the
lower court to order the execution of the final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
decision on the merits of the main case, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">The basic facts are not disputed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents seek to justify the orders complained of upon the ground
that the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of our decision in Case
G.R. No. L-20950 is rather vague and requires a clarification, because:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>Since defendants
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">Dizons</span></span><span style=""> </span>were held <u>not liable</u> for the
alleged damages, it follows that the <u><span style="">joint
and several character</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">of the obligation imposed by this Honorable
Court was <u>extinguished</u>, because the other defendants herein will no longer
be able to claim from defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> the share
which corresponds to the latter (2nd par., Art. <span class="GramE">1217, Civil
Code)."</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This contention <span style="">is </span>absolutely
devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, Art. <span style="">1217 of </span>our Civil Code, cited<span style=""> b</span><span style="">y </span>respondents, refers to the effect of <u><span style="">payment </span></u>by one of the <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> debtors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
such payment having been made <span style="">in </span>the case at bar, said Article <span style="">is </span>clearly inapplicable there­to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only provision which respondents might
have had <span style="">in </span>mind (on the
assumption that their reference to Art. 1217 was due merely to <span style="">a </span>misprint)
is Art. 1215 of said code, reading:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE">Novation</span>, compensation, confusion or remission of the debt,
made by any of the <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> creditors or with any of
the <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> debtors, shall extinguish the
obligation, without prejudice to the <span style="">provisions
of </span><span style="">article
</span>1219.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The creditor who may have executed any of these acts, as well
as he who collects the debt, shall be liable to the others for the share in the
obligation corresponding to them."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Neither is this Article in point.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The aforementioned decision this Court cannot be regarded as remitting a
<span class="SpellE">solidary</span> obligation of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>,
because, as possessors in good faith, they were and are <u>entitle by law</u>
to retain the property in question, until the indemnity due to the is
paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, they were <u>never</u>
under obligation to pay damage to <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, either
jointly or <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span>, and, hence, there was no <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> obligation on their part that could have been
remitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision the Court <span style="">of </span>First Instance holding all of the
defendants herein jointly and <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable for
the payment of said <span class="GramE">damages,</span> did <u>not</u> create a <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> obligation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was no more than an <u>attempt</u> to declare the existence said
obligation, which <u>attempt</u> — <u>not</u> the <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>
<u><span style="">ob</span></u><u><span style="">ligatio</span></u><u><span style="">n</span></u><span style=""> </span><sup><span style="">__ </span></sup>was <u>frustrated</u> by our
decision establishing <span style="">that </span>such
obligation did not and does not exist.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, it should be noted that the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the decision of the lower court, which <span style="">was </span>the
object of the appeal in G.R.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>L-20950, provided:</p>
