The accused, who offered <em><em>alibi</em></em> as a defense, presented his testimony and that of his wife. Barbara Mingo, and Police Patrolman Rodolfo Manunggay and Exhibits 1, a bolo and 1-a, scabbard.</p><p>The operative facts of the case and the circumstances surrounding the apprehension and investigation of the accused now appellant established by the evidence on record are as follows:</p><p>In the evening of April 9, 1976 at about 8:00 p.m., at Sitio Dacotan, Barrio Tambac, Municipality of Romblon, Venancio Gapisa and Simeona Rapa-Gapisa, husband and wife, retired to sleep. The couple lived in a typical hut made of bamboo flooring and dilapidated <em>buri</em> walling surrounded by fruit bearing banana plants. Venancio Gapisa immediately fell asleep because he was tired from clearing the fields, and besides, had drunk tuba on that day. He slept near the door lying on his right side.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p><p>Not long after the couple had retired, Simeona, who had not yet fallen asleep, heard an indistinct sound of murmur and gnashing of teeth. Although she was seized by fear, she managed to peep through the dilapidated <em>buri</em> wall and saw accused Dominador Molo attired only in short pants. He was alone. Trembling, she immediately lighted a kerosene lamp and placed it on top of the trunk nearby. She tried to awaken her husband, but the latter did not respond.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p><p>Meanwhile, the accused had already climbed up the house which was only a flight of two steps. The accused forcibly pushed the sliding door and barged into the house. He inquired from Simeona where Venancio was and she replied that he was asleep. Finding Venancio sleeping near the door, he immediately grabbed his left wrist and started hacking at the sleeping old man. Rudely awakened, Venancio quickly stood up and with his right hand reached for his bolo which was atop the table nearby; but he was not able to retaliate in as much as Dominador Molo was quick to hack at him again. Fearing for her own life, Simeona rushed out of the house through the door of the unfinished kitchen to summon help from her son, Alejandro Gapisa, who was at Roman Mangaring's house some 100 meters away. Trembling, she told him that his father was boloed by Boslo, the name by which accused-appellant was known in their locality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p><p>Upon being informed, Alejandro and Roman ran towards the house of Venancio, followed by Simeona. Upon arrival, they saw Venancio bleeding profusely and in weakened condition. He was sitting in the floor of the kitchen, defecating in his pants. When Alejandro took him in his arms, Venancio told him that he was boloed by Boslo. Roman Mangaring who was present also inquired from Venancio who his assailant was and elicited the answer, "Boslo."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Venancio was then rushed to the hospital and arrived there at about 1:50 a.m. He expired a few minutes after.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p><p>An autopsy of the victim disclosed that he died of hemorrhage from multiple incised wounds.

Treachery qualifies the killing into murder. (Article 248, Revised Penal Code).<p>Dwelling is an aggravating circumstance because the killing was done in the house of Venancio Gapisa who had not given provocation. (Art. 14 (3), Revised Penal Code).&nbsp; </p><p>Other aggravating circumstances are recidivism and <em>reiteration</em>. (Article 14, paragraphs 9 and 19, Revised Penal Code).

They could not, however, state how much money was taken, from whom it was taken and how it was taken (pp. 34-38. 44-45, tsn., July 12, 1976).&nbsp; </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Lest it be thought that Simeona Gapisa and Alejandro Gapisa gave false testimony, thus rendering themselves untrustworthy witnesses, it should be pointed out that when they mentioned robbery as the possible motive of accused-appellant, Alejandro Gapisa made it clear that that was only his "surmise11 (p. 34, tsn,, July 12, 1976) while Simeona Gapisa qualified her assertion with the word "maybe" (p. 44, tsn., July 12, 1976). They were not committal or categorical about the matter.&nbsp; </p><p>Aside from robbery, there was no other possible motive of accused-appellant. Both Simeona Gapisa and Alejandro Gapisa admitted that accused-appellant had no grudge against Venancio Gapisa and his family and vice-versa (pp. 33-34, 53-54, tsn., July 12, 1976).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But even in the absence of proof of motive, the conviction of accused-appellant can stand inasmuch as he had been positively identified by Simeona Gapisa and by the deceased himself through his dying declaration. Motive need not be shown when there is positive identification.

robbery, and, had served sentences for said crimes.</p><p>We agree with the Solicitor General that appellant is not entitled to the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender. For in order that the same may be properly appreciated in favor of the accused, it must appear that — a) he had not been actually arrested; b) he surrendered himself to a person in authority or his agent; and c) his surrender is voluntary, which circumstances are not present in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> For appellant admitted that on the day after the killing, police authorities surrounded his house and arrested him.

It appears that accused-appellant is an incorrigible criminal with clearly anti-social proclivities against which the community has <em>the need,</em> if not <em>the right,</em> to defend itself. Where, as in this case, the reformative end of punishment seems to have failed in amending his criminal tendencies — he was convicted for frustrated murder in Criminal Case V-542, Mindoro on September 2, 1950; murder in Criminal Case No. 862, Romblon on July 27, 1961; grave slander in Criminal Case "No. V-669, Romblon, on June 5, 1957; less serious physical injuries, before the Municipal Court of Romblon, Romblon in Criminal Case No. 839 on October 9, 1959; qualified by trespass to dwelling, before the Municipal Court of Romblon, Romblon in Criminal Case No. 845 on February 25, 1960 and robbery, before the Court of First Instance of Davao in Criminal Case No. 9982 on March 1, 1967 — the imposition of the supreme penalty, <em>is not only justified </em>by the facts of this case, <em>but is required</em> as a measure of social defense. Society had given accused-appellant several chances. It would seem that compassion had not reformed him, but had instead made him a hardened criminal and a menace to his fellow men.
