<span class="SpellE">Pagkakaisa</span>-PAFLU, on <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1968</st1:date>, filed a sworn motion to cite respondent <span class="SpellE">Filtex</span> In­ternational Corporation or its General Manager,
for con­tempt of court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alleged by <span class="SpellE">movant</span> is that said respondent has refused to obey this
Court is order of October 20, 1967 for it to reinstate, pending appeal, the
strikers-members of petitioner union not found by the Court of Industrial
Relations in its decision as responsible for the strike, said reinstatement to
be made within thirty (30) days from notice <span class="GramE">of</span> the
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said notice took place on <st1:date year="1967" day="25" month="10">October 25, 1967</st1:date>, thereby giving the
respondent corporation until <st1:date year="1967" day="24" month="11">No­vember
 24, 1967</st1:date> to reinstate the strikers in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent's counsel was furnished with copy
of the pre­sent motion for contempt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting thereon, <span class="GramE">We</span> required <span class="SpellE">Filtex</span>, on <st1:date year="1968" day="15" month="1">January
 15, 1968</st1:date>, to comment in ten days from notice, on petitioner's
motion for contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said notice was
received by counsel for respondent on <st1:date year="1968" day="18" month="1">January
 18, 1968</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 179).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With in extension given,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Filtex</span> filed on <st1:date year="1968" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1968</st1:date>, its opposition to the motion to cite
respondent for contempt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said opposition set up, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
the following defense:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
corporation was in a dilemma, upon receipt of this Court's reinstatement order,
on whether to terminate the services of the employees at present oc­cupying the
positions formerly held by petitioner's mem­bers or to obey this Court's
resolution; that for it to dismiss immediately or separate said present
employees would be to violate our labor laws, particularly that on giving of
notice of termination of service, and to expose itself to the danger of being
sued in court by said em­ployees; that considering the number of employees
involved, it took respondent <span class="SpellE">Filtex</span> time to ascertain
the actual status and other circumstances of the employees affected, digging
into files and records of new and old employees; that it already notified its
employees formerly holding positions occupied by petitioner's members with a
view to reinstating some of the latter in compliance with, this Court's order,
but the present employees manifested their unwillingness to being terminated or
replaced; that <span class="SpellE">Filtex</span> in fact had filed a
manifestation dated January 24, 1968 regarding the foregoing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said manifestation stated that 52 of the
strikers had been reinstated long before this Court's order for reinstatement;
that of these, 41 had been subsequently dismissed for cause; and that the rest
had failed to present <span class="GramE">themselves</span> for
reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pe­titioner, however,
commented on said manifestation, stat­ing that the alleged reinstatement of 52
strikers long before this Court's reinstatement order is contrary to
respondent's previous stand that none of them had been reinstated before that
time; that dismissal of 41 strik­ers reinstated, if true, would be clearly an
unfair labor practice; and that respondent has not shown that it has given
notice to the strikers to return to work within a given period or lose their
jobs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present Incident was thereupon heard by <span class="GramE">Us</span>,
on <st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1968</st1:date>, after
notice to the parties, who ap­peared and adduced their respective
arguments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Filtex</span>
clearly and admittedly failed and refused to carry out this Court's order to
reinstate the strikers in question, with­in thirty days from notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out by petitioner's comment to its
manifestation, it did not reinstate or even offer to reinstate any striker
pursuant to this Court's order, but claimed having reinstated 52 of them long
be­fore the order was issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
previous reinstatement is not proved and goes counter to the stand hitherto
take by <span class="SpellE">Filtex</span> that it had precisely refused to
reinstate the strikers before said time.</p>

<p class="BODY">The point then to resolve is whether <span class="SpellE">Filtex's</span>
refusal to abide by <span class="GramE">Our</span> resolution is justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged fear of violating labor laws,
specifically the separation pay law, and of being exposed to suit, is
untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dismissal of present
employees taken as strikers' replacements, due to court order for the reinstatement
of strikers, is not only legal but also envisioned by both the company and the
pre­sent employees when they were hired pending the outcome of the present suit
or subject to any order herein. Said other workers must be deemed to have
accepted their employment as replacements with the knowledge that the same is
subject to the consequences of the labor dispute bet­ween the strikers and the
company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Norton &amp;
Harrison Co., etc., Labor Union v. Norton &amp; Harrison Co., L-18461, Feb. 10,
1967.)</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, <span class="GramE">We</span> find, no valid reason for <span class="SpellE">Fil­tex</span>
to have refused to obey this Court's order until now.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Filtex</span> could have paid one
month salary to the substitute employees, if it really was bent on comply­ing
with labor laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only that, but it
could have given one-month notice to them, in lieu of one-month sala­ry, under
the separation pay law, considering that this Court's resolution of October 20,
1967 gave it one month to effect reinstatement.</p>
