				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On January 31, 1956, the plaintiffs filed with the Court of First Instance of 
Zambales a complaint for the recovery of two parcels of land, plus damages and 
attorney's fees against the defendants. On March 5, 1956, defendants answered 
the complaint with a counterclaim. The hearing of the case set on November 21, 
1956, on petition of defendants' counsel, was postponed to September 5,1957, 
notice of which was duly served on counsel of both parties. On September 5, 
1957, as the parties and/or their counsel did not appear, the trial court issued 
an Order, the dispositive portion of which states:—
<blockquote>
<p>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, let the plaintiffs' complaint as well as the 
defendants' counterclaim be dismissed without pronouncement as to 
costs."</p></blockquote>
<p>On September 20, 1957, plaintiffs filed an Urgent Motion for Reconsideration, 
alleging that the failure to appear on the scheduled date of hearing, was due to 
excusable negligence because the letter written by counsel to one of the 
plaintiffs was not received and that they have "good grounds" to support their 
cause of action. Attached to the said Motion was the affidavit of Consolacion 
Manuel, corroborating the allegations contained in the motion.</p>
<p>Upon order of the Court, defendants opposed the Motion, contending that (1) 
the client is bound by the conduct or mistake of his counsel; (2) plaintiffs 
have not been deprived of their alleged properties, without due process of law; 
and (3) the Motion failed to state in clear and precise terms the alleged 'good 
grounds' to support the complaint. Plaintiffs replied, claiming that the failure 
to appear was due to an honest mistake and made in good faith and that the"good 
grounds" stated by them in the motion for reconsideration consisted of a deed of 
sale executed by the father of the defendants in favor of the father of the 
plaintiffs. On December 6, 1957, the Urgent Motion was denied.</p>
<p>On December 18, 1957, a Second Motion for Reconsideration and to Set Aside 
Order dated September 5, 1957, or Amend Said Order to Add "without prejudice", 
was presented. In the second motion, the grounds stated in the first were 
amplified and elaborated upon. It was contended that the failure to appear was 
caused by excusable negligence which was not a creation of the plaintiffs 
themselves. In their opposition to the second motion, defendants stressed the 
fact that the second motion was <i>proforma</i>; that the grounds upon which the 
said motion was anchored were, if not yet stated in the first motion, already 
existing at the time and their non-inclusion then constituted a waiver 
thereof.</p>
<p>On February 6, 1958, the lower court promulgated the following Order:—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Finding the plaintiffs' second motion for reconsideration to be well taken 
for reasons alleged therein;</p>
<p>AS PRAYED FOR, the decision of this Court dated September 5, 1957 is hereby 
amended to the effect that the case is dismissed <i>without prejudice</i>. All 
other parts of said order remains the same."</p></blockquote>
<p>On February 17, 1958, defendants filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the 
above Order, contending that: (1) The second motion for reconsideration is 
without merit under the Omnibus Motion Rule; (2) the same did not suspend the 
running of the thirty-day period for appeal, same being <i>proforma</i>; (3) 
when the Court issued its order of February 6, 1958, it had no longer 
jurisdiction to entertain said motion, the decision having become final and 
executory, against which an Opposition was presented by plaintiffs. On April 28, 
1958, the lower court denied the motion for reconsideration, for lack of merits. 
Defendants appealed directly to this Court, and impugned the Order of the lower 
court dated February 6, 1958.</p>
<p>The order of September 5, 1957, was received by the plaintiffs-appellees on 
September 27, 1957. On September 30, 1957, the first motion for reconsideration 
was filed which was denied on December 6, 1957. The order denying said motion; 
was received on December 15, 1957. Since the first motion suspended the period 
for the finality of judgment, only two days were consumed of the thirty days 
period. The second motion was presented on December 18, 1957, which was well 
within the thirty days period. It is true that while said second motion was 
pending resolution by the trial court, the 30-day period lapsed, because the 
second motion was only resolved on February 6, 1958; but it is likewise true 
that the case was in the <i>interim</i> within the jurisdiction of the court. It 
is a familiar rule that when a motion is filed within the reglementary period, 
provided that same does not suffer fatal defects, the duration of its pendency 
is not included in the computation of the period within which to appeal. 
Furthermore, it is one of the inherent powers of the trial court "to amend and 
control its process and orders so as to make them conformable to law and 
justice" (par. [<i>g</i>], sec. 5, Rule 124). The trial judge, after going over 
the second motion for reconsideration, might have found out that the ends of 
justice would be better served if the relief.prayed for be granted. So, 
discarding technicalities, such as the issue whether the second motion was 
<i>pro forma</i> or not, and in order to promote the object of the Rules, and to 
assist the parties in obtaining just, speedy and inexpensive determination of 
the proceeding (Sec. 3, Rule 1), the trial judge accepted and granted said 
second motion for reconsideration. Inasmuch as not only the complaint but also 
the counterclaim were dismissed because both parties and their respective 
counsel failed to appear when the case was called for hearing, there can be no 
harm at all in dismissing the case "without prejudice". And considering further 
the circumstance that the second motion was filed within the thirty-day period, 
and,therefore, the order in question had not become final, the trial judge was 
within the pale of the rules and sound discretion in ordering the said 
amendment. Evidently, the order in question, is predicated upon broad principles 
of justice, emanating from the aforecited rule (Sec. 5, par. [<i>g</i>], Rule 
124). In De Lara, Inc. <i>vs</i>. Secretary of Public Works, etc., G. R. No. 
L-13460, Nov. 28, 1958, the following pronouncements may serve as a criterion, 
in cases of this nature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A new trial under this Rule should be distinguished from the discretionary 
power of the court to reopen a trial either before or after rendition of 
judgment for the introduction of additional evidence so as to clarify its doubts 
on material points. Such discretionary power is controlled by no other rule than 
that of the paramount interests of justice, and will not be reviewed on appeal 
unless a clear abuse thereof is shown." (Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, 
Vol. 1, 1957 Ed., 513; <i>See also</i> Capellania de Tambubong <i>vs</i>. 
Antonio, 8 Phil. 683; Soriano <i>vs</i>. Aquino, 31 Phil. 176; Alvarez 
<i>vs</i>. Guevara Wee, 47 Phil. 12; Gaas <i>vs</i>. Fortich, 54 Phil, 196).</p>
<p>"The theory upon which the;court allowed motions for new trial, in the 
absence of statutory authority, is based upon the fact that, until the decision 
becomes <i>final</i>, it is under the control of the court. If the trial court 
should discover or be convinced that it had committed an error in its judgment 
or had done an injustice, before the same has become final, it may, upon its own 
motion or upon a motion of the parties, correct such error in order to do 
justice between the parties. If the trial court should discover that it was 
necessary, in order to correct an error in its decision, to grant a new trial, 
it may do so either upon its own motion or upon a motion of the parties, 
provided that that is done before the decision becomes final. It does not 
require statutory authority for a court to correct its errors or mistakes during 
the time which it has control over its decisions." (Veluz <i>vs</i>. Justice of 
the Peace of Sariaya, 42 Phil. 557, 561-562).</p></blockquote>
<p>In view hereof, we find that the orders appealed from are in conformity with 
the evidence and the law on the matter, and they should be, as they are hereby, 
affirmed. Costs is taxed on defendants-appellants in both 
instances.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, 
Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, De Leon,</i> and <i>Natividad, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
