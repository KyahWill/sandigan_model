LIONG SIAN ALIAS GEORGE QUE LIONG SIAN. GEORGE QUE LIONG SIAN, PETITIONER-APPELLEE, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR-APPELLANT.

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In a decision dated <st1:date year="1964" day="11" month="5">May
 11, 1964</st1:date>, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental granted the petition of Lee <span class="SpellE">Liong</span> <span class="SpellE">Sian</span> <u>alias</u> George <span class="SpellE">Que</span> <span class="SpellE">Liong</span> <span class="SpellE">Sian</span>, for change of name to
George Lee <span class="SpellE">Neri</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due time, the Government perfected an appeal "on
questions of law", and the record of the case was accordingly elevated to
this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">After several motions for extension of time to file appellant’s
brief, the Solicitor General, on <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="12">December
 17, 1964</st1:date>, instead of filing a brief, pre­sented a motion to
withdraw the appeal, on the ground "that the objections which <span class="SpellE">movant</span> intends to <span class="GramE">raise</span> on appeal
are too technical and would only entail a waste of time and effort." The
Solicitor General, however, did not state the basis of the objections he was
intending to raise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By resolution dated <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1967</st1:date>, the motion was
considered as appellant's brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> having failed to file his brief, the case
was considered submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since this is a matter in which the State has an interest, <span class="GramE">We</span> have looked into the record of the case to determine the
propriety of petitioner's change of name.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reasons behind the petition are:</p>

<blockquote>“2. That he became a Filipino citizen by naturalization on <st1:date year="1961" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1961</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3. That the family name which he carries is a derivative of the
Chinese name of his ancestry.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4. That since he has become a Filipino citizen, he desires to be
fully integrated into the Filipino society to which he now belongs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5. That his Chinese name has always been a roadblock to his ge­nuine
and sincere desire to act and be treated as Filipino by his fellow citizens,
giving rise to a handicap in the social and business dealings of the herein
petitioner.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“6. That your petitioner in­tends to get married and, judging from
his experience as a child, does not want that the children he expects to come
out of such mar­riage who will all be natural-born Filipinos shall suffer the
same complex of being discriminated by reason of petitioner's Chinese name.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“7. That furthermore, petitioner's name is long, hard to remember,
and difficult to spell."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The only ground of opposition interposed before the lower court
which was contained in the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> motion to
dismiss, was that "the petition mentions two alternative names, to wit,
George Lee <span class="SpellE">Neri</span> and George L. <span class="SpellE">Neri</span>."
But this was answered by the lower court when it ruled that George L. <span class="SpellE">Neri</span> is merely an abbreviation of George Lee <span class="SpellE">Neri</span>, and, therefore, pro­per.</p>

<p class="BODY">While this Court has already expressed the view that the State
has an interest in the names borne by individuals and entities for purposes of
identifica­tion and that a change of name is a privilege and not a matter of
right (<span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Peng</span> <span class="SpellE">Oan</span> vs. Republic, L-8035, November 29, 1957; Yu Chi Han vs.
Republic, L-22040, Nov. 29, 1965), it has been held, however, that in the
absence of prejudice to the State or any individual, a sincere desire to adopt
a Filipino name to erase signs of a former alien nationality which unduly
hamper social and business life is a proper and reasonable cause for a change
of name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Uy</span> @ Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> vs. Republic,
L-22712, Nov. 29, 1965).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">There being no showing that the petition for change of name is
motivated by some fraudulent purpose, or that it is trivial, whimsical or
capricious, <span class="GramE">We</span> have no objection to the withdrawal of
the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, let the appeal be considered withdrawn and/or
dismissed in accordance with Section 2 of Rule 50.</p>
