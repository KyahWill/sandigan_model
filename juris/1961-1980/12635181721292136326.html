				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case is before Us upon petition of defendants Felix <span class="SpellE">Caisip</span>, Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Rojales</span> and
Federico <span class="SpellE">Villadelrey</span>, for review on certiorari of a
decision of the Court of Appeals which affirmed that of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, convicting them of the crime of
Grave Coercion, with which they are charged, and sentencing each to four (4)
months and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span> <u>mayor</u>
and to pay a fine of P200.00, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of
insolvency, not to exceed one-third of the principal penalty, as well as
one-third of the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">As set forth in the trial court's decision, the background of the
present case is this:</p>

<blockquote>"The complainant Gloria <span class="SpellE">Cabalag</span> is
the wife of <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>
who cultivated a parcel of land known as <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 105-A of
Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Palico</span> situated in <span class="SpellE">sitio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bote-bote</span>, barrio <span class="SpellE">Tampisao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Nasugbu</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said parcel of land used to be tenanted
by the deceased father of the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Palico</span> is owned by <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span> and administered by
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Chuidian</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The overseer of the said hacienda is Felix <span class="SpellE">Caisip</span>,
one of the accused herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even before
the occurrence of the incident presently involved, there had been a series of
misunderstandings and litigations inÂ­volving the complainant and her husband,
on one hand, and the men of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Palico</span> on the
other.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It appears that on <st1:date year="1957" day="23" month="12">December
 23, 1957</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>
filed an action with the Court of Agrarian Relations seeking recognition as a
lawful tenant of <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>
over Lot No. 105-A of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Palico</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a decision dated <st1:date year="1958" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1958</st1:date>, the Court of Agrarian
Relations declared it has no jurisdiction over the case, inasmuch as <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> is not a tenant on the said parcel of land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An appeal was taken by <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>
to the Supreme Court, but the appeal was dismissed in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1958" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1958</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1958" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1958</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>. filed an
action against <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>
in the justice of the peace court of <span class="SpellE">Nasugbu</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, for forcible entry, praying therein that <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> be ejected from the premises of Lot No. 105-A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due hearing, the said Court in a
decision dated May 2, 1959 ordered <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> to vacate
the lot and to pay damages and accrued rentals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A writ of execution was issued by Justice of the Peace Rodolfo A.
Castillo of <span class="SpellE">Nasugbu</span>, which was served on <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> on June 6, 1959, and the return of which was made
by Deputy Sheriff Leonardo R. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> of this Court on
June 23, 1959 (Exhibit '10').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writ
recites among other things that the possession of the land was delivered to the
<span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> y<i> </i><span class="SpellE">Cia</span> thru
Felix <span class="SpellE">Caisip</span>, the overseer, and <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>
was given twenty days from June 6, 1959 within which to leave the
premises."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The record before Us does not explain why said decision was
executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the complainant,
her husband's counsel had appealed from said decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The justice of the peace who rendered it,
Hon. Rodolfo Castillo, said that there really had been an attempt to appeal,
which was not given due course because the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> had expired; that a motion to reconsider
his order to this effect was denied by him; and that a second motion for
reconsideration was "<u>still pending</u> consideration," and it was
October 19, 1959 when such testimony was given.</p>

<p class="BODY">Continuing the narration of the antecedent facts, His Honor, the
Trial Judge, added:</p>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1959" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1959</st1:date>,
some trouble occurred between the complainant and <span class="SpellE">Caisip</span>
regarding the cutting of sugar cane on <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 105-A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following day <st1:date year="1959" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1959</st1:date>, the complainant allegedly again
entered the premises of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 105-A and refused to be
driven out by Felix <span class="SpellE">Caisip</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due to the aforementioned incidents, Gloria <span class="SpellE">Cabalag</span> was charged in the justice of the peace court of <span class="SpellE">Nasugbu</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, with grave
coercion for the incident of June 15, 1959, docketed in the said court as
Criminal Case No. 968 (Exhibit '3'); and with the crime of unjust vexation for
the incident of June 16, 1959, docketed in the said court as Criminal Case No.
970.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both cases, however, were filed
only on <st1:date year="1959" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1959</st1:date>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In other words, these criminal cases, Nos. 968 and 970, against
Gloria <span class="SpellE">Cabalag</span>, were filed eight (8) days after the
incident involved in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is, also, noteworthy that both cases were - on motion of the prosecution, filed
after a reinvestigation thereof - provisionally dismissed, on November 8, 1960,
by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, upon the
ground "that the evidence of record x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> are insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond
reasonable doubt." The decision of said court, in the case at bar, goes on
to say:</p>

<blockquote>"It further appears that due to the tenacious attitude of
Gloria <span class="SpellE">Cabalag</span> to remain in the premises, <span class="SpellE">Caisip</span> sought the help of the chief of police of <span class="SpellE">Nasugbu</span> who advised him to see Deputy Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> about the matter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter, however, informed <span class="SpellE">Caisip</span> that he
could not act on the request to eject Gloria <span class="SpellE">Cabalag</span>
and to stop her from what she was doing without a proper court order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Caisip</span> then
consulted Antonio <span class="SpellE">Chuidian</span>, the hacienda administrator,
who, in turn, went to the chief of police and requested for the detail of policemen
in <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bote-bote</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The chief of police, acting on said request,
assigned the accused Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Rojales</span> and Federico <span class="SpellE">Villadelrey</span>, police sergeant and police corporal,
respectively, of the <span class="SpellE">Nasugbu</span> Police Force, to <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bote-bote</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1959</st1:date>,
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 p.m.</st1:time>, Gloria <span class="SpellE">Cabalag</span> was seen weeding the portion of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
105-A which was a <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Caisip</span>
approached her and bade her to leave, but she reÂ­fused to do so, alleging that
she and her husband had the right to stay there and that the crops thereon
belong to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She having stuck to this
attitude, even when he threatened to call the police, <span class="SpellE">Caisip</span>
went to his co-defendants, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Rojales</span> and Cpl. <span class="SpellE">VilladelÂ­rey</span>, both of the local police, who were some
distance away, and brought them with him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Rojales</span> told Gloria, who was then in a
squatting position, to stop weeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
Gloria insisted on her right to stay in said lot, <span class="SpellE">Rojales</span>
grabbed her right hand and, twisting the same, wrested <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
the trowel she was holding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Villadelrey</span> held her left hand and, together with <span class="SpellE">Rojales</span>, forcibly dragged her northward - towards a
forested area, where there was a banana plantation - as <span class="SpellE">Caisip</span>
stood nearby, with a drawn gun.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as Gloria shouted "Ina <span class="SpellE">ko</span>
<span class="SpellE">po</span>! Ina <span class="SpellE">ko</span> <span class="SpellE">po</span>!â<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
her neighbors, <span class="SpellE">Librada</span> <span class="SpellE">Dulutan</span>,
followed, soon later, by Francisca <span class="SpellE">Andino</span>, came and
asked the policemen why they were dragging her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The policemen having answered that they would take Gloria to town -
which was on the west - Francisca <span class="SpellE">Andino</span> pleaded that
Gloria be released, saying that, if their purpose was as stated by them, she
(Gloria) would willingly go with them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By this time, Gloria had already been dragged about eight meters and her
dress, as well as her blouse<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
were torn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then agreed to proceed
westward to the municipal building, and asked to be allowed to pass by her
house, within <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 105-A, in order to breast-feed her
nursing infant, but, the request was turned down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As they passed, soon later, near the house of
<span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span> Rivera, head of the tenant organization to
which she was affiliated, in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Camachilihan</span>,
Gloria called out for him, whereupon, he went down the house and accompanied
them to the municipal building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon arrival
thereat, <span class="SpellE">Rojales</span> and <span class="SpellE">Villadelrey</span>
turned her over to the policeman on duty, and then departed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After being interrogated by the chief of
police, Gloria was, upon representations made by <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span>
Rivera, released and allowed to go home.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing is the prosecution's version.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That of the defense is to the effect that
upon being asked by the policemen to stop weeding and leave the premises,
Gloria, not only refused to do so, but, also, insulted them, as well as <span class="SpellE">Caisip</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to
the defense, she was arrested because of the crime of slander then committed by
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants <span class="SpellE">Rojales</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Villadelrey</span>, moreover, testified that, as they
were heading towards the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Camachilihan</span>,
Gloria proceeded to tear her clothes.</p>

<p class="BODY">His Honor, the Trial Judge, accepted, however, the version of the
prosecution and found that of the defense unworthy of credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The findings of fact of the Court of Appeals,
which fully concurred in this view, are "final," and our authority to
review on certiorari its appealed decision is limited to questions purely of
law.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellants maintain that the Court of Appeals has erred: (1) in not finding
their acts "justified under Article 429 of the New Civil Code"; (2)
in holding that the 20-day period of grace given to <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> and his wife, Gloria <span class="SpellE">Cabalag</span>,
by the sheriff, to vacate Lot 105-A, was valid and lawful; (3) in finding that
the elements of the crime of grave coercion are present in the case at bar; and
(4) in finding appellants guilty as charged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This pretense is clearly untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Art. 429 of our Civil Code, reading:</p>

<blockquote>"The owner or lawful possessor of a thing has the right to
exclude any person from the enjoyment and disposal thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this purpose, he may use such force as
may be reasonably necessary to repel or prevent an actual or threatened
unlawful physical invasion or usurpation of his property. "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">upon which appellants rely is obviously
inapplicable to the case at bar, for, having been given 20 days from June 6,
1959, within which to vacate Lot 105-A, complainant did not, on June 17, 1959
-or within said period - <u>invade</u> or <u>usurp</u> said lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had merely <u>remained</u> in possession
thereof, even though the hacienda owner may have become its co-possessor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants did not "<u>repel</u> or <u>prevent</u>
an actual or <u>threatened</u> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> physical <u>invasion</u> or usurpation." They <u>expelled</u>
Gloria from a property of which she and her husband were in possession <u>even</u>
before the action for forcible entry was filed against them on May 17, 1958,
despite the fact that the Sheriff had explicitly authorized them to stay in
said proÂ­perty up to June 26, 1959 and had expressed the view that he could not
oust them <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> on June 17, 1959, without a
judicial order <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is urged, that, by weeding and refusing to leave <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
105-A, Gloria had committed a crime in the presence of the policeÂ­men, despite
the aforementioned 20-day period, which, appellants claim, the sheriff had no
authority to grant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contention is
manifestly untenable, because: 1) said period was granted in the presence of
the hacienda owner's representative, appellant <span class="SpellE">Caisip</span>,
who, by not objecting thereto, had impliedly consented to or ratified the act
performed by the sheriff; 2) Gloria and her husband were thereby allowed to
remain, and had, in fact, remained, in possession of the premises, perhaps
together with the owner of the hacienda or his representative, <span class="SpellE">Caisip</span>; (3) the act of removing weeds from the <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span> was <u>beneficial</u> to its owner and to
whomsoever the crops belonged, and, even if they had not authorized it, does
not constitute a criminal offense; and (4) although Gloria and her husband had
been sentenced to vacate the land, the judgment against them did not
necessarily imply that they, as the parties who had tilled it and planted
thereon, had no rights, of any kind whatsoever, in or to the standing crops,
inasmuch as "necessary expenses shall be refunded to every possessor,"<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and the cost of cultivation, production and upkeep has been held to partake of
the nature of necessary expenses.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is, accordingly, clear that appellants herein had, by means of
violence, and without legal authority <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
prevented the complainant from "doing something not prohibited by law,
" (weeding and being in Lot 105-A), and compelled her "to do something
against" her will (stopping the weeding and leaving said lot) "<u>whether
it be right or wrong</u>," thereby taking the law into their hands, in
violation of Art. 286 of the Revised Penal Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Caisip</span> argues that, not
having used violence against the complaining witness, he should be acquitted of
the charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, His Honor,
the Trial Judge, correctly observed:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
While it is true that the accused <span class="SpellE">Caisip</span> did not lay
hands on the complainant, unlike the accused <span class="SpellE">Rojales</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Villadelrey</span> who were the ones who used force
against Gloria, and while the Court is also inclined to discredit the claim of
the complainant that Felix <span class="SpellE">Caisip</span> drew a gun during
the incident, it sufficiently appears from the record that the motivation and
inducement for the coercion perpetrated on the complainant came from the
accused <span class="SpellE">Caisip</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was his undisguised and particular purpose to prevent Gloria from
entering the land and working on the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was the one who first approached Gloria with this objective in mind,
and tried to prevent her from weeding the land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He had tried to stop Gloria from doing the same act even the day
previous to the present incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
<span class="SpellE">Caisip</span> who fetched the policemen in order to
accomplish his purpose of preventing Gloria from weeding the land and making
her leave the premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The policemen
obeyed his bidding, and even when the said policemen were already
over-asserting their authority as peace officers, <span class="SpellE">Caisip</span>
simply stood by without attempting to stop their abuses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could be hardly said to have disapproved
an act which he himself induced and initiated."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In other words, there was community of purpose between the
policemen and <span class="SpellE">Caisip</span>, so that the latter is guilty of
grave coercion, as a co-conspirator, apart from being a principal by induction.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the commission of the offense, the aggravating circumstances
of abuse of superior strength<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
and disregard of the respect due the offended party, by reason of her sex,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
were present, insofar as the three appellants herein are concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As regards appellants <span class="SpellE">Rojales</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Villadelrey</span>, there was the additional aggravating
circumstance of having taken advantage of their positions as members of the
local police force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the penalty
of imprisonment meted out to appellants herein, which is the minimum of the
maximum prescribed in said Art. 286,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
and the fine imposed upon them, are in accordance with law.</p>
