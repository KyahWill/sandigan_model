				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners-appellants filed in the Court of
First Instance, Branch XXVI of Rizal, Civil Case No. 23625, a petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
prohibi­tion with preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court dismissed the petition on the ground "that the special
remedy of <i>certiorari</i> maybe resorted to only where ordinary appeal may
not be adequate, which circumstance is certainly not present in the instant
case." Petitioners-appellants then filed in the Court of Appeals, C.A.
-G.R. No. 06498-Sp to contest the order of dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since this appeal dealt with a question of
law, the Court of Appeals certified the case to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners-appellants, the spouses Florentino and Adelina
Enriquez, are lessees of a residential house with a small store situated at
Lawaan St., Aurora Subdivision, Angono, Rizal, owned by respondents-appellees,
the spouses Nestor and Estrella Mijares.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For failure of Enriquez to pay the monthly rentals from November 1975 to
February 1976, Mijares sent various communications, cul­minating in a letter
demanding that Enriquez pay the back rentals and vacate the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">The efforts at collection proved unavailing and in time, Mijares
filed in the Municipal Court of Angono, Rizal, Civil Case No. 117 against
Enriquez for ejectment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court
required Enriquez to file an answer within the period specified; instead of
filing an answer, he filed a motion to dismiss the original complaint and,
later, he further filed an amended motion to dismiss the amended
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The municipal court denied
both motions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Enriquez then filed his
answer with compulsory counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
response, Mijares filed a motion to declare Enriquez in default, and the court
granted it, ordering the reception <u>ex</u> <u>parte</u> of Mijares'
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, Enriquez
filed a motion for reconsideration, but the municipal court denied it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, Enriquez filed in the Court of First Instance,
Branch XXVI of Rizal, Civil Case No. 23625, a petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
prohibition with preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Enriquez claimed that the court acted without jurisdiction:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in ordering the amendment of the complaint;
in denying his motion to dismiss the amended complaint; and in declaring him in
default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court issued a res­training
order enjoining the respondent municipal judge from pro­ceeding with the
hearing of the ejectment case, and directing the respondents to maintain the <u>status</u>
<u>quo</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court also required
Mijares to file his answer, and he did so.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the petition for <i>certiorari</i> was pending in the court
of first instance, the municipal court rendered a decision in the eject­ment
case in favor of Mijares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court
ordered Enriquez and all persons under him to vacate the premises involved in
the case, to pay plaintiffs the total amount of P1,850.00 rentals in arrears;
P250.00 every month thereafter until defendants shall have vacated the
premises; P2,000.00 as liquidated damages; and P500.00 for and as attorney's
fees, in addition to costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court
later issued the corresponding writ of execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whereupon, Enriquez appealed the decision of the municipal court
by filing Civil Case No. 24135 in the same Court of First Instance, Branch XXVI
of Rizal, where his petition for <i>certiorari</i> was pending.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the court dismissed the petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
saying "that the perfection of the appeal of the mentioned Civil Case No.
117 to this court (Branch XXVI) has rendered the instant case moot and
academic." It is from this order of dismissal that Enriquez now appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the petition for <i>certiorari</i> was dismissed, Mijares
applied in Civil Case No. 24135 for a writ of execution, which the court
granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, the court dismissed the
appeal from the judgment in the ejectment case, on the ground that Enriquez had
been declared in default, and had appealed the case without asking for the
lifting or setting aside of the order of default, as required by the Rules of
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the court set aside the writ
of execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his petition for injunction filed with the Court of Appeals,
Enriquez argued "that the basis of the dismissal of said <i>certiorari</i>
case No. 23625 of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> is the appeal made in Civil
Case No. 117 of the municipal court of Angono, Rizal, which appeal was however
dismissed on motion of herein petitioners as defendants in said appealed
case." True, the appeal has been dismissed; none­theless, we find that the
issue is whether a petition for <i>certiorari</i> is rendered moot and academic
by an appeal taken in the same case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue is resolved by application to the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rule 65, Section 1 provides, <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u>,
that when any tribunal, exercising judicial functions, has acted without or in
excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion, and there is no
appeal, nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of
law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, there are two conditions that militate
against the grant of a petition for <i>certiorari</i>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>firstly</u>, when there is an appeal; or <u>secondly</u>,
when there is a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy avail­able under law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since in this case there was an appeal, by
the plain terms of Rule 65 (1), <i>certiorari</i> cannot be granted.</p>

<p class="BODY"><i>Certiorari</i> is a special civil action by which questions of
jurisdiction may be determined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
extraordinary writ of <i>certiorari</i> offers a limited form of review, for
its principal function is to keep inferior tribunals within their jurisdiction
(See Albert v. CFI of Manila, L-26364, 29 May 1968; 23 SCRA 948).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a remedy of last resort; for when
another remedy is present, the law provides that <i>certiorari</i> is not
available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writ is available only to
keep an inferior court within the bounds of its jurisdiction, or to prevent it
from committing a grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess of
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a long line of cases, this Court has held that the writ is not
available to correct errors of procedure, or mistakes in the judge's findings
or conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been held that
whether the court decides the question wrongly is utterly immaterial to the
question of its jurisdiction (Estrada v. Sto. Domingo, L-30570, 29 July 1969;
28 SCRA 890).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a rule welt-settled
in our juris­prudence that a petition for <i>certiorari</i> will not be allowed
when there is a remedy by appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Court has firmly established that the only circumstance when <i>certiorari</i>
may lie even though an appeal is available, is when such appeal does not prove
to be a more speedy and adequate remedy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In a more recent case, this Court held that questions of errors of law
should be taken up in an appeal, for they do not involve jurisdictional errors
which may properly be raised and corrected by <i>certiorari</i> (Guevarra v.
Hermoso, L-28241, 6 August 1971; 40 SCRA 335).</p>

<p class="BODY">The general rule is that <i>certiorari</i> will not lie as a subs­titute
for an appeal, for relief through a special action like <i>certiorari</i> may
only be established when no remedy by appeal lies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exception to this rule is conceded only
"where public welfare and the advancement of public policy so dictate, and
the broader interests of justice so require, or where the orders complained of
were found to be completely null and void, or that appeal was not considered
the appropriate remedy, such as in appeals from orders of preliminary
attachment or appointments of receiver." (Fernando v. Vasquez, L-26417, 30
January 1970; 31 SCRA 288).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example,
<i>certiorari</i> maybe available where appeal is inadequate and ineffectual
(Romero Sr. v. Court of Appeals, L-29659, 30 July 1971; 40 SCRA 172).</p>

<p class="BODY">None of the exceptional circumstances have been shown to be
present in this case; hence the general rule applies in its entirety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appeal renders superfluous a pending petition
for <i>certiorari</i>, and mandates its dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the light of the clear language of Rule 65
(1), this is the only reasonable reconciliation that can be effected between
the two concurrent actions:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the appeal
has to be prosecuted, but at the cost of the petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
for the petition has lost its <u>raison</u> <u>d'etre</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To persevere in the pursuit of the writ would
be to engage in an enterprise which is unnecessary, tautological, and frowned
upon by the law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order dismissing the petition for <i>certiorari</i>
is hereby affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without costs.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Antonio, (Acting Chairman), Santos, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> De Castro, JJ.,<span style="font-style: normal;"> concur.</span></span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Aquino, J., <span style="font-style: normal;">see concurring
opinion.</span></span><br>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">AQUINO, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the
Enriquez spouses had filed an answer to the ejectment complaint, the municipal
court of Angono, Rizal, erred in declaring them in default.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the Enriquez spouses should have moved to set aside
the order of default and the judgment by default (Sec. 13, Rule 5 and sec. 3,
Rule 18, Rules of Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of
denial of that motion, they should have appealed to the Court of First Instance
of Rizal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of resorting to that remedy, they improperly filed a
petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition in the Court of First Instance,
Civil Case No. 23625.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that, although the Enriquez spouses did not move
to set aside the order of default, they were able to appeal from the adverse judgment
of the municipal court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal was
docketed in the Court of First Instance as Civil Case No. 24135.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of First Instance erroneously disposed of that appeal
by dismissing it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of First
Instance should have set aside the municipal court's decision and required it
to try the case anew by giving the Enriquez spouses a chance to present their
evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, nothing more can be done about that dismissal of the
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is now final and the
municipal court's decision is already executory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That erroneous dismissal of the appeal could
have been assailed by means of <i>certiorari</i> in this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of First Instance correctly disposed of the <i>certiorari</i>
and prohibition case, Civil Case No. 23625, by dis­missing it since appeal, not
<i>certiorari</i>, was the remedy of the Enriquez spouses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Enriquez spouses improperly appealed by
record on appeal from the dismissal order.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is that appeal from the dismissal of their <i>certiorari</i>
petition which the Court of Appeals had certified to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have no choice but to affirm the order of
dismissal.</p>
