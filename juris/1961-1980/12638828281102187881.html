				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">What was challenged in this <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition
proceeding by the then Mayor of Balabagan, Lanao del Sur, was the validity of
an order of preventive suspension issued by respondents:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the then Provincial Governor Linang D.
Mandangan, Vice-Governor Kasan A. Marohombsar and Members Ibrahim Ali and Bajunaid
Balt, composing the Provincial Board of Lanao del Sur at that time, on the
ground of the pendency of two complaints against petitioner, one for oppression
and misconduct in office and the other for dishonesty and misconduct in
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court in its resolution of <st1:date year="1969" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1969</st1:date><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
required respondents to answer, with a writ of preliminary injunction against
the enforcement of such order of preventive suspension of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was an answer duly filed on June 23 of
that year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was likewise prayed that
the writ of preliminary injunction be lifted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court, however, while requiring petitioner to answer that plea, did
not grant it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other pleadings were
subsequently filed, including memoranda from both parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the last pleading filed by respondents, it
was admitted that by <st1:date year="1971" day="31" month="12">December 31,
 1971</st1:date>, the case would become moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">A lot of time had passed since then including not only the
regular elections for provincial and municipal officials in 1971 but also the
adoption of the present Constitution on <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="1">January
 17, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will clearly
appear therefore that the matter sought to be put issue by this petition would
serve no purpose or consequence as there is even no showing that the parties
have retained the positions previously held by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, <span class="GramE">under</span>
two Presidential Decrees, changes were introduced not only in the names but in
the membership of provincial boards.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is dismissed for being moot and
academic.</p>
