<p class="BODY">Late in the evening of <st1:date year="1959" day="10" month="6">June
 10, 1959</st1:date>, nine Muslim ban­dits carrying bladed weapons and firearms
met in the house of one <span class="SpellE">Miutong</span> located at <span class="SpellE">Candiis</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lamitan</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Basilan</span></span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They took an early supper and conversed until
late in the evening, when they left and boarded two <span class="SpellE">vintas</span>
in the di­rection of <span class="SpellE">Pe-ek</span>, same district and
city.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time> of the same evening, the bandits arrived at <span class="SpellE">Pe-ek</span> and went direct to the house of <span class="SpellE">Paleng</span>
Toto which they en­tered unannounced.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Once inside the house, they fired two shots into the air, waking up the
inmates of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the bandits
lighted a native lamp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They then
hog-tied the inmates of the house, ransacked their pockets for va­luables, and
hacked them with bladed weapons on vital parts of their bodies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bandits then left the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly after, two of the victims, <span class="SpellE">Paleng</span> Toto and <span class="SpellE">Mahajiril</span> Toto,
were found dead, while three other victims, <span class="SpellE">Kapek</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sabu</span> <span class="SpellE">Pa­leng</span> and <span class="SpellE">Enjeng</span>, were found to be still alive although gravely
wounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These victims were taken to a
hospital at <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Basilan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
where due to timely medical care for about three weeks, they were saved from
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The medical certificates,
Exhibits "A" and "C", described the wounds inflicted upon <span class="SpellE">Paleng</span> Toto and <span class="SpellE">Mahajiril</span> Toto,
respective­ly, and the causes of their deaths were as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>re <span class="SpellE">Paleng</span> Toto,
"1. Wound, incised, 2-1/2 in. long, superficial, back, left side, upper
portion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>2. Wound, incised, 4 in. long

of the above named deceased Moro <span class="SpellE">Paleng</span> Toto was
Acute Anemia, Secondary hemorrhage, <span class="GramE">Multiple</span>

</span>The cause of death of the above named deceased Imam <span class="SpellE">Mahajiril</span>
Toto was Acute Anemia, Secondary hemorrhage, wound penetrating the thoracic
cavity, shoulder and back, left side." The wounds inflicted upon the other
three victims are described in medical certificates Exhibits "H",
"I" and "J", as follows:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Exhibit "H", re <span class="SpellE">Kapek</span>, "Hacking

complications, 2 weeks."</span> The bandits duly identified were <span class="SpellE">Baeng</span> <span class="SpellE">Tungol</span>, <span class="SpellE">Unuh</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bakang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malonzo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Indanan</span> <span class="SpellE">Tarang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Awaron</span> <span class="SpellE">Nalun</span>, Elias <span class="SpellE">Taupan</span>, Endo <span class="SpellE">Sahim</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abirin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ninth
ban­dit was not identified and was referred to as John Doe.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court found the defendants, <span class="SpellE">Indanan</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tarang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Unuh</span> <span class="SpellE">Bakang</span>, guilty as principals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The finding is correct, it being clear from
the evidence that there was conspiracy or previous concert of criminal design.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court held that there was treachery because the victims
were hog-tied and defenseless when some of the bandits hacked them with bladed
weapons on vital parts of their bodies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court was correct in so holding.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the lower court erred in finding the defend­ants, <span class="SpellE">Indanan</span> <span class="SpellE">Tarang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Unuh</span> <span class="SpellE">Bakang</span>, guilty of
"double murder, with multiple frustrated <span class="GramE">murder</span>,"
that is, of com­plex crimes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crimes
were not complex because there were different acts of hacking performed by
different ban­dits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason
Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code on complex crimes is not applicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span>, G.R. No.</span> L-18793, <st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="10">October 11, 1968</st1:date>.) There were, therefore, two
distinct murders and three distinct frustrated murders and the two defendants
are criminally liable for each and every one of them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court was correct in finding that the aggra­vating
circumstance of by a band was offset by the mitigat­ing circumstance of
illiterate non-Christians.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Sec. 106,
Administrative Code of the Department of Mindanao and <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>.)</p>

<p class="BODY">The civil indemnity for the deaths of <span class="SpellE">Paleng</span>
Toto and <span class="SpellE">Mahajiril</span> Toto should be raised from P6<span class="GramE">,000</span> to P12,000 for each of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span>, <u>supra</u>.)</span><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The civil indemnity of P500 granted by the lower court to each of
the three victims of frustrated murder cannot be increased in the absence of
evidence to justify an increase.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only witness presented for the defense was Endo <span class="SpellE">Sahim</span>, the defendant who previously pleaded guilty to the
information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to his
testimony, the trial court, Judge Geronimo R. <span class="SpellE">Marave</span>,
presiding, made the following findings:</p>

<blockquote>"To overcome the evidence for the prosecu­tion, the defense
introduced the lone testimony of Endo <span class="SpellE">Sahim</span> who
claims that <span class="GramE">he,</span> <span class="SpellE">Malonzo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Awaron</span> were the only ones who committed the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This testimony was not at all corroborated,
not even by the accused <span class="SpellE">Indanan</span> <span class="SpellE">Tarang</span>
or <span class="SpellE">Unuh</span> <span class="SpellE">Bakang</span>
themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Endo <span class="SpellE">Sahim</span> was arraigned by the reading of the above quoted <span class="SpellE">informations</span> and translated in the dia­lect known to him,
he admitted that he, toge­ther with his co-accused, <span class="SpellE">Baeng</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tungol</span>, <span class="SpellE">Unuh</span> <span class="SpellE">Bakang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Indanan</span> <span class="SpellE">Tarang</span>, Elias <span class="SpellE">Taupan</span>, conspiring
and confederating together, aiding and as­sisting with their co-accused Moro <span class="SpellE">Abirin</span>, and one John Doe who is still at large, <span class="SpellE">Malonzo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Awaron</span> <span class="SpellE">Nalun</span> who are already dead, commit­ted the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, when he was arraigned and apprised
that <span class="SpellE">Indanan</span> <span class="SpellE">Tarang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Unuh</span> <span class="SpellE">Ba­kang</span> were among his
companions in the commission of the crime, he was not heard to have stated that
<span class="SpellE">Indanan</span> <span class="SpellE">Tarang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Unuh</span> <span class="SpellE">Bakang</span> were not with him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"From the evidence therefore, the guilt of the accused <span class="SpellE">Indanan</span> <span class="SpellE">Tarang</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Unuh</span> <span class="SpellE">Bakang</span> of the crime charged
in the information was proved beyond reasonable doubt."</blockquote>

of the trial court.</p>
