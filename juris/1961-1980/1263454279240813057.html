				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On August 20, 1962, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> filed in
the court below a petition for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus,
alleging therein that they were being unlawfully detained and deprived of
liberty by the respondents Commissioner of Immigration and Chief of the
Detention Station at Engineer Island, Manila, because the order for their
deportation issued on December 28, 1961 by the President of the Philippines had
been revoked on the 30th of the same month and year.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="8" day="21" year="1962">August 21, 1962</st1:date>,
the lower court ordered the respondents to bring the persons of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> before the court and to submit their return.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 22 of the same year, the respondents filed an
opposition to the petition, denying that the order of deportation mentioned
above had ever been resolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date, acting upon <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>’
petition, the lower court ordered their release - as in fact they were released
- from confinement upon the filing by each of them, and approval by the court,
of a bond in the sum <span style="">of P8<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="9" day="1" year="1962">September 1, 1962</st1:date>,
the Commissioner of Immigration submitted his return to the writ, stating
therein that he <span style="">was </span>holding <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> under confinement by virtue of an outstanding and
<span class="SpellE">unrevoked</span> deportation order issued by the President
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He therefore prayed that the petition for habeas
corpus be dismissed; that the bail bonds posted by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
for their temporary liberty be cancelled, and that all of them be ordered
re-arrested for immediate deportation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="10" day="4" year="1962">October 4, 1962</st1:date>,
a supplemental petition was filed for the purpose of including Po Kim Chun as
co-petitioner because he was also arrested and detained pursuant to the same
allegedly revoked order of deportation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, the Court issued an order directing appellants to bring the
person of Po Kim Chun before the Court on the following day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The return filed by the Commissioner of
Immigration in con­nection with the original petition was considered as filed
in connection with the supplemental petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Po Kim Chun was also allowed to be on provisional liberty on <span style="">a </span>similar
bond, and upon the filing and approval thereof, he was released from custody.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 30, 1962, the Commissioner of Immigration filed a
supplemental return and motion for the cancellation of the bonds mentioned
heretofore, claiming that it had been definitely ascertained that there was no
record whatsoever of the alleged order of December 30, 1961 revo<span style="">k</span>ing <span style="">the deportation order against <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, and
alleging further that the proper public records showed that said deportation
order had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court, however, held in abeyance
its resolution thereon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The case as against Po Kim Chun was never tried and it appears
that on <st1:date month="6" day="30" year="1963">June 30, 1963</st1:date> he
voluntarily left the country.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due trial of the case as regards the other petitioners, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> herein, the court rendered judgment declaring
that they were unlawfully detained and deprived of their liberty and ordered
their release.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due time the
respondents appealed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> were
among several aliens charged and made respondents in Case No. <span class="GramE">R-478 of the Deportation Board.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>After proper investigation by the latter,
they were recommended for deportation due to their communistic or subversive
activities, coupled with the utterance of counterfeit coins, and for prostitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, on <st1:date month="12" day="28" year="1961">December 28, 1961</st1:date> the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
declared them to be undesirable aliens and ordered that they be arrested by the
Commissioner of Immigration and thereafter deported by the first available
transportation to mainland <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or <st1:country-region><st1:place>Formosa</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In compliance therewith, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
were arrested and turned over to the Commissioner of Immigration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Preparatory to their deportation, they
remained confined at the Detention Station at <st1:place><st1:placename>Engineer</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Island</st1:placetype></st1:place>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
until <st1:date month="8" day="22" year="1962">August 22, 1962</st1:date> when
they were released on bail by order of the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> sought from the
President and the Deportation Board the reconsideration of the order of
deportation, of the denial of the review thereof, and a new trial based on
newly discovered evidence (Exhibit 4, pp. 46-47, Record, paragraph 9,
Supplemental Return, Record p. 43), but this was denied by the President
(paragraph 9-B, Supplemental Return, Record, p. 43; Exhibits <span style="">5, 5-A </span>and
6, Record, pp. 105-107).</p>

<p class="BODY">As raised by appellants the issues involved in this appeal are
the following:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. Did the President revoke on <st1:date month="12" day="30" year="1961">Dec. 30, 1961</st1:date>, his last day in office, the order of
deportation issued against <span style="">petitioners
on </span><st1:date month="12" day="28" year="1961"><span style="">Dec. 28, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2. Is the trial court possessed with jurisdiction to release petitioners
from confinement on bail during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the
proceedings for habeas corpus?</p>

<p class="NUM">3. Are petitioners entitled to release on habeas corpus or are
they lawfully detained by the Commissioner of Immigration pending deportation
upon order of the President?</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged revocation of the presidential order of deportation
is obviously of vital and decisive importance in the resolution of the first
and last issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the <span style="">facts stated heretofore, it is clear that <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> had the burden of proving not only that the
revocation order was issued but also that it is valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To discharge this burden, however, all that
they could produce was (a) the alleged original of the order aforesaid claimed
to have been signed not by the President but only by Assistant Executive
Secretary <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Gallares</span>
after the words "By the President:", and (b) a <span class="SpellE">photostatic</span>
copy of an alleged duplicate of the same order signed neither by the President
nor </span><span style="">by
A</span><span style="">ssistant Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Gallares</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">An examination of both
documents </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">sufficient to
convince anyone that they are of an extremely suspicious character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, why and how the alleged
original of an official document has fallen into the hands of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> has not been satisfactorily explained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second place, on the face thereof
(Exhibit </span><span style="">A, </span><span style="">p. 97 of the Record)
the name of the then President of the Philippines, Carlos P. Garcia, does not
appear at all, while it does appear on the face of the alleged <span class="SpellE">photostatic</span> copy of an alleged duplicate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the third place, upon the face of said <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">photostatic</span></span> copy, the following
remarks appear:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"COPY FOR:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">The
Sec. of For.</span> Affairs</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Chairman,
Deportation Board</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Commissioner of
Immigration"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The alleged original, however, does not
contain the same remar<span style="">k</span>s.</p>

<p class="BODY">Add to the above the circumstance that the alleged revocation
order was issued <span style="">on the 30th day of </span>December
1961, and <span style="">one can </span>readily reach
the conclusion that, if it was really issued, it was one of the "<st1:time hour="0" minute="0">midnight</st1:time>" orders and appointments that now
belong to history.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our conclusion, therefore, is that the documents upon which <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> rely are utterly insufficient to prove the
alleged revocation of the order of deportation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having arrived at the above conclusion, <span class="GramE">We</span>
deem it unnecessary, for the purpose of this decision, to consider and resolve
the other issue raised in appellants' brief.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the
appealed decision is reversed and set aside and the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
are hereby ordered re-arrested for deportation in accordance with the
presidential order of deportation mentioned in the body of this decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bail bonds filed for their provisional
liberty shall remain outstanding until after they have been re-arrested, to
answer for any liability contracted under their terms. <span class="GramE">With
costs.</span></p>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> Fernando, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span> <span style="font-style: normal;">concur.</span></span><br>
