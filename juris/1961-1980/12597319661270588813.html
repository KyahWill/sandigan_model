				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF LEON C. SO TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. LEON C. SO, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal, taken by the Government, from an order of the Court of First
Instance of Pampanga, granting the petition of appellee Leon C. So to
be allowed to take his oath as citizen of the Philippines.
<p>A decision having been rendered by the Court of First Instance of
Pampanga, on August 31, 1960, granting appellee's application for
naturalization as a citizen of the Philippines, on July 10, 1962, he
moved that, after due hearing, he be allowed to take his oath and the
corresponding certificate of naturalization issued to him. After said
hearing, the lower court issued the aforementioned order, from which
the Office of the Solicitor General has appealed, upon the ground that
appellee has no lucrative employment or occupation.</p>
<p>Indeed, the record discloses that, when the petition for
naturalization was originally heard in July and August, 1960, appellee
was allegedly working as sales clerk in the S. So &amp; Sons Grocery
Store, which belonged to his widowed mother, with a yearly salary of
P2,400.00, which was later increased to P3,000. At the aforementioned
rehearing, in September 1962, he testified that his mother owns a land
of about 384 square meters in Angeles, Pampanga, and that his salary
had been increased to P300.00 a month. But, since appellee is married
and has six (6) children, the lower court entertained doubts on the
sufficiency of his income to warrant the conclusion that he has a
lucrative trade or profession and justify his being allowed to take the
requisite oath. So, on October 1, 1962, said court issued an order
directing that his oath taking be "held in abeyance‚Äù and that "if he
could prove a substantial means to be admitted to Philippine
citizenship, he shall be allowed to take the oath as Filipino citizen."</p>
<p>On "motion for reconsideration" filed by the appellee, the court set
a date for the reception of additional evidence on his behalf. On said
date, he produced an alleged contract (Exhibit M) between him and his
widowed mother, and owner of S. So &amp; Sons Grocery Store, dated
October 25, 1962, increasing his salary to P900.00 a month, "effective
November 1, 1962." Relying upon this evidence, and considering him a
co-owner of the land aforementioned, the lower court issued the order
appealed from, dated November 18, 1962, holding that appellee "has
proven substantial means as required by law", and, accordingly,
authorizing him to take his oath as Filipino citizen.</p>
<p>For reasons not explained in the record, His Honor, the trial Judge had, <em>prior</em>
thereto, or on November 17, 1962, administered to the appellee the
aforementioned oath. Consequently, on motion of the Government, which
had, meanwhile, or on December 13, 1962, filed seasonably its notice of
appeal, said oath and the certificate of naturalization issued in
pursuance thereof, were, on December 29, 1962, ordered cancelled by the
lower court.</p>
<p>It is obvious, however, that said contract (Exhibit M) was made for
the sole purpose of adjusting appellee's evidence to the view of the
lower court to the effect that his income theretofore was insufficient
to satisfy the legal requirement of a lucrative trade or profession.
Indeed, considering that appellee's employer is his own mother and that
there has been not even an attempt to explain why his salary as sales
clerk should be suddenly trebled, from P300 to P900 a month, no other
logical explanation can be given for said increase (Velasco <em>vs</em>. Republic, L-14214, May 25, 1960; Cu <em>vs</em>. Republic, L-13344, July 21, 1962; Que Hoc Gui <em>vs</em>. Republic, L-16884, September 30, 1961; Tan <em>vs</em>. Republic, L-14860, May 30, 1961; Sy Ang Hoc <em>vs</em>. Republic, 50 Off. Gaz., 5628).</p>
<p>With respect to the land of which the lower court found the appellee
to be a co-owner, suffice it to say that such finding is contrary to
appellee's own testimony, to the effect that said land had been bought
by <em>his mother</em>, that it belonged to <em>her</em> and that <em>she alone</em>
received the income derived therefrom. Moreover, even if we assumed
that it belonged to the conjugal partnership between her and her
deceased husband, the result would be that one-half thereof would still
belong to her exclusively, and that the other half would have to be
divided between her and her thirteen (13) children, so that the latter
and, hence, appellee herein, would own less than fourteen (14) square
meters each, on the assumption that the estate of the deceased has no
unpaid obligations, on which there is absolutely no evidence
whatsoever. Then, again, there is no competent evidence on the value of
said property. Hence, the lower court, at the first re-hearing,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> considered the evidence for appellee concerning said land <em>insufficient</em>
to authorize his oath taking. Precisely, for this reason, the appellee
deemed it best to give up his claim of qualification based upon
ownership of real estate, and to improve his position as regards his
alleged income, by suddenly increasing his salary from P300 to P900 a
month. It is thus manifest that the record before us does not justify
either the conclusion that appellee is a co-owner of the land
aforementioned or the consideration of his alleged interest therein as
a factor indicative of a compliance with one of the requisite
qualifications to be naturalized as a Filipino citizen.</p>
<p><strong></strong><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Wherefore, the order appealed from should be, as it
is hereby reversed, and petitioner's motion to take his oath denied,
with costs against said petitioner-appellee. It is so ordered.</p>
