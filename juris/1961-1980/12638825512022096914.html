				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This disbarment case stemmed from an <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
case filed by<span style=""> Atty. <span class="SpellE">N<span style="">ilo</span></span></span> S. <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> against Luis D. Santos who had issued bouncing
checks.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1970</st1:date>
<st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> purchased for P240<span class="GramE">,000</span> the shares of stock of <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>
in the Diamond Shipping Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
made an initial payment of P40<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The balance of P200<span class="GramE">,000</span>
was covered by a promissory note and five postdated checks issued by <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four checks were dishonored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
failed to pay the balance of the price amounting to P100<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He transferred the stocks to <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Tankch</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1974</st1:date>
<span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> sued <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
and <span class="SpellE">Tankeh</span> the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City for the recovery of the<span style=""> said </span>balance (Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">Q-19174).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Not content with that civil action, <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>,
through counsel, filed on <st1:date year="1975" day="22" month="1">January 22,
 1975</st1:date> a complaint for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> against <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
in the office of the provincial fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1975" day="15" month="5">May
 15, 1975</st1:date> the fiscal charged <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
with <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (Criminal Case No. 14355).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On being served with a warrant of arrest, <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
put up a cash bond of P15<span class="GramE">,000</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The criminal case was reinvestigated by a state prosecutor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon his motion to dismiss, concurred in by
the fiscal, the court dismissed the <span class="GramE">case</span> in its order
of <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>, smarting from
the criminal action filed against him by <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>,
retaliated by filing in this Court on <st1:date year="1975" day="28" month="10">October
 28, 1975</st1:date> a complaint for disbarment against <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>
who was admitted to the bar in 1932.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
alleged that <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> committed a serious breach of
professional ethics by instigating a false or malicious suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> denied the
charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that he would have been
remiss in his duties as a lawyer if he had closed his eyes to the commission of
a fraud or crime perpetrated against <span class="GramE">himself</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was referred to the Solicitor General for investigation,
report and recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
complainant <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> had presented
his evidence and when respondent <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> was under
cross-examination.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Santos manifested in
a letter to the Solicitor General dated April 27, 1976 that he had decided to
adopt a "forgive and forget" attitude, that he was "no longer
interested" in prosecuting the case, and that he would not object to its
dismissal (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 18).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> objected to the dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He insisted that the hearing be
continued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He completed the presentation
of the evidence in his defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City rendered a verdict in <span class="SpellE">Tuazon's</span>
favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its decision dated <st1:date year="1976" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1976</st1:date> it ordered <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
to pay the sum of P100<span class="GramE">,000</span> plus P20,000 as damages and
attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">(A lawyer may be disbarred "for any deceit, malpractice, or
other gross misconduct in such office, grossly immoral conduct, or by reason of
his conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude, or for any violation of
the oath which he is required to take before admission to practice, or for a <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> disobedience of any lawful order of a superior
court, or for corruptly or <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span> appearing as an
attorney for a party to a case without authority so to do" (Sec. 27, Rule
138, Rules of Court).)</p>

<p class="BODY">(The issue is whether Atty. <span class="SpellE">Tuazon's</span>
act of filing through a lawyer a charge of swindling against his debtor,
Santos, which charge was filed in court by the fiscal but was later dismissed,
constituted malicious prosecution which justifies <span class="SpellE">Tuazon's</span>
disbarment.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that that act is not within the purview of the grounds
for disbarment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that the rule
of <span class="SpellE"><u>inclusio</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">unius</span>
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">est</span></span> </u><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">exclusio</span></u></span><u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">alterius</span></span></u><span style=""> </span>does not apply to the grounds for
disbar<span style="">ment enumerated in section 27 (<span class="SpellE">Royong</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Oblena</span>, 117 Phil. 865.
But <span class="SpellE">Tuazon's</span> conduct cannot be categorized as a
reprehensible act which warrants the cancellation of his name in the Roll of
Attorneys or which shows his unfitness to be a member of the bar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">[It is evident that he acted in good faith in instituting the
criminal action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Civil and criminal
actions may be instituted separately in <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> cases
(Art. 33, Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> had warned <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
that he was going to resort to a criminal action to protect his interest.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in his letter of <st1:date year="1970" day="29" month="6">June
 29, 1970</st1:date>, he apprised <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
that he (<span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>) would file civil and criminal
actions if <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> did not make good
the amounts covered by the dishonored checks (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>
waited for more than four years before he filed the criminal action.)</p>

<p class="BODY">(On the other hand, <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
admitted that he filed the complaint for disbarment by way of vindictive retaliation
against <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> (53 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <st1:date year="1976" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1976</st1:date>; 6-9 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <st1:date year="1976" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1976</st1:date>).</p>
