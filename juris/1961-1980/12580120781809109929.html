<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petition for a writ of certiorari 
to annul the order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental, in its Special Case No. 2280, dismissing 
the petitioner's petition for judicial recount of the election returns for the 
position of lieutenant-governor in the 1963 elections, coming from Precincts 
Nos. 9, 14, 18, 19 and 25 of <span class="SpellE">Mambajao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camiguin</span> <span class="SpellE">Subprovince</span>. It is 
alleged that if the said order were annulled, the result of the election would 
change in favor of the petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner 
Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Ber</span>.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="SpellE">Palarca</span> and respondent Jose P. <span class="SpellE">Neri</span> were candidates of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party-<span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> Loyalist 
Coalition and of the Liberal Party, respectively, for lieutenant-governor of 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Camiguin</span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Subprovince</span></span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> in the elections held on 
</span><st1:date month="11" day="12" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">12 November 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">During the canvass of the 
election returns by the provincial board of canvassers, the representative of 
the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party, discovering what he believed 
to be indubitable discrepancies in the copies of the returns, moved the board to 
petition for a judicial recount. The board refused, whereupon the petitioner 
filed before the respondent court a petition for judicial recount. The court, on 
</span><st1:date month="11" day="29" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">29 November 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
enjoined, by a writ of preliminary injunction, the members of the provincial 
board of canvassers from proclaiming Jose P. <span class="SpellE">Neri</span> as 
the lieutenant-governor-elect, until otherwise directed by the 
court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="12" day="9" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">9 
December 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the respondent court issued the 
order that is sought to be annulled, which, as aforesaid, dismissed the petition 
with respect to the afore-enumerated precincts but ordered a recount with 
respect to Precinct No. 16. The questioned order is predicated on the 
examination by the respondent court of the election returns involved, wherein it 
found the following: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In Precinct No. 9, there is no 
contradiction or conflict whatsoever in the copies submitted to the Provincial 
Treasurer and the municipal treasurer as well as those found in the ballot box. 
Petitioner Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Palarca</span> is credited in all those 
copies with 'thirty-two’ votes, in words and figures, and <span class="SpellE">Neri</span> with 'seventy-seven’ votes also in words and figures. 
The only discrepancy noted is that found in the copy of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party wherein candidate Jose P. <span class="SpellE">Neri</span> has been credited with 'seventy’ votes in words and 
figures. The Court found, however, some erasures after the word ' seventy’ and 
also after the figures '70' written in said copy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In Precinct No. 14, the Court 
also found no conflict or contradiction in all the four copies, namely, those of 
the Provincial Treasurer, the municipal treasurer, the ballot box and the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party. The only discrepancy, if at all, is that 
found in the superimposition of the figure '1' over the figure '6’ in the 81 
votes accredited to candidate Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Palarca</span> in the 
copies of the Provincial Treasurer and the municipal treasurer, which apparently 
shows that the Board of Inspectors corrected the original entry from '86' to 
'81' as they bear the Initials of the person who wrote the entries on said 
copies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In Precinct No. 16, the Court 
found the votes credited to candidate Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Palarca</span> 
written very clearly in words and figures as 'Fifty-Six' in the copy of the 
statement submitted to the municipal treasurer, whereas, in the copy sent to the 
Provincial Treasurer, that deposited in the ballot box and that given to the 
<span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party, the votes for said candidate 
written in words may be read either as 'Fifty-Six’, '<span class="SpellE">Fixty</span>-Six', '<span class="SpellE">Finty</span>-Six' or 
'Sixty-Six' depending upon the appreciation of the first capital letter and the 
third small letter in the hyphenated word.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In Precinct No. 18, the Court 
found no conflict or contradiction in the copies of the municipal treasurer, the 
Provincial Treasurer and in the ballot box. The only discrepancy noted by the 
Court is in the copy of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party wherein 
candidate <span class="SpellE">Palarca</span> was credited with ' 67' votes in 
words instead of '47' in words appearing in the three other copies 
above-mentioned. In the said copy, however, of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party, the figures representing the votes of 
the same candidate Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Palarca</span> is clearly written 
as '47'.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In Precinct No. 19, the Court 
found no contradiction in the copies of the Provincial Treasurer, the municipal 
treasurer and in the ballot box, as candidate Jose P. <span class="SpellE">Neri</span> was credited in all copies with 'One Hundred 
Twenty-Five' votes in words and figures and candidate Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Palarca</span> with "Forty-Eight’ votes in words and figures. In 
the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party's copy, however, candidate Jose 
P. <span class="SpellE">Neri</span> <span class="GramE">appear</span> credited with 
'One Hundred Twenty’ in words and '125' in figures.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In Precinct No. 25, the copy of 
the election statement submitted to the provincial treasurer, that deposited in 
the ballot box and that of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party show 
no contradiction or conflict, and show candidate Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Palarca</span> to have been credited with 'Fifty-One' votes in 
words and figures and Jose <span class="SpellE">Neri</span> with 'Forty-Nine' 
votes also clearly written in words and 
figures."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">From the foregoing findings, it 
is observed that the copies of the election returns for Precincts Nos. 9, 14, 
18, 19 and 25 of the provincial treasurer, of the municipal treasurer and the 
one deposited in the ballot box (except for the initialed corrections pertaining 
to Precinct No. 14) all tallied with one another; and that the only copy that 
did not tally with the aforesaid three (3) copies, with respect to these 
precincts, was the copy of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> 
Party.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The issue, therefore, is whether 
or not the copy or statement of the election returns sent to the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party is one of those contemplated by Section 
163 of the Revised Election Code, which provides: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"When 
statements of a precinct are contradictory.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> -In case it appears to the 
provincial board of canvassers that another copy or other authentic copies of 
the statement from an election precinct submitted to the board give to a 
candidate a different number of votes and the difference affects the result of 
the election, the Court of First Instance of the province, upon motion of the 
board or of any candidate affected, may proceed to recount the votes cast in the 
precinct for the sole purpose of determining which is the true statement or 
which is the true result of the count of the votes cast in said precinct for the 
office in question. Notice of such proceeding shall be given to all candidates 
affected."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The lower court, in its order of 
</span><st1:date month="12" day="9" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">9 December 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
resolved the issue in the negative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="12" day="13" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">13 
December 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Palarca</span> filed the present petition with this Court, praying 
for the nullification of the lower court's dismissal order and an <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></span></em> 
preliminary injunction to restrain the respondent court from lifting the 
preliminary injunction that it had previously issued against the proclamation of 
candidate <span class="SpellE">Neri</span>. This Court issued the writ, as prayed 
for, under bond in the amount of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is urged by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Palarca</span> that the number of copies of election returns to be 
prepared by the Board of Election Inspectors prior to 1961 were only four in 
accordance with Section 150 of the election code; that the Commission on 
Elections, in its resolution of 6 June 1961 (2 February 1961, according to 
respondent <span class="SpellE">Neri</span>), increased the number of copies from 
four to six and, in its resolution of 18 June 1962 (Resolution No. 414 of 14 
July 1963, according to respondent <span class="SpellE">Neri</span>), again 
increased the number of copies from six to seven; that the manner of preparation 
of the returns, however, remained unchanged, and, therefore, any of these 
additional three (3) copies should be understood as "another copy or other 
authentic copies of the statement x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> " for purposes of judicial recount under Section 163, 
these copies being either originals or duplicate 
originals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The lower court correctly ruled 
that the copy of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party is not one of 
those contemplated by Section 163, and rightly feared that a contrary ruling 
would set a widespread suspension of the proclamation of the results of an 
election as the copies of the statements given to the political parties .are 
susceptible of tampering to suit their partisan objectives. The judgment of the 
court below is in conformity with this Court's doctrine in <span class="SpellE">Acuña</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Golez</span>, L-25399, 
</span><st1:date month="1" day="27" year="1966"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 27, 
1966</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
wherein it was held that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Upon mature consideration of the 
pros and cons of the aforementioned question, the Court is of the considered 
opinion that the same must be decided in the negative, for the simple reason 
that, in using the aforementioned phrase the framers of the Revised Election 
Code evidently had in mind the <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">four</span></em> (4) copies mentioned in Section 
150 thereof and intended, one for the ballot box, another for the municipal 
treasurer, still another for the provincial treasurer and the last for the 
Commission on Elections. In other words, the lawmakers could not have referred 
to any other copies, for no such copies were prescribed in the 
Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Indeed, since Provincial Board 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">v.</span></em> <span class="SpellE">Barot</span>, G. R. No. L-3483 (December 16, 1949), we have 
consistently adhered to the view that Section 163 of the Revised Election Code 
should be construed <span class="SpellE">restrictlvely</span> (<span class="SpellE">Parlade</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Quicho</span>, L-16259, 
December 29, 1959; Samson v. <span class="SpellE">Estenzo</span>, L-16268, January 
30, 1960; Laws in v. <span class="SpellE">Escalona</span>, L-22540, July 31, 
1964), because of the special nature of the authority conferred therein and 
because otherwise that authority could be so used as to delay the proclamation 
of the winning candidate beyond the date set for the beginning of the term of 
the office involved. The necessity of avoiding this contingency becomes apparent 
when we consider that the effect of said delay is, in the case of national 
offices, for which there is no hold over, to leave the office without any 
incumbent, and, in the case of local offices, whose incumbents may hold over, to 
often permit the defeated candidate to unduly extend his tenure, at the expense 
of the true choice of the electorate." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">For the foregoing reasons, the 
writ is denied and the petition dismissed, <span class="GramE">The</span> writ of 
preliminary injunction issued by this Court on </span><st1:date month="12" day="16" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">16 
December 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> is hereby lifted. <span class="GramE">Costs against petitioner Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Ber</span>.</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Palarca</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
