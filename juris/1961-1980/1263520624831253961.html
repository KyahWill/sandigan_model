</span>47327 entitled "MA-AO Sugar Central Co., Inc. vs. Manila Port

<blockquote><span style="">"IN VIEW OF THE
FOREGOING, the Court renders judgment sentencing the defendants to </span>pay
jointly and severally the plaintiff the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,490.34</span>,
with legal interest thereon from the date of the filing of the complaint until
the whole amount is paid, plus the sum of P500.00 as reasonable attorney's
fees, which the Court deems just <span style="">and
equitable </span>under the circumstances of this <span style="">case, </span>and the costs of this action."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1960</st1:date>,
the UTC/Crane Co. shipped at <st1:place><st1:city>San Francisco</st1:city>, <st1:state>California</st1:state>,
 <st1:country-region>U.S.A.</st1:country-region></st1:place>, on board the S/S
President Tyler, 44 cartons of gate and globe valves of various sizes on order
of the Philippine Banking Corporation for <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Ma-<span class="SpellE">ao</span> Sugar Central Company, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only 40 of the 44 cases were unloaded from
said vessel and delivered to the Manila Port Service on <st1:date year="1960" day="25" month="6"><span style="">June 25, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, the remaining 4 having been over carried by
the vessel and later transferred to the S/S President Pierce which unloaded
them unto the custody of the same appellants mentioned heretofore on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="10" month="7"><span style="">July 10,
 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="5" month="7">July 5, 1960</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> withdrew the shipping documents covering the
44 cartons from the consignee bank and turned them over to its broker, the
Pacific Customs Brokerage Co., Inc.</p>

<p class="BODY">As notwithstanding painstaking search the goods could not <span style="">be </span>located at the piers, <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> broker filed on <st1:date year="1960" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1960</st1:date> a provisional claim with the <span style="">Manila Port Service covering all the 44
cartons of valves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1960</st1:date>,
however, 11 of the missing cartons were located and delivered to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, and on <st1:date year="1960" day="10" month="7">July
 10, 1960</st1:date>, 4 additional cartons were discharged and delivered to the
latter, leaving only 29 cartons unaccounted for.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1961</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> broker filed another claim with the Manila
Port Service for the C&amp;F value of the 33 cartons not delivered up to that
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequent­ly, this claim was
reduced to 29 cartons upon receipt of the four additional cartons mentioned
heretofore.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon appellants' failure to satisfy their claim for damages for
the missing goods, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed the present action
against them to recover their value.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' defense below was that they are not liable for any
loss or damage to the cargo in question since no claim had been filed within
fifteen days from the date of discharge of the last package of the shipment in
question, as provided for in Section 15 of the Manage­ment Contract entered
into by and between the Bureau of Customs and appellant Manila Port Service
governing the management and operation of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
service.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due trial, the court rendered the appealed judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence the present appeal which, because only
questions of law are involved, was certified to this Court by the Court of
Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' contentions in the first three assignments of errors
submitted <span style="">in </span>their brief may be
reduced to this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the provisional
claim Exhibit P filed by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span style="">is </span>not the claim for value required by
and defined in Section 15 of the Management Contract and that, at any rate, it
was not filed within the fifteen day period from the date of discharge of the
last package, as required by the afore­said contract.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find this contention
to be without merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As stated heretofore, only forty <span style="">of </span>the forty-four cartons composing the shipment were discharged
from the S/S President Tyler on <st1:date year="1960" day="24" month="6">June
 24, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <u><span style="">July 10 of the same year</span></u> four
additional cartons were discharged in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
from the <span style="">S/S </span>President
Pierce.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The computa­tion of the fifteen
day period, therefore, must start not from <st1:date year="1960" day="24" month="6">June 24, 1960</st1:date> but from <st1:date year="1960" day="11" month="7"><u><span style="">July 11, 1960</span></u></st1:date><span style=""> </span>(the day following the event).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it appears that it was on <st1:date year="1960" day="25" month="7"><u><span style="">July
 25, 1960</span></u></st1:date><span style=""> </span>that
<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> broker filed the provi­sional claim
Exhibit P, covering all the 44 cartons, the conclusion must be that the same
was filed within <span style="">the applicable legal period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the claim was entitled
"Provisional" is of no decisive significance as far as the rights of
the parties herein are concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, it had to be of that nature considering the possibility that
after its filing, other cartons </span><span style="">would
</span><span style="">be, as </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">fact they were found.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' last contention is that the lower court erred in
including shipping expenses, margin tax and other charges in determining <span style="">the </span>invoice value of the missing goods
and that, consequently, it erred in rendering judgment for <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span style="">in </span>the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,490.34</span> with legal interest <span style="">thereon, plus the </span>sum <span style="">of
P500.00 for attorney's fees and costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 15 of the Management Contract relied upon by the
appellants shows that, <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>, they are liable to
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> not only for the invoice value of the goods
they had failed to deliver to the latter but also for the total value thereof, <span style="">as </span>manifested,
and for all damages suffered by the consignee on account of their loss.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> broker had
made manifes­tation to appellants not only of the invoice value of the goods
subject of its claim but also of their total actual landed cost (Exhibit
N).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As ruled in Northern Motors vs.
Prince Lines etc., G. R. No. L-13884, the <span style="">consignee </span><span style="">has in his hands the right to hold the </span><span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator — if he so desires — responsible for the
full value of the merchandise undelivered by speci­fying such value in any of
the documents required of him to claim the merchandise from customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the Management Contract, therefore, and
under the <span style="">provisions
of Article 1173 of the New Civil Code, appellants were rightly </span>held
liable for the damages awarded to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> by the
trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision is affirmed, with costs.</p>
