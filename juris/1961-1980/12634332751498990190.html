the case was submitted for decision on <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="3">March

 7, 1979</st1:date>, when this Court issued the following resolution:</p>

<blockquote>"In L-26675 entitled, "<span class="SpellE">Pelagia</span>
V. Aguilar, et al. vs. Court of Appeals, et al. which involves questions of law
relating to <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suits filed against the
petitioners; considering that <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suits are
summary in nature so as to afford the plaintiff expeditious relief; and
considering that events may have transpired through the long lapse of time
since the suits were commenced in January, 1965, and which may have changed the
status of the litigants with respect to the disputed premises and altered their
remedial rights, the parties are required to INFORM the Court within ten (10)
days after receipt of this resolution whether or not the petition has become
moot and academic."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Counsel for petitioners responded with a Manifestation dated <st1:date year="1979" day="15" month="5">May 15, 1979</st1:date> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"PETITIONERS, through counsel, with reference to the
resolution dated May 7, 1979, a copy of which was received on May 9, 1979, to
this Honorable Court respectfully manifest that they are still occupying the
premises leased to them based on adjusted monthly rentals and, for this reason,
they accordingly consider their petition in this case already moot and
academic."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondents have not filed any manifestation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, they seek no relief other than the
dismissal of the present petition.</p>
