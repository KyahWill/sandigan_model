				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a proceeding instituted in this Court for the reconstitution of the 
decision of this Court penned by Chief Justice Manuel V. Moran and Justice 
Ricardo Paras in G. R. No. 46500 and G. R. No. 48114, entitled "Testate Estate 
of the Deceased Maria Jacoba Cruz. Lutgarda Yatco, et al. vs. Daniel F. Cruz, et 
al." and "In the Matter of the Estate of the Deceased Maria Jacoba Cruz. 
Francisco Yatco, etc., et al. vs. Adriano F. Cruz, et al." The petition was 
published (Exhibits "B" &amp; "B-1") and a commissioner was appointed by this 
Court to receive the evidence.
<p>At the hearing oppositions were presented by Teodora, Candida, Romana and 
Josefa Gana, and Eriberto, Huminado, Victor, Mario, Florencio and Monico 
Valencia represented by Delgado, Flores, Macapagal &amp; Dizon Law Offices, by 
Remedios, Adriano and Jose Cruz represented by Atty. Jimenez B. Buendia, and by 
Paz B. Laurel and Maria B. Laurel represented by Atty. M. H. de Joya. The 
evidence submitted shows that the said testate proceeding reached this Court on 
two occasions, the first in G.R. No. 46500 and the second, in G. R. No. 
48114.</p>
<p>In the first case (G. R. No. 46500), the original of the record on appeal 
(Bill of exceptions) in the Court of First Instance of Manila was presented by 
the petitioners as Exhibit "I". A simple copy of the decision of the Court of 
First Instance appealed from was also submitted in Exhibit "D" by the 
petitioners. The record on appeal bears the signature of the lawyers who 
presented the said record on appeal, the amendments thereto, as well as the 
signature of the Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch VII. The 
case having been forwarded by the Court of Appeals to this Court, it was 
registered in this Court as G. R. No. 46500 and a decision was promulgated on 
October 25, 1939. The decision was published in the "Lawyer's Journal", Vol. 
VIII, July 15, 1940, No. 13, pp. 520, 521, 522 and is penned by Justice Manuel 
V. Moran, and concurred in by Justices Avanceña, Villareal, Imperial, Diaz, 
Laurel and Concepcion (see Exhs. "E", "E-1", "E-2", "E-3" and "E-4"). Copy of 
the decision also appears in the printed Record on Appeal in G. R. No. 48114, 
Exh. "G", pp. 2-11.</p>
<p>In the above decision (civil case No. 46500) the wills Exhibits "B", "C", and 
"D" were legalized and will Exhibit "A" invalidated, so the proceedings for the 
distribution of the estate continued in the Court of First Instance of Manila. 
The proceedings appear in two printed records on appeal as G. R. No. 48114 in 
the Supreme Court and as CA-G. R. 8126 in the Court of Appeals (Exhibits "G" 
&amp;"G-1"). In the Supreme Court, to which the case was forwarded by the Court 
of Appeals, the decisions was rendered in said G. R. No. 48114 on October 5, 
1942. The petitioners for reconstitution submitted at the hearing a typewritten 
copy of the alleged decision as Exhibit "H". According to the testimony of a 
witness for the reconstitution, this copy was furnished him by Atty. Ramon 
Diokno who appears as counsel for the administratrix. The decision purports to 
have been written by Justice Paras with the concurrence of Justices Jose Yulo, 
Manuel V. Moran, Roman Ozaeta and Jorge Bocobo. This same copy, Exh. "H", has 
been certified to as a true, faithful and correct copy of the decision of the 
court by the writer of the opinion, then Justice Ricardo Paras. The 
certification is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is to certify that the attached document consisting of three pages and 
marked as Exhibit 'H' as far as I remember is a true, faithful and correct copy 
of the Decision of the Supreme Court which was penned by the undersigned on 
October 5, 1942, in G. R. No. 48114 entitled 'In the Matter of the Estate of the 
Deceased Mario Jacoba Cruz, Francisco C. Yatco, et al., Movants-Appellees, 
versus Adriano F. Cruz, et al., Oppositors-Appellants.</p>
<p>"Manila, Philippines, February 16, 1961.</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) Ricardo Paras<br>t/ RICARDO PARAS"</p></blockquote>
<p>That the decision was in fact rendered is corroborated by a copy of the 
notice of the order of decision issued by the clerk of the Court of First 
Instance of Manila, dated December 22, 1942, which was presented at the hearing 
as Exhibit "J-I".</p>
<p>There has been no question as to the authenticity of all the documents 
presented or of copies of the proceedings except as to the dacision in the said 
case No. G.R. 48114 (Exh. "H"). Objection to the decision is based on the ground 
that the period within which the reconstitution of the records of cases 
destroyed during the last war, had already expired at the time of the 
presentation of the petition for reconstitution on August 23, 1960. Republic Act 
No. 441 approved June 7, 1950 is cited in support of this objection, thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SECTION 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Act Numbered Three thousand one 
hundred and ten, the party or parties interested in any case pending in the 
court the records of which have been destroyed by reason of the last Pacific war 
may file a petition for the reconstitution of such records, * * 
*"</p></blockquote>
<p>In answer to the above objection the petitioners for reconstitution argue 
that the provisions of Republic Act No. 441 are not being availed of in the 
proceedings at bar as said Act (R.A. No. 441), as its title indicates, refers to 
pending cases, whereas the records sought to be reconsituated are records of 
cases that had already been decided.</p>
<p>Neither are the provisions of Act No. 3110 applicable in this proceedings 
because this act also governs the reconstitution of <i>pending judicial 
proceedings</i>, etc., as witness the title of the act which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"AN ACT TO PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE PROCEDURE FOR THE RECONSTITUTION OF THE 
<i>RECORDS OF PENDING JUDWIAL PROCEEDINGS</i> AND BOOKS, DOCUMENTS, AND FILES OF 
THE OFFICE OF THE REGISTER OF DEEDS, DESTROYED BY FIRE OR OTHER PUBLIC 
CALAMITIES, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES."</p></blockquote>
<p>Objection is also raised against the petition for reconstitution on the 
ground that the right on the part of the petitioners to ask for said 
reconstitution has lapsed by prescription, and the decisions with which 
reconstitution is made are not authentic, as required by Republic Act No. 411 
and Act No. 3110. It is argued in support of the objection that anyway the right 
to enforce the decisions cannot be made by execution because more than 10 years 
had elapsed from the time said decisions were promulgated.</p>
<p>But the petitioners invoke in support of the petition for reconstitution the 
inherent power of courts of justice to restore their records, as defined in 
section 5 (h) of Rule 124 of the Rules of Court. The rule is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 5. Inherent powers of courts.—Every court shall have power:</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
<p>"(<i>h</i>) To authorize a copy of a lost or destroyed pleading or other 
paper to be filed and used instead of the original, and to restore, and supply 
deficiencies in its records and proceedings."</p></blockquote>
<p>The decision of this Court in G.R. No. 46500, penned by the late Mr. Justice 
Moran, appears in an issue of the Philippine Lawyers' Journal, a legal 
publication dedicated to publishing copies of decisions directly secured from 
this Court. No valid objection has been raised against the correctness of this 
copy.</p>
<p>The objection raised against Exhibit 'H" because of its supposed lack of 
authenticity should not be sustained. We do not think it essential or necessary 
that an authentic copy be produced to reconstitute a decision of this Court 
under Rule 124, Sec. 5(h) of the Rules. Evidence which is sufficient to prove 
the contents of a lost or destroyed document in accordance with the rules of 
evidence (Rule 123, Section 51) should be sufficient. Besides, the records on 
appeal in both cases appear to be authentic, because in one case a certified 
copy of the original record existing in the Court of First Instance was 
submitted as well as a printed copy thereof, and in the other (case) a printed 
record on appeal was also submitted. Against these records on appeal no 
objection can be presented.</p>
<p>As to the objected decision in G. R. No. 48114 we are fully satisfied with 
the correctness of the simple copy which was submitted in view of the 
certification of its correctness and truthfulness by former Chief Justice 
Ricardo Paras, whose memory the present members of this Court can attest to. 
Furthermore, this decision and that penned by Justice Moran coordinate with the 
nature of the issues presented in the proceedings leading up to their rendition, 
such as the pleadings in the court of origin, and the decision of that court of 
origin appealed from. A study of the decisions in question, in relation to the 
judgments appealed from and the pleadings on which said decisions are based, 
gives us no reason to doubt that the questioned copy is correct and, if not 
authentic, is sufficiently exact to satisfy beyond doubt the reasonable scruples 
of any unprejudiced mind.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our ruling is justified by the precedent set by this Court in 
the case of Allingag vs. Del Valle-Cruz (R-G. R. No. 47766, April 13, 1959) in 
which, upon a report of the commissioner which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Acting upon the petition filed by Zoila Dayahan del Rosario, praying that 
the time to reconstitute judicial records be extended, the Court resolved that 
said petition is not necessary because courts have inherent power to 
reconstitute at any time the records of their finished cases under Rule 124, 
Section 5(h)."</p></blockquote>
<p>this Court adopted and approved a resolution couched in the folowing 
terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Considering the report of the reconstitution commissioner in RG.R. No. 47766 
(Ciriaco Allingag vs. Lucia F. de Valle-Cruz), THE COURT RESOLVED to approve 
said report and to declare duly reconstituted the decision whose copy is in this 
record."</p></blockquote>
<p>One final objection need be considered by us. This refers to the claim that 
there is no use for reconstituting the judgments because the same may no longer 
be enforced, more than 10 years having elapsed from the rendition of the 
judgments sought to be reconstituted. We refrain from passing upon this 
question, leaving the same to the appropriate time when, after the 
reconstitution of the decisions and the records, the said decisions will be 
sought to be enforced.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the oppositions to the petition for reconstitution are hereby 
overruled and the petition is granted, but reconstitution is ordered not only as 
to the decisions but as to all the other judicial records having relation 
thereto presented at the hearing, such as the original pleadings filed in the 
court of origin, the decisions of the courts therein, the records on appeal 
therefrom, and the decision of this court in such case.</p>
<p>The decisions are hereby reconstituted, with all the pleadings and papers 
above indicated. Without costs. So ordered.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., 
Barrera, Dizon, Regala, </i>and <i>Makalintal, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
