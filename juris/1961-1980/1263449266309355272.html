				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Julio Aguilar owned and operated several <span class="SpellE">jeepneys</span>
in the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> among which
was one with plate number PUJ-206-Manila, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He entered into a contract with the Capital Insurance &amp; Surety Co.,
Inc. insuring the opera­tion of his <span class="SpellE">jeepneys</span> against
accidents with third-party liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
a consequence thereof an insurance policy was executed by the Capital Insurance
&amp; Surety Co., Inc., the pertinent <span class="GramE">provisions of which in
so far as this case is concerned contains</span> the following:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>Section II - LIABILITY TO THE PUBLIC</u></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">"1. The Company, will, subject to the limits of liability,
indemnify the Insured in the event of accident caused by or arising out of the
use of the Motor Vehicle/s or in connection with the loading or unloading of
the Motor vehicle/s, against all sums including claimant's costs and expenses
which the Insured shall become legally lia­ble to pay in respect of:</p>

<p class="NUM">“<span class="GramE">a</span>. death of or bodily injury to any
person</p>

<p class="NUM">“<span class="GramE">b</span>. damage to property"</p>

<p class="BODY">During the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of such
insurance policy on February 20, 1961 <span class="SpellE">Iluminado</span> Del
Monte, one of the driv­ers of the <span class="SpellE">jeepneys</span> operated
by Aguilar, while driving along the intersection of Juan Luna and Moro streets,
City of Manila, bumped with the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
abovementioned one <span class="SpellE">Gervacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Guingon</span>
who had just alighted from another <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> and as a
consequence the latter died some days thereafter.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">A corresponding</span> information for homicide
thru reck­less imprudence was filed against <span class="SpellE">Iluminado</span>
del Monte, who pleaded guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A penalty
of four months imprisonment was imposed on him.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a corollary to such action, the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Gervacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Guingon</span> filed an action for damages praying that the
sum of P82,771.80 be paid to them jointly and severally by the defendants, driver
<span class="SpellE">Iluminado</span> del Monte, owner and operator Julio
Aguilar, and the Capital Insurance &amp; Sure­ty Co., Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For failure to answer the complaint, Del
Monte and Aguilar were declared in default.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Capital In­surance &amp; Surety Co., Inc. answered, alleging that the
plaintiff has no cause of action against it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During the trial the following facts were stipulated:</p>

<blockquote>"COURT:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court wants
to find if there is a stipulation in the policy whereby the insured is insured
against liability to third persons who are not passengers of jeeps.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"ALMARIO:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far as I
know, in my honest be­lief, there is no particularization as to the passengers,
whether the passen­gers of the jeep insured or a passenger of another jeep or
whether it is a pe­destrian.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With those,
we can submit the stipulation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SIMBULAN:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I admit
that." (<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>., p. 21, Jan. 23, 1962; p. 65 Rec.
on Appeal)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">On <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1962</st1:date>, the Court of First Instance of Manila
rendered its judgment with the following <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
por­tion:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered sen­tencing <span class="SpellE">Iluminado</span> del Monte and Julio Agui­lar jointly and
severally to pay plaintiffs the sum of P8<span class="GramE">,572.95</span> as
damages for the death of their father, plus P1,000.00 for attorney's fees plus
costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defendant Capital Insurance and Surety Co., Inc. is
hereby sentenced to pay the plaintiffs the sum of Five Thousand (P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) Pesos plus Five Hundred (P500.00) Pesos as
attorney's fees and costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These sums of
P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and P500.00 adjudged against Capital
Insurance and Surety Co., Inc. shall be applied in partial satisfaction of the
judgment rendered against <span class="SpellE">Iluminado</span> del Monte and
Julio Aguilar in this case.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The case was appealed to the Court of Appeals which appellate
court on <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1963</st1:date>
certified the case to <span class="GramE">Us</span> because the appeal raises
purely questions of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised before <span class="GramE">Us</span> in this
appeal are (1) As the company agreed to indemnify the insured Julio Agui­lar,
is it only the insured to whom it is liable? (2) Must Julio Aguilar first show
himself to be entitled to indem­nity before the insurance company may be held
liable for the same? (3) Plaintiffs not being parties to the insurance
contract, do they have a cause of action against the com­pany; and (4) Does the
fact that the insured is liable to the plaintiffs necessarily mean that the
insurer is liable to the insured?</p>

<p class="BODY">In the discussion of the points thus raised, what is paramount is
the interpretation of the insurance contract with the aim in view of attaining
the objectives for which the insurance was taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Rules of Court provide that parties may
be joined either as plaintiffs or defendants, as the right to relief in respect
to or arising out of the same transactions is alleged to exist (Sec. 6, Rule
3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The policy, on the other hand,
contains a clause stating:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin: 0in 0.3in 0.0001pt 0.5in;">"E. <u>Action <span class="GramE">Against</span>
Company</u></p>

<blockquote>No action shall lie against the Company unless, as a condition
precedent thereto, the Insured shall have fully complied with all of the terms
of this Policy, nor un­til the amount of the Insured's obligation to pay shall
have been finally determined either by judgment against the Insured af­ter
actual trial or by written agreement of the Insured, the claimant, and the
Company.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Any person or organization or the legal representative thereof who
has secured such judgment or written agreement shall there­after be entitled to
recover under this po­licy to the extent of the insurance affor­ded by the
Policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing contained in this policy
shall give any person or orga­nization any right to join the Company as a
co-defendant in any action against the Insured to determine the Insured's liabi­lity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Bankruptcy or insolvency of the Insured or of the Insured's estate
shall not relieve the Company of any of its obligations here­under."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant contends that the "no action" clause in the policy
closes the avenue to any third party which may be injured in an accident
wherein the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> of the in­sured might have been
the cause of the injury of third persons, alleging the freedom of
contracts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Will the mere fact that such
clause was agreed upon by the par­ties in an insurance policy prevail over the
Rules of Court which authorizes the joining of <span class="GramE">parties</span>
plaintiffs or defendants?</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing issues raise two principal questions:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) Can plaintiffs sue the insurer at all?
(2) If so, can plaintiffs sue the insurer <u>jointly</u> with the insured?</p>

<p class="BODY">The policy in the present case, as <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>,
is one whereby the insurer agreed to indemnify the insured "against all
sums x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> which the
Insured shall become legally <u>liable</u> to pay in respect of a death of: a.
of or bodily injury to any person x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." Clearly, therefore, it is one for indemnity
against liability;<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
from the fact then that the insured is liable to the third <span class="GramE">person,</span>
such third person is entitled to sue the insurer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The right of the person injured to sue the insurer of the party
at fault (insured), depends on whether the contract of insurance is intended to
benefit third per­sons also or only the insured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the test applied has been this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the contract provides for indemnity
against <u>liability</u> to third persons, then third <span class="GramE">persons</span>
to whom the insured is liable, can sue the insurer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the contract is for indemnity against
actual loss or pay­ment, then third persons cannot proceed against the insu­rer,
the contract being solely to reimburse the insured for liability actually
discharged by him thru payment to third persons, said third persons' recourse
being thus limited to the insured alone.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The next question is on the right of the third per­son to sue the
insurer jointly with the insured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The po­licy
requires, as afore-stated, that suit and final judg­ment be first obtained
against the insured; that only "thereafter" can the person injured
recover on the poli­cy; it expressly disallows suing the insurer as a co­-defendant
of the insured in a suit to determine the lat­ter's liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As adverted to before, the query is which
procedure to follow - that of the insurance policy or the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The "no action" clause in the policy of insurance
cannot prevail over the Rules of Court provision aimed at avoiding multiplicity
of suits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a case squarely on the
point, American Automobile Ins. Co. v. <span class="SpellE">Struwe</span>, 218 SW
534 (Texas CCA), it was held that a "no action" clause in a policy of
insurance cannot override procedural rules aimed at avoidance of multiplicity
of suits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We quote:</p>

<blockquote>"Appellants filed a plea in abatement on the grounds that the
suit had been premature­ly brought against the insurance company, and that it
had been improperly joined with <span class="SpellE">Zunker</span>, as said
insurance company, under the terms of the policy, was only liable after
judgment had been awarded against <span class="SpellE">Zunker</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"xxx That plea was properly overruled, because under the laws
of Texas a dual suit will always be avoided whenever all parties can have a
fair trial when joined in one suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>, had he so desired, could have prose­cuted his
claim to judgment as against <span class="SpellE">Zunker</span> and then have
sued on that judgment against the insurance company, but the law does not make
it imperative that he should do so, but would permit him to dispose of the
whole mat­ter in one suit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The rule has often been announced in <st1:state><st1:place>Te­xas</st1:place></st1:state>
that when two causes of action are connec­ted with each other, or grow out of
the same transaction, they may be properly joined, and in such suit all parties
against whom the plain­tiff asserts a common or an alternative lia­bility may
be joined as defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Even if appellants had
presented any plea in abate­ment as to <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of
damages arising from a tort with those arising from a contract, it could not,
under the facts of this case, be sustained, for the rule is that a suit may in­clude
an action for breach of contract and one for tort, provided they are connected
with each other or grew out of the same transac­tion."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, in the instant suit, Sec. 5 of Rule 2 on "<span class="SpellE">Joinder</span> of causes of action" and Sec. 6 of Rule 3 on
"Permissive <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of parties" cannot be
superseded, <u>at least with respect to third persons not a party to the
contract</u>, as herein, by a "no action" clause in the contract of
insurance.</p>
