				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>
and <i style="">mandamus</i>, with preliminary
injunction, filed on January 27, 1965, respondent <span class="SpellE">Macrohon</span>,
as Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, was sought to be
enjoined from continuing with the enforcement of a writ of execution issued by
another respondent, Pedro P. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>, acting as
hearing referee of the Workmen's Compensation Commission to enforce an award of
compensation for the death of a deceased employee of petitioner in favor of his
widow, the third respondent, Regina <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Espeleta</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was premised on the fact that
while petitioner presented "good and valid defenses" against such a
claim, a decision was rendered granting such compensation which was sought to
be reconsidered, but the petition for review unfortunately was not filed within
the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, a messenger of counsel for
petitioner, "due to voluminous work in following up and filing of papers
conducted with other [equally] urgent legal matters" having failed because
of alleged excusable neglect to file the same on time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner would have it that in its favor
were good and valid defenses, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"a.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the complaint was
filed out of the [two months] <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period
prescribed by Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, the same having
been filed [two years and six months] after the death of the deceased; and
b.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the nature of the disease
described as 'Cerebral Infraction due to Internal Hemorrhage caused by Hypertension'
was in no logical way connected with the nature of the work performed by the
said deceased." We issued, in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1965</st1:date>, the writ of preliminary
injunction upon petitioner posting a bond of P2,000, and ordered respondents to
answer within Ten (10) days from notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a two-page answer of respondent widow, <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Espeleta</span>, filed on
February 22, 1965, there was an admission of a decision being rendered in her
favor by a regional office of the Department of Labor coupled with a vehement
denial that such an award "was rendered in total disregard of the
defenses" set forth in the petition, the truth of the matter, according to
her, being that the claim was meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was likewise a denial of the allegations of the petition insofar
as it alleged "excusable negligence with the averment that the aforesaid
respondent "has no knowledge sufficient to form a belief as to the truth
thereof." One of her special affirmative defenses was to the effect that
the petition "is frivolous and merely intended for delay, for settled is
the rule in this jurisdiction that <i style="">certiorari</i>
is not the remedy to obtain the review of a decision which has already become
final, * * *.” It was respondent <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Espeleta's</span> prayer than
that the writ of preliminary injunction be dissolved and that "the writ of
execution be given due course to satisfy [her] just claims."</p>

<p class="BODY">The answer of respondent <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>,
likewise filed on <st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1965</st1:date>,
was much more detailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again there was
an admission of the defenses mentioned by him but a denial that said defenses
"are good and valid; on the contrary, the same was found to be
unmeritorious and ineffective; * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
There was an admission likewise that a decision was rendered by respondent in
favor of the widow <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de <span class="SpellE">Espeleta</span> and a denial that it was "in total
disregard of the defenses" of petitioner, the reason according to the
answer being that such defenses which were fully considered were found "to
be ineffective and unmeritorious;" to show which a copy of such decision
was annexed to the answer.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The rest of the answer dealt mainly with a denial of the allegation of the
petition that the failure to file the pleading for review on time could be
considered as excusable neglect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
prayer was for a dissolution of the writ of preliminary injunction and the
dismissal of the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">As above noted, the answer of respondent <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>
included a copy of his decision as acting referee granting the award in favor
of the claimant widow, respondent <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Espeleta</span>, on her own
behalf and as guardian of her minor child, the amount of P4,000.00 as death
compensation benefits, minus the sum of P100.00 previously advanced and
counsel's fee in the amount of P200.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The defense of prescription was rejected by respondent <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was his
view that with free medical and hospital assistance being extended to the
deceased, the amount of P200.00 likewise having been given to the widow for
funeral expenses plus the additional sum of P150.00 as financial help, there
was "an advance payment and recognition of the right of the claimants to
compensation benefits, and therefore, non-compliance of the provisions of said
Section 24 is condoned."</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, such decision took note of the failure to controvert
the claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Conversely, the evidence shows that the
respondent has not complied with the regular requirement to report to this
Office the death of the late <span class="SpellE">Espeleta</span> within a period
of 14 days after such death, or 10 days from knowledge or notice thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the law and as held by our Supreme
Court in the case of General Shipping Co. v. Workmen's Compensation Commission,
et al., G.R. No. L-14936, <st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="7">July 30,
 1960</st1:date>, the failure of the respondent to make the required report
constitutes a renuncia­tion of its right to controvert the claim, thereby constructively
admitting that it is compensable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having
lost its right to controvert the claim and not having reinstated it in
accordance with the procedure provided by law, the respondent cannot at this
stage set up the defense of prescription.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is implied from its having lost its right to dispute the
claim."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the memorandum for petitioner in lieu of oral argument filed
on <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1965</st1:date>, there was
an admission of its failure to controvert the claim of respondent <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Espeleta</span> but an assertion relying primarily on American
cases, citing in addition Manila Railroad Co. v. Workmen's Compensation
Commission,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
that such failure cannot in any way validate an invalid claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Such must be valid and effectual in the
first place."</p>

<p class="BODY">Such a plea is unavailing, the failure to controvert is fatal to
its defense of the claim having been filed out of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To speak of the past year alone, eight
decisions may be cited opposed to such a contention of petitioner.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
There would be no need therefore to pass on the plea that a petition for review
should be allowed as there was an excusable negligence on account of the
failure to file the same on time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For at
any rate, in view of its failure to controvert, the award must be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is worth noting that in National Development Co. v. <span class="SpellE">Ayson</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
the claimant was dismissed from employment on <st1:date year="1953" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1953</st1:date>, but it took her until <st1:date year="1961" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1961</st1:date>, or almost eight years later,
before she started to have her rights enforced under the Workmen’s Compensation
Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In National Development Co. v. <span class="SpellE">Rongavilla</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court, through Justice <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>, stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"On <st1:date year="1960" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1960</st1:date>, after almost nine (9) years from the time
she was discharged by the National Development Co., the employee, through
counsel, filed with the Regional Office No. 4 of the Department of Labor, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
a claim for disability compensation because of pulmonary tuberculosis."
Nonetheless, it was held that such failure to file on time notwithstanding,
"when it is shown that the employer has not manifested to the Workmen's
Compensation Commission his intention to controvert the right to compensation,
* * *, the Workmen's Compensation Commission can proceed to determine and
decide the claim for compensation."</p>

<p class="BODY">In Manila Railroad Co. v. Workmen's Compensation Commission,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
there was this categorical declaration from this Court, through Justice
Sanchez, that "petitioner's failure to explain lack of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
for an unreasonable length of time constitutes 'a renunciation of his right to
challenge the claim."'<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
In the latest decision of this Court, the opinion being penned by Justice
Castro, the principle is restated thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Having
failed to file its <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> on time, the
petitioner thereby waived or renounced 'by operation of law' its right to
question the validity or reasonableness of the respondent's claim for
compensation."</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> and <i style="">mandamus</i>
is denied and the writ of preliminary injunction lifted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With costs against petitioner.</p>
