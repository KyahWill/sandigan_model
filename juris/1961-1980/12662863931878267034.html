<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appeal taken by <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span> and others from 
an order issued on November 14, 1958 by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City in the Intestate Estate of the Deceased Go <span class="SpellE">Fook</span> (Special Proceedings No. 263) declaring their claim for 
unpaid rentals on a property leased to said deceased not entitled to preference 
with respect to the proceeds of the sale of movable properties found in the 
leased premises. The appealed order reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"3. Claim of <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span> et al. for unpaid 
rentals for one year. <span class="GramE">Under Art.</span> 2211 CCP, the claim 
for unpaid rentals must have been incurred by the deceased himself. It is 
admitted that up to the. death of Go <span class="SpellE">Fook</span>—rentals were 
paid—what remains unpaid are rentals that accrued when the <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span> went ahead with the lease with the approval 
of this Court, Following the strict construction of the law, this Court must 
hold that insofar as the property of Go <span class="SpellE">Fook</span> is 
concerned, the lease entered into by his <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span> cannot enjoy preference over property that 
belonged to him, so that this claim must also be denied 
preference."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is not disputed that on March 
20, 1954, Go <span class="SpellE">Fook</span> leased from the Security Investment 
Corporation, for a period of two years, renewable for another like period, at 
the option of the parties, and at a monthly rental of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, a parcel of land, with the building existing 
thereon, situated in the City of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, where the 
lessee ran a hotel business under the name of St. Francis Hotel. On July 12, 
1954, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> sold the property to <span class="GramE">appellants</span> who agreed to recognize the lease 
aforesaid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st2:date month="9" day="14" year="1954"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 14, 
1954</span></st2:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, Go 
<span class="SpellE">Fook</span> died intestate in the City of 
</span><st2:city><st2:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Baguio</span></span></st2:place></st2:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and his estate—consisting solely 
of furnishings used in the operation of the </span><st2:place><st1:sn><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">St.</span></st1:sn><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:middlename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Francis</span></st1:middlename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:sn><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Hotel</span></st1:sn></st2:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">— was placed under 
administration, with the People's Bank and Trust Co. as judicial 
administrator.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On December 20, 1954, appellants 
filed a claim against the Estate for the sum of P4<span class="GramE">,180.00</span> representing unpaid rentals on the leased premises 
for the months of August and September, 1954, plus interest. They also filed an 
action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> against the Administrator of the 
Estate in which case the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> 
City rendered judgment ordering the latter to vacate the premises and pay 
appellants the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for unpaid rentals for 
the months of October, November and December, 1954, with legal interest from 
December 25, 1954, and the further sum of P2,000.00 monthly beginning January, 
1955 until the property is vacated, plus attorney's fees and costs. By reason of 
this judgment, appellants filed an amended and supplemental claim against the 
Estate for the total sum of P14,251.70, representing unpaid rentals from August, 
1954 to January, 1955, inclusive, at the rate of P2,000.00 a month, plus 
interest, costs and attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In its order of February 26, 
1955, the probate court appointed <span class="SpellE">Liane</span> Gomez to 
replace the People's Bank &amp; Trust Co. as administrator, at the same time 
authorizing her to continue running the St. Francis Hotel for the purpose of 
paying the back and future rentals to appellants, for the period and under the 
terms and conditions set forth in the "Memorandum of Agreement of Lease", signed 
by the parties concerned and attached to said order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Despite the aforementioned order, 
on June 29, 1955 the Court disallowed appellants' claim "on the ground that 
having raised the issue of the existence of a partnership between the deceased 
Go <span class="SpellE">Fook</span> and the Pacific Exchange Corporation these 
claims should properly be brought before the surviving partner as liquidator of 
the alleged partnership." Subsequently, however, the Court reconsidered its 
ruling and allowed their claim in the sum of P14<span class="GramE">,180.00</span>. Thereafter, upon authority of the court, the movable 
properties found within the premises of the St. Francis Hotel were sold at 
public auction for the sum of P14<span class="GramE">,143.40</span>. The majority 
thereof were bought by appellants who, instead of paying cash <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, filed a bond to secure payment of the purchase 
price.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On March 2, 1956, appellants 
filed a motion asking that their claim for unpaid rents, which as of that date 
<span class="SpellE">totalled</span> P19<span class="GramE">,750.00</span>, be 
declared a preferred claim with respect to the proceeds of the sale of movables 
in the property leased, to the exclusion of other creditors, under the 
provisions of Article 2241, paragraph 12, Civil Code of the Philippines. This 
motion was denied; hence the present appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In denying appellants' claim for 
preference in relation to unpaid rentals, the lower court held that the 
provisions of Article 2241 of the New Civil Code, providing as they do for an 
exception to the general rule, must be strictly construed, and that a strict 
construction thereof requires that the preference established be applied only to 
unpaid rentals due from the deceased Go <span class="SpellE">Fook</span> 
himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We can not agree with this 
view.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the first place, the contested 
ruling would seem to read into the law something that is not there, because 
Article 2241, paragraph 12 of the New Civil Code establishes a preference in 
favor of "credits for rent for one year upon the personal property of the lessee 
existing on the immovable leased, and on the fruits of the same" without 
imposing the condition that the rent should have been incurred personally by the 
lessee—in this case, the now deceased Go <span class="SpellE">Fook</span>—and not 
by the Executor or Administrator of his Estate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the second place, even 
admitting as correct the lower court's view on the matter, its ruling can not 
stand because it is not denied that the contract of lease of April 1,1954 
between the Security Investment Corporation, as <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, and Go <span class="SpellE">Fook</span>, as lessee, 
was for a period of two years ending in the month of April 1956, and the one 
year unpaid rentals for which preference is claimed by appellants cover the 
period from February 1955 to January 1956—a period well within the term of the 
lease. Said contract of lease not having been automatically extinguished by 
reason of the death of Go <span class="SpellE">Fook</span> on September 14, 1954, 
it is clear that, in truth and in fact, the rentals for which preference is 
claimed fell due under the contract of lease entered into by him personally 
during his lifetime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the third place, the contract 
of lease entered into by the <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span>—with court 
authority—was on behalf of the Estate of the deceased Go <span class="SpellE">Fook</span>. Consequently, the rentals that fell due <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> are, for all legal purposes, the same as those 
provided for under the original contract of lease.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is our opinion, therefore, 
that the claim of appellants for unpaid rentals for one year in the total sum of 
P19,750.00 covering the period from February 1955 to January 1956, is entitled 
to the preference established by the provisions of paragraph 12, Article 2241 of 
the New Civil Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
