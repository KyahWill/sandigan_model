MUNICIPAL JUDGE PEDRO T. CRISTOBAL OF MABINI, PANGASINAN, RESPONDENT.

				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">It was a serious charge that had to be faced by respondent Pedro T.
<span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> who, as Municipal Judge of <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, was proceeded
against administratively for misconduct by virtue of a complaint instituted by
one <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Tarectecan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was accused of having acted on a complaint
for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> filed by his own son and having thereafter
issued a warrant of arrest against respondent therein, complainant <span class="SpellE">Tarectecan</span>, who as a consequence was jailed for four days
until he could furnish the bail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only
then did respondent Judge disqualify himself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That <span style="">was the finding of the
investigating judge, Gregorio A. <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>, of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was so admitted by respondent Judge at the
hearing before this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His attention
was likewise called to Administrative Order No. 248 removing from office
Municipal Judge Pedro R. <span class="SpellE">Rabago</span> of <span class="SpellE">Cagwait</span>, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> There, it was shown that respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Rabago</span> did appear in a civil </span><span style="">suit as counsel for his son-in-law, who thereafter filed three criminal
cases against the opposing parties, heard at the stage of preliminary
investigation by such respondent <span class="SpellE">Rabago</span>, although
thereafter desisting from further acting thereon in view of his relationship to
the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such administrative
order of President Ferdinand E. Marcos of </span><st1:date year="1970" day="17" month="11"><span style="">November 17, 1970</span></st1:date><span style=""> removing such respondent from office, there
is this relevant excerpt: "Evidently, respondent cannot validly plead
ignorance of the circumstances antecedent to and surrounding the filing of
these criminal cases, considering that he is the father-in-law and legal
counsel of <span class="SpellE">Nicostrato</span> <span class="SpellE">Logronio</span>
in Special Proceedings No. 49. In conducting the first stage of the preliminary
investigation and issuing warrants of arrest against the accused in Criminal
Cases Nos. 512 and 514, respondent judge was obviously actuated with improper
and vengeful motives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He used the powers
of his office not to apply the law with an <span class="GramE">even</span> hand
but to oppress the opponents of his son-in-law and former client.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent's actuations clearly show that he
is guilty of gross abuse of the powers of his office constituting serious
misconduct and that he is unfit to remain in the judicial branch of the
Government."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Respondent <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>,
however, did seek to distinguish the above administrative order by stressing
his good faith as contrasted with the alleged political harassment and
persecution that motivated the actuation of respondent <span class="SpellE">Rabago</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, no further action need be taken by this Court, as his
resignation had been accepted by the President on <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All that need further be said is that the other alleged misconduct
imputed to him, namely, the fabrication of a case of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
against complainant <span class="SpellE">Tarectecan</span>, was shown to be
without basis.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, </span>the complaint is dismissed for being
moot and academic.</p>
