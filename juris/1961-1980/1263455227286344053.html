First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, dismissing plaintiff's
complaint, with costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff, Pepsi-Cola Bottling Company of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
is a domestic corporation with offices and principal place of business in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants are the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:place></st1:city>, its City Mayor, the
members of its municipal board and its City Treasurer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff seeks to recover the sums paid by
it to the City of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> - hereinafter referred to as
the City - and collected by the latter, pursuant to its Municipal Ordinance No.
110, as amended by Municipal Ordinance No. 122, both series of 1960, which
plaintiff assails as null and void, and to prevent the en­forcement
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both parties submitted the case
for decision in the lower court upon a stipulation to the effect:</p>

<blockquote>"1. That
plaintiff's warehouse in the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:place></st1:city>
serves as a storage for its products the "Pepsi-Cola" soft drinks for
sale to customers in the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:place></st1:city>
and all the municipalities in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Agusan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These "Pepsi-Cola" soft drinks are
bottled in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and shipped to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
warehouse of plaintiff for distribution and sale in the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:place></st1:city> and all municipalities of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. That on <st1:date year="1960" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1960</st1:date>, the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:place></st1:city> enacted Ordinance No. 110
which was sub­sequently amended by Ordinance No. 122 and ef­fective <st1:date year="1960" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A copy of Ordinance No. 110, Series of 1960
and Ordinance No. 122 are incorporated herein as Exhibits "A" and
"B", res­pectively.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3. That Ordinance
No. 110 as amended, im­poses a tax on any person, association, etc., of P0.10
per case of 24 bottles of Pepsi Cola and the plaintiff paid under protest the
amount of P4,926.63 from August 16 to <st1:date year="1960" day="31" month="12">December
 31, 1960</st1:date> and the amount of P9,250.40 from January 1 to <st1:date year="1961" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1961</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4. That the
plaintiff filed the foregoing com­plaint for the recovery of the total amount
of P14,177.03 paid under protest and those that it may later on pay until the
termination of this case on the ground that Ordinance No. 110 as amended of the
City of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> is illegal, that the tax im­posed is
excessive and that it is unconstitutional.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5. That pursuant
to Ordinance No. 110 as amended, the City Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span>
City, has prepared a form to be accomplished by the plain­tiff for the
computation of the tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A cop(y) of the
form is enclosed herewith as Exhibit "C".</blockquote>

<blockquote>“6. That the
Profit and Loss Statement of the plaintiff for the period from January 1, 1961
to July 30, 1961 of its warehouse in <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> City is
incorporated herein as Exhibits "D" to "D-1" to
"D-5".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this Profit and Loss
Statement, the defendants claim that the plaintiff is not en­titled to a
depreciation of P3,052.63 but only P1,202.55 in which case the profit of
plaintiff will be increased from P1,254.44 to P3,104.52.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff differs only on the claim of
depre­ciation which the company claims to be P3,052.62.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is in
accordance with the findings of the representative of the undersigned City
Attorney who verified the records of the plaintiff.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“7. That beginning
<st1:date year="1960" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1960</st1:date>, the
price of Pepsi-Cola per case of 24 bottles was in­creased to P1.92 which price
is uniform through­out the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said increase was made due to the increase in
the production cost of its manu­facture.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“8. That the
parties reserve the right to sub­mit arguments on the constitutionality and
illegality of Ordinance No. 110, as amended of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:place></st1:city> in their respective
memoranda.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 1 of said Ordinance No. 110, as amended, states what
products are "liquors", within the purview thereof. Sec­tion 2
provides for the payment by "any agent and/or consignee" of any
dealer "engaged in selling liquors, imported or local, in the City,"
of taxes at specified rates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 3
prescribes a tax of P0.10 per case of 24 bottles of the soft drinks and carbo­nated
beverages therein named, and "all other soft drinks or carbonated
drinks." Section 3-A, defines the meaning of the term "consignee or
agent" for purposes of the ordinance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sec­tion 4 provides that said taxes "shall be paid at the end of
every calendar month." Pursuant to Section 5, the taxes "shall be
based and computed from the cargo manifest or bill of lading or any other
record showing the number of cases of soft drinks, liquors or all other soft
drinks or carbonated drinks received within the month." Sections 6, 7 and
8 specify the surcharge to be added for failure to pay the taxes within the
period pres­cribed and the penalties imposable for "deliberate and willful
refusal to pay the tax mentioned in Sections 2 and 3" or for failure
"to furnish the office of the City Treasurer a copy of the bill of lading
or cargo manifest or record of soft drinks, liquors or carbonated drinks for
sale in the City." Section 9 makes the ordinance applicable to soft
drinks, liquors or carbonated drinks "received outside" but
"sold within" the City.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 10 of the ordinance provides that the revenue derived <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> “shall be <span class="SpellE">alloted</span> as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>40% for Roads and Bridges Fund;
40% for the General Fund and 20% for the School Fund."</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff maintains that the disputed ordinance is null and void
because:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) it partakes of the nature
of an import tax; (2) it amounts to double taxation; (3) it is excessive,
oppressive and confiscatory; (4) it is highly unjust and discriminatory; and
(5) section 2 of Republic Act No. 2264, upon the authority of which it was
enacted, is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative powers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second and last objections are manifestly devoid of merit. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Indeed - independently of whether or not the
tax in question, when considered in relation to the sales tax prescribed by
Acts of Congress, amounts to double taxation, on which we need not and do not
express any opinion - double taxation, in general, is not forbidden by our
fundamental law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have not adopted, as
part thereof, the injunction against double taxation found in the Constitution
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and of some States of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Then, again, the general principle against delegation of legislative powers, in
consequence of the theory of separation of powers<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
is subject to one well-established exception, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>legislative powers may be delegated to local
governments - to which said theory does not apply<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> -
in respect of matters of local concern.</p>

<p class="BODY">The third objection is, likewise, untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tax of "P0.10 per <u>case</u> of <u>24</u>
bottles" of soft drinks or carbonated drinks - in the production and sale
of which plaintiff is engaged - or less than P0.0042 per bottle, is manifestly
too small to be excessive, oppressive, or confiscatory.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first and the fourth objections merit, however, serious
consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, it is
noteworthy that the tax prescribed in section 3 of Ordinance No. 110, as
originally ap­proved, was imposed upon dealers "engaged in selling"
soft drinks or carbonated drinks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
it would seem that the intent was then to levy a tax upon the <u>sale</u> of
said merchandise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As amended by
Ordinance No. 122, the tax is, however, imposed <u>only</u> upon "any
agent and/or consignee of any person, associa­tion, partnership, company or
corporation engaged in selling x <span class="SpellE">x</span> soft drinks or
carbonated drinks." And, pursuant to section 3-A, which was inserted by
said Ordinance No. 122:</p>

<blockquote>" x <span class="SpellE">x</span> - Definition of the Term
Consignee or Agent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- For purposes of
this Ordinance, a con­signee or agent shall mean any person, associa­tion,
partnership, company or corporation who acts in the place of another by
authority from him or one entrusted with the business of another or to whom is
consigned or shipped no less than 1,000 cases of hard liquors or soft drinks
every month for <u>resale</u>, either retail or wholesale."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As a consequence, merchants engaged in the sale of soft drinks or
carbonated drinks, are <u>not</u> subject to the tax, <u>unless they are agents
and/or consignees of another dealer,</u> who, in the very nature of things,
must be one engaged in business <u>out­side</u> the City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the tax would <u>not</u> be
applicable to such agent and/or consignee, if <u>less</u> than 1,000 cases of
soft drinks are consigned or shipped to him every month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we consider, also, that the tax
"shall be based and computed from the <u>cargo</u> <u>manifest</u> or <u>bill
of lading</u> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> showing the number of cases" -
<u>not</u> sold - but "<u>received</u>" by the taxpayer, the
intention to limit the application of the ordinance to soft drinks and
carbonated drinks brought into the City from <u>outside</u> thereof becomes
apparent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Viewed from this angle, the
tax partakes of the nature of an import duty, which is beyond defendant's
authority to impose by express provision of law.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Even, however, if the burden in question were regarded as a tax
on the sale of said beverages, it would still be invalid, as discriminatory,
and hence, <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the uniformity required by
the Constitution and the law <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, since only
sales by "agents or consignees" of <u>outside</u> dealers would be
subject to the tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sales by local
dealers, not acting for or on behalf of other merchants, <u>regardless of the
volume</u> of their sales, and <u>even if the same exceeded</u> those made by
said agents or consignees of producers or merchants established outside the
City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
would be <u>exempt</u> from the disputed tax.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the uniformity essential to the valid exercise of
the power of taxation does not require identity or equality under all
circumstances, or negate the authority to classify the objects of taxation.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The classification made in the exercise of this authority, to be valid, must,
however, be reasonable<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and this requirement is not deemed satisfied unless:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) it is based upon substantial distinctions
which make real differences; (2) these are germane to the purpose of the
legislation or ordi­nance; (3) the classification applies, not only to present
condi­tions, but, also, to future conditions substantially identical to those
of the present; and (4) the classification applies equally all those who belong
to the same class.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">These conditions are not fully met by the ordinance in question.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, if its purpose were merely to levy a burden upon the sale of soft
drinks or carbonated beverages, there is no reason why sales thereof by dealers
<u>other than agents or con­signees</u> of producers or merchants established <u>outside</u>
the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:place></st1:city>
should be exempt from the tax.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed,
and another one shall be entered annulling Ordinance No. 110, as amended by
Ordinance No. 122, and sentencing the City of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span>
