				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On September 27, 1958, plaintiff brought an action against defendant before 
the Court of First Instance of Manila to recover the sum of P6,032.02, plus 
damages and attorney's fees.
<p>On November 3, 1958, defendant filed its answer setting up certain defenses 
and a counterclaim. It averred that while it admits that plaintiff is entitled 
to the sum of P5,250.12 for which it prepared a check in his behalf, however, 
plaintiff submitted an accounting of his cash collections between July 28, 1958 
and August 1, 1958 showing that he had in his possession the amount of 
P74,298.80 which he has so far failed to turn over to defendant, for which 
reason, defendant claims, plaintiff has no cause of action.</p>
<p>In view of the admission of defendant that it owes plaintiff the sum of 
P5,250.12 which it was ready to turn over to him any moment, the latter filed a 
motion for judgment on the pleadings praying that defendant be ordered to pay 
him said amount of P5,250.12. Defendant objected to the motion contending that a 
judgment on the pleadings is not proper when the answer tenders a genuine issue 
which is controvertible in nature, but overruling thia objection, the court 
rendered judgment ordering defendant to pay plaintiff the sura of P5,250.12 
without costs.</p>
<p>Defendant now comes on appeal raising as main issue that the trial court 
erred in rendering judgment on the pleadings notwithstanding that the material 
allegations of the complaint are disputed in the answer of defendant.</p>
<p>There is merit in this appeal. Under our rule, "where an answer fails to 
tender an issue or otherwise admits the material allegations of the adverse 
party's pleading, the court may, on motion of that party, direct judgment on 
such pleading, except in actions for annulment of marriage or divorce wherein 
the material facts alleged in the complaint should always be proven." (Section 
10, Rule 35)<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> but where defendant's 
answer tender an issue judgment on the pleadings cannot be rendered.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> Specifically, this Court held that judgment 
on the pleadings can only be rendered when the pleading of the party against 
whom the motion is directed, be he plaintiff or defendant, does not tender any 
issue, or admits all the material allegations of the pleading of the movant. 
Otherwise, judgment on the pleadings cannot be rendered.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[3]</sup></span></p>
<p>In the case at bar, there is no occasion for rendering such judgment 
considering that defendant tenders an issue which cannot be brushed aside 
without presentation of evidence. An examination of the complaint will disclose 
that plaintiff seeks to collect the sum of P6,032.02 which it is claimed, 
defendant refused to pay in spite of repeated demands. This allegation, it is 
true, is admitted in the answer, but the admission is qualified. Defendant 
stated that plaintiff rendered an accounting of his cash collections showing 
that he had in his possession the sum of P74,298.18 which he has failed to 
deliver to defendant, and that unless this matter is clarified plaintiff has no 
cause of action against defendant. Verily, this is an issue which cannot be 
brushed aside. It can only be threshed out upon presentation of appropriate 
evidence, or when the case is decided on the merits.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed. The case is remanded to 
the lower court for further proceedings. No costs.</p><i>Bengzon, Acting, C.J., 
Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera,</i> and <i>Dizon,
