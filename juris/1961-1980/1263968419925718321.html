<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Pursuant to a Management 
Agreement entered into by and between the Bureau of Customs and the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Terminal Co., Inc., 
on </span><st1:date month="6" day="24" year="1957"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 24<span class="GramE">,</span> 1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, after a public bidding the

including transit import cargoes. The salient features of the Management 
Agreement, pertinent to the case under consideration, are: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"This agreement, made and entered 
into this 24th day of June, 1957, in the City of Manila, by and between the 
Bureau of Customs, in the exercise of the powers conferred upon it by Act No. 
3002, as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 285 and Republic Act No. 140, 
hereinafter called the <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">BUREAU</span></em>, and the <span class="SpellE">Visayan-Cebu</span> Terminal Company, Inc., a corporation duly 
organized and existing by virtue of and under the laws of the Republic of the 
Philippines, with principal office in the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, Philippines, and represented in this transaction by 
its President duly authorized and empowered to legally bind the corporation 
hereinafter called the <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">CONTRACTOR</span></em>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">* * * * * * 
*<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">2. During the period while this 
agreement remains in force and effective, the CONTRACTOR shall be, and the 
BUREAU does hereby appoint the CONTRACTOR, sole manager of the <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service at the Port of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, * * *, subject always, however, to the terms, 
conditions, restrictions, subjections, supervisions and provisions in this 
agreement contained, * * *.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">23. It is further understood and 
agreed that in consideration of the rights and privileges granted the CONTRACTOR 
for the management of the <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service, the Bureau 
shall receive twenty-eight per centum (28%) of the total monthly <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">gross</span></em> <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">income</span></em> derived from whatever source in 
connection with the operation of the <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service, 
payable monthly within ten (10) days of the succeeding

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On November 26,1958, <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacareza</span> of the Bureau 
of Internal Revenue, Manila, demanded of the Company the payment of P121,919.45, 
due the government, covering percentage taxes and penalties, for the period from 
August 24, 1956 to October 31, 1958. The company, on </span><st1:date month="12" day="18" year="1958"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 18, 
1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
replied that it was not liable for the 3%, percentage tax demanded. Thereafter, 
the books of the company (petitioner herein) were examined by two Internal 
Revenue Examiners (<span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> and Fuentes) who were 
introduced to the company by Andres <span class="SpellE">Relampagos</span>, <span class="GramE">then</span> Provincial Revenue Officer of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, in a formal letter dated </span><st1:date month="3" day="24" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 
24, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
The two examiners, on April 7, 1959, issued a certificate that they had gone 
over the books of the company and made a memorandum to the Provincial Revenue 
Officer, stating that the petitioner was not "subject to the 3% percentage tax 
contemplated in Section 191 in relation to 182, both of the National Internal 
Revenue Code, as amended, because they are paying 28% straight based on their 
gross receipts as per contract entered into and by the Bureau of Customs, hence 
no assessment could be made‚Äù. <span class="SpellE">Inspite</span> of the 
Memorandum, the Deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue, <span class="SpellE">Melecio</span> Domingo, wrote the petitioner, advising that it was 
liable to the government in the total sum of P73<span class="GramE">,072.17</span>, as percentage taxes and surcharges. After a series 
of communications, the liability of the petitioner was computed at P56<span class="GramE">,202.97</span>, including P4,000.00 as compromise penalty, which was 
finally reduced to P52,172.97. The compromise penalty was also reduced from 
P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to P500.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Not satisfied with the 
assessment, the petitioner appealed the case to the Court of Tax Appeals, which 
rendered judgment, the pertinent portions of which read: "Having found 
petitioner to be within the ambit of Section 191 of the Tax Code, it follows 
that it is liable for the payment of the percentage tax provided <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In the alternative, petitioner 
contends that since the 28% of gross receipts goes to the Bureau of Customs as 
its share, the same should not be included in computing the 3% percentage 
tax.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"We agree to this contention. The 
total amount of cash received by petitioner an its earnings from the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operation without including any amount of money 
that did not go to its funds as its property should be deemed its gross 
receipts, liable to the payment of the percentage tax. Indeed, gross receipts 
should not include any money that has been especially earmarked for some other 
person (Commissioner vs. Manila Jockey Club, Inc., 108 Phil., 821). And the 
government could not have intended to consider as gross receipt the 28% that 
went to one of its institutions, the Bureau of Customs, and thereby collect 
percentage tax on it from petitioner. To hold petitioner liable for the payment 
of percentage tax is unquestionably unjust and not contemplated by Section 191 
of the Tax Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"WHEREFORE, the decision appealed 
from is hereby modified in the cense that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Terminal Co., Inc., 
is ordered to pay the Commissioner of Internal Revenue the sum of r41.416.38, as 
unpaid percentage tax and 25% surcharge. <span class="GramE">Without special 
pronouncement as to costs."</span><o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The above judgment is now before 
<span class="GramE">Us</span>, on appeal by both parties. Petitioner claims that 
the same is "contrary to law because it completely disregards the fact that the 
subject company is merely acting as the Manager of the Bureau of Customs, which 
entity is the one really subject to tax, if the said tax is to be imposed", and 
prays a reversal of such judgment. Upon the other hand, the Commissioner alleges 
that the CTA erred in exempting the corporation from paying percentage tax on 
the 28% delivered to the Bureau of Customs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It would seem that in the appeal 
of <span class="GramE">petitioner company</span> the only issue raised for 
determination is whether or not petitioner is liable for the payment of the 3% 
percentage tax as provided for in Section 191 of the National Internal Revenue 
Code. The said section provides: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Percentage tax 
on road, building, irrigation, artesian well, waterworks and other construction 
work contractors, or proprietors or operators of dockyards, and 
others.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> Road, 
building, irrigation, artesian well, waterworks, and other construction work 
contractors; <span class="SpellE"><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">arrastre</span></em></span><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> contractors</span></em>; * * *, shall pay a tax 
equivalent to <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">three per centum of their 
grow receipts</span></em>."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Admittedly petitioner, as found 
by the Court of Tax Appeals, is an <span class="SpellE"><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">arrastre</span></em></span><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> contractor</span></em>, under the reproduced 
section of the Tax Code. The nature of the work undertaken by petitioner is more 
than sufficient to show that it is an <span class="SpellE"><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">arrastre</span></em></span><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> contractor</span></em>, which renders service 
covering the handling of cargoes at piers and wharves (<span class="SpellE">Sadaya</span> <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. Coll. of Int. Rev., 99 Phil. 297.) 
It will also be noted that in the very Management Agreement, petitioner has been 
categorically referred to as CONTRACTOR. Being a contractor, the petitioner is 
subject to the percentage tax.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The contention that it being 
merely the manager of the Bureau of Customs, it should not be subject to <span class="GramE">tax,</span> is farfetched. <span class="GramE">The mere fact that it 
pays the Bureau of Customs 28%; of its gross receipts, does not detract from its 
character as Contractor.</span> If the Bureau of Customs is the principal of 
petitioner, there is no sense in giving said Bureau 28% of the gross receipts 
only, and petitioner, the agent 72%. It has been likewise argued that inasmuch 
as petitioner handles only imported cargo in its <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operations, pursuant to Republic Act No. 140, it 
should be exempted from the percentage tax, reasoning out that only those 
handling <span class="SpellE">interisland</span> cargo are liable. For one thing, 
section 191 of the Tax Code does not establish any <span class="GramE">distinction,</span> moreover it is a well settled rule that he who 
claims exemption should prove by convincing proofs that he is exempted. 
Petitioner utterly failed to present such proofs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The argument of the petitioner, 
to the effect that it should not be made to pay the percentage tax at all, 
because agents of the Internal Revenue have categorically stated in a memorandum 
that it is not liable, is without legal basis. The agents did not have the power 
to make such pronouncements, and even if they were so authorized, their 
recommendations are always subject to the review of their superiors, who may 
countermand or affirm them. The government is never <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> to collect legitimate taxes because of the error 
committed by its agents (<span class="SpellE">Genato</span> Commercial Corp. 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. CTA, et al., 104 Phil. 
615.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Commissioner of Internal 
Revenue, on his part, contends that the 28% received by the Bureau of Customs 
constitutes "a business expense of the respondent, which is not deductible from 
the latter's gross receipts for purposes of the 3% tax imposed by Section 191 of 
the Tax Code." In exempting the petitioner from the payment of 3% tax on the 28% 
given to the Bureau of Customs, the CTA cited the case of Manila Jockey Club 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. Collector, <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">supra</span></em>, wherein this court, among 
others, has said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Needless to say, gross receipts 
of the proprietor of the amusement place should not include any money which 
although delivered to the amusement place has been especially earmarked by law 
or regulation for some person other than the 
proprietor."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Commissioner, however, 
postulates that the above ruling is not applicable to the instant case, for 
there is no law or regulation which specifically earmarks 28% of the total 
monthly gross receipts derived from the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> 
service in question, for the Bureau of Customs. Republic Act No. 140, amending 
Act No. 3002 and Comm. Act No. 285, under which the management agreement was 
entered into does not so provide. Withal, it is not disputed that said amount 
had been given to the Bureau of Customs under the authority of par. 23 of the 
Management Contract, heretofore reproduced, which can be lawfully construed as 
"regulation." As the learned trial Court has aptly observed: "* * * the 
government could not have intended to consider as gross receipts the 28% that 
went to one of its institutions, the Bureau of Customs, and there-by collect 
percentage tax on it from petitioner. To hold petitioner liable for the payment 
of percentage tax is unquestionably unjust and not contemplated by Section 191 
of the Tax Code." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">PREMISES 
CONSIDERED</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
the decision appealed from should be, as it is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>, in all 
respects. No special pronouncement as to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Bengzon</span></em></span><em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, C. J., Bautista Angelo, Reyes,
