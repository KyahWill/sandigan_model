				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The rather unique feature about this case was that a couple, now
appellants Vicente C. <span class="SpellE">Villamala</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gaudiosa</span> <span class="SpellE">Villamala</span>, were jointly
prosecuted for the crime of rape allegedly perpetrated on the complainant <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> <span class="SpellE">Bentulan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were found guilty by the lower court and
each of them sentenced to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span><u>,</u>
with the accessory penalties provided for by law and with the pecuniary
liability in the sum of P12,000.00 imposed by way of indemnification to the
offended party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was her clear-cut and
straightforward testimony as to the commission of such crime reinforced by four
other witnesses, one of whom was her son, that led to the finding of
guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reversal is sought on this
appeal, the assignment of errors amounting to no more than an attack on the
credibility of the evidence offered by the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What further weakens any persuasive force of
this attempt at reversal is the weakness of the defense of alibi, the
allegation being limited to the two appellants having stayed in their house on
the night in question when admittedly their residence was only a few meters
away from the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor
was that the only weakness of such an attempt at freeing themselves from
liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were identified as
having been at the actual scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> is thus called for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony on which the finding of guilt was based did show
that on the evening of November 5, 1974, complainant <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bentulan</span> was with her three children in their house
in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Nangka</span>, <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>, her husband being away
as he was a fisherman.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
About ten that night, she heard appellant <span class="SpellE">Gaudiosa</span> <span class="SpellE">Villamala</span> calling her by her nickname <u>King</u>,
whereupon she stood up and opened the door to enable her visitor to enter.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
That the latter did, at the same time asking where her husband was; she was
informed that he was away.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
While the two seated side by side were conversing, complainant heard <span class="SpellE">Gaudiosa</span> whistle, and immediately thereafter, her husband,
appellant Vicente <span class="SpellE">Villamala</span> entered the house.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
No sooner was he inside when <span class="SpellE">Gaudiosa</span>, who was at <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia's</span> left side, placed her left arm around her neck
and pinned the latter to the floor, the left leg of appellant being thrust
between <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia's</span> knees.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
In that situation with <span class="SpellE">Gaudiosa</span> choking her neck, she
was unable to extricate herself, being held fast by the bigger and taller <span class="SpellE">Gaudiosa</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Vicente in turn took advantage of the situation and through force removed
complainant's black skirt and panties.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Such torn garments appellant Vicente <span class="SpellE">Villamala</span> threw
aside, removed his short pants, and placed himself on top of <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus he was able to consummate the sexual act,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
with <span class="SpellE">Gaudiosa</span> continuing to hold and pin to the floor
the victim's neck and left leg.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
While <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> was thus being sexually assaulted,
both appellants told her in a low voice not to worry because she would be
financially assisted, the needs of her children being attended to, and perfumes
and dresses supplied her.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The two appellants continued to appease the victim telling the latter not to
worry; they then left the victim who was in tears the whole evening.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
When her husband, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Bentulan</span> arrived at <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1974" day="6" month="11">November 6, 1974</st1:date>, she immediately
reported her being ravished by the appellants.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The enraged husband, with a scythe in his hands, was about to jump from the
window to go after the appellants and avenge his honor, but she held him back
and advised him against taking the law into his own hands, mostly for the
reason that if he did what he intended to do, she and the children would suffer
as he would have to go to jail.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Instead, that same day, the spouses still weighed down by the shame and stigma
resulting from the deed, resolved to go back to <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span>
where they had tilled a farm before they came to <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon arriving in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, they informed a cousin of
hers, <span class="SpellE">Pedring</span> <span class="SpellE">Degamo</span>, of
their decision to go back to <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span>; the latter
persuaded them to file instead a case against the appellants.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
The following day, the <span class="SpellE">Bentulan</span> spouses went to the Philippine
Constabulary Headquarters at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Gorordo</span>
  Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and lodged their complaint for rape.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
As noted earlier, complainant's son, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Bentulan</span>,
Jr., who was seven years old when he testified and who had to stop going to
school because of her fear that appellants might kidnap him to prevent him from
being a witness, corroborated the narration of the mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was in a position to do so, as on the
night of the occurrence, along with his younger brother <span class="SpellE">Ronilo</span>
and the youngest child in the family, <span class="SpellE">Lilibeth</span>, he
was asleep in the same room.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
He was awakened by the voice created by what was being done to his mother.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
He noticed his mother "wriggling," appellant Vicente <span class="SpellE">Villamala</span>, "on top" of her, and appellant <span class="SpellE">Gaudiosa</span> <span class="SpellE">Villamala</span> "choking
[his] mother." <a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Due to the latter fact, the latter "was not able to shout" but
"she was only able to moan."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
There was confirmation of the latter fact from another witness, Agustin <span class="SpellE">Dumaguit</span>, who at about that time was passing by the house
of the <span class="SpellE">Bentulan</span> and who testified that he heard a
moaning sound, the word used in the <span class="SpellE">Cebuano</span> dialect
being <span class="SpellE"><u>nagkanguhal</u></span><u>.</u><a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
When asked by the lower court what is its meaning, his answer was: "It
means the voice of a person who is choked on the neck."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
He was able to identify the sound as coming from complainant, as she and her
husband were good friends, their houses being less than a hundred meters away.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Then, later, he saw both the appellants leaving the house.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
He could identify them as the distance between them was only "three meters,
more or less."<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the above evidence, but with a thorough analysis
of what was testified to by the witnesses for the defense, Judge Juan Y. Reyes
in a comprehensive decision of twenty-five pages<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
found the accused, now the appellants, guilty "beyond doubt of the crime
of rape" and sentenced them according to law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The brief filed on their behalf hardly caused
a dent in the well-reasoned opinion of the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not help their cause at all when their
counsel limited his efforts to twelve pages, with the facts being hardly
discussed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, he laid emphasis on
legal doctrines, which, unfortunately for them, do not fit the situation, as
revealed by the competent evidence of record.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, with the stress being on the alleged lack of credibility of
what was testified to by the prosecution and with reiteration of the defense of
alibi, the lack of persuasiveness of such brief becomes even more
apparent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attempt at reversal is
doomed to futility.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The glaring weakness of the brief for appellants, outside of
its brevity, is that it manifests less than full awareness of the principle
invariably followed by this Tribunal that on the question of the credence to
which the conflicting versions of prosecution and defense are entitled, the
answer given by the trial court is generally viewed as correct and thus
entitled to <span style="">the highest respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a principle was reiterated in a recent
decision, People v. <span class="SpellE">Cudalina</span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the prosecution likewise being for
rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "Moreover, counsel
ought to have realized that such an approach has to hurdle the obstacle arising
from the well-settled doctrine that the greatest weight is accorded the
conclusion reached by the lower court on the question of credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unless it could be shown that it has not duly
taken into consideration matters of significance bearing materially on the
outcome, its determination is to be left undisturbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In People v. Manos, this Court stated the
following: 'At any rate, the lower court is vested with considerable discretion
in determining which of the conflicting versions is to be lent credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is said in People v. <span class="SpellE">Gumahin</span>
finds application in the present case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus: “The findings of the lower court embodied in a well-written
decision cannot only stand the test of the most rigid scrutiny but also has in
its favor the well-settled principle that as far as credibility is concerned,
the findings of the lower court which had the opportunity to see, hear and
observe the witnesses testify and to weigh their testimonies will be accorded
the highest degree of respect by this Tribunal." People v. <span class="SpellE">Tila</span>-on and People v. <span class="SpellE">Lumayag</span>
were cited in support of the <span class="SpellE">Gumahin</span> opinion.' This
also from People v. <span class="SpellE">Angcap</span>: 'There is need to stress
anew that this Court has long been committed to the principle that the
determination by a trial judge who would weigh and appraise the testimony as to
the facts duly proved is entitled to the highest respect, unless it could be
shown that he ignored or disregarded circumstances of weight or influence
sufficient to call for a different finding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So it was announced by Justice Moreland in 1915 in the first case of
consequence enunciating such a doctrine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As he pointed out, in the event of a conflict in the testimony of the
witness, "the peculiar province of the trial court is to resolve the
question of credibility, and, unless there is something in the record of
impeaching by fair interpretation the resolution of the trial court in relation
to that question, this court will assume that he acted fairly, justly, and
legally in the exercise of that function.'"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> After People v. <span class="SpellE">Cudalina</span>,
such a principle was again reiterated in four subsequent decisions.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2. Why should not the lower court believe complainant?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her narration of what transpired was
characterized by simplicity and veracity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It yields <span style="">the impression of a
witness revealing the grim ordeal to which she was subjected and finding it
difficult but quite necessary to face her tormentors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At one stage, she broke down and cried.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Then she was subjected to an intensive
cross-examination by counsel for appellants with many embarrassing questions
directed at her.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It was all in vain, as she stood firm; her
answers merely confirmed the fact that one of the gravest offenses was committed
against her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The emotional stress she
was laboring under was quite evident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
cannot be doubted that if she were not thus sexually assaulted, she would not
have been bold and brazen enough to accuse not only the man but also the wife
as it could have aroused misgivings as to the truth of what was narrated by
her, until it was made clear that the appellants were engaged in the trade of
supplying girls to a house of prostitution and the wife was quite reconciled to
the practice followed by her spouse of sampling prospective merchandise, as it
were, even without their consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
unbelievable that she could have entertained the thought of imputing to them
such a heinous offense if there were no basis for it, considering that they
were her <span class="SpellE"><u>compadre</u></span> and <span class="SpellE"><u>comadre</u></span><u>,</u>
she having stood as sponsor to one of their children.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It cannot be forgotten that the crime for
which they were indicted carries with it the most severe penalty.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There was corroboration of her story from her son, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Bentulan</span>, Jr., only seven years of age at the time he
testified, perhaps not even fully conscious of the enormity of the misdeed
inflicted on her mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was quite
calm on the stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not exaggerate
at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The effect, of course, was to
inspire greater credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is this
the only instance in the annals of our jurisprudence that a child of tender
years has been so fortuitously situated as to be thereafter the bane of the
malefactors in view of what was seen by him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In People v. <span class="SpellE">Zapatero</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a> this
Court, through Justice <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, categorically
affirmed: "The testimony of a seven-year old girl and that of an
eight-year old boy was admitted in certain cases * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3. Nor does it lend any persuasive tone to the brief for
appellants when the defense relied upon is alibi, to which three sentences were
devoted in less than half a page.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor
could counsel be blamed as the sole reliance for this attempt at exculpation
was that <span style="">appellants "firmly
testified that they were in their house during the whole evening of </span><st1:date year="1974" day="5" month="11"><span style="">November
 5, 1974</span></st1:date><span style=""> * * *."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Such a bare allegation merely compounded the
inherent weakness of their case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
cannot stand the test of even the slightest scrutiny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their houses were not far from each other,
they being neighbors.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> How easy it was then for appellants to go to
complainant's residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more,
there was positive identification of their presence therein, from her, her son,
an eyewitness to the offense, and from the first witness for the prosecution,
another neighbor, Agustin Dum<span class="SpellE">aguit</span>, who explicitly
affirmed on the witness stand that appellants were precisely "the ones who
came out from the house of Vicente <span class="SpellE">Bentulan</span>," he
having seen them "clearly because of the light of the lamp."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> An excerpt from <span class="SpellE">Cudalina</span>
is again relevant: "It suffices to state that this Court when confronted
with the defense of alibi in rape cases has invariably found it unconvincing
and unsatisfactory."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Reference may likewise be made to the later
