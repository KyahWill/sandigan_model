<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is a petition filed by the 
<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Portland Cement Company (CEPOC) for review of the 
decision of the Court of Tax Appeals (in CTA Case No. 708) denying its claim 
against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for refund of the sum of 
P476,208.50, representing alleged overpayments of <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></span></em> 
taxes for the period of from January 1, 1957 to June 30, 1959, on the ground 
that said court erred in upholding the assessment and collection thereof based 
on the selling price of the cement petitioner produced and not on the value of 
the limestone and shale it quarried and used in the production of the 
cement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">There is no controversy as to the 
fact that for the period of from April 16, 1957 to July 20, 1959, for the cement 
it produced and sold, petitioner was assessed and paid <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></span></em> 
taxes in the total sum of P502,975.28; that its demand for refund of alleged 
overpayment having been denied, petitioner filed on October 15, 1959, a 
corresponding petition in the Court of Tax Appeals against the respondent 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue; and that after due hearing, the Court of Tax 
Appeals rendered a decision on June 21, 1961, declaring the collection of the 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></span></em> tax based on the selling price of cement 
to have been made in accordance with Section 243 in relation to Section 246 of 
the National Internal Revenue Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the municipality and ten per <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">centum</span></em> to the province where the mines 
are situated, and eighty per centum to the National 
Treasury."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Herein petitioner contends that 
the collectible <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></span></em> tax should be based on the actual market 
value of the quarried minerals that were used in the production of cement; 
whereas, respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue maintains that, as the 
cement produced by petitioner consists of 80% minerals, the same is a mineral 
product pursuant to the definition given in Section 246 of the Tax Code, and the 
ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span> tax should be based on its selling 
price.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is noteworthy that under 
Section 242 of the same Code, with respect to leased mineral lands, the lessee 
shall pay to the government, not only rentals for the use of the land, but also 
royalty, on the minerals extracted <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>. These 
imposts are levied "for the privilege of exploring, developing mining, 
extracting and disposing of the minerals" from said land. With respect to 
mineral lands not under lease. Section 243 governs, and imposes <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></span></em> 
tax on the actual market value of the gross output of the minerals or mineral 
products extracted <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>. Both sections 242 and 
243 are under Title VI of the Tax Code which refers to Mining Taxes. As under 
Section 242, the rentals and royalties collectible from the lessees and 
concessionaires of the leased lands are for the privilege of mining and 
extracting minerals <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, so it may be said that 
the <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></span></em> tax imposed by Section 243 upon those 
extracting minerals and mineral products from lands not under lease, is also for 
the same purpose, i.e., the privilege of mining and extracting minerals from 
said lands. In other words, <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></span></em> tax is a tax not on the minerals, but 
upon the privilege of severing or extracting the same from the earth, the 
government's right to exact the said impost springing from the <span class="SpellE">Regalian</span> theory of State ownership of its natural 
resources.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">There can be no question that 
quarried minerals have their own market value. The dispute here arose, however, 
from the construction given to the term mineral products, which was defined in 
Section 246 of the Tax Code, as "things produced by the lessee, concessionaire, 
or owner of mineral lands, at least eighty <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">per cent</span></em> of which things must be 
minerals extracted by such lessee, concessionaire or owner of mineral lands." 
Respondent argues that since the <span class="SpellE">portland</span> cement 
produced by <span class="GramE">petitioner<sup><span style="color: red;">[</span></sup></span><sup><span style="color: red;">2]</span></sup> consists of 80% minerals quarried from its 
mines, such cement falls within the definition of a mineral product and the 
imposable <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></span></em> tax should be based on its selling Price 
which is its actual market value.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This line of argument suffers 
from two infirmities: First, while cement is composed of 80% minerals, it is not 
merely an admixture or blending of raw materials, as lime, silica, shale and 
others. It is the result of a definite process-the crushing of minerals, 
grinding, mixing, <span class="SpellE">calcinging</span>, cooling, adding of <span class="SpellE">retarder</span> or raw gypsum. In short, before cement reaches its 
saleable form, the minerals had already undergone a chemical change through 
<span class="GramE">Manufacturing</span> process. This could not have been the 
state of "mineral products" that the law contemplates for purposes of imposing 
the <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></span></em> tax. It must be remembered that, as 
<span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, this tax is imposed on the privilege of 
extracting or severing the minerals from the mines. To our minds, therefore, the 
inclusion of the term mineral products is intended to comprehend cases where the 
mined or quarried elements may not be usable in its original state without 
application of simple treatments, such as washing, or cutting them into sizes, 
which process does not necessarily involve the change or transformation of the 
raw materials into a composite, distinct product. Secondly, respondent cannot 
use the selling price of the product in this case as gauge of its actual market 
value. The cement here is manufactured by petitioner itself out of materials 
quarried from its mines. While the selling price of cement may reflect the 
actual market value of cement, said selling price cannot be taken as the market 
value also of the minerals composing the cement. And it was not the cement that 
was mined, only the minerals composing the finished 
product.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Anent respondent's contention, 
however, that the taxes collected and paid two years before the filing of the 
action in the Court of Tax Appeals are barred by prescription, the same must be 
sustained. By specific provision of Section 308 of the Internal Revenue Code, 
action for recovery of tax payments erroneously or illegally collected must be 
filed within 2 years from such payments. As the action in this case was 
instituted only on </span><st1:date month="10" day="16" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 16 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">,

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision of the Court of 
Tax Appeals under review is hereby modified, by holding petitioner entitled to 
the refund of the corresponding overpayments of <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></span></em> 
taxes made after </span><st1:date month="10" day="15" year="1957"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 15,

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner-appellant Commissioner 
of Internal Revenue has sought reconsideration of our main decision in the above 
entitled case, claiming that this Court has <span class="SpellE">miscontrued</span> the issues involved in this case, and that 
instead of resolving what is the market value upon which should be based the 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></span></em> tax imposed by section 246 of the 
Internal Revenue Code, as said section was amended by Republic Act 1299, in 
force since June 16, 1955, this Court decided the case "on an issue that was not 
raised by them" by ruling "that cement is not a mineral product but a 
manufactured product, and as such it is not subject to the <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></span></em> 
tax" (Motion for Reconsideration, p. 6). The appellant Commissioner therefore 
prays that this Court declare:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(1) That cement is a mineral 
product subject to 1-1/2 % ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span> tax based on its 
selling price; or<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(2) In the alternative, that the 
sales of cement by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Portland Cement Company are subject to sales tax of 
7%.<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The reconsideration must be 
denied. The appellant Commissioner of Internal Revenue has plainly misconstrued 
the language and import of our main decision. We there stated the issue to be as 
follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Herein <span class="GramE">petitioner<sup><span style="color: red;">[</span></sup></span><sup><span style="color: red;">1]</span></sup> contends that the collectible ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span> tax should be based on the actual market value of 
the quarried minerals that were used in the production of cement; whereas, 
respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue maintains that, as the cement 
produced by petitioner consists of minerals, the same is a mineral product 
pursuant to the definition given in Section 246 of the tax Code and the ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span> tax should be based on its selling 
price."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">And we sustained the position of 
the cement company, i.e., that the <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ad 
<span class="SpellE">valorem</span></span></em> tax in question should be based on 
the actual market value of the <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">quarried 
minerals</span></em> used in producing cement, reasoning that cement (as 
distinguished from the original minerals used to produce it) is the result of a 
process, and that the same "could not have been the <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">state</span></em> of mineral products contemplated 
by the law" for the purpose of imposing the <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></span></em> 
tax. The necessary corollary of this pronouncement is that the law intended to 
impose the <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></span></em> tax upon the market value of the 
component mineral products in their <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">original state</span></em> before <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">processing</span></em> into cement. For it can not 
be overlooked that the law does not impose a tax on <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">cement qua cement</span></em>, but on mineral 
products, at least 80% of which must be minerals extracted by the lessee, 
concessionaire or owner of mineral lands. Both parties concede that cement is 
made up of 80% or more of minerals thus extracted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Court did not, and could 
<span class="GramE">not,</span> rule that cement is a manufactured product subject 
to sales tax, for the reason that such liability had never been litigated by the 
parties. What it did declare is that, while cement is a mineral product, it is 
no longer in the state or condition contemplated by the law; hence the market 
value of the cement could not be the basis for computing the <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></span></em> 
tax, since the <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></span></em> tax is a severance tax, <span class="SpellE">i</span>. e., a charge upon the privilege of severing or extracting 
minerals from the earth, (Dec. p. 4) and is due and payable <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">upon removal</span></em> of the mineral product 
from its bed or mine (Tax Code s. 245). So that the tax is to be computed on the 
basis of the market value of the mineral in its condition at the time of such 
removal and before its being substantially changed by chemical or manufacturing 
(as distinguished from purely physical) processing. Whatever mention was made in 
the decision of such process undergone by the component minerals of cement, was 
made solely and exclusively to emphasize the changed in the condition of the 
minerals, from the primitive state contemplated by the taxing statute. This is 
clear from the text of the decision (pp. 1-5) where <span class="SpellE">we.stated</span>: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
