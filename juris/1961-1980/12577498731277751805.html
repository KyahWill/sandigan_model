				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On September 9, 1959, Ruben L. Valero and Estrella L. de Valero
applied with the Public Service Commission for a certificate of public
convenience to install and operate an ice plant with a daily productive
capacity of 5 tons in Olongapo, Zambales, proposing to sell the produce
thereof in the same,place (Case No. 127392). Thereafter, the
application was set for hearing, and applicants, were required to
publish the same in 2 Manila edited daily newspapers of general
circulation in Olongapo ,and also to send copies of the order, by
registered mail or personal delivery, to the parties appearing in the
list furnished them by the Commission. The list above referred to give
the names of Alberto A. Galvez and Leonor Asuncion and the Municipal
Council of Olongapo, Zambales, as the only parties to be affected by
the application. These requirements of publication and notice were duly
complied with' by applicants.<p></p>
<p>After hearing, during which nobody appeared to oppose the
application, the Commission granted the same upon finding that
applicants are financially capable to install, maintain, and operate
the proposed public service and that the prerequisite notice and
publication had been made. The decision' was decreed to take effect
immediately, although its finality was fixed at 30 days after notice to
applicants. Copy of the decision was received by applicants on May 26,
1960.</p>
<p>On June 21, 1960, or within this 30-day period, Diosdado Rodriguez,
claiming to be the operator of a 10-ton ice plant. in San Marcelino,
Zambales and selling its produce in various places including Olongapo,
petitioned the Commission to set aside the decision and re-open the
case for the reason that aa an affected party he was not notified of
the proceedings held therein. This was opposed by the Valeros on the
grounds that Rodriguez, who obtained a certificate of public
convenience in Case No. 108844 on August 20, 1959, was not authorized
to serve the ice needs of the municipality of Olongapo that even
granting that Olongapo was included among the 'places to be served by
Rodriguez' ice plant, when the decision granting his application was
rendered Olongapo was still a U.S. Naval Reservation and therefore, the
Public "Service Commission, was without jurisdiction to authorize the
sale of ice therein. The petition to set aside, as well as the
opposition thereto, were duly heard.</p>
<p>In its order of February 12, 1962, the Public Service Commission,
resolving the, issues raised by the Valeros in their opposition, in
part, said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"1. Olongapo is included in the territory of sale
authorized to Diosdado Rodriguez. That this is so is clear both from
the opinion of the Commission and Condition No. 1 contained in the
decision rendered in. Case.No. 108844 on August 20, 1959 in favor- at
Diosdado Rodriguez, as follows:</p>
  <p>* * * As to the towns
applicant may be authorized to sell his. ice, we believe that.we should
not allow him to sell in the towns of San) Narciso and Iba, where there
are already ice plants in operation, except the town of Subie where it
clearly appears that the present production of the existing plant is
not sufficient for the needs of the public considering the great demand
in Olongapo which is a barrio of Subic. We think that the public of
Olongapo should be afforded applicant's service to supplement the
inadequate ice supply which they can get from the Navy.plant in
Olongapo. * * *.</p>
  <p>* * * CONDITIONS: 1: Applicant Diosdado
Rodriguez, shall install, maintain and operate in San Marcelino,
Zambales, an ice plant with a daily .productive capacity of ten (.10)
tons and shall sell the ice produced or manufactured in his plant
within the municipality of San Marcelino as well as in the towns of
Subic. * * *</p>
  <p>"b. An examination of the entire Military Bases
Agreement ber tween the Philippines and the United States of America of
March 14, 1947 shows that the Philippines did not expressly or by
implication give away her jurisdiction, right or authority over public
services existing within the bases or which may be authorized therein.
Only such jurisdiction, authority or rights which have ,been expressly
or by clear implication transferred by the Philippines to United States
by treaty stipulation in the Military Eases Agreement are deemed
transferred. Molina vs. Panaligan, G. E. L-1Q842, May 27, 1957; People
vs. Acierto, 49 Off. .Gaz., No. 2, 518)</p>
  <p>"In contending that
the -Philippines transferred to the United States its jurisdiction over
public services in Olongapo, counsel for, the Valeros, Atty. Vicente
Ampil, relies upon Article VII of the Military Bases Agreement which
reads:</p>
  <p>'ARTICLE' VIIâ€”Use of Public Service. It is mutually
agreed that the United States may employ and use for United States
military forces any and all public utilities, other services and
facilities, * * * in the Philippines under conditions no less favorable
than those that may be applicable from' time to time tto the military
forces of the Philippines.'</p>
  <p>''Counsel's contention, in our
opinion, is erroneous for the afora-cited article.does nothing more
than provide for the United States Military forces <em>equality</em>
of right with the Philippine Military forces in the use, among others,,
of all public services not only within the bases but in the entire
Philippines."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus declaring Rodriguez to be an affected party, the decision
previously rendered therein was ordered set aside and the case was
scheduled for a new hearing to enable them (the applicants and the
oppositor) to present their evidence. It is from this order that
applicants file the instant petition for review.</p>
<p>It is not disputed that before the case was heard, the Commission's
requirement of publication of the order of hearing) and notice to the
affected parties appearing in the list furnished them by the
Commission, were duly complied with by applicants. That oppositor
Diosdado Rodriguez was not so notified, was due to the fact that his
name did not appear in said list. However, confronted by this omission
and finding that Rodriguez should actually have been brought to the
proceedings, the Commission directed the reopening of the case, to
enable said party to oppose the application.</p>
<p>Under the above set of facts, there is no reason for us to disturb
the ruling of the Commission. The reopening of the, ease to allow an
affected party, who wag not properly notified of the application, to
present his opposition thereto, is certainly within the scope of the
Commission's authority to pass upon and determine ' whether
applications for operation of public services would be granted or not.
As a matter of fact, it is empowered by law to amend, modify, or revoke
even a Certificate of public convenience already issued, at any time,
should the facts and circumstances upon which it was issued be found to
have been misrepresented or materially changed.1 In this case, the
motion to set aside was filed before the decision to grant a
certificate of public convenience to applicants has become final. '.
That applicants' failure to notify the oppositor was for cause not
attributable to them, does not alter the situation that an affeeted
party was deprived of his day in court. Certainly the action taken by
the Public Service Commission in setting aside its decision which was
not yet final, and order to give opportunity to the aggrieved party to
be heard, is not only not erroneous but is the proper step to take.</p>
<p>In view of the conclusion herein reached, it is premature to.
resolve the question as to whether or not the Public Service Commission
had authority to include Olongapo in Rodriguez' certificate of public
convenience. This matter, if at all seriously urged, may be taken up
again when the case is considered on the merits by the Commission.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order appealed from, being conformable to law, the
petition for a writ of prohibition is denied, with costs against the
petitioners. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Paredes, Dizon, Regala,</em> and <em>Makalintal, J.J.,</em> concur.</p></div>
