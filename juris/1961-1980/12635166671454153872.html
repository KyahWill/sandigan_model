<p class="BODY">Desirous of availing himself of such a privilege, petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Yap <span class="SpellE">Ek</span> <span class="SpellE">Siu</span> instituted an action to that effect on <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1965</st1:date> in the Court of

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As to why petitioner
could avail himself of such a privilege, the appealed decision stated the
following: "As his reason for a change of his name to William <span class="SpellE">Tanchon</span>, petitioner declared that since his childhood days,
his Filipino playmates called him William; that he also desires to have his
family name of Yap changed to <span class="SpellE">Tanchon</span> in due respect
to his </span>father named <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pio</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Tanchon</span> who has been authorized by the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental to use said name per its
Decision in Special Proceeding No. S-42 dated </span><st1:date year="1962" day="9" month="7"><span style="">July 9, 1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> * * *; that said father of petitioner is </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">naturalized Filipino citizen in accordance with the Decision of this
Court in Special Proceeding No. S-2 dated </span><st1:date year="1959" day="27" month="7"><span style="">July 27, 1959</span></st1:date><span style=""> * * *, and was issued a Certificate of
Naturalization * * * dated </span><st1:date year="1959" day="28" month="8"><span style="">August </span>28, 1959</st1:date> also by
said <span style="">Court, and that he took the
corresponding Oath of Allegiance as </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">naturalized Filipino
citizen on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="28" month="8"><span style="">August 28, 1959</span></st1:date><span style=""> * * *.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner makes it plain and clear that he is still </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">Chinese citizen, and that his intention in filing this petition for
change of name is not to escape or evade his civil obligations; that he has
filed his income tax returns for the year 1964 * * *."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The only question before
us then is whether the </span>standard which would warrant <span style="">a </span>change of
name had been satisfied by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is that standard?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yu Chi Han
v. Republic,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
a 1965 decision, to which later cases adhered, supplies the answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"This Court has already had the occasion to express the view that
the State has an interest in the names borne by <span style="">individuals and entities for purposes of </span><span style="">identification </span>and that <span style="">a </span>change of
name is a privi­lege and not <span style="">a matter </span>of right, so that before a person can be authorized to
change his name given him either in his certificate of birth or civil registry
he must show proper or reasonable cause, or any compelling reason which may
justify such change.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the
request should be denied (<span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Peng</span>
<span class="SpellE">Oan</span> v. Republic, L-8035, November 29, 1957).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following may be considered, among
others, as proper and reasonable causes that may warrant the grant of a
petition for change of name:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) when
the name is ridiculous, tainted with <span style="">dishonor,
or is </span><span style="">extremely
difficult to write </span><span style="">or pronounce;
</span>(2) when the request for change <span style="">is </span>a consequence of a change of status, such
as when a natural child <span style="">is </span>acknowledged or legitimated; and (3) when the change is
necessary to avoid confusion (<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Civil Code
of the Philip­pines, 1953 ed., Vol. I, p. 660)."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the light of what was
set forth in the decision appealed from, it cannot be said that there is a
proper or reasonable cause, much less a compelling reason, to justify such a
change of name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the decision itself
admitted, petitioner "is still a Chinese citizen" al­though his
father apparently had become naturalized.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the circumstances, it would be productive of con­fusion if after
he has been using his present name all the while in both his personal and
business dealings, he would thereafter be known differently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not enough that his Filipino playmates
from his childhood days have called him William.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is the plea that a sense of filial
respect, his father having been authorized to use the name <span class="SpellE">Tanchon</span>,
that persuasive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Rather, what commands
assent is the weight of the reason advanced by the Republic in its brief </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In the present case,
the herein petitioner has not proven that his name is ridiculous, or tainted
with dishonor or extremely difficult to write or pronounce.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither has he </span>claimed that <span style="">he wants to change his name by reason of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">change in his status.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">we have already indicated above, there is nothing in the record that
would show that petitioner's continuous use of his present name would cause
confusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the change
of petitioner's name would give rise to confusion, for his real name, Yap <span class="SpellE">Ek</span> <span class="SpellE">Siu</span>, appears in all his
important and personal documents and according to him, he has never </span><span style="">used the name William in all his business dealings
* * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, since he is a Chinese
citizen * * *, he should also use a Chinese name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">Chinese citizen to use </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">Filipino name, we
submit, will only create embarrassment and confusion in his social and business
</span><span style="">dealings
</span><span style="">on the ground that he might be
mistaken to be a Filipino when in fact and in truth he is </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">Chinese."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The above argument was
not refuted at all, there being no brief filed on behalf of petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would
thus clearly appear that the lower court did act mistakenly in reaching the
conclusion that such a privilege, which is not to be indiscriminately awarded
to any and every applicant, could properly be availed of by petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">WHEREFORE</b><span style="">, the decision appealed from is reversed,
