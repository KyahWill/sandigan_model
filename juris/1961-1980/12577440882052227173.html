				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The above-entitled cases have been elevated for review to this Court by the 
respondent, Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, seeking relief from the 
Resolution of the Social Security Commission, dated October 26, 1959, ordering 
the said respondent to pay sickness benefits to petitioners for the periods 
claimed by them, in amounts to be determined by the Social Security System's 
Claims Department.
<p>The findings of fact by the Social Security Commission are admitted by the 
respondent and are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Godofredo Mosuela was an employee of the respondent from August 25, 1955 to 
January 19, 1969, with a salary of P1.02 per hour and worked eight (8) hours a 
day. In August, 1957, he became a covered member of the Social Security System 
and was assigned SSS No. 03-011790. In the collective bargaining agreement 
concluded between the employee's union, of which petitioner is a member, and the 
respondent, it is provided among other things that an employee who falls ill 
shall receive sick leave with full pay for the first two weeks of illness and 
thereafter, sick leave with half pay for the duration of the illness up to a 
maximum of six (6) months.</p>
<p>On September 30, 1958, Godofredo Mosuela was afflicted with sciatica and was 
confined in the Waterous Clinic on October 6, 1958. He was operated on October 
6, 1958, and discharged from the clinic on December 20, 1958, from which date he 
was confined in his house for purposes of recuperation until January 4, 1959. In 
accordance with the collective bargaining agreement, the respondent allowed the 
petitioner sick leave with full pay from September 30, to October 15, 1958, and 
sick leave with half pay from October 15, 1958 to January 4, 1959. On January 5, 
1959, petitioner returned to work for respondent until January 13, 1959. On 
January 14, 1959, he was asked by respondent to stop working and was finally 
discharged on January 31, 1959. Soon after his discharge, petitioner applied to 
the respondent for sickness benefits under Section 14 (a) of the Social Security 
Act, as amended, for the period of his ailment from October 16, 1958 to January 
3, 1959, when he was receiving only half pay, but respondent refused to grant 
the same.</p>
<p>Gregorio C. Mon was an employee of respondent from 1950 up to January 30, 
1959, with a salary of P.82 per hour and worked eight (8) hours a day. In 
August, 1957, he became a covered member of the Social Security System and was 
assigned SSS No. 03012561. On December 16, 1958, he was confined at the Waterous 
Clinic where he underwent a kidney operation and was discharged therefrom on 
January 8, 1959. From January 9, to January 19, 1959, he was confined in. his 
house to recuperate. In accordance with the collective bargaining agreement 
heretofore mentioned, respondent granted the petitioner sick leave with full pay 
from December 16-30, 1958, and, thereafter, sick leave with half pay from 
January 1-29, 1959. On January, petitioner was discharged by respondent. Soon 
after, he applied to respondent for sickness benefits under the Social Security 
Act, as amended, for the period of his ailment from January 1-29, 1959, when he 
was receiving only half pay, but the respondent likewise refused to grant the 
demand.</p>
<p>"Honorio L. Padilla was employed with the respondent from 1950 to December 
31, 1958, with a salary of P1.20 per hour and worked for eight (8) hours a day. 
In August, 1957, he became a covered member of the System and was assigned SSS 
No. 03011179. Between January and March, 1958, he was periodically ill and was 
granted by respondent sick leave with full pay for two weeks so that by March, 
1958, he had exhausted all sick leaves with full pay to which he was entitled 
from the respondent by virtue of the collective bargaining agreement mentioned 
in the two preceding cases.</p>
<p>"On August 1, 1958, he was afflicted with fibrotic tuberculosis and was 
hospitalized at the Waterous Clinic. He was discharged from the hospital on 
August 20, 1958 but remained in confinement in his home up to September 3, 1958. 
Having exhausted all sick leaves with full pay from the respondent, he was 
granted sick leave with half pay from August 1 to September 3, 1953, Soon after 
his release from the Waterous Clinic on August 20, 1958, he applied to 
respondent for sickness benefits under the Social Security Act, as amended, for 
the period of his ailment from August 1, 1958 to September 12, 1958, when he was 
receiving only half pay but respondent refused to grant it. On September 4, 
1958, respondent's physician declared petitioner fit for duty but respondent's 
operation supervisor, Mr. Homer Pratte, refused to let him work alleging that 
he was not then yet fit for duty. On December 31, 1958, petitioner was 
discharged by respondent."</p></blockquote>
<p>Since the cases involved similar facts and the same question of law, the same 
were tried jointly by the Commission.</p>
<p>The issue resolves upon the proper interpretation of the word "pay" appearing 
in the second proviso of Section 14 (a) of Republic Act No. 1161, which is 
worded as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 14. <i>Sickness benefit</i>.—(a) Under such rales and conditions as the 
Commission may prescribe, any covered employee under this Act who, after one 
year at least from the date of his coverage, on account of sickness or bodily 
injury is confined in a hospital, or elsewhere with the Commission's approval, 
shall, for each day of such confinement, be paid his employer, or by the System 
if such person is a voluntary member, an allowance equivalent to twenty <i>per 
centum</i> of his daily rate of Compensation, plus five <i>per centum</i> 
thereof for every dependent if he has any, but in na case shall the total amount 
of such daily allowance exceed six pesos, or sixty <i>per centum</i> of his 
daily rate of compensation, whichever is the smaller amount, nor paid for a 
period longer than ninety days in one calendar year: <i>Provided</i>, That he 
has paid the required premiums for at least six months immediately prior to his 
confinement: <i>Provided, further</i>, That the payment of such allowance shall 
begin only after the first seven days of confinement, except when such 
confinement is due to injury or to any acute disease; <i>but in no case shall 
such payment begin before all leaves of absence with pay, </i>if any, to the 
credit of the employee shall have been exhausted: * * *" (Italics 
supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>It may be gleaned from the records that the respondent, pursuant to a 
bargaining agreement with petitioners' union, granted them two weeks' sick leave 
with full pay and thereafter, sick leave with half pay up to a maximum of six 
months.</p>
<p>Petitioners contend that upon exhaustion of their two-week full pay sick 
benefits, they became entitled to the sickness allowances provided for under the 
Social Security Act (Republic Act 1161, as amended), although they were still 
enjoying the half-pay benefits during their illness for a maximum period of six 
months.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the respondent maintains that as the petitioners are still 
receiving some amount of sick leave pay from it, although less than full pay, 
said petitioners are not entitled to the sickness allowances under the said 
Social Security Law.</p>
<p>We agree with the appellees that appellant Company's contention is untenable. 
The Social Security law was enacted for the avowed purpose of protecting 
employees against the hazards of disability, sickness, old age, and death, and 
these purposes would be frustrated if lawful claims were to be denied simply 
because the claimant is receiving some pay, however infinitesimal, from the 
employer. Such would be the logical consequence of appellant's theory that the 
term "leaves of absence with pay" used in the statute includes leaves with any 
amount of pay, whatever such amounts should be. It stands to reason that in 
requiring the employee to exhaust all his leaves of absence with pay before his 
sickness allowances can begin, the statute takes into consideration that if the 
employee does receive the same compensation as when he was healthy, he has no 
ground for complaint. But this can not be true if the compensation received 
during his leave of absence is substantially reduced.</p>
<p>It is argued that unless appellant's interpretation is adopted, the laid-off 
employee may receive a total sickness allowance (under the statute and under the 
collective bargain combined) greater than the compensation he was actually 
earning before sickness. Suffice it to say that the law, in fixing the sickness 
allowance, did not take into account allowances fixed by agreement, since the 
legislator could not determine in advance whether such allowances would be 
agreed upon, nor their amount. Hence the contractual sickness benefits can not 
operate to reduce the statutory indemnities. The remedy evidently lies in taking 
into account the provisions of the Social Security law in the collective 
bargaining contract, and in providing for the deduction of the statutory 
allowances from the benefits that the employer is required to pay under the 
agreement. But such deduction can not be made without express assent to the 
effect by all the contracting parties, since courts can not write the contract 
for them.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the Social Seeurity Commission's resolution now 
under appeal is affirmed. Costs against respondent-appellant.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, 
Paredes, Dizon, </i>and <i>De Leon, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
