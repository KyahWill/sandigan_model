				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Defendant Florentino Manimbo and Tomas Manimbo were lessees, on a
month to month basis, of portion of a parcel of land located at Juan
Luna Street, corner of Pavia, Tondo, Manila, formerly belonging to
Pedro Cruz, who sometime in 1952 sold it to plaintiff Rufino M. Cortez.
At the time of the sale, plaintiff knew that defendants' houses (of the
barong-barong type, allegedly valued at P2,000.00, and P500.00,
respectively), were on the land. In 1956, plaintiff filed separate
complaints against defendants in the Municipal Court of Manila, for
ejectment and recovery of rentals in arrears. After joint trial, the
municipal court found for the plaintiff and against defendants. Upon
appeal, CFI of Manila rendered a single decision in the two cases,
ordering defendants to remove their improvements, vacate the premises
and further ordered defendant Florentino Manimbo to pay rent of P6.00 a
month from January 19, 1956 and defendant Tomas Manimbo, P8.00 a month
from January, 1956, until they actually vacate the premises. The
decision was subsequently amended with respect to the amount of rentals
in arrears. The trial court also dismissed the counterclaims.
Defendants appealed, but the questions raised being purely of law, the
Court of Appeals on March 23, 1959, issued a resolution certifying the
cases to us. Pending appeal in the Court of Appeals, however, the
latter ordered the execution of the judgment, for failure of the
defendants to deposit the monthly rentals adjudged by the lower court
and to file the required su- persedeas bond. An order of demolition was
issued by the Court of Appeals. Certiorari proceedings with preliminary
injunction presented by defendants before this tribunal against said
Order, was dismissed on November 8, 1957, for lack of merit (Manimbo,
et al. vs. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. L-13078-79).</p>
<p>On April 3, 1959, however, plaintiff-appellee moved for the
reconsideration of the resolution certifying the cases to this Court,
on the ground that the issue raised in the appeal had become moot, in
view of the fact that during the pendency of the appeal, sometime in
April, 1958, the defendants removed their respective houses, of which
fact the lower court was duly informed on June 30, 1958. It further
averred in the motion that it would serve no practical or useful
purpose, to certify the cases to this Court. The motion was denied.</p>
<p>The appellants do not dispute the right of the appellee to eject
them from the land in question; and they have not assigned as error in
their brief or made any assertion that the trial court erred in
ordering them to vacate the land; they do not dispute that they have
failed in the payment of their monthly rentals to the appellee and that
they have been in default in the payment of the agreed monthly rentals
from February, 1955 with respect to Florentino and from December, 1954,
with respect to Tomas. Admittedly, the filing of the ejectment cases by
the appellee against the appellants was justified. </p>
<p>Appellants submit, these facts notwithstanding, that the lower court
should not have dismissed their counterclaims and that they should be
indemnified of the value of their houses, having built them in good
faith and were already there when the appellee bought the land from
Pedro Cruz, a fact known to appellee. Appellants claim that the right
of the owner of the lot in question to possess and have the lots
returned to him "must be subordinated to the right of the appellants to
be indemnified because of the violation of the appellee of an alleged
verbal agreement." "We contend", they say, "that this violation of this
agreement constitutes a violation of a lien, which we may call it
implied equitable lien. Equitable lien may be established by verbal
agreement (Jackman <em>vs</em>. Newbold [CCA 8th] 28 F (2nd) 107; 62
ALE, 727), quoted in 33 Am. Jur. 428, par. 19). A lien may also be
created by contract, express or implied, with the owner of the property
or by some statute or fixed rule of law; it cannot be created by the
court merely from a sense of justice (53 CJS, 833, par. 2)". And "that
for the violation of the agreement the appellants became entitled to
receive not only the compensatory but the nominal and exemplary
damages". This contention is unmeritorious. The supposed verbal
agreement, as alleged by appellants, seems to be that appellee would
respect the improvements and appellants could stay on the land, as long
as they wanted to, provided they pay the rentals. The lower court did
not make any finding sustaining this allegation. It stated "there was
no basis for this claim"(counterclaim), which simply shows that the
pretensions of the appellants regarding the verbal agreement was
discredited by the lower court, and credited the appellee who denied
the existence thereof. The Court of Appeals did not make any findings
on this point. The cases raised purely questions of law. Having
admitted the fact that they were tenants of the land on a verbal month
to month contract, and failed to pay rentals, it follows that
appellants could legally be ejected at the end of each month, subject
to the provisions of law and jurisprudence on the matter. In this
jurisdiction, as has been well commented by the lower court, "it is the
law that the lessee is not entitled to reimbursement for the useful
expenses or improvements that he may have incorporated in the premises
where the lessor does not chose to appropriate the same; the only right
of the lessee being to take them away". If the rule were otherwise, "it
would always be in the power of the tenant to improve his landlord out
of his property" (Alburo <em>vs</em>. Villanueva, 7 PhiL, 277).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"<em>Indemnity for Improvements</em>.â€”The right of a
tenant in regard to improvements (mejoras) is expressly provided for in
article 1573 read in connection with article 487 where it is provided
that the tenant may make such improvements, either useful or
convenient, as he considers advantageous, provided he does not alter
the form and substance of the thing rented, <em>but that he will have no right for indemnification therefore</em> though he can take away such improvements if it is possible to do so without injury or damage to the thing rented (Alburo <em>vs</em>. Villanueva, 7 Phil. 277; In re Building &amp; Loan Association <em>vs</em>. Penalosa, 13 Phil., 575; Rivera <em>vs</em>. Trinidad, 48 Phil., 396; Cortes <em>vs</em>. Ramos, 46 Phil., 184; Montinola <em>vs</em>. Bantug, Off. Gaz., Aug. 16, 1941, p. 1484; Pineda <em>vs</em>.
Liwanag, Off. Gaz., Supp. Nov. 1, 1941 p. 97)" (Tolentino's
Commentaries and Jurisprudence on the Civil Code, Vol. II, p. 930, 1947
Ed.) </p>
  <p>"* * * This principle of possession in good faith,
naturally cannot apply to a lessee because as such lessee he knows that
he is not the owner of the leased premises. Neither can he deny the
ownership or title of his lessor. Knowing that his occupation of the
premises continues only during the life of the lease contract and that
he must vacate the property upon termination of the lease or upon
violation by him of any of its terms, he introduces improvements on
said property at his own risk in the sense that he cannot recover their
value from the lessor, much less retain the premises until such
reimbursement. His right to improvements introduced by him is expressly
governed by Article 1573 and 487 of the old Civil Code * * *" (Lopez
Inc. <em>vs</em>. Philippine &amp; Eastern Trading Co., Inc. 98 Phil., 348, 52 Off. Gaz., [3] 1452).</p>
  <p>" * * * 'Article 361 and 453 of the Civil Code, which define the rights
between the owner of the land and builders of improvements thereon in
good faith, are not applicable as between landlord and tenant, since
the Code supplies specific provisions designed to cover their rights.
Besides the tenant cannot be said to be a builder in good faith as he
has no pretension to be owner (Manresa Com. ed. Vol. V, p. 445) * * *'
"(Lopez Inc. <em>vs</em>. Philippine &amp; Eastern Trading Co., Inc supra). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the facts obtaining in these cases, nominal or exemplary damages, as prayed for by the appellants, cannot be awarded.</p>
<p>Moreover, the appellants, sometime in the month of April, 1958,
vacated the land in question and removed their respective houses to a
place and have been possessing and enjoying them since then. There is,
therefore, no improvement or any part of the appellants' houses left on
the land which they may ask the appellee to pay for. They should not be
permitted to eat their cake and have it too.</p>
<p>In view hereof, the appeal is dismissed and the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellants.</p>
