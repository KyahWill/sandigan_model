<p class="BODY">On November 26, 1962, without the knowledge of
plaintiff-appellant … purchaser of the property at the auction sale … the
mortgagors spouses Reynaldo B. <span class="SpellE">Chavoso</span> and <span class="SpellE">Manolita</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Chavoso</span> paid the sum
of Sixteen Thousand Two Hundred Forty Pesos (P16,240.00) to the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City who, on the same day, issued in favor of said
spouses a "Certificate of Re­demption" of the land in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said certificate was duly annotated at the
back of the corresponding original certificate of title with the Register of
Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, the owners' duplicate certificate of title to the property,
theretofore re­tained by the GSIS, notwithstanding the auction sale
aforementioned, was surrendered by said company to the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City upon demand of the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 12, 1963, herein appellant (auction-vendee) commenced action
for "Recovery of Property" in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> against the spouses Reynaldo B. <span class="SpellE">Chavoso</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Manolita</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Chavoso</span>,
the GSIS, the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, and
against the Sheriff of the place alleging, among others, that the defendant
Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City accepted the alleged
redemption price of P16,240.00 illegally, not only because there was no showing
that the plaintiff-appellant <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Reyes had
unlawfully refused to accept said redemption price, but also because the amount
re­ceived by said official was short of the assessment fees, taxes, documentary
stamps and commission in favor of the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant prayed for judgment order­ing the <span class="SpellE">Chavoso</span> spouses "to surrender possession of the
premises to the plaintiff"; to pay P400.00 a month for the use and
occupation of the premises starting Novem­ber 28, 1962 till they vacate the
premises, and to re­mit all rentals collected from tenants therein; and to pay
P1,000.00 for attorney's fees and P1,000.00 for every appeal made by
defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Separate answers were filed
by defendants GSIS, Register of Deeds and Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City on <st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1963</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="5">May 14, 1963</st1:date>, and <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1963</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For their part, defendants
spouses Reynaldo B. <span class="SpellE">Chavoso</span> and <span class="SpellE">Manolita</span>
C. <span class="SpellE">Chavoso</span> filed a mo­tion to dismiss on the grounds
that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the complaint of the plaintiff
against said defendants spouses states no cause of action; and (2) the claim of
plaintiff against them in the sum of P16,240.00 redemption price has been fully
and legally paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was
opposed by plain­tiff.</p>

<p class="BODY">Resolving the motion to dismiss, the court, on <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1963</st1:date>, dismissed the case as
against defendants-spouses Reynaldo B. <span class="SpellE">Chavoso</span> and <span class="SpellE">Manolita</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Chavoso</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff moved for reconsideration; while
defendant GSIS, after knowing that the case had been dismissed as against the <span class="SpellE">Chavoso</span> spouses, also moved for the dismissal of the action
against it; and the court, in an order dated July 24, 1963, denied plaintiff's
motion for reconsideration of the order of dismissal as against the <span class="SpellE">Chavosos</span> and, at the same time, dismissed the case with
respect to defend­ant GSIS.</p>

<p class="BODY">The auction-vendee, <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Reyes, has
appealed from both orders.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law question involved - whether or not the com­plaint filed
in the court below states a cause of action against therein defendants - calls
for a determination of the issue as to whether on the face of the complaint, it
appears that the <span class="SpellE">Chavoso</span> spouses had validly redeem­ed
the property, subject matter of the complaint, which would entitle them to the
possession and enjoyment of the property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On this point, the trial court held for <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The instant complaint prays that de­fendants be ordered to
surrender posses­sion of the premises in dispute and to order defendants to pay
P400.00 a month as monthly rental starting <st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1962</st1:date> until they vacate the premises and
attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This claim of the
plaintiff is anchored on the fact that on <st1:date year="1961" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1961</st1:date> he acquired through a public auction
sale the property in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
complaint likewise alleges however, that at the back of TCT No. 26484 there is
annotated as per entry PE-1120/T-26484 - Certificate of Re­demption by Reynaldo
B. <span class="SpellE">Chavoso</span>, <span style="">ins­</span>cribed
on <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1962</st1:date>, and
the date of the instrument <st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="11">November
 28, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint also
alleges that the redemption money was accepted by the Sheriff on <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1962</st1:date>, and in fact a
certificate of redemption has been issued on said date by the Sheriff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cause of action, there­fore, of the
plaintiff in the present complaint is based on whether redemp­tion has been
made by the defendants within the period required by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As alleged (in) the complaint the public
auction sale was conducted on <st1:date year="1961" day="27" month="11">Novem­ber
 27, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Admittedly, the
redemp­tion was made by the defendants on <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="11">No­vember 23, 1962</st1:date>, which is within the one year period
prescribed by law for redemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
being the case, the complaint in this case can very well be said to have no
cause of action, for the very right of plaintiff to divest defendants of their
possession of the disputed premises, has been extin­guished by the act of
redemption made by the defendants and acknowledged by the proper
authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, it has been
mentioned in the complaint that the redemption money is lacking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to say that under the provi­sions
of Section 27, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court -</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Written notice of any redemption must be given to the officer who made
the <span style="">sale </span>and a duplicate filed
with the registrar of the province, and if any assessments or taxes are paid by
the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>, or if he has or acquires any lien
other than that upon which redemption was made, notice thereof must in like
manner be given to the officer and filed with the registrar of deeds; if such
notice be not filed, the property may be redeemed without paying such
assessments taxes, or liens.'</p>

<blockquote>In this particular case, redemption has
actually been accepted by the Sheriff and, therefore, it could be gleaned that
there has been a valid redemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
that matter, the complaint states no cause of action."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant contends, however, that the redemption made by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> spouses Reynaldo B. <span class="SpellE">Chavoso</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Manolita</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Chavoso</span> is
null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is argued that the
Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City may lawfully accept the
redemption money for the purchaser only (1) <span style="">if </span>said pur­chaser unlawfully refuses
to accept the redemption mo­ney, or (2) if said purchaser had authorized the
she­riff to accept such redemption money.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We do not agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such
conditions are imposed by the Rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
contrary, Section 31 of Rule 39 expressly provides that the payment of the
redemption money may be made to such sheriff, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 31.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Effect of
redemption by judgment debtor, and a certificate to be delivered and recorded
there upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To whom payments on
redemption made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- If the judgment
debtor redeem, he must make the same payments as are required to effect a
redemption by a <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>, whereupon the effect of
the sale is terminated and he is restored to his estate, and the person to whom
the pay­ment is made must execute and deliver to him a certificate of
redemption acknowledged or approved before a notary public or other officer
authorized to take acknowledgments of conveyances of real property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such certificate must be filed and recorded
in the office of the registrar of deeds of the province in which the property
is situated, and the registrar of deeds must note the record thereof on the
margin of the record of the certificate of sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The payments mentioned in this and the
last preceding sections may be made to the purchaser or <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>
or for him to the officer who made the sale</u>.” [Underscoring Ours<u>]</u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span>recall that
this same argument was hinted in <span class="SpellE">Javallana</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
where it was suggested that the redemption was rendered ineffectual by reason
of the fact that the tender of payment <span style="">was
</span>made to the officer who made the sale instead of directly to the
purchaser, and this Court held that "it was manifestly un­necessary for
the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span> to seek out the purchaser for the purpose
of making payment to him."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
To the same effect was the holding of this Court in <span class="SpellE">Basco</span>
vs. Gonzalez,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
where, in denying a similar contention, it was explained:</p>

<blockquote>"The further contention of the appel­lant that the redemption
made by Gonzalez through the provincial sheriff is not va­lid, and that
redemption could be made legally only through <span class="SpellE">Primicias</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, is untenable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the case of Papa vs. <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span> (29
Phil. 360, 364), this Court held that although the purchaser of the auction is
the only person who has a right to receive the price of the thing redeemed, the
<span class="SpellE">re­demptioner</span> may, however, deposit it in the hands
of the sheriff for its delivery to such purchaser, especially in the case where
the latter refuses to receive it, or when for any reason it may be feared that
the period for redemption may lapse with­out its being shown in the authentic
man­ner that the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span> has in due course of
time complied with his duty to pay the price of the sale and interest
thereon."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It will be seen then that the manner in which the re­demption in
question in the case at bar was made is not only in accordance with the express
provision of the Rules of Court, but is likewise sanctioned by decisional
dicta.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the contention that the amount accepted by the Sheriff from
the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span> in this case failed to in­clude the
assessments, taxes and commissions appellant claims to have paid in addition to
the purchase price of the auction sale and, for which reason, it is now con­tended
by appellant that the redemption referred to should be deemed ineffectual, the
last paragraph of Section 30, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court expressly provides
that "if any assessments or taxes are paid by the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>
or if he has or acquires any lien other than that upon which the redemption was
made, notice thereof must in like man­ner be given to the officer (who made the
sale) and filed with the registrar of deeds; if such notice be not filed, the
property may be redeemed without paying such assess­ments, taxes, or
liens." As correctly pointed out by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in
their briefs, there is no allegation in the complaint filed with the lower
court that such notice was made by appellant, and there is no claim made here
by appellant that he complied with the requirement of making such notice to the
Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City before the lat­ter permitted
the redemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, even on the
assumption that appellant had really paid the assessments, taxes and
commissions alluded to by him, he cannot now be heard to complain that the said
sheriff violated his duty by accepting only the purchase price at the auction
sale and the interests thereon, for without the required notice from appellant
that he had made additional payments in the form of assessments, taxes and
commissions, the sheriff concerned was in no position to know them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither <span style="">is </span>appellant right in saying that he failed to make such no­tice
precisely because he was not aware of the redemption, intimating that it was
the duty of either the <span class="SpellE">redemption­er</span> or the sheriff
to notify him of the redemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such
duty devolves upon them; on the contrary, the rule requiring such notice should
be taken to mean that a pur­chaser or <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>,
in order to protect his rights, must make such notice as soon as any additional
payments are made by him, and not only at the time the mortgagor or judgment
debtor offers to make the redemption.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span>hold that the
lower court did not err in holding that on the face of the complaint filed
therewith, it appears that a valid redemption had been made by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> spouses, hence no cause of action is stated <span style="">a­gainst </span>them therein, and, in
dismissing, on such ground said complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The same considerations apply as regards the motion to dismiss of the
other <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> GSIS.</p>
