				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by <span class="SpellE">Monico</span> Reyes from a decision
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> convicting
him of the crime of illegal detention with murder and sentencing him to life imprisonment,
as well as to indemnify the heirs of the deceased, <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span>
Castro, in the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution is to the effect that in the
evening of December 31, 1953 to January 1, 1954, at about midnight, while <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> Castro was walking along the street, in the barrio
of Fortuna, municipality of <span class="SpellE">Floridablanca</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, on her way home from the tailoring shop in which
she worked as a seamstress, <span class="SpellE">Monico</span> Reyes, who had
been courting her before, approached her, grabbed her by the waist and dragged
her into his house not far away; that although <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span>
grappled with <span class="SpellE">Mo­nico</span>, begged to be released and cried
for help, several persons nearby could not come to her assistance, because <span class="SpellE">Monico</span>, brandishing a "weapon," warned them not
to do so; that upon being informed about this occurrence, her father and her
brother, Domingo and Juan Castro, ran towards <span class="SpellE">Monico's</span>
house, the door of which they found closed; that, thereupon, Domingo shouted:
"<span class="SpellE">Monico</span> -- do not make any move -- we'll talk
about this matter;" that <span class="SpellE">Monico</span> answered:
"do not come up, your daughter will die;" that, meanwhile, Juan had
peeped through a hole in the "<span class="SpellE">sawale</span>"
partition, and saw <span class="SpellE">Monico</span> holding <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span>
firmly by the waist, with the left hand, and, with the right hand, a knife,
with which he stabbed <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span>; that unable to enter
through the door, Domingo and Juan forced their way into the house through a
window; that in the compartment where <span class="SpellE">Monico</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> were, father and son noticed that <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> was lying on the floor face upward; that as Domingo
proceeded to approach her, he was immediately met by <span class="SpellE">Monico</span>,
knife in hand; that realizing the danger <span style="">to
</span>his father, Juan lunged at <span class="SpellE">Monico</span>, and
struggled with him for the possession of the weapon; that, with the assistance
of Domingo who pulled <span class="SpellE">Monico</span> by a leg, Juan succeeded
in wrestling the knife; that Juan then stabbed <span class="SpellE">Monico</span>
several times, until the blade, detached from the handle, was left embedded in <span class="SpellE">Monico’s</span> body; that Juan, in turn, had knocked down a table
and clubbed <span class="SpellE">Moni<span style="">co</span></span><span style=""> </span>with one of its legs, until he was no
longer moving; that father and son then picked up <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span>,
who was groaning, with a stab wound on the left side of the chest, below the
middle third of the left clavicle; that, forthwith, they brought her <span style="">to </span>a local physician, who said she was
dying; that, as they tried to bring <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> to the
hospital, she died on the way; and that her death was due to heart failure
incidental to internal hemorrhage.</p>

<p class="BODY">The theory of the defense is that <span class="SpellE">Monico</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> had <span style="">been
</span>sweethearts for about a year before the date of the occurrence; that
since November <span style="">1953, </span>they had
agreed to elope <span style="">in </span>the evening
of December 31, <span style="">1953; </span>that at
about 11 o'clock that evening she woke him up in his house; that he then dressed
<span style="">up </span>for the purpose of reporting
their elopement to the authorities; that Domingo and Juan then arrived and
forced their way into the house; that <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> tried to
prevent her father from harming <span class="SpellE">Monico</span>, and stated
that she had gone to him of her own volition; that, this notwithstanding, Juan
tried to stab <span class="SpellE">Monico</span>, but, instead, wounded <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span>, by accident; that, thereupon, father and son ganged
up on him, and did not leave him until they thought he was dead.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court accepted the version of the prosecution and gave
no credence to the evidence <span style="">for </span>the
defense and, we think, correctly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the theory for the prosecution is borne out by the testimony of <span style="">Juanita Morales, a co</span>-<span style="">worker </span>of <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span>,
who was with her when <span class="SpellE">Monico</span> dragged her from the
street into his house, and the testimony of Carolina Morales, Felipe <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> and Roman <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span>, whose
houses were in the vicinity of the scene of the occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They testified positively that <span class="SpellE">Monico</span> had used force and violence in order to bring <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> into his house, that she resisted him and <span style="">cried for </span>help, and that she kept on
screaming when she was already inside said house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have no reason to doubt the veracity of
these four (4) witnesses, who had no possible motive to falsely incriminate
appellant herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, there is no satisfactory evidence that <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> reciprocated his love.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not a single letter of <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span>
to him has been produced by the defense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, there was absolutely no reason why they should elope, for
nobody appears to have opposed their union, if they wanted it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> was
of age, she being 22 years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again,
had they agreed to elope in the evening of the occurrence, <span class="SpellE">Monico</span>
would not have gone to bed at the appointed hour, much less in his underwear (<span class="SpellE"><u>camiseta</u></span>), to wait for his future bride.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, if <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span>
voluntarily went to his house, in pursuance of their alleged agreement, why
should he report their "elopement" to the authorities?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lastly, as stated in the decision appealed
from:</p>

<blockquote>"We cannot accept the theory that <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span>
was accidentally wounded as advanced by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be observed <span style="">that </span>when Domingo and his son were in the premises, they
surrounded him and their one and common thought was to extricate <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> from <span class="SpellE">Monico</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this light, we cannot sustain the view
that any of them would risk a frontal attack that would endanger in any way <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In strength,
they were decidedly superior and it is unreasonable to believe that they had to
avail themselves of the use of a weapon to achieve their purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are firmly convinced that the author of
the tragic death of <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> Castro was no other than <span class="SpellE">Monico</span> Reyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Considering that appellant had deprived <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span>
of her liberty and detained her for sometime before stabbing her, the crime
committed is that of serious illegal detention, provided for in Article 267, in
relation to paragraph (3), of the Revised Penal Code, which prescribes the
penalty of life imprisonment to death.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In People vs. Guzman (58 <span class="GramE">Off</span>. <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>. 664, 667), we held that "an attack made by a man
with a deadly weapon upon an unarmed defenseless woman constitutes the
circumstance of abuse of that superiority which his sex and the weapon used in
the act afforded him, and from which the woman was unable to defend
herself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE">U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE">
vs. <span class="SpellE">Camiloy</span>, 36 Phil. 757; </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE">U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE">
vs. Consuelo, 13 Phil. 612; People vs. Quesada, 62 Phil. 446)."</span> In
view of this aggravating circumstance, the aforementioned penalty should be
imposed in its maximum period or death.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For lack, however, of the number of votes necessary <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
the penalty next lower in degree, or life imprisonment, meted out by the lower
court, is the proper penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from should be, as it is
hereby affirmed, with costs against appellant <span class="SpellE">Monico</span>
Reyes.</p>
