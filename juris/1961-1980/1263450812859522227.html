				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In its session on March 29, 1966, the respondent Com­mission on
Elections (COMELEC) "RESOLVED to appoint", amongst others, the
petitioners Pablo D. Suarez, Guillermo C. Lucas and Gerardo I. Bautista--then
holding positions of "Election Registrar(s) of the Commission on
Elections" corresponding to items provided for "Municipal
Registrars", under duly approved appointments dated February 1, 1964, but
actually detailed to and performing duties as such in Manila by virtue of
alleged verbal assignments made by the COMELEC--as permanent election
registrars for the first, second and fourth congressional districts of Manila,
respectively, and directed its Personnel Office "to prepare and issue the
corresponding appointment papers effective upon assumption of duty". <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Evidently, the COMELEC was motivated to so act
by its desire to rectify its erstwhile practice of appointing election
registrars without desig­nation of specific station having in view the new
Registration Law, Republic Act 3588, the ruling in <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>
vs. Commission on Elections, G.R. L-24329, April 8, 1965, and moves in Congress
toward a more definitive expression of legisla­tive intent to make the offices
of election registrars permanent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the resolution aforesaid could be implemented, however,
one Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Verdejo</span>, also an election registrar
detailed to the city of Manila, invited the attention of the COMELEC to an
unresolved letter-petition he had <span class="SpellE">priorly</span> addressed
to the latter praying for his retention as one of the four election registrars
to be permanently stationed in Manila.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This trig­gered a restudy of the disposition of permanent appointments
of city registrars throughout the country.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The permanent appointments of 33 city registrars were soon to be
approved by the COMELEC upon recommendation of the Chief of its Registry
Operations Division who conducted the restudy aforesaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But action on those of four permanent
registrars for <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> was deferred
pending a more thoroughgoing examination of the service records of all the
election registrars who have been detailed in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
with a view to determining who among them would best qualify for the said
positions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Eventually, on August 24, <span style="">1966,
a</span>cting on the recommenda­tion of its screening committee, and after
evaluating the qua­lifications and service records of the several prospective
ap­pointees in accordance with specific guidelines it laid down, the COMELEC
"RESOLVED to permanently appoint * * * as Elec­tion Registrars in the City
of Manila" - instead of the peti­tioners - the respondents Enrique, <span class="SpellE">Roa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nestorio</span> Bautista,
together with Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Verdejo</span> heretofore
mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their appointment papers were
issued and were thereafter approved by the <span style="">Civil </span>Service Commission; they then
duly qualified as such.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notified of this development and directed to yield their offices
and turn over their property and other accountabilities to the new permanent
appointees, the forty-one other election registrars (the petitioners included)
then detailed in Manila, to a man demurred and refused to heed the aforesaid
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this disobedience, the
COMELEC forthwith charged them adminis­tratively and ordered their preventive
suspension.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rebuffed in their efforts to obtain a reconsideration of the
directives of the COMELEC, the petitioners came to this Court in this
three-pronged action:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>prohibition to
stop the COMELEC from relieving them from their present positions and from
proceeding with the administrative investigation; mandamus to compel the
COMELEC to issue their appointment papers pursuant to the reso­lution of March <span style="">29, 1966; </span>and quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span>
to declare them duly entitled to the offices of permanent election registrars
for the first, second and fourth districts of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their ancillary prayer for preliminary
injunction was allowed and, upon bond duly filed and approved, the
corresponding writ was issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">The original position taken by the petitioners has undergone a
substantial metamorphosis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their
petition, they staked their claim upon the <span class="SpellE">COMELEC's</span>
resolution of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:date month="3" day="29" year="1966">March <span style="">29, 1966</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>which, they contended, amounted to a
final and completed <span style="">exercise </span><span style="">of appointing
power by the COMELEC and therefore vest­ed in them title to the respective
offices in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their subsequent
memorandum, they stand solidly upon the propo­sition that their <span style="">original appointments </span>of </span><st1:date month="2" day="1" year="1964"><span style="">February
 1, 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> vested in
them irrevocable titles to the offices of election registrars for the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, of <span style="">which
they may not be divested against their will without doing violence to their
constitutional right to security of tenure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They now regard the </span></span><st1:date month="3" day="29" year="1966"><span style="">March
 29, </span><span style="">1966</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span><span style="">resolution as
merely reappointing them to the same positions and net conferring
"new" appointments upon them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Whichever stance they </span>assume,
the petitioners can derive no comfort.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the matter of <span style="">their reliance
upon their original ap­</span>pointments of <st1:date month="2" day="1" year="1964">February 1, 1964</st1:date>, our ruling in <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span>,
et al. vs. Commission on Elections, et al., G.R. <span style="">L-26558, </span><st1:date month="4" day="27" year="1967">April 27, 1967</st1:date>, controls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, where the therein petitioners relied
upon appointments which, <span style="">like </span>those
of the petitioners herein, did not specify a particular station, and the
assignment of the appointees to particular places was made <span style="">by mere detail </span>thereafter, we ruled
that the said appointments did not enti­tle the appointees to any security of
tenure or permanency in the places to which they were assigned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, because -</p>

<blockquote>"* * * The subsequent assignment of the appoin­tees <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> that the said respondent held in reserve to be
exercised as the <span style="">needs </span>of each
locality justified did not in any way detract from the per­fection attained by
the appointments beforehand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the
respective appointees were entitled only to such security of tenure as the
appointment papers concern­ed actually conferred - not <span style="">in </span>that of any place to which they may have been subsequently <span style="">assigned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is </span>particularly true in the case at bar where the of<span style="">fices </span>filled by the petitioners were
those of 'munici­pal registrars', whereas the assignments given to them were
stations corresponding to 'city registrars' - which they were not - covered by
item numbers in the current appropriations act which time altogether dif­ferent
from those stated in their respective appointments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As things stand, in default of any particular
station stated in their respective appointments, no security of <span style="">tenure can be asserted </span>by the
petitioners on the basis of the mere <span style="">assignments
which were given </span>to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
contrary rule will erase altogether the demarcation line we have repeatedly
drawn between <u><span style="">ap</span></u><u><span style="">pointment</span></u><span style=""> </span>and <u><span style="">assi</span></u><u><span style="">gnment</span></u><span style=""> </span>as two distinct concepts in the law of
public officers." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span>, et
al. vs. Commission on Elections, et al., <u>supra</u>.)</span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The final resolution of the COMELEC
against retaining the pe­titioners herein as election registrars with permanent
station in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> cannot therefore
be denounced as an infringement of their right to security of tenure.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor may the petitioners find sanctuary in the COMELEC re­solution
of <st1:date month="3" day="29" year="1966">March 29, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under either alternative in their shifting
view thereof - that <span style="">is, </span>as either an original appoint­ment or as a reappointment to
the same position - the said re­solution cannot be imbued with the character of
a completed exertion of appointing power which vested in the <span class="GramE">petitioners</span>
irrevocable title to the offices concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indubitable <span style="">is the </span>rule that an appointment attains finality, from the
standpoint of the appointing authority, upon the performance of the last act
required of it as such appointing authority; but the mere issuance of the
resolution aforesaid was not, in the case at bar, the last act which would take
the matter completely out of the control of the appointing authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We <span style="">have </span>hereto­fore ruled that, <span style="">under </span>existing
appointing <span style="">machinery
</span>in this jurisdiction -</p>

<blockquote>"* * * an appointment made by an officer duly empowered to
make it is not final or complete until after the Commissioner of Civil <span style="">Service </span>has
certi­fied that such appointment may be made.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">Hence,
with­</span>out such certification, the appointment may be re­called or
withdrawn by the appointing officer. * * *." (<span class="SpellE">Grospe</span>
vs. Secretary of Public Works, et al., 56 O.G., No. 24, pp. 4097, 4100).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Here, there is not even an insinuation
that that certification was had; the appointment papers of the petitioners have
not even been issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that <span style="">in Villanueva vs. <span class="SpellE">Balallo</span>, </span>G.R. L-17745, <st1:date month="10" day="31" year="1963">October 31, 1963</st1:date>, we held that when the appointee is
qualified, the certification of the appointment by the Commissioner of <span style="">Civil </span>Service
becomes ministerial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, it can hardly
be averred that the petitioners’ qualifications and preferential right over all
others to the positions in ques­tion have been finally ascertained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the very least, it must be conceded that
the pending letter-petition of Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Verdejo</span> to
which the attention of the COMELEC was seasonably called cast serious doubts on
the correctness of the initial choices made by the COMELEC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Which is why it was
impelled to order a restudy of the entire matter and to set more specific
guidelines for such restudy.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor
is there anything in the ruling adverted to which intimates that certification
by the Civil Service Commissioner can be dispensed with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It still must be had as the ultimate act <span style="">required </span><span class="GramE">to complete</span> the ap­pointment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not until then does the appointee become
entitled to the protection of the law against unjust removal - a rule we
reiterated in <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Favis</span></span><span style=""> vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Rupisan</span>,
et al., G.R.L-22823, May 19, 1966, in which <span style="">we </span>quoted with approval the
pronouncements made in the earlier case of <span class="SpellE">Grospe</span> vs.
Secretary of Public Works, et al., heretofore cited.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we look in retrospect at the developments contempo­raneous with
the issuance of the resolution of March <span style="">29,1966,
</span>we are satisfied that the seasonable action of the COMELEC in ordering a
restudy of the disposition of the permanent appoint­ments for city election
registrars, including those for Manila now claimed by the petitioners -
evidently, due to doubts gen­erated by the letter-petition of Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Verdejo</span> -- and its subsequent action of revising the
resolution of March <span style="">29, 1966 </span>by
appointing the respondents, in lieu of the petitioners, were still well within
its power to take.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No question is here
raised as to the reasonableness of the criteria or guidelines relied upon by it
in making its final choices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <span style="">we have </span>been
shown no valid reason for substituting our own discretion for that it exercised
in the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">It follows ineluctably that the present petition must fall.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is <span class="GramE">dismissed,</span>
writ of preliminary injunction heretofore issued is dissolved, at peti­tioners'
cost.</p>
