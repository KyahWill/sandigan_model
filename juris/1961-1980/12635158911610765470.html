HON. FRANCISCO ARCA, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA (BRANCH I)
AND JUANA T. DE LA VIÑA, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for a writ of certiorari with preliminary injunction to
set aside certain orders, dated February 3, 1965 and December 17, 1964, of
respondent Judge Francisco <span class="SpellE">Arca</span> of the Court of First
Instance of Manila (Branch I) issued in Civil Case No. 21954 of said court, and
to require the same court to grant petitioner's motion for demolition of a
lessee's buildings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Basic to these proceedings is that by decision of the Court of
First instance of Manila in its Case No. 21954, the private respondent, Juana
T. de la <span class="SpellE">Viña</span>, with other lessees who are not now
involved, were on September 29, 1956 condemned to vacate the lots in Manila
leased by them from herein petitioner, and - </p>

<blockquote>“<span class="GramE">remove</span> the buildings built thereon, and
return the possession"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">of the lots to herein petitioner: for
said respondent de la <span class="SpellE">Viña</span> to pay P2,224.50 annually,
beginning January 1, 1954, with interest at the legal rate, plus real estate
tax of P278.06 per year until the possession of the lot occupied by her is
restored to herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appealed to this Supreme Court (Case G.R. No.
<span class="GramE">L-12020), the aforesaid judgment was affirmed, with costs
against appellants, on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="31" month="8"><span class="GramE">August 31, 1960</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The records having been returned to the Court of First Instance
(Branch I) of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> secured a writ of execution, by virtue of which the
Sheriff levied upon personal property of respondent De la <span class="SpellE">Viña</span>,
and sold the same on <st1:date month="3" day="22" year="1961">March 22, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the Sheriff also made levy on
three buildings belonging to the execution debtor, standing on the premises to
be vacated.</p>

<p class="BODY">De la <span class="SpellE">Viña</span> resorted to the Court of
Appeals (Case CA-G.R. No. 29294-R) entreating that Court to set aside the writ
of execution and the City Sheriff's sale of the <span class="SpellE">personalty</span>
and the levy on the buildings aforementioned; and by decision of December 19,
1961, the Court of Appeals upheld the execution and sale of the <span class="SpellE">personalty</span>, but enjoined the sale of the real properties
until proper notice of the sale had been made.</p>

<p class="BODY">After new notices had been issued, the Sheriff of Manila sold the
buildings to the herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> as the
highest bidder and on <st1:date month="9" day="28" year="1962">September 28,
 1962</st1:date> executed the corresponding certificate of sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>De la <span class="SpellE">Viña</span> moved to
set aside the sale, but apparently upon indication from respondent judge,
withdrew the motion on <st1:date month="2" day="13" year="1963">February 13,
 1963</st1:date> in order to file a separate civil action to annul the
sheriff's sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">The suit was actually instituted on <st1:date month="9" day="17" year="1963">September 17, 1963</st1:date>, docketed as Civil Case No. 54997 of
the City Court of first Instance, Branch X, presided by Judge <span class="SpellE">Moya</span>; but the latter rejected de la <span class="SpellE">Viña's</span>
application for a preliminary writ of injunction to restrain <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> from consolidating ownership over the buildings and
from taking possession thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reason
given for denying the writ was that one year had elapsed since the sale; that
the petition showed that the houses were in actual possession of the buyer, and
that whatever prejudice might ensue could be adequately compensated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having obtained a final deed of sale from the Sheriff, petitioner
<span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> secured from respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Arca</span> an <u>alias</u> writ of execution on <st1:date month="7" day="13" year="1964">July 13, 1964</st1:date> ordering de la <span class="SpellE">Viña</span> and all persons claiming under her to vacate the lot
in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="8" day="1" year="1964">August 1, 1964</st1:date>, de la <span class="SpellE">Viña</span>
once more resorted to the Court of Appeals for a writ of prohibition against
the enforcement of the <u>alias</u> writ of execution (CA-G.R. No. 34350-R) but
that appellate court, on <st1:date month="8" day="25" year="1964">August 25,
 1964</st1:date>, dismissed the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">De la <span class="SpellE">Viña</span> returned to the court of
respondent <span class="SpellE">Arca</span>, with a motion to quash the <u>alias</u>
writ of execution, and on <st1:date month="8" day="29" year="1964">August 29,
 1964</st1:date> respondent judge issued an order authorizing her and her
household help "to stay in her house No. 2, one of the subject matters of
the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This order was set aside on September 22 by the same judge, after
hearing the parties, and the motion to quash the execution was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four days later, on September 26, a third <u>alias</u>
writ was issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">De la <span class="SpellE">Viña</span> asked for reconsideration,
and on September 29 the respondent judge set aside its order of September 22,
and restrained further action on the <u>alias</u> writs of execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">After various other incidents, <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
finally moved on November 28, 1964 for "leave to forthwith demolish and
destroy the buildings in question," on the ground that his title to the
land had never been disputed, and that regard­less of the validity or
invalidity of the Sheriff's sale to him of the houses standing thereon, he was
entitled to have the buildings removed, pursuant to the final judgment affirmed
by the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By order of December
17, the respondent denied the motion for demolition, on the ground that the
houses might have sentimental value for de la <span class="SpellE">Viña</span>
and that she could not be deprived of her property without due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on <st1:date month="2" day="3" year="1965">February
 3, 1965</st1:date>, upon <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
motion, the respondent directed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">the</span> sheriff
and the defendant <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> are hereby ordered to place
the plaintiff de la <span class="SpellE">Viña</span> in possession of one house
of her choice among the three houses in question x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> .”<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">His motion for reconsideration having been denied, <st1:city><st1:place>Tucson</st1:place></st1:city>
came to this Court on certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
gave the petition due course and issued a preliminary writ of injunction upon a
P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">Through the incredible turnings and <span class="SpellE">twistings</span>
of this lawsuit one circumstance starkly juts out, though apparently ignored by
the respondent judge: <span style="">&nbsp;</span>that a final <span class="SpellE">judgement</span>, directing Juana T. de la <span class="SpellE">Viña</span>
to <u>vacate</u> the lot she leased from petitioner, to <u>remove</u> her
buildings thereon and to <u>restore possession</u> to petitioner (a judgment
affirmed by this Supreme Court since 1960) stands to this day unimplemented and
not executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the terms of
the judgment, the respondent court, which is duty bound to enforce it, has, on
one pretext or another, ordered possession of one building of her choice
restore to the judgment debtor, and refused to order its demolition, although
the creditor has asked for it, and it is directed in the final judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, such action is in plain abuse of
discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">That this situation should not be tolerated any longer is
self-evident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To allow further evasion
of a judgment that became final years ago does nothing but discredit judicial
processes and cast contempt and disrepute upon the ad­ministration of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whether or not the respondent De la <span class="SpellE">Viña</span>
is or is not the owner of the buildings is without relevance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She has been ordered to remove the buildings
and return possession of the land to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
by a final adjudication that may no longer be altered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having failed for years to do so voluntarily,
it is but proper that the sheriff be now allowed to demolish the buildings and
the landlord recover possession of his land (Rule 39, section 14) in order that
the judgment in his favor be not reduced to a mockery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the respondent judge to deny the judgment
creditor his remedy on the ground that the tenant-owner of the buildings can
not be deprived thereof without due process is a perversion of the
constitutional provision; for she has had ample opportunity to be heard, and
was heard, before the judgment of eviction against her became final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor does the question of sentimental value of
the property constitute a justification for refusal to execute that
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As ruled by Judge <span class="SpellE">Moya</span>, any prejudice that may ensue can be adequately
compensated by a damage award.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent De la <span class="SpellE">Viña's</span> belated
contention that the buildings are not on petitioner's land is not entitled to
serious consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this claim had
any truth in it, the said respondent would not have failed to invoke it in the
main case or in the two proceedings initiated by her in the Court of Appeals to
block execution of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
having done so, the claim, even if true, is now barred by <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the writ of certiorari is granted, and the
orders of February 3, 1965 and December 17, 1964, issued by the respondent
Judge Francisco <span class="SpellE">Arca</span>, directing that, private
respondent De la <span class="SpellE">Viña</span> be placed in possession of one
of the houses in question, and denying the petition for their demolition, are
