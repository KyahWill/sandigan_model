<span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> Gloria, private respondent herein, instituted
against Rosario <span class="SpellE">Artuz</span> Civil Case No. M-79 in the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> for consolidation of
ownership of a parcel of land.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint stated that on October 10, 1964 Rosario <span class="SpellE">Artuz</span> executed in favor of <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span>
Gloria a deed of sale with right to repurchase within a period of one (1) year
of a parcel of residential land located in <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tapaz</span>, <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>, containing an
area of 750 square meters and embraced in Tax Declaration No. 3516 for a
consideration of P2,025.00; that the defendant allegedly failed to exercise her
right to repurchase within the <span style="">stipulated
period; that the plaintiff had been in possession of the property immediately
after the execution of the document; and that said plaintiff had been paying
the taxes thereon.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In her answer the defendant Rosario <span class="SpellE">Artuz</span>
admitted the existence of the deed of sale with right to repurchase but denied
the legality and genuineness thereof and alleged as affirmative defenses that
the document in question was an equitable mortgage, the real intention of the
parties being merely to secure the payment of a loan in the amount of
P2,025.00; that the defendant, who was then deaf, to<span style="">tally blind and senile, did not understand English and was made to
affix her <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> on the alleged deed of sale with
right to repurchase upon representation of the plaintiff that the same was a
mere equitable mortgage; that the defendant had remained in possession of the
property in question and had been paying the taxes thereon; that a</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">tender of payment was made by defendant to
the plaintiff on or before October 10, 1965 to repurchase the property but
plaintiff refused to accept the amount of P2,025.00 because he was asking for a
much bigger amount of P6,000.00; that by reason of such refusal, the defendant
consigned the amount of P2,025.00 with the court; and that the actual amount of
the loan received by the defendant from the plaintiff was only P1,525.00
inasmuch as the amount of P500.00 was retained by plaintiff as interest on the
transaction.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision dated <st1:date month="12" day="26" year="1969">December
 26, 1969</st1:date>, the lower court ordered the consolidation of the title
and/or ownership over the property in question in the name of the plaintiff
because:</p>

<blockquote>"From the evidence of the plaintiff, it appears that he bought
the property in question from the original defendant, namely, the deceased Rosario
<span class="SpellE">Artuz</span>, <span style="">on </span>October
10, 1964, for a purchase price of P2,025.00, with said vendor-a-retro reserving
the right to repurchase within a period of one (1) year from the <span style="">date thereof, <span class="SpellE">i</span>.
e., under a 'Deed of Sale with Right of Repurchase' (see <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'A'), which the vendee-a-retro registered </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the Office of the
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>; that immediately upon the
execution of the document of sale, the plaintiff, as vendee-a-retro, took
actual and material posÂ­session of the property bought and constructed a <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> house thereon, which is presently occupied by his son,
the picture of which <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> house, is Exhibit 'B'; that
since the time said plaintiff took actual and physical possession of said
property, nobody prevented him from doing so, much less has his possession of
the same been disturbed by anybody up to the present time; that when plaintiff
took possession of the property in question, there were three (3) coconut, two
(2) orange and three (3) mango trees already standing thereon, the former are
now fruit bearing which said plaintiff had enjoyed and/or per</span><span style="">ceived </span><span style="">and as to the mango trees, it is only this
year that they are bearing fruits as the plaintiff was smoking them; that the
property bought is covered by Tax Declaration No. 3516, still in the name of
the vendor-a-retro, the original defendant (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'C')
which has not yet been declared </span><span style="">in his </span><span style="">name
because at the time he bought said property, the same was delinquent in real
estate taxes since the year 1953, that when he paid the delinquent real estate
taxes on June 20, 1966 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'D'), he was not able to
pay all the delinquent taxes and besides, the land was then involved in the
instant case, which was filed by said plaintiff on July 2, 1966, and that said
property in question was not redeemed and/or repurchased by anybody on or
before the expiration of the date of reÂ­purchase on October 10, 1965.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>For what has been said, above, there <span style="">can be no </span>more dispute that <span style="">the plaintiff bought the property in litigation from the deceased
original defendant, Rosario <span class="SpellE">Artuz</span>, for the </span><span style="">sum </span><span style="">of P2,025.00, on October 10, 1964, with right of repurchase within a
period of one (1) year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The period of
one (1) year within which to repurchase having expired without the
vendor-a-retro having exercised her right to repurchase the property sold, it
follows as a consequence thereof, that the plaintiff, is entitled to
consolidation of his ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
the fact that the original defendant, Rosario <span class="SpellE">Artuz</span>,
as vendor-a-retro deposited the repurchase price of P2,025.00, with the court
on August 30, 1966, under Official </span><span style="">Receipt
</span><span style="">No. 595356, issued by the Clerk
of Court <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> B. Dorado, with which counsel for
the substituted defendants wanted to be transferred with the Philippine
National Bank, <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> City </span><span style="">Branch, in </span><span style="">his urgent motion filed on October 8, 1968 (see pp. 53-55, record), is
not only the best reflection and healthiest index that she knew that what she
had executed in favor of the plaintiff was a sale with right of repurchase (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'A'), the same deposit having been made by her on
August 30, 1966, before she died on February 11, 1968, and after the expiration
of the period of repurchase but also an abandonment and/or waiver of what she
had alleged in the answer that the real </span><span style="">intention </span><span style="">of the
parties, <span class="SpellE">i</span>. e., the vendee-a-retro and vendor-a-retro,
in the Deed of Sale with Right of Repurchase (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'A') was only an 'Equitable Mortgage.'</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This appeal is meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the record discloses that the defendants and their counsel
have been lackadaisical in attending to the case, substantial justice demands
that petitioners be given their day in court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It appears from the answer that the vendor-a-retro, Rosario <span class="SpellE">Artuz</span>, who died on <st1:date month="2" day="11" year="1968">Feb<span style="">ruary 11, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">, was deaf and blind and was senile when she
was made to <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> the alleged deed of sale with
right to repurchase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The document is
written in English which was not understood by Rosario <span class="SpellE">Artuz</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer alleged that the intention of the
parties was only to execute a deed of equitable mortgage to secure the loan of
P2,025.00; and that Rosario <span class="SpellE">Artuz</span> actually received
only the amount of P1,525.00 because the private respondent retained the amount
of P500.00 as interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear that
the defendants have a meritorious defense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their motion for new trial should have been granted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The nature of the document in question was squarely placed in
issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants contend that the
document was only an equitable mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The third paragraph of Article 1606 of the Civil Code of the Philippines
provides that âthe vendor may still exercise the right to repurchase within
thirty days from the time final judgment was rendered in a civil action on the
basis that the contract was a true sale with right to repurchase." Hence
even if after a new trial it is found that the document in question is a true
sale with right of repurchase, the defendants may still exercise the right to
repurchase the land in question within thirty days from the time final judgment
is rendered.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In view of the foregoing,
it is no longer necessary to remand this case to the lower court for a new
trial.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court erred in not allowing the defendants, as
successors-in-interest of Rosario <span class="SpellE">Artuz</span>, to
repurchase the land within thirty days from the date the decision had become
final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the petitioners had duly
consigned the reÂ­purchase price, their consignation of the amount of P2,025.00
validly effected redemption.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby set aside
and the private respondent's complaint for consolidation of ownership is
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners are declared
