				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Direct appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of
Manila in its Civil Case No. 53072, ordering appellant to pay P1<span class="GramE">,431.64</span>, plus interest, P200.00 attorneys’ fees and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">As consignee of shipment of books and magazines, from <st1:state><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:state> to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
on board the M/S "EFFIE MAERSK", the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Philippine Education Co., Inc. filed with the appellant <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operator, Manila Port Service, (a branch of the Manila Railroad Company) a
provisional claim (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. G) <span class="GramE">for</span>
shortage and/or damage, dated <st1:date year="1960" day="29" month="6">June 29,
 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The carrying vessel
arrived at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place>
on that same day, June 29, and the last discharge of its cargo was done on <st1:date month="6" day="30" year="1960">June 30, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A formal claim with full data was filed and
received on October 25; amended claim was submitted later, for P1<span class="GramE">,431.64</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Manila Port Service rejected the claim as not filed on time,
and action was begun on <st1:date month="6" day="29" year="1961">June 29, 1961</st1:date>,
in the City Court of Manila, that rendered judgment for the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appeal was taken to the Court of First
Instance, which also found for the plaintiff, as hereinabove described.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied, the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator
elevated the claim to this Court, alleging that the provisional claim was
insufficient; that the formal claim was made beyond the 15-day period from last
discharge of cargo, and hence, there was non-compliance with paragraph 15 of
the Management Contract, prescribing timely filing of the claim as condition
precedent to recovery; and that the judgment rendered by the Court below was
not in conformity with the said contract that limited recovery to invoice
value, and in no case to exceed P500.00 for each package.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the appeal meritorious, for the reason that the
provisional claim, Exhibit G, is evidently premature and speculative and <span class="GramE">was</span> not in substantial compliance with paragraph 15 of the
Management Contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit G is dated
June 29, 1960, the same day the vessel carrying the cargo arrived in port, and
before it had discharged the cargo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is no showing anywhere in the record that on the day the provisional claim had
been made, the consignee had already discovered, or had been reliably informed,
of a shortage or damage to its goods.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The claimant was merely speculating on a possibility, and this is shown
by the detail that the provisional claim was for "<span class="SpellE">shortlanded</span>
and/or landed in bad order" cargo, justifying the inference that the
consignee was then still uncertain about the existence or nature of the alleged
damage.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has repeatedly rejected, as insufficient, damage
claims made prior to the discharge of the last package from the vessel:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shell Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Compañia</span>
General de <span class="SpellE">Tabacos</span>, L-20230, July 30, 1965; Fireman's
Fund Ins. Co. vs. Manila Port Service, L-22454, April 29, 1966, 16 S. C. Rep. <span class="SpellE">Anno</span>. p. 795; Domestic Ins. Co. vs. Manila Railroad Co.,
L-24066, <st1:date month="8" day="30" year="1967">Aug. 30, 1967</st1:date>, 20
S. C. Rep. <span class="SpellE">Anno</span>. <span class="GramE">1090; <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Surety &amp; Ins. Co. vs. Manila Railroad Co.,

fours with the one before us. No valid claim having been filed within the requisite
period, the damage claim of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is barred.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b><span style="">,</span> the appealed decision is reversed, and the complaint ordered
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs
