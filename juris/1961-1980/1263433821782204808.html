				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Court affirms on the merits the judgment of the court of
first instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> presided by respondent judge
affirming the judgment after joint trial of the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> finding the petitioner-accused guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crimes of grave oral defamation and slight physical
injuries, and reduces the award to the offended party of P7,000.00 for moral
and exemplary damages to the sum of P5,000.00 by way solely of moral damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Nora Aguilar Matura is the accused in two criminal
cases docketed as Criminal Case No. R-3165, for grave oral defamation and
Criminal Case No. R-3166, for slight physical injuries, of the municipal court
of <span class="SpellE">Argao</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said cases were tried jointly after which a
judgment dated <st1:date year="1976" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1976</st1:date>
was rendered by municipal judge Manuel Trinidad, Jr., the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in this joint trial:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding accused Nora Aguilar Matura, in <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No. R-3165, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of
the crime of grave oral defamation (slander) defined and penalized in Art. 358
of the Revised Penal Code, and, appreciating one (1) mitigating circumstance,
without any aggravating circumstance, she is hereby sentenced to suffer imprisonment
for six (6) months of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span><u> mayor</u>;

the crime of slight physical injuries defined and penalized in Art. 266 of the
Revised Penal Code, and, allowing one (1) mitigating circumstance in her favor,
without any aggravating circumstance to offset the same, she is hereby sentenced
to suffer imprisonment for ten (10) days of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">menor</span></u>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner appealed the judgment of conviction to the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, Branch XII, and the cases
were therein docketed as Criminal Case No. AR-368 for Grave Oral Defamation and
Criminal Case No. AR-369 for Slight Physical Injuries.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the course of her appeal, petitioner herein moved for a trial <u>de
novo</u> on the ground that the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Argao</span>
was not a court of record as it had no qualified stenographer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was denied by respondent
judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for new trial on <st1:date year="1975" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1975</st1:date> was also filed
alleging that "errors of law and irregularities were committed during the
trial in the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Argao</span> which
prejudiced the substantial rights of the accused."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was also denied by respondent
judge in his order of <st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="9">September 16,
 1975</st1:date> for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1976</st1:date>,
on the basis of the testimonial and documentary evidence before him, Judge <span class="SpellE">Laya</span> rendered judgment affirming the municipal court's
judgment of conviction and ordering her besides to pay the offended party Luisa
<span class="SpellE">Samargo</span> the amount of P7,000.00 as moral and
exemplary damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent portions
of the decision follow:</p>

<blockquote>"The complaining witness, Luisa <span class="SpellE">Sarmago</span>,
is a public school teacher at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Argao</span></st1:placename>

teacher, assigned at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Canbanua</span></st1:placename>

a distance of about two kilometers from the <st1:place><st1:placename>Central</st1:placename>

complaining witness is assigned.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1970" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1970</st1:date>,
the offended party held classes as usual, and shortly before dismissal at <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon, two (2)
intermediate girls went inside her room and told her that the herein accused
requested to see her at the Guidance <span class="SpellE">Counselling</span>
Room. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The complaining witness acceded to
the request, and after dismissal of classes she proceeded to the Guidance <span class="SpellE">Counselling</span> Room, about 10 to 15 meters from her own room.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon arrival at the Guidance <span class="SpellE">Counselling</span>
Room, the persons present were the accused, Miss Judith <span class="SpellE">Wedney</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Gamelo</span>, guidance coordinator, Mrs. Gloria <span class="SpellE">Alfafara</span>, home economics teacher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaining witness asked the accused
what it was that she wanted, but almost immediately the accused started to
flare up, accusing the complaining witness of being a paramour of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> husband.<span style="">&nbsp;

woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not only a shame to you but
also to your relatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You should be
ashamed not only to yourself, but also to your relatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You would be the cause of the death of my
husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Inday</span>
Soling and <span class="SpellE">Meding</span> told me that I am an unfortunate
wife, because I just do not know that you had immoral caresses with my
husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You even went up and down my
husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You lascivious you!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You should be ashamed of yourself; you are an
unmarried woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Don't mind about
myself, because I am already married.'</p>

<blockquote>"Accused further said:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'From A to Z, you have done with my husband.' Many other things were
said by the accused against the offended party, imputing immorality or lack of
the feminine virtues generally cherished by respectable unmarried women.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These imputations which tend to cause
dishonor of the offended party were made in the premises of the school and in
the presence of teachers and students.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"While the accused continued with her verbal insults, she
approached the offended party in a menacing manner, pointing an accusing finger
close to the face of the complaining witness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter brushed aside the pointed finger, and the accused became more
violent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She physically assaulted the
complaining witness, inflicting about ten (10) different abrasions and
contusions and requiring medical attendance for a period of three (3) to four
(4) days (Exhibit 'A').</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The issue raised is whether or not the Court below erred in
convicting the <span style="">accused.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"After a careful and thorough analysis and synthesis of the
evidence on record in these cases, this Court is of the opinion, and so holds,
that this Court could not give due credence to the evidence of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The guilt of the accused had been
convincingly and duly established beyond reasonable doubt and that the judgment
of the Court below, except for the modification hereinafter stated, should be
affirmed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The slight physical injuries and the grave oral defamation
complained of took place in the Guidance <span class="SpellE">Counselling</span>
Room.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Aside from the accused and the offended party only three
other persons were there:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Miss Judith <span class="SpellE">Gamelo</span>, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Alejandra</span> K. <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> and Mrs. Gloria <span class="SpellE">Alfafara</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Miss <span class="SpellE">Gamelo</span> and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> were witnesses for the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Alfafara</span> was presented
by the accused, but surprisingly, she did not testify on the incident at the
Guidance <span class="SpellE">Counselling</span> Room.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thus, in so far as the incident at the Guidance <span class="SpellE">Counselling</span> Room is concerned, the accused must have to
rely solely on her own version thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The testimonies of Miss <span class="SpellE">Tovilla</span> and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Alberastine</span> could not be believed not only because they
were positively shown to be not around the premises but also because their testimonies
as to the alleged exchange of words between Miss <span class="SpellE">Sarmago</span>
and the accused were not positive nor convincing as they were merely 'their own
gist' of what they allegedly heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the most, such testimony is inconclusive and at the least it is purely
imaginary.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The version of the accused that she was the one attacked by the
offended party and that she did not utter the defamatory words cannot be
sustained not only because of the strong, convincing and positive evidence for
the prosecution but also because her version is unnatural and against the
ordinary experience of man.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the first place, there can be no question that before <st1:date year="1970" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1970</st1:date>, as admitted by her,
her feelings were beyond description.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rumor that linked her husband to the offended party was too much to
bear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It not only pricked her pride as a
wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a cause for disillusionment
and disappointment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was as well a
solid ground for contempt, ill-will and hatred.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Since she had not seen the offended party from the time Miss <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span> visited her, as well as from the time she
allegedly heard the confession of her husband, she was just waiting for an
occasion to see Miss <span class="SpellE">Sarmago</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, as admitted by her, she was prepared for
a 'solo' confrontation with Miss <span class="SpellE">Sarmago</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such preparedness was beyond reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She left <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Canbanua</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>School</st1:placetype></st1:place>
not knowing what her feelings were.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She <span class="SpellE">travelled</span> all the way to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Central</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>School</st1:placetype></st1:place> not knowing still what her
feelings were.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She arrived at the
Guidance <span class="SpellE">Counselling</span> Room not knowing yet what her
feelings were.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With more reason that she
could not describe her feelings when she saw Miss <span class="SpellE">Sarmago</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As she puts it on her own words, her feelings
during all these times were 'indescribable'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"She further admitted that the incident was an outlet for the
unburdening of her emotions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She felt unburdened
after that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was relieved after that
and for the first time she could describe her feelings.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is therefore to be expected that when she decided to meet
Miss <span class="SpellE">Sarmago</span> she was prepared for the firing line and
to hold at bay her imagined enemy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thus, upon seeing Miss <span class="SpellE">Sarmago</span>, the
accused completely forgot herself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was her most natural reaction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Convincingly, therefore, the accused was the aggressor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Then again, if it were true that Miss <span class="SpellE">Sarmago</span>
was the aggressor, it is surprising that the accused had her injuries treated
only the following day and she did not file any action, whether criminal or administrative,
against Miss <span class="SpellE">Sarmago</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"IN THE LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, judgment is
hereby rendered affirming the decision of the Court below promulgated on <st1:date year="1975" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1975</st1:date>, with the modification
that the accused is hereby ordered to pay the offended party the amount of
P7,000.00 as moral and exemplary damages.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With costs against the accused."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1976</st1:date>
within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, petitioner-accused
filed a notice of appeal from respondent judge's joint judgment of conviction
to this Court "since the issues to be raised are purely questions of
law."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his order of <st1:date year="1976" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1976</st1:date>, respondent judge
ordered the elevation of the records and the evidence to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, however, the private prosecution filed with
respondent judge under date of July 8, 1976 a motion to dismiss the appeal on
the ground that the appeal taken to respondent judge's court was "improper
and erroneous since the crime of grave oral defamation calls for a penalty of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span><u> mayor</u> in its maximum period to <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span></u>
in its minimum period (from 4 months and one day to two (2) years and 4
months), it is clearly within the range of concurrent jurisdiction prescribed
in Sections 44 (f) and 87 (c) of the Judiciary Act of 1948 as amended,"
and the appeal from the municipal court's conviction of the offense of grave
oral defamation should have been taken direct to the Court of Appeals or to
this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an Order dated August 27,
1976, respondent judge, ignoring the fact that he had already taken cognizance
of the joint appeal (and that the appeal from the municipal court's conviction
for the crime of slight physical injuries was concededly within his court's
exclusive appellate jurisdiction and was in no way being challenged by the
prosecutor) and rendered his earlier judgment of April 14, 1976 affirming the
municipal court's judgment of conviction, granted the motion to dismiss the
appeal further ordering that "if the accused could not obtain a writ of
preliminary injunction or restraining order from the Supreme Court, this court
will automatically issue a writ of execution of judgment after twenty-one (21)
days from today."</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the two petitions at bar.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first (L-44550-51) seeks a review of respondent judge's judgment
affirming her conviction and the second (L-44552-53) seeks the setting aside of
respondent judge's later order of dismissal of her appeal (to the court of
first instance) and to restrain the announced execution of the municipal
court's judgment of conviction and to have this Court review her conviction by
respondent judge as per her notice of appeal on questions of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court considered the two petitions together and in its Joint
Resolution of <st1:date year="1977" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1977</st1:date>
gave due course to both petitions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitions were submitted for decision on <st1:date year="1977" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1977</st1:date> after the parties' filing of their
respective joint briefs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's brief on appeal concentrated on the alleged errors committed
by respondent judge in affirming the conviction, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>
(1) in not granting a trial <u>de novo</u>; (2) in not granting a new trial;
(3) in finding petitioner-accused guilty of grave oral defamation and slight
physical injuries; and (4) holding her liable for moral and exemplary damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court in the interest of an expeditious disposition of cases
on their merits and its aversion to splitting jurisdiction and multiplicity of
actions and appeals has resolved to squarely pass upon the assigned errors on
their merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This approach renders moot
the second petition seeking to set aside respondent judge's later order of <st1:date year="1976" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1976</st1:date> dismissing the appeal
to his court, which he had already passed upon anyway in his earlier decision
of <st1:date year="1976" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1976</st1:date> affirming
the conviction and imposing furthermore the P7,000.00 award for moral and
exemplary damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to note
that assuming that the private prosecutor, without the intervention of the
fiscal on behalf of the State, had the authority and personality to file the
motion for dismissal of the appeal, respondent judge, if he found the petition
to be meritorious, should not have ordered the dismissal of the appeal (which
had been timely filed within the fifteen (15) day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period) but instead should have forwarded the appeal to this Court, as the
court of proper appellate jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This would have been in consonance with the ruling in <span class="SpellE"><u>Bello</u></span><u> vs. Court of Appeals</u><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></u></span></a>
that a timely appeal misdirected to a court of first instance should not be
dismissed but should be instead certified by it to the proper appellate court,
so as not to sacrifice substance to form and subordinate substantial justice to
a mere matter of procedural technicality.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's first
contention is that respondent judge should have conducted a trial <u>de novo</u>
on her appeal from the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Argao</span>
because the latter was not a court of record as it had no court
stenographer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find the same to be
without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without going into the veracity of petitioner's allegation that
there was no court stenographer in the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Argao</span>,
it is clear from the decision rendered by the municipal court that the two
criminal cases were tried jointly, the proceedings were duly recorded in
accordance with R.A. 6031 and a detailed statement of the evidence presented by
the prosecution and the defense was made.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the decision of respondent judge, he made express reference to
"the transcripts of stenographic notes of the proceedings before the court
below in its session of <st1:date year="1971" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1971</st1:date>
which stenographer <span class="SpellE">Leonisa</span> B. Gonzales took
down."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In <span class="SpellE"><u>Celestino</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">Luzano</span>
v. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Honorio</span> Romero et al</u>., this Court held
that "even when there is no duly appointed court stenographer, the
proceedings can still be recorded by a competent stenographer duly designated
by the Judge or upon agreement of the parties."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
It is noteworthy that neither in the petition filed nor in any of the pleadings
submitted as annexes does it appear (at any time during the hearing in the
municipal court or before judgment was rendered or at any time before appeal
was taken <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>) that any objections to the
correctness of the transcript of stenographic notes were ever made by
petitioner-accused.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is next contended by
petitioner that respondent judge erred in denying her motion for a new
trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ground invoked is that
certain errors of law and irregularities were committed during the trial in the
municipal court consisting principally in the denial by the municipal judge of
her right to present the complainant Luisa <span class="SpellE">Sarmago</span> as
her witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find the contention to
be untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">A petition for a new trial is addressed to the sound discretion
of the trial court and the Court will not disturb the latter's action on appeal
in the absence of a showing of grave abuse.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There has been no abuse of judicial discretion here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the record, it is shown that during the
trial in the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Argao</span>, the
complainant testified as a witness for the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If petitioner-accused wanted to propound
questions to her, this could have been readily accomplished during the
cross-examination of the complaining witness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If petitioner's counsel failed to do so or to elicit the desired
testimony from the complainant, it is now too late to cure that
deficiency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the accused had called
no less than nine (9) witnesses in her behalf.</p>

<p class="BODY">The State aptly refuted petitioner's contention in this
wise:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The charges against
petitioner of grave oral defamation and slight physical injuries do not involve
a complicated factual setting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both
charges arose from a single incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
it was, the records were already bloated with the testimonies of nine (9)
defense witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Viewed from this
perspective, respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Laya</span>, or the Municipal
Court of <span class="SpellE">Argao</span> at that, was justified in denying
petitioner's Motion for New Trial, since under Section 6, Rule 133 of the Rules
of Court:</p>

<blockquote>'The court may stop the introduction of further testimony upon any
particular point when the evidence upon it is already so full that more
witnesses to the same point cannot be reasonably expected to be additionally
persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this power should be
exercised with caution.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's plaint
against her conviction has no basis for reversal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly held by respondent judge,
petitioner's version denying that she had uttered the defamatory words and that
the offended party had attacked her cannot be sustained "not only because
of the strong, convincing and positive evidence from the prosecution but also
because her version is unnatural and against the ordinary experience of
man."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Following settled jurisprudence,
this Court holds the findings of fact of the municipal court as affirmed by
respondent judge to be final, particularly, since this appeal is avowedly one
of "purely questions of law".</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that remains to be
considered is the award of P7,000.00 as moral and exemplary damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General correctly submits that there is no basis
for awarding exemplary damages in the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Art. 2230 of the Civil Code provides that in
criminal offenses exemplary damages as a part of a civil liability may be
imposed when the crime is committed with one or more aggravating
circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present case, no
aggravating circumstance was established by the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the award of moral damages is justified under Art. 100 of the
Revised Penal Code which provides that every person criminally liable for a
felony is also civilly liable, and Art. 2219 of the Civil Code which states
that moral damages may be recovered in a criminal offense resulting in physical
injuries, in libel, slander, and any other form of defamation, among
others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 2216 of the Civil Code
provides that no proof of pecuniary loss is necessary in order that moral damages
may be adjudicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such damages may be
adjudicated in crimes pursuant to Art. 2204 of the Civil Code according to the
aggravating or mitigating circumstances present.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General further correctly submitted that respondent
judge's basis for his award of moral damages is fully justified by his
decision, quoting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The law is well settled that 'Every person criminally liable
for a felony is also civilly liable.' (Art. 100, Revised Penal Code).</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is also well settled in this jurisdiction that moral
damages may be recovered in (1) a criminal offense resulting in physical
injuries; (2) libel, slander, or any other form of defamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Art. 2219, Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No proof of pecuniary loss is necessary in
order that moral damages may be adjudicated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Art. 2216, Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
so because moral damages include physical sufferings, mental anguish, fright,
serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, social
humiliation and similar injury and although incapable of pecuniary computation,
they may be recovered if they are the proximate result of the defendant's
wrongful act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Art. 2217, Civil Code) as
in the case at bar.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With the foregoing legal touchstone in the light of the <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> fact that the offended party is a public
school teacher of good repute and that the defamatory utterances were made by
the accused who is also a public school teacher in the presence of her
co-teachers and within the view and hearing distance of the pupils whose
characters they are supposed to mold by their teachings and examples but
lamentably the herein accused had shown otherwise, this Court is left without
any choice but to apply the law as the evidence directs and its conscience clearly
dictates."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the offenses committed by petitioner may be deemed
mitigated by the circumstance of her having acted under passion and obfuscation
as asserted by her and found in the decision of respondent judge and that the
award of P7,000.00 may accordingly be reduced to P5,000.00 as moral damages.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed judgment of <st1:date year="1976" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1976</st1:date> is affirmed with the modification
that petitioner-accused is ordered to pay the offended party Luisa <span class="SpellE">Sarmago</span> the sum of P5,000.00 as moral damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With costs against petitioner-accused.</p>
