				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Has the protestee in an election contest the right to demand the opening of 
ballot boxes in precincts included in the petition of protest, if he (the 
protestee) did not include the said precincts in his counter-protest, nor make 
express allegations in his answer of irregularities prejudicial to him in the 
precincts subject of the petition of protest, and the protestant, before the 
hearing, informed the court that he wanted to have the ballot boxes in<i> first 
eight precincts only</i> brought to court, and may probably desist from 
presenting the boxes in the other twelve precincts, and after the termination of 
the revision in the first eight precincts, expressly waives his right to present 
the remaining twelve ballot boxes on the ground that he has no more funds to pay 
for getting the ballot boxes, considering the revision in the first eight 
precincts sufficient for his protest? This is the question presented in the 
above entitled case.
<p>In the elections for municipal and provincial officials held in the 
municipality of Padada, Davao, on November 10, 1959, Gregorio M. Matas was 
declared elected as municipal mayor over the other candidate Isidro M. Ordaneza. 
On November 27, 1959, Ordaneza filed a petition of protest contesting the 
election of Matas, alleging frauds, abuses and irregularities in Precincts Nos. 
2, 7, 7-A, 9, 13, 14, 16, 17 and 38 (9 precincts). On November 28, 1959, he 
filed an amended petition wherein he included for revision, in addition to the 
precincts already mentioned in his original petition, Precincts Nos. 1, 8, 10, 
11, 12, 14-A, 18, 35, 35-A, 36 and 39 (11 precincts). Matas filed an answer to 
the amended petition of protest denying the allegations of supposed frauds, 
irregularities, etc., in the conduct of the elections in the precincts 
mentioned. He made no specific allegation or averment, in the various paragraphs 
of denial in his answer, that frauds and irregularities in the counting and 
appreciation of the ballots were committed <i>to his prejudice,</i> thus 
limiting himself to a denial of the alleged irregularities in the counting of 
the ballots in favor of the protestant. In the last paragraph of his denial, he 
made specific allegation that in all the precincts, names that sounded similar 
or equal to his (protestee's) name or surname were counted in his favor and on 
the other hand, names in ballots that did not sound equal or similar to 
protestant were counted in protestant's favor, although these did not change the 
result of the election.</p>
<p>The answer also contains a counter-protest alleging frauds and irregularities 
committed in Precinct No. 15. The prayer demands the dismissal of the 
protestant, the bringing in of the ballot box in Precinct No. 15, together with 
the registry list and a recount of said ballots in said precinct No. 15, and a 
request for the payment of costs and expenses by protestant, with a general 
prayer for relief.</p>
<p>Before proceeding with the bringing in of the ballot boxes, the protestant 
filed a motion dated January 9, 1960, alleging that—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"2. That in all probability, protestant will only request for the actual 
counting of 8 precincts whereas with respect to the other remaining precincts, 
protestant will probably only seek for the comparison of the registry 
lists;</p>
<p>"3. That in case necessity arises for the reopening of the entire ballot 
boxes under protest, the protestant may from time to time, increase his bond to 
answer therefor, pursuant to the pertinent provisions of the Revised Election Law;</p>
<p>"4. That protestant, therefore, is constrained to seek for reduction of the 
cash bond to the sum of P500.00 and to the Surety Bond in the sum of P2,500.00." 
(Motion to Reduce Bond, Annex '1', Answer to Petition; Memo for respondents)." 
(p. 3, Memo for Respondents)</p></blockquote>
<p>Protestee Matas did not object to the motion but apparently agreed thereto as 
the court in the order dated January 14, 1960 indicates. The said order is as 
follows—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On petition and recommendation of the parties when this case was called for 
hearing this morning, the following are hereby appointed Commissioners: Atty. 
Eriberto A. Unson, representing the Court; Atty. Gregorio Palabrica, 
representing the protestant; and Atty. Primitivo C. Buagas, representing the 
protestee, for the re-opening, recounting and classification of the ballots 
boxes corresponding to Precincts Nos. 2, 7, 7-A, 13, 14, 17, 38 and 39 of the 
Municipality of Padada, Dayao, and for this purpose said Commissioners are 
hereby authorized to conduct the re-opening of the ballot boxes corresponding to 
the above-named precincts starting tomorrow, January 15, I960, at 8:00 a.m. in 
the office of the Clerk of Court, and to continue everyday thereafter from 8:00 
a.m. to 12:00 noon and from 2:00 to 5:00 pm. until the same is finished." (pp. 
3-4, Memo for Respondents.)</p></blockquote>
<p>When the commissioners were about to complete the recounting and 
classification of the ballots in the first 8 precincts already brought before 
the court, protestee Matas filed an urgent motion dated January 21, 1960 praying 
that an the other 12 ballot boxes be opened also and the ballots therein 
revised. Opposition thereto was filed by the protestant on January 26, 1960. 
Shortly thereafter, i.e., on February 8, 1960, the protestant moved that since 
he had previously filed a petition to reduce the bond and said reduction was 
approved by the court and he believes that he has already sufficient number of 
votes to off-set the majority obtained by the protestee, he declared that he 
"waives and renounces his right to proceed with the opening and recounting of 
the ballots contained in the other 12 precincts, namely, Nos. 9, 16, 1, 8, 10, 
11, 12, 14-A, 18, 35, 35-A and 36, but demanding comparison of the Voter's 
Registry lists for the election years 1955, 1957 and 1959 of the aforementioned 
precincts, and praying for the dismissal of the protest as to said 12 remaining 
precincts. (Annex "G" of Petition).</p>
<p>The court promulgated two separate orders, one dated February 20, 1960 
granting the protestant's motion dated February 3, 1960, and another dated 
February 22, 1960, dismissing the protest as regards the twelve unrevised 
Precincts Nos. 9, 16, 1, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14-A, 18, 35, 35-A and 36. The protestee 
moved to reconsider the order of the court but the court denied the motion for 
reconsideration. Whereupon this petition for certiorari with preliminary 
injunction was filed before Us.</p>
<p>The petitioner has not filed any memorandum before Us evidently because the 
petition and the arguments which he adduced before the court below, in support 
of his petition regarding the ballot boxes which the protestant declined to 
have opened, were reproduced in his petition in this case, and he believed 
evidently that they are complete and sufficient, for the purposes of his 
petition before Us. The said arguments may be summarized as follows: The right 
of protestee to ask for the opening of the ballot boxes in question is 
recognized by Section 175 of the Revised Election Code which provides that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Upon the petition of any interested party, or <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio</span>, if the interests 
of justice so require, the court shall immediately order that the copies of the 
registry lists, the ballot boxes, the election statements, the voters' 
affidavits, and the other documents used in the election be produced before it 
and that the ballots be examined and the votes recounted, and for such purpose 
it may appoint such officers as it may deem necessary and shall fix the 
compensation of each at not less than five pesos but not more than fifteen pesos 
for every election precinct which they may completely revise and report 
upon."</p></blockquote>
<p>Further that it is not necessary for the protestee to include in his 
counter-protest precincts already covered by the protest, in accordance with 
section 176 of the Revised Election Code, which provides—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * (c) Should the protestee desire to impugn the votes received by the 
protestant in other precincts, he shall file a counter-protest within the same 
period fixed for the answer, serving a copy thereof upon the protestant by 
registered mail or by personal delivery or through the 
sheriff."</p></blockquote>
<p>Section 175 of the Revised Election Code refers to the right of any party in 
an election to file the corresponding petition of protest. The provision that 
the court may "<i>motu, proprio,</i> if the interest of justice so requires," 
immediately order that documents be produced and ballots examined and votes 
recounted evidently refers to a case, where an election contest has already been 
presented and <i style="font-style: italic;">the court desires to make</i><span style="font-style: italic;"> further examination in the 
interest of justice</span>. In the case at bar, the court did not order but actually 
refused the revision in the 12 precincts which the protestant waived to present; 
so, the provision in question is not applicable.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the result of an election is a matter of public 
concern, so that the right of a protestee, to demand revision in precincts not 
included in his counterprotest should not be denied. Our answer to this 
suggestion is that in this jurisdiction the rule has invariably been to deny 
revision in precincts <i>that are not contested either in the petitim of protest 
or in a counter-protest</i>. To permit revision in precincts not subject of 
petition of protest or counter-protest would mean allowing any party to conduct 
a fishing expedition and unduly prolong the contest resulting in cutting down 
the term of the winner. The decisions of this Court and those of the House 
Electoral Tribunal are to the effect that a protestant must specify in his 
answer the precincts in which he desires or demands revision, and that he may 
not demand the revision in precincts which he did not include in his protest. If 
the protestant is not permitted to demand revision in precincts not included in 
his petition of protest, neither should the defendant or protestee be allowed to 
do so; to permit otherwise would encourage unscrupulous litigants to frustrate 
prompt termination of protests, delay proceedings and even frustrate the will of 
the electorate, and would give protestee more rights than the protestant. They 
should be treated equally.</p>
<p>Paragraph (c) of section 176 quoted above limits the right of the protestee 
to the filing of a counter-protest within the same period for the answer and the 
latest decision of this Court is to the effect that the right of the protestee 
is to demand revision only in those precincts in which he demanded revision in 
his counter-protest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The main theme of petitioner is that the trial court committed an abuse of 
discretion in granting the motion of respondent that he be authorized to 
withdraw 36 out of the 92 precincts covered by his protest on the ground that 
after the recanvass of the first 29 precincts he found that his protest with 
regard to said 36 precincts was unnecessary. Petitioner contends that to allow 
such withdrawal at that stage would be tantamount to amending the protest which 
can no longer be done because the period fixed for doing so bad already expired. 
And this contention is apparently predicated upon the fact that at the time the 
motion for withdrawal was filed the recanvass of the votes had already started 
and the period for filing the pleadings has expired.</p>
<p>"There is no merit in this contention. While it is true that the period for 
filing the pleading has already expired and the recanvass of the ballots covered 
by the protest has already started when the motion for withdrawal was filed and 
protestee had traversed the allegation of the motion insofar as the 36 precincts 
are concerned, it can not be said that the trial court erred in allowing the 
withdrawal considering that the move of protestant in asking for such withdrawal 
is not to amend his protest but merely to inform the court that he was desisting 
from it with regard to said 36 precincts. We have no quarrel with the theory 
that an election protest is impressed with public interest in the sense that the 
public is interested in knowing what has actually happened in the elections, but 
that issue is not involved herein. This is a matter that wholly depends upon 
protestant even if the withdrawal of the protest is not effected if the 
protestant desists from acting thereon or from presenting evidence to 
substantiate it that will be the end of tile ease. The most that can happen is 
that the protest should be dismissed for lack of action or proof and to <i>such 
eventuality protestee can not object nor complain because the precincts 
concerned are not involved in his counter protest</i>. In other words he can not 
allege prejudice if the withdrawal is allowed. This is the exclusive prerogative 
of protestant." (Dimaporo vs. Estipoña, et al., 112 Phil., 220).</p></blockquote>
<p>The following circumstances also indicate the conformity of the protestee 
that revision be limited to the. first eight precincts. Before the hearing 
started the protestant announced his intention to limit revision only to the 8 
precincts mentioned in his original petition. The protestee did not file any 
objection or opposition thereto; he actually consented to the revision only of 
such 8 precincts. The reservation by the protestant (to present the other 12 
precincts if said is necessary for his protest) was made also without objection 
on the part of the protestee. There are reasons why a protestant should have the 
right to withdraw from his protest some precincts included in his original 
protest, even without the consent of the protestee. The protestant is required 
by the election law to file a protest within two weeks after the proclamation of 
the results of the election (in case of provincial or municipal officials). 
The rule enforced in this jurisdiction is not to permit the protestant or the 
protester to demand revision of the ballots in precincts which one or the other 
has not protested in the petition of protest or counter-protest. Inclusion of 
additional precincts after the expiration of the period for filing the protest 
is not permitted. (Fernando vs. Constantino, 37 Off. Gaz., 107; Almeda vs. 
Silvosa, et al., 100 Phil., 844; Araneta vs. Araneta, 47 Phil. 850.) 
Consequently, the proteatant has a very limited time to investigate where the 
frauds or irregularities have taken place, so that the precincts wherein the 
same occurred may be included in his petition of protest. Naturally, he should 
be allowed a leeway to include in his petition of protest as many precincts as 
he has been informed or believes that irregularities have been committed; at the 
same time he should be given the choice of the precincts in which he desires 
revision, after he had had the opportunity to determine, what evidence of such 
irregularities, he may be able to muster in support of his petition of protest. 
There is no valid reason why he should not be permitted to withdraw his petition 
as to precincts where he has subsequently found no evidence of irregularities or 
frauds. Not only is this conducive to simplification and limitation of the 
issues but it will ultimately result in a prompt dispatch or termination of the 
election contest. Because of the fact that the revision of ballots involves a 
very long and tedious process and the corresponding shortness of the term of 
office, withdrawal of the petition as to precincts already included in the 
original protest should be encouraged instead of discouraged.</p>
<p>The above view is also supported by the fact that the choice of precincts in 
which the ballots are to be revised is a choice of the evidence that the 
protestant desires to submit to the court for the purpose of proving that he had 
actually received a greater number of votes than his opponents. As indicated 
above, while the rule that the court may, in the invest of justice, order the 
revision in other precincts is justified by the fact that the question of 
election is a public question, the need of prompt termination of the contest 
demands limitation of revision to those precincts which the protestant deems 
sufficient to establish the allegations of his petition of protest. This 
practice of admitting evidence of facts not alleged is not allowed in ordinary 
cases; neither should it be permitted in election contests, especially because 
in this case the protestee demanded that the other 12 precincts be brought to 
court for revision only after he found out that the results of the revision 
would perhaps be adverse. To permit such change would mean allowing any party to 
change the issues at any time of the trial as his conveniences demands. To cap 
it all, he made the demand subject to the obligation of the protestant; to 
deposit the expenses necessary to the revision.</p>
<p>We hold that in view of the foregoing reasons and circumstances above 
indicated, the protestee voluntarily acquiesced to limiting the revision to the 
eight precincts already, examined, and may not, at this stage, demand revision 
of all the other 12 precincts.</p>
<p>Wherefore for all the foregoing considerations the petition, for certiorari 
is hereby denied, with costs against the petitioner.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., 
Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, </i>and <i>De Leon, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
