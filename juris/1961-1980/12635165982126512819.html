				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The validity of a court-martial proceeding was challenged in the lower
court on due process grounds to show lack of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner, a sergeant in the Philippine Army
and the accused in court-martial proceeding, through a writ of certiorari and
prohibition, filed on April 17, 1963, with the lower court, sought to restrain
respondents, the officers, constituting the court-martial, that was then in the
process of trying petitioner for alleged violation of two provisions of the
Articles of War, from continuing with the proceedings on the ground of its
being without jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
likewise a plea for a restraining order, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of<span style=""> </span>his petition, but it was
unsuccessful.</p>

<p class="BODY">No response, either way, was deemed necessary by the then
Presiding Judge of the lower court, now Justice <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Yatco</span> of the Court of Appeals, as petitioner had, in
the meanwhile, been convicted by the court-martial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court verdict, render on September
16, 1963, was one of dismissal, as in its opinion, "this case had already
become moot and academic * * *."</p>

<p class="BODY">An appeal was taken to us, the same due process objections
raised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We think that the question
before us is of such import significance that an easy avoidance through the
technicality of the "moot and academic" approach hardly
recommendation itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For reasons to be
more fully set forth, we find such court-martial was not lawfully <span style="">convened, and, conse</span>quently devoid of
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we reverse
the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">There was a stipulation of facts submitted to the lower court on
July 10, 1963, to the following effect:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"That the arraignment petitioner on December 17, 1962 was for the
purpose of avoiding prescription pursuant to Article of War 38 of one of the
offenses with which <span style="">the accused is
charged since, as charged, same</span><span style=""> was </span><span style="">allegedly
committed on or about December 18, 1960; That prior</span><span style=""> </span>to the said arraignment, no written
summons or <u>subpoena</u> was issued addressed to the petitioner or his
counsel, informing them of said arraignment; that instead of said written
summons or <u>subpoena</u> Col. <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> Samson,
Constabulary Staff Judge Advocate called up First <span style="">Sergeant Manuel <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> at the Headquarters </span>II
Philippine Constabulary Zone, Camp Vicente Lim, <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span>,
Laguna on December 16, 1962 by telephone with instructions to send the
petitioner to HPC, Camp <span class="SpellE">Crame</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, under escort, for <u>arraignment</u> and only for arraignment; That upon
arrival in HPC, the petitioner was directed to proceed to the PC Officer's
Clubhouse, where a General Court-Martial composed of the respondents, created
to try the case of 'People vs. Capt. <span class="SpellE">Egmidio</span> Jose,
for violation of Articles of War 96 and 97', pursuant to paragraph 10, Special
Order No. 14, Headquarters Philippine Constabulary, dated 18 July 1962, * * *,
was to resume, as scheduled, the trial of People vs. Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Numeriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ohagan</span>, for violation of Articles of War 64, 85, and
97'; That it was only at the time (December 17, 1962) that petitioner learned
that he will be <u><span style="">arraigned </span></u>for
alleged violation of Articles of War 85 and 97, after being informed by one of
the respondents, Capt. <span class="SpellE">Cuadrato</span> Palma as Trial Judge
Advocate why he was there; That prior to that arraignment on December 17, 1962
there was no special <span style="">order published by
the Headquarters Philippine Constabulary creating or </span>directing the
General Court-Martial composed of the respondents to arraign and try the case
against the petitioner, there however was already an existing court trying
another case; That the respondents relied on the first <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>
of the Acting Adjutant General, HPC, Camp <span class="SpellE">Crame</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, dated December 14, 1962 and addressed to the
Trial Judge Advocate, of the General Court-Martial * * <span style="">* </span>directing the said Trial Judge Advocate to refer the case
against petitioner to the above-mentioned court, * * *; That the above
paragraph 10, Special Order <span style="">No. 14
dated 18 </span>July 1962, does not contain the phrase 'and such other cases
which may be referred to it', but however said orders were amended only on 8
January 1963, to include such phrase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>*
* *"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was further stipulated that petitioner's counsel did object to
his arraignment asserting that a general court-martial then convened was
without jurisdiction, as there was <span style="">no
special order designating </span>respondents to compose a general court-martial
for the purpose of trying petitioner, as petitioner was not furnished a copy of
the charge sheet prior to his arraignment as required in the Manual for
Court-Martial, except on the very day thereof, and as there was no written
summons or <u>subpoena</u> served on either the petitioner, as accused, or the
counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents, acting as the general
court-martial, overruled the above objections, and the Trial Judge Advocate was
then ordered to proceed to read the charges and specifications against
petitioner over the vigorous objections of counsel, it was shown, likewise, in
the stipulation of facts, that the case, having been postponed to February 21,
1963, petitioner's counsel had in the meanwhile complained to the Chief of
Constabulary against the proceedings on the ground of its nullity, and sought
to have respondents restrained from continuing with the trial of petitioner due
to such lack of jurisdiction but the Chief of Constabulary ruled that he could
not act on such complaint until the records of the trial were forwarded to him
for review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With such a ruling, and with
the denial of two other motions by petitioner upon the court-martial being
convened anew on February 21, 1963, one to invalidate his arraignment on
December 17, 1962, and the other to quash the complaint based on the denial of
due process and lack of jurisdiction, the present petition for certiorari and
prohibition was filed with the lower court.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As above noted, the lower court dismissed the petition due to its
belief that, petitioner having been convicted in the meanwhile, there being no
restraining order, the matter had become moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was set forth earlier, we differ, the
alleged lack of jurisdiction being too serious a matter to be thus summarily
ignored.</p>

<p class="BODY">The firm insistence on the part of petitioner that the general
court-martial lacks jurisdiction on due process grounds, cannot escape
notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basic objection was the
absence of a special order "designating respondents to compose a general
court-martial to convene and try the case of petitioner; * * *".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was expressly stipulated that the
respondents were convened to try the case of a certain Capt. <span class="SpellE">Egmidio</span> Jose and not that filed against petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, the opening paragraph of
the stipulation of facts made clear that he was arraigned on December 17, 1962
by respondents as a general court-martial appointed precisely to try the above
Capt. Jose solely "for the purpose of avoiding prescription pursuant to
Article of War 38 of one of the offenses with which the accused is charged * *
*".</p>

<p class="BODY">Is such a departure from what the law and regulations<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
prescribe offensive to the due process clause?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If it were, then petitioner should be sustained in his plea for a writ
of certiorari and prohibition, as clearly <span style="">the denial of the constitutional right would oust respondents </span>of
jurisdiction, even on the assumption that they were vested with it
originally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our decisions to that effect
are impressive for their unanimity.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Harden v. The Director of Prisons,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Justice <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, speaking for the Court, explicitly
announced that "deprivation of any fundamental or constitutional
rights" justify a proceeding for <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> on the ground
of lack of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Abriol</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Homeres</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
is even more categorical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case,
the action of a lower court, denying the accused the opportunity to present proof
for his defense, his motion for dismissal failing, was held by this Court as a
deprivation of his right to due process.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As was made clear by the opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Ozaeta</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"No court of justice under our system of
government has the power to deprive him of that right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the accused does not waive his right to be
heard but on the contrary – as in the instant case – invokes the right, and the
court denies it to him, that court no longer has jurisdiction to proceed; it
has no power to sentence the accused without hearing him in his defense; and
the sentence thus pronounced is void and may be collaterally attacked in a
habeas corpus proceeding."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A recent decision rendered barely a month ago, in <span style="">Chavez </span>v. Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
is even more in point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, again, <u>habeas</u>
<u><span style="">corpus</span></u><span style=""> was relied upon </span>by petitioner whose
constitutional <span style="">rights were not
respected, </span>but, in addition, the special civil actions of <span style="">certiorari and </span>mandamus were likewise
availed of, in view of such consequent lack of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stress though in the opinion of Justice
Sanchez, was on <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The course which <span style="">petitioner takes </span>is correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> is a high <span style="">prerogative writ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is </span>traditionally considered as an
exceptional <span style="">remedy to release a person
whose </span>liberty is illegally restrained such as when the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> constitutional rights <span style="">are disregarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such defect
results in the absence </span>or loss of jurisdiction and therefore invali­dates
the trial and the consequent conviction of the accused whose fundamental right
was violated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That void judgment of
conviction may be challenged by collateral attack, which precisely is the
function of <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This writ may issue even if another remedy which is <span style="">less </span>effective may be availed of by
the defendant."</p>

<p class="BODY">The due process concept rightfully referred to as "a <span style="">vital and living force </span>in our
jurisprudence" calls for <span style="">respect
and deference, otherwise </span>the governmental action taken suffers from <span style="">a </span>fatal infirmity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was so aptly expressed by the then
Justice, <span style="">now </span>Chief Justice, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"*
* * acts of Congress, as well as those of the Executive, can deny due process
only under pain of nullity, and judicial proceedings suffering from the same
flaw are subject to the same sanction, any statutory provision to the contrary
notwithstanding.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The crucial question, then, is <span style="">whether such failure to comply with the dictates of the applicable law </span>insofar
as convening a valid court martial is concerned, amounts to a denial of due <span style="">process.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We hold that it does.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>There
is such a denial not only under the broad standard which delimits the scope and
reach of the due process requirement, but also under one of the <span style="">specific elements of procedural </span>due
process.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be admitted that there is no controlling <span style="">and precise definition of due </span>process
which, at the most <span style="">furnishes a standard
to which governmental action should conform in order to impress with the stamp
of </span>validity any deprivation of life, liberty or property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A
recent decision </span>of this Court, in <span class="SpellE">Ermita-Malate</span>
Hotel v. Mayor of Manila,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
treated the matter thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is
responsiveness to the supremacy of reason, obedience to the dictates of
justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Negative­ly put, arbitrariness
is ruled out and unfairness avoided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
satisfy the due process requirement, official action, to paraphrase <span class="SpellE">Cardoso</span>, must not outrun the bounds of reason and result in
sheer oppression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due process is thus
hostile to any official action marred by lack of reasonableness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Correctly has it been identified as freedom
from arbitrariness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the embodiment
of the sporting idea of fair play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
exacts fealty 'to those strivings for justice and judges the act of officialdom
of whatever branch <span style="">'in the light of
reason drawn from considerations of fairness </span>that reflect [democratic]
traditions of legal and political thought.’"</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is such a reliance on the broad reach of due process the sole
ground on which the lack of jurisdiction of the court-martial convened in this
case could be predicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Recently,
stress was laid anew by us on the first requirement of procedural due process,
namely, the existence of the court or tribunal clothed with judicial, or
quasi-judicial, power to hear and determine the matter before it.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
This is a requirement that goes back to <span class="SpellE">Banco</span> <span class="SpellE">Español</span>-Filipino v. <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>; a
decision rendered half a century ago.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is the express admission in the statement of facts that
respondents, as a court-martial, were not convened to try petitioner but
someone else, the action taken against petitioner being induced solely by a desire
to avoid the effects of prescription; it would follow then that the absence of
a competent court or tribunal is most marked and undeniable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a denial of due process is therefore
fatal to its assumed authority to try petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writ of certiorari and prohibition should
have been granted and the lower court, to repeat, ought not to have dismissed
his petition summarily.</p>

<p class="BODY">The significance of such an insistence on a faithful compliance
with the regular procedure of convening court-martials in accordance with law
cannot be over-emphasized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was
pointed out by Justice <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> in <span class="SpellE">Ruffy</span>
v. The Chief of Staff, Philippine Army:<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
"Courts-martial are agencies of executive character, and one of the
authorities 'for the ordering of courts-martial has been held, to be attached
to the constitutional functions of the President as Commander in Chief, in­<span style="">dependently </span>of legislation.'
(Winthrop's Military Law and Precedents, 2d Edition, p. 49.) Unlike courts of
law, they are not a portion of the judiciary." Further on, his opinion
continues:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“'Not belonging to the
judicial branch of the government, it follows that courts-martial must pertain
to the executive department; and they are in fact simply instrumentalities of
the executive power, provided by Congress for the President as Commander in
Chief, to aid him in properly commanding the army and navy and enforcing
discipline therein, and <span style="">utilized </span>under
his orders or those <span style="">of his authorized
military representatives.’"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is even more indispensable, therefore, that such
quasi-judicial agencies, clothed with the solemn responsibility of depriving
members of the Armed Forces of their liberties, even of their lives, as a
matter of fact, should be held all the more strictly bound to manifest fidelity
to the fundamental concept of fairness and the avoidance of arbitrariness for
which <span style="">due </span>process stands as a
living vital principle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were
otherwise, then, abuses, even if not intended, might creep in, and the
safeguards so carefully thrown about the freedom of an individual, ignored or
disregarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Against such an
eventuality, the vigilance of the judiciary furnishes a shield.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is one of its grave responsibilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a <span style="">trust must be lived up to; </span>such a task cannot be left undone.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of respondent Court of September 16,
1963, dismissing the petition for certiorari and prohibition, is reversed, and
the writ of certiorari and prohibition granted, annul­ling the proceedings as
well as the decision rendered by <span style="">respondents
as a court-martial and </span>perpetually restraining them from taking <span style="">any </span>further action on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without pronouncement as to costs.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">CASTRO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">My concurrence in the decision of this Court in the able pen of
Mr. Justice Fernando is unqualified.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, I feel compelled to express my views on cer­tain
disturbing facets of this case which to my mind not merely in­dicate a
censurable denial of due process, but as well pointedly <span style="">exposes, </span>from the perspective of military
law, tradition and usage, the intrinsic nullity of the proceedings had by the
general court-martial in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">The history and development of courts-martial as tribunals for
the enforcement of discipline in bodies of military character<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
underscore several time-honored tenets: a <span style="">court-martial is an ins</span>trumentality of the
executive power, to aid the President as com­mander-in-chief in properly
commanding and controlling the armed forces and enforcing discipline therein;
it has only such powers as are expressly vested in it by statute, or as may be
derived from military usage; it is a creature of <u><span style="">orders</span></u><span style="">; </span>as a
purely executive agen­cy designed for military uses, it is brought into being
by a military order; it is transient in its duration; it has no fixed place of
session, nor permanent office or clerk, no inherent power to issue a judicial
mandate; its judgment is in quintessence simply a recommendation until approved
by the proper revisory commander; its competency cannot be expanded by
implication; and no intendment in favor of its acts can be made where their
legality does not indubitably appear.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The original concept of a court-martial in British law, even with
American and Philippine statutory accretions, remains funda­mentally the same
today, with few modifications of consequence.</p>

<p class="BODY">W<span style="">hy</span> a
court-martial is essentially transient in nature, and is as a rule appointed to
try a single case, is not difficult to com­prehend.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Firstly</u>, in a military organization, every officer thereof
belongs to a particular branch of service and is for that reason assigned to a
position which calls for the discharge, in a conti­nuing manner and for a
period which is denominated <u>tour of duty</u>, of duties pertaining to his
specialization or branch of service.  Thus an ordnance officer is assigned to ordnance work, a field artillery
officer to field artillery duties, a finance officer to duties involving money
and finances, a quartermaster officer to duties involving supplies and other
aspects of logistics, and so forth.  Although generic military duty perforce embraces occa­sional membership
in courts-martial, it does not envision such membership as a continuing
assignment of long duration.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Secondly</u>, the court-martial, as its history and
development demonstrate, is a blend of the jury system and the one-judge
(non-jury) judicial system.  In common
law jurisdictions, an accused is tried by his peers.  In one-judge (non-jury) jurisdictions, the accused is tried by a
lone judicial arbiter.  In a
court-martial trial, <span style="">the entire </span>panel of officers who constitute the court-martial is
judge and jury.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Thirdly</u>, by virtue of military law, tradition and usage, a
court-martial is constituted to try a particular case (or several cases
involving the <u>same</u> accused). After completion of the trial and resolution
of necessary post-trial incidents, the court is dis­solved, and the members
thereof return to and resume their res­pective normal assignments.  Even the law member of a court-martial (who
rules on questions of law and admissibility of evi­dence and advises the other
members on court procedure and the legal intricacies of trial), rejoins his
regular office or unit (al­though he may thereafter again be appointed law
member of a sub­sequent general court-martial, or an ordinary member of another
general court-martial, or even president of still another general <span style="">court-martial).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In sum, a court-martial </span>is
not a continuing permanent tri­bunal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus it is that, in the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the
general rule has commanded undiminished respect that a court-martial <span style="">is </span>appointed
to try only a single case, or several cases pertaining to a <span style="">single individual.  There is of course no legal impediment to empowering a
court-martial, in the same or­der creating it, to try more than one case, but
such creations are the exception and quite infrequent. And even if
"roving" or "semi-permanent" courts-martial were the rule
in our Armed </span>Forces, which I do <span style="">not
concede, the general court-martial in the </span>case at <span style="">bar was not one such.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is undisputed - as in fact it is stipulated by the parties -
that the general court-martial in question was constituted to try Captain
Egmidio Jose.  Nothing in the
phraseology of the order that created it authorized it to try the petitioner
staff-sergeant Santiago.  It could not
therefore proceed in any manner, which we can view as properly coming within
the periphery of its limited powers, with respect to the charge against
Santiago. When it arraigned Santiago on December 17, 1962, it was absolutely
without legal power to do so, and the arraignment was a futile ceremony, as
meaningless as it was inefficacious.</p>

<p class="BODY">Undeniably the record shows that the order creating the
court-martial to try Captain Egmidio Jose was belatedly amended on January 8,
1963 by the addition of the phrase, "and such other cases that may be
referred to it.  But this afterthought
could not, in law, serve to invest with validity an act that was <u>ab</u> <u>initio</u>
a nullity.  And it is of no moment that
the petitioner was thereafter arraigned anew, assuming <u><span style="">arguendo </span></u>that he was.  The proceedings would have been palpably
objectionable on the patent ground that the offense imputed to the petitioner
which was committed on De­cember 18, 1960 was already time-barred on December
18, 1962, pursuant to the provisions of Article of War 38 of Commonwealth Act
408, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">As I see it, the arraignment of the petitioner by the general
court-martial constituted to try Captain Egmidio Jose was a despe­rate measure
resorted to to remedy a desperate situation - solely to interrupt the running of
the prescriptive period provided by Ar­ticle of War 38. This action was not
only completely devoid of any semblance of legality; it likewise conclusively
evinces gross negli­gence on the part of the military.  Why nothing was done toward the creation of a
court-martial to try Santiago within the two years following the commission of
the crime is not explained by the record, and I venture the opinion that there
can be no satisfactory ex­planation thereof.  The military authorities allowed that long pe­riod to lapse without any
assiduous effort at bringing the petitioner to the forum of a duly constituted
general court-martial.  This should
never come to pass in the Armed Forces where disciplinary measures of whatever
specie or character, by law and tradition and usage, should be swiftly
administered.  For, the officer of ave­rage
military learning knows or should be cognizant of the prolife­ration in the
Articles of War of provisions designed to insure speedy trial of accused
persons.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because an accused charged with a serious offense such as that in
the case at bar - unlawful disposition of ten carbines belong­ing to the
Government - is ordinarily placed in arrest and is no entitled to bail, time is
of the essence as undue delay would ob­viously be prejudicial to the
accused.  The Articles of War (Com­monwealth
Act 408 as amended by Rep. Act 242) and implementing military manuals and
regulations explicitly enjoin that the report of investigation, if practicable,
be completed within 48 hours, that the investigator forthwith make the proper
recommendation as to the disposition of the case, and that the officer
exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the accused act on the
report of the investigator with deliberate speed.  As a matter of fact, Article of War 71 explicitly commands that
when a person subject to military law is placed in arrest or confinement
immediate steps be taken to try him or to dismiss the charge; that when a
person is held for trial by general court-martial his commanding officer, within
eight days after the accused is arrested or confined, forward the charges to
the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction and fur­nish the
accused a copy of such charges; and that if the same be not practicable, he
report to superior authority the reasons for the de­lay.  The same Article of War poises the threat of
punishment (as a court-martial may direct) over any officer responsible for
unne­cessary delay "in investigating or carrying the case to a final con­clusion."</p>

<p class="BODY">The record propels me to the conclusion that everything that the
military authorities did or neglected to do with respect to the case of the
petitioner was contrary to all the imperatives of mili­tary law, tradition and
usage.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, it is my considered view that at the time the peti­tioner
was arraigned, there was no court-martial validly in exis­tence that could
