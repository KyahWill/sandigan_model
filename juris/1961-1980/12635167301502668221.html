				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The information (for <span style="">estafa)
filed with the Court of First Instance of Pampanga in Criminal Case No. 5232
against Rosendo Resuello and others alleged that Rosendo Resuello, as President
and General Manager of </span>the Security <span style="">Credit and </span>Acceptance <span style="">Corporation,
and </span>his <span style="">co-defendants, </span>as
officers of the same entity, ha<span style="">d
"received for deposit from FLORENTINA </span><span style="">G. </span><span style="">LIMPIN the amount of EIGHT HUNDRED (P800.00) PESOS, with the
obligation, on the part of the accused to return and deliver the amount so </span>deposited
<span style="">upon demand the said accused far from complying
with the said obligation, conspiring together and mutually helping and aiding
one another, with intent of gain and to defraud and with grave abuse of
confidence and by means of deceit, once in possession of the said money, did
then and there wilful­ly, unlawfully and feloniously misapply, misappropriate
and convert to their own personal </span><span style="">use a</span><span style="">nd
benefit the said </span>amount of EIGHT <span style="">HUNDRED
(P800.00) PESOS, end in </span>spite of <span style="">repeated
and insistent demands made on the said accused to return and deliver the money,
said accused failed and refused and still fail and refuse to return or deliver
the said amount of P800.00, to the damage and prejudice of the said FLORENTINA
G. LIMPIN in the aforesaid amount, Philip­pine currency".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On June 24, 1968 Resuello filed a motion to quash the information
on the ground that the facts charged do not constitute an offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing the parties, the court, in its
order of October 10, 1968, sustained the motion aforesaid and, as a result,
dismissed the case, with costs de oficio, upon the ground that the liability of
the defendant and his co-accused was purely civil in nature.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due time the Provincial Fiscal appealed from the order of
dismissal by filing the corresponding notice of appeal, and on April 21, 1969
the State filed its brief claiming therein that the trial court committed the
follow­ing errors:</p>

<blockquote>"I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred in considering the
transaction involved as a simple loan;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"II.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred in concluding that the
relationship between the accused-defendant and the complaining witness is one
of creditor and debtor;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"III.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court likewise erred in resolving
that defendant's liability is only civil, not criminal; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"IV.<span style=""> </span>The lower court finally erred in quashing the
information on the ground that the facts alleged do not charge an
offense."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On July 5, 1969, instead of filing his brief, the accused
appellee filed a motion to dismiss the appeal "on the ground that the
order appealed from is not appealable and has become final and executory",
claiming in this con­nection that under Section 17 of the Judiciary Act, as
amended by Republic Act No. 5440 - which took effect on September 9, 1968, or
more than one month before the perfection of the appeal - the remedy of appeal
does not lie from the trial court's order of dismissal since only a question of
law is sought to be reviewed, the proper <span style="">remedy
being, therefore, a petition for review on certiorari.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The motion to dismiss must be denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In cases similarly situated, and as long as
the steps formerly required for the perfection of an appeal were taken in due
time, we have adopted the policy of giving due course to the appeal, without
prejudice to requiring the appel­lant to file the necessary petition for review
by certiorari - which is also a form of appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, appellee, through counsel, appears to have received
copies of the brief filed by the State on April 23, 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On May 22 of the same year, his attor­neys of
record filed a motion for first extension of time to file their brief, which this
Court granted on May 27, 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again on
June 20, 1969, his attorneys filed a motion for second extension for the same
purpose which <span style="">We </span>also granted on
June 25 of the same year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only on
July 5, 1969 that the motion under consideration was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These facts show, in our opinion, <span style="">that </span>appellee is guilty of laches.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the motion to dismiss the State's appeal is
denied, but appellant is hereby required to file within ten (10) days from
notice hereof the necessary petition for review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellee, on the other hand, is required to
file his brief within the reglementary period to be counted from notice of said
petition for review.</p>
