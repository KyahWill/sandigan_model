<span class="SpellE">Villarin</span>, thereby inflicting upon the body of said <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> hack wound,

wanted "<span class="SpellE">puto</span>."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>
responded, these persons demanded for his money and personal belongings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> informed
them that he had no money, but threw down some blankets and <span class="SpellE">clothings</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this juncture, three persons destroyed the
<span class="SpellE">wallings</span> of the house and entered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Emiliana</span> <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> recognized two of them to be <span class="SpellE">Arasa</span>

<span class="SpellE">Jawalil</span>, armed with a shotgun and bladed weapon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not know the name of the third but

weapon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Arasa</span>
Han asked for <span class="SpellE">Emiliana</span> who was then hiding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While he was looking for her, <span class="SpellE">Anjal</span> and a companion ransacked the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Arasa</span> Han
found <span class="SpellE">Emiliana</span>, he pulled her but she resisted and
ran towards her father, <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>
intervened, <span class="SpellE">Arasa</span> Han hacked him with a barong,
hitting him on his left neck almost severing the head from the body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, <span class="SpellE">Emiliana</span>
was able to escape to a neighbor­ing house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After looting the house, the trio left, bring­ing with them blankets,
two pants, two pairs of rubber shoes, shirts, a bolo, chickens and other
personal effects, all valued at one hundred pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Emi­liana</span>
returned to the house, she found her father already dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A report was immediately relayed to the head­quarters
of the 110th PC Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A patrol was at
once sent to the scene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Emiliana</span> informed the patrol that she recognized <span class="SpellE">Anjal</span> <span class="SpellE">Jawalil</span> and <span class="SpellE">Arasa</span> Han as two of the perpetrators but did not know the
name of the third, although she would be able to identify him if she sees him
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The patrol arrested <span class="SpellE">Arasa</span> Han and <span class="SpellE">Anjal</span> <span class="SpellE">Jawalil</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon being
investigated, they admitted having committed the crime and implicated <span class="SpellE">Yakan</span> <span class="SpellE">Pahoto</span> as their
co-conspirator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their affida­vits were
taken, Exhibits "D" AND "E".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Pahoto</span> was
brought face to face with <span class="SpellE">Emiliana</span>, she readily
recognized him as one of the three that came up her house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Emiliana</span> knows <span class="SpellE">Arasa</span> Han and <span class="SpellE">Anjal</span> <span class="SpellE">Jawalil</span> very well because they used to pass by her

<span class="SpellE">Pahoto</span> was arrested as the third unidentified suspect
and "when I brought <span class="SpellE">Kamboto</span> before <span class="SpellE">Erniliana</span>, she identified <span class="SpellE">Kamboto</span>
(sic) as one of those three persons who went up their house."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This use of the name <span class="SpellE">Kamboto</span>
in reference to appellant <span class="SpellE">Yakan</span> <span class="SpellE">Pahoto</span>
is the only instance in the record where appel­lant is referred to by the name
of <span class="SpellE">Kamboto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
may be due to the fact that towards the end of the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Emiliana</span>, counsel for accused in response to the court's
question "What is the name of the other accused" answered, "<span class="SpellE">Yakan</span> <span class="SpellE">Kamboto</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">thisincident</span>

if <span class="SpellE">Emiliana</span> had really identified <span class="SpellE">Pahoto</span>
before Sgt. Gregorio during his investigation of the suspects, it is not
explained at all why Sgt. Gregorio was not asked during his testimony to
positively identify appellant <span class="SpellE">Pahoto</span> as the person
referred to by him as <span class="SpellE">Kamboto</span>, who was thus
"readily fingered"<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">The only evidence relied upon for the conviction of appellant <span class="SpellE">Yakan</span> <span class="SpellE">Pahoto</span> were the affidavits
of the two other accused, <span class="SpellE">Arasa</span> Han and <span class="SpellE">Anjal</span> <span class="SpellE">Jawalil</span>, admitting their
commission of the crime and naming <span class="SpellE">Pahoto</span> as one of
their companions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These affidavits were
repudiated by <span class="SpellE">Arasa</span> Han and <span class="SpellE">Anjal</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jawalil</span> as having been extracted from them by force
and maltreatment, when they testified and set up their defense of alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court correctly rejected their
claims, as they had not complained of such alleged maltreatment to the City
Judge, Hon. Francisco S. <span class="SpellE">Atilano</span>, before whom they
executed the same, after the contents thereof had been duly interpreted to them
in the dialect by the Court interpreter, <span class="SpellE">Hamid</span> <span class="SpellE">Amerin</span>, who witnessed their signing.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>But while these affidavits were properly
taken by the trial court as admissions validly and voluntarily given by said <span class="SpellE">declarants</span> and as valid evidence against them, said
affidavits, duly objected to, could not be validly considered as evidence
against appellant <span class="SpellE">Yakan</span> <span class="SpellE">Pahoto</span>,
in the ab­sence of independent proof of any conspiracy implicating <span class="SpellE">Pahoto</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General, therefore, correctly
reported in his brief that "there is really no evidence on record that <span class="SpellE">Emiliana</span> <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> was able to
identify <span class="SpellE">Yakan</span> <span class="SpellE">Pahoto</span> as
the third man who went up their house" and that the State's evidence is
insufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt appellant <span class="SpellE">Yakan</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pahota's</span> guilt of the crime charged.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>
