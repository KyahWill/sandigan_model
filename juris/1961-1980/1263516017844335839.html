				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Respondent Ventura Vasquez was petitioner's taxi driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime on December 22 or 23, 1961, at about
<st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 a.m.</st1:time>, while driving
petitioner's taxicab, he <span class="SpellE">vomitted</span> blood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from his <span class="SpellE">hemoptysis</span>,
he suffered back pains, fever and headache.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He re­ported to petitioner the fact of his having <span class="SpellE">vomitted</span>
blood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He <span style="">was </span>sent to <span class="GramE">petitioner company's</span>
physician, Dr. Roman, who treated him and sent him to <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.

for six days.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, he was
admitted at the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Institute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There he stayed until <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1962</st1:date> under the medical care of Dr.
Mario <span class="SpellE">Lirag</span>. Dr. <span class="SpellE">Lirag</span>
diagnosed his ailment as pulmonary tuberculosis, moderately advanced in both
lungs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon his discharge on <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1962</st1:date>, he was clinically
improved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His X-ray examination,
however, showed the same finding, i.e., PTB, moderately advanced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has not resumed work.</p>

<p class="BODY">Offshoot of the foregoing is respondent's claim filed on <st1:date year="1962" day="9" month="5">May 9, 1962</st1:date> with the Workmen's
Compensation Commission.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In affirming the decision of the Hearing
Officer, the Commission ordered petitioner:</p>

<blockquote>"1. To pay the
claimant, thru this Commission, the sum of THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED
THIRTY-TWO and 30/100 (P3,732.30) PESOS as compensation as of August 11, 1964,

hundred pesos which may accrue in his favor as weekly compensation pursuant to
Section 55 of the Act." </blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The case is now before us
on review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Two questions are raised
by petitioner:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) respondent's claim
should have been dismissed for his failure to file the notice of injury and
claim for compensation required by Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation
Act; and (2) the claim for compensation is directed against Amador Santos, not
against petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1. Sickness manifested itself on December 22 or 23, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Claim was filed on <st1:date year="1962" day="9" month="5">May 9, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner argues that by Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act,
the claims should be thrown out of court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because, according to petitioner, such claim was not filed within two
months following illness.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner's case must
fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stabilized jurisprudence is that
failure of the employer to file with the Commission notice of <span class="SpellE">con­troversion</span> set forth in the second paragraph of Section
45 of the Workmen's Compensation Act is a waiver of the defense that the claim
for compensation was not filed within the statutory period and a forfeiture of
the employer's right to controvert the claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner here knew of respondent's illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, it did not controvert respondent's right
to compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Constructively, such
failure is an admission that the claim is compensable.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2. Petitioner's averment that respondent driver had no cause of
action against petitioner is equally without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent's claim for compensation herein is
directed against petitioner A.D. Santos, Inc. Petitioner, in answer to the
claim, categorically <span class="GramE">admitted<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that</span> claimant was its taxi driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Add to this the fact that the claimant
contracted pulmonary tuberculosis by reason of his said employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And respondent's cause of action against
petitioner is complete.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But petitioner cites the
fact that respondent driver, in the course of his testimony, mentioned that he
worked for the City Cab operated by Amador Santos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This will not detract from the validity of
respondent's right to compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For,
the truth is that really at one time Amador Santos was the sole owner and
operator of the City Cab.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
subsequently transferred to petitioner A.D. Santos, Inc. in which Amador Santos
was an officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The
mention by re­spondent of Amador Santos <span style="">as
</span>his employer in the course of his testimony, in the words of this Court
in <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Sugay</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><u>vs</u>. <u><span style="">Reyes</span></u><span style="">, G.R. No.</span></span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">L-20451,
</span><st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="12"><span style="">December 28, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, "should not be allowed to confuse the facts relating to
employer-employee relationship," for "when the veil of corporate
fiction is made </span>as a <span style="">shield to
perpetrate a fraud and/or confuse legit­imate issues (here, the relation of
employer-employee), the same should be pierced."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
