Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental for
having allegedly raped Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Macahilos</span>, a
thirteen-year old girl, on the night of <st1:date year="1972" day="17" month="9">September

was sentenced, under the charge aforesaid, "to suffer life imprisonment,
to indemnify the offended party in the amount of P6,000.00, and to pay the
costs." From this judgment, the defendant has appealed, claiming that the
trial court erred:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By not dismissing the case against the
accused-appellant for lack of jurisdiction as there was no valid complaint
filed;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Granting, <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>,
that the trial court has jurisdiction, by not acquitting the
defendant-appellant for insufficiency of evidence;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By giving credit to the <span class="SpellE">unsworn</span>
testimony of complainant; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By not acquitting defendant-appellant on the
basis of his evidence."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first error assigned
by the appellant is that the trial court had not acquired jurisdiction over the
case since there was no valid complaint filed.</p>

<blockquote>"BAIL BOND RECOMMENDED:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P40,000.00."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant claims that the above-quoted complaint was not
subscribed and sworn to by the complainant, and, hence, not a valid complaint
within the scope of Section 2, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
In support thereof, the appellant cites the case of <u>People vs. Santos</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein the Court said the follow­ing:</p>

<blockquote>"We cannot consider the information, although signed by
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Bansuelo</span> to­gether with the fiscal, as
equivalent to the complaint required by law, because said in­formation lacks
the oath of the complainant; the <span class="SpellE"><u>jurat</u></span>
contained therein is the subscribed and sworn certification of the fiscal that
he had conducted the preliminary investigation in which the offended party had
taken no par­ticipation whatsoever; in very unequivocal terms, the information
commences with the statement that 'the undersigned fiscal accuse <span class="SpellE">Engracio</span> Santos of the crime of rape', the offended party
not having been mentioned at all as one of the accusers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x

<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"This Court has invariably maintained strict compliance with
the jurisdictional re­quirement of a complaint by the offended party, as defied
in Section 2 of Rule 106 and Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Palabao</span>
(L-8027, August 31, 1954), we considered insufficient an informa­tion filed
with the Provincial Fiscal, wherein the offended party signed at the bottom
there­of and above the signature of the prosecuting officer, the information
even reciting that the Provincial Fiscal charged defendant with the crime of
seduction at the 'instance of the of­fended party.' In the case of People vs.
Mar­tinez, (76 Phil. 559), this Court <span class="SpellE">motu</span> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span> dismissed the case for failure of the aggrieved
party to file the proper complaint for the of­fense of oral defamation,
although the accused never raised the question on appeal, thereby showing the
necessity of strict compliance with the legal requirement even at the cost of
nullifying all the proceedings already had in the lower court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The contention is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As pointed out by the Solicitor General, there was substantial
compliance with the rules since the complaint states the name of the defendant;
the designation of the offense by statute; the acts or omissions complained of
as constituting the offense; the name of the of­fended party; the approximate
time of the commission of the offense, and the place wherein the offense was
committed, as required by Section 5, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court; and, be­sides,
the complainant, Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Macahilos</span>, had subscribed
to her complaint of rape as shown in the opening paragraph of the complaint
which states:</p>

<blockquote>"The undersigned, Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Macahilos</span>,
herein Offended Party, <u>after having been duly sworn</u>, accuses <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> Salazar of the crime of Rape, x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>." (underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The ruling of the Court in the case of <u>People vs. Santos</u>,
cited by the appellant, is not conclusive for the reason that it was an
information that was filed therein and not a complaint; and the opening
paragraph of the information clearly and un­mistakably shows that it was the
fiscal alone who accused the respondent Santos with the crime of rape and the
offended party was not even referred to in the body of the information as
having requested its filing.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant also
contends that the trial court erred in not acquitting him for insufficiency of
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General
summarized the evidence of the prosecution as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The rape of Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Macahilos</span> took
place in their home barrio called <span class="SpellE">Ricorro</span>, a remote
and secluded place within the <st1:place><st1:placetype>territory</st1:placetype>

</span>Previous to the perpetration of the evil deed, at night time of
September 17, 1972, three young girls Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Macahilos</span>,
(the complainant, then 13 years old), <span class="SpellE">Bernardina</span>,
(complainant's 11-year old sister) and their cousin, Norma <span class="SpellE">Batulan</span>
(then 17 years old), slept in the <span class="SpellE"><u>sala</u></span> of the
humble <span class="SpellE">Macahilos</span> home in <span class="SpellE">Ricorro</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 24-26, &amp; 40, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,

the appellant, <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> Salazar, having somehow gained
unlawful access to the <span class="SpellE">Macahilos</span> home, rudely woke up
the 13-year old complainant as he touched and fondled her breasts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 26-27, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,

in his right hand, "pointing it" at the victim as he, in the
meanwhile, unilaterally enjoyed the victim's innocent breasts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 28-29, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,

aloud at one point because of pain, as the assailant pawed her breasts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(p. 40, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., May
8, 1973; p. 4, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., July 6, 1973).</blockquote>

</span>From the kitchen, he forced the terrified young victim down the back

<p class="BODY">The appellant assails the veracity of the testimony of the
complainant, claiming it is all a lie and a pure fabrication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But what powerful motive could have numbed
all sense of modesty and shame in a thirteen-year old girl, barely reaching the
age of puberty, and impelled her to concoct a story that would certainly bring
ignominy, dishonor and humiliation to her and her family?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if it were a fabrication, how could she
have told such a story and be cross-examined about it knowing that at any stage
her statements would be placed under the close scrutiny of men learned in the
law?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, it was only to vindicate
her honor that gave her the courage and tenacity to undergo the trauma of
recalling her harrowing ordeal which she would have preferred to forget and to
leave unknown to others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As has been
said:</p>

<blockquote>"A maiden especially a country girl like the offended party
herein, would not expose herself publicly and in court, airing acts so
repugnant to modesty as those involved in a narrative of acts constituting
rape, unless she is urged by the impelling force of sincerity and the honest
purpose of obtaining a redress for her grievance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shameless effrontery and cynicism alone
cannot make a girl face without a blush the ordeals of publicity in making a
nar­ration of rape; and we have not been shown that the offended party is a
shameless woman or anything of the kind."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The insinuation that this complaint
against the accused was filed in retaliation for the conviction of the uncle of
the complainant for the crime of rape and that the parents of the offended
party may have resented the appellant's occupation of a neighboring parcel of
coconut land is preposterous and absurd.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is against human nature and the ordinary course of things for the
said parents to sacrifice the honor, dignity and future of their daughter for
such nugatory motive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, there is
no evidence that the appellant was instrumental in the conviction of the
relative of the complainant as to motivate her parents to wreak their vengeance
upon him.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, We have meticulously reviewed the record and find
that the purported inconsistencies and improbabilities pointed out by the
appellant are more fancied than real.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the appellant claims that the prosecution failed to explain how
the accused gained entry into the house of the complainant which was barricaded
from the inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, it was established
that the appellant and his victim had been neighbors for quite some time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had also been shown that the accused had
stayed in the house of the complainant for a month's time and thus became
intimately familiar with the complainant's house.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant likewise points out that the complainant and her
companions in the house did not make an outcry when the accused dragged the
complainant to the kitchen and thence to the pineapple plantation where she was
raped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Persons, however, have different
reactions to similar situations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some
may manifest an aggressive or violent attitude, while others like the
complainant and her companions in the house, may cringe in a mute fearful
attitude.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fear is capable of producing
and having the effect of physical force required to overcome the resistance put
up by a victim of rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was this fear
impressed firmly in the minds of the complainant and her companions, by the
appellant's threat to kill the three of them, backed up by the dagger he was
then wielding, that overcame them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Coupled with this is the superior male strength of the accused and the
relative tender ages of the complainant and her companions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant stresses the improbability of the commis­sion of
the sexual act in view of the position taken by the accused in allegedly raping
the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues
thusly:</p>

<blockquote>"8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then comes the improbability of sexual
intercourse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant declared that
after she laid down the defendant-appellant removed his pants or underwear,
whichever is correct and then the latter removed her panty, he squatted near
her feet and then lifted her feet and placed them in his shoulders (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Pasal</span>, p. 7).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then she modified this by declaring that it
was not her feet that were placed on his shoulders but her legs were resting on
his shoulders and her feet were hanging on his back (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
<span class="SpellE">Pasal</span>, p. 45).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So that when her legs and feet were on that position while
Defendant-Appellant was squatting, that was the time when he inserted his organ
in her vagina (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Pasal</span>,
p. 7).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this position of the
Defendant-Appellant on a half-<span class="SpellE">sitted</span> position
(squatting) and the feet of the complainant hanging or dangling at the back of <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> Salazar while her legs were resting over her
shoulders, the position therefore of the vagina would be elevated than the
penis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vagina must be positioned
between her breast and abdo­men.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How
could <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> Salazar insert his penis, unless he
would lie over her with face down and her feet spread out or crossed around the
waist or thigh of Salazar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If sexual
intercourse is improbable with this position, then it is not true your Honor
that <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> Salazar had entered the house and
dragged the complainant down to the pine­apple plantation and raped her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, if his hand was holding a dagger
and his arms gripped her thigh she would have been wounded with the
dagger."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A rapist, however, rarely considers the position his victim may
have in the sexual act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His purpose is
to be sated and that alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or
not his victim is contorted is the least of his concerns. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It is not improbable, therefore, that the
appellant could have violated the complainant in the manner she described.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant likewise emphasizes the impossibility of the
commission of the crime because the medical certificate indicated that the hymen
was negative for laceration or tear and that the vaginal smear is negative for <span class="SpellE">spermatocytes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the absence of lacerations, abrasions or rashes in the genital
organ of the victim that would indicate forcible sexual intercourse can­not
definitely be a basis for concluding that a woman did not have sexual
intercourse.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It is not altogether impossible for the complainant to be endowed with an
elastic membrane so that no tear or laceration could be found therein after the
sexual act complained of.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor will the absence of <span class="SpellE">spermatocytes</span>
from the specimen taken from the complainant's vaginal canal disprove the com­mission
of the crime of rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The important
factor in rape is not emission of the semen, but penetration, and the crime is
deemed consummated even without complete penetration, it being sufficient that
the labia has been penetrated.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
In fact, it is not even necessary that there be a medical examination of the
victim in cases of rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not
the charge will prosper depends upon the evidence offered and so long as such
evidence convinces the court, a conviction for rape is proper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, it is not improbable that the
complainant washed herself not only for the sake of cleanliness but more particularly
in order to avoid possible conception.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant also assails the testimony of the parents of the
offended party, claiming it to be incredible and unworthy of belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The settled, long-standing rule where the
issues raised hinge on credibility of witnesses is for the appellate tri­bunal
to give due respect to the assessment of the facts made by the lower court,
said court having had the opportunity, not only of receiving the evidence, but
also of observing the conduct and demeanor of the witnesses while testifying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This rule should not be overturned unless
there is a showing that in making the disputed factual findings, the trial
court has over­looked or failed to consider certain facts of weight and
importance that could have materially affected the conclusion reached in the
case.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
In the instant case, there is no positive reason that would justify a reversal
of the rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyhow, the lone testimony
of the offended party is sufficient to sustain the conviction of the accused.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant further
contends that the trial court erred in giving credit to the <span class="SpellE">unsworn</span>
testimony of the complain­ant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appellant puts emphasis on the fact that the transcript of stenographic notes
of the trial held on <st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1973</st1:date>
does not show that the complainant had been administered the oath before her
direct examination.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, in the transcript of stenographic notes of the trial held
on <st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1973</st1:date>, the court
stenographer omitted the statement that the witness had previously subscribed
to an oath before giving her testimony.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But, this omission can be attri­buted to the court stenographer's
inadvertence or inexperience because at the resumption of the trial in the
afternoon of the said day, the same court stenographer stated that the witness
"testifying under the same oath,"<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
which would show that an oath had been previously administered to the
witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, it appears that
the complainant had been subjected to an extensive cross-examination by counsel
for the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant is now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from claiming that the witness was not under oath
when she testified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a party fails to
object to the taking of the testimony of a witness without the administration
of an oath, he will be deemed to have waived the objection.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant
contends that the trial court erred in not acquitting him on the basis of his
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense is alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the appellant, he was drunk on
the night in question and was sleeping in his house when the al­leged rape took
place and did not wake up until dawn of the next day when he became hungry.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the proffer of alibi made solely by the appellant as his
basic defense, We need only state that by now it is almost trite to say that
alibi is amongst the weakest of defenses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Easy to concoct, it may be properly credited only if established by
convincing and satisfactory proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
must be clearly shown not only that the accused was at some other place but as
well that it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime
at the time of its commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Guillermo
<span class="SpellE">Bendijo</span>, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Lajola</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cipriana</span> Salazar and <span class="SpellE">Julito</span>
Salazar who were presented by the appellant as witnesses in support of his
alibi merely declared that the appellant was drunk on the night in question;
that Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Lajola</span> had offered the appellant some wine
which the latter accepted; that Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Bendijo</span>
brought the appellant home because of his inebriation; and that his wife, <span class="SpellE">Cipriana</span> Salazar, attended to the appellant when he reached
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their declarations, however,
cannot serve to overthrow the testimony a Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Macahilos</span>
and Norma <span class="SpellE">Batolan</span> who positively identified the
appellant and definitely placed him at the <span class="SpellE">situs</span> of
the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Bendijo</span> left after bringing the appellant home and <span class="SpellE">Cipriana</span> Salazar and <span class="SpellE">Julito</span>
Salazar went to sleep after the appellant had laid down,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
so that they could not have known what the appellant did while they were
asleep.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, therefore, did not err in finding the accused <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> Salazar guilty of the offense of rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The commission thereof was with the use of a
deadly weapon, to wit a dagger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 4111, the imposable
penalty is <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> to
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two aggravating circumstances are
present in the commission of the offense, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the crime was committed in the night
time and in the dwelling of the offended party.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, appellant is sentenced to the penalty of Death,
and the indemnity is increased to P12,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As thus modified, the judgment appealed from is affirmed in all other
respects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against the appellant.</p>
