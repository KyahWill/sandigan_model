				<H3>MARIANO G. ALMEDA, SR., AND VALERIANA F. ALMEDA, PETITIONERS, VS. THE HON. JESUS Y. PEREZ, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, AND THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for prohibition and certiorari, with preliminary 
injunction, filed by petitioners, seeking to set aside and declare null and void 
the orders, dated March 15, 1961 and May 8, 1961, of the respondent Judge Jesus 
Y. Perez of the Court of First Instance of Manila, in Civil Case No. 44693 of 
said court. The first order allowed the filing of an amended petition for 
forfeiture against petitioners; the second denied a motion for the 
reconsideration thereof and for the dismissal of the amended petition for 
forfeiture.
<p>In October, 1961, Epifanio T. Villegas and Jesus A. Mendoza filed a complaint 
with the Secretary of Justice, charging Mariano G. Almeda, Sr. with having 
acquired during his incumbency as government employee, cash and properties from 
unknown sources in the total amount of P121,407.98, which acquisitions, 
according to the complaint, were manifestly out of proportion to the salary and 
other lawful income of said Mariano G. Almeda, Sr., and, therefore, in violation 
of the provisions of Republic Act No. 1379, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft 
Law. Pursuant to the provisions of said Act, a preliminary investigation was 
conducted by a committee of investigators designated by the Secretary of 
Justice. In a resolution of said investigators, dated November 4, 1960, it was 
certified that there is reasonable ground to believe that from 1950 to 1959, 
Mariano G. Almeda, Sr. acquired properties manifestly out of proportion to his 
salary as Assistant Director of the National Bureau of Investigation, and to his 
other lawful income.</p>
<p>On the basis of the findings of the investigators, the Solicitor General, 
representing the Republic of the Philippines as petitioner, filed on November 
12, 1960, with the Court of First Instance of Manila, a petition for forfeiture 
against Mariano G. Almeda, Sr., docketed as Civil Case No. 44693. It charges him 
with having committed graft while engaged in the performance of his official 
duties and. in consequence of said graft, had acquired properties and made cash 
disbursements from 1950 to 1959 grossly-disproportionate to his lawful income. 
His wife was included as a co-respondent in her capacity as wife of Mariano G. 
Almeda, Sr. and as co-owner of their conjugal properties.</p>
<p>Petitioner herein filed their answer on December 5, 1960 and thereafter the 
case was set for hearing, but on February 15, 1961, the Solicitor General filed 
a "Motion for Leave to Amend Petition for Forfeiture". The judge granted the 
motion but rejected the inclusion of Mariano F. Almeda, Jr. as party respondent. 
On March 25, 1961 the Solicitor General filed the amended petition for 
forfeiture, adding other counts and items of alleged unlawful acquisitions and 
disbursements thus increasing the alleged cash from unexplained sources received 
by the respondents from the years 1950-59 to P208,682.45, as against 
respondent's salary and other lawful income of only P59,860.97. Respondents, 
petitioners herein, objected to the amendment on the ground that the new counts 
or charges had already been investigated and dismissed after investigation, and 
respondents had not been given a new preliminary investigation with respect to 
the new counts or charges; that the proceedings under Republic Act No. 1379 
being criminal in nature, the petition may not be amended as to substance 
without respondents' consent. It is also claimed that the amendments were 
presented only to delay the proceedings to the prejudice of the respondents, and 
that the new counts or charges could not be included because one year nad 
already elapsed aftfcr a general election in violation of the provisions of 
Republic Act No. 1379. After the filing of memoranda by the parties the 
respondent judge issued the order sought to be reviewed, authorizing the 
presentation of the second amended petition but without including therein 
Mariano F. Almeda, Jr. as a party respondent. The court ruled as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Court finds no merit to the contention that the amended petition seeks 
to include new counts which were previously dismissed by the investigating 
Fiscals because no such dismissal appears in the resolution of said 
investigating fiscals and moreover, the only function of the investigating 
fiscals in the preliminary investigation was to determine whether or not there 
is probable cause that respondents have acquired properties beyond their means. 
The items of receipts and disbursements or acquisitions referred to as new 
counts by the respondents are but allegations in detail respecting the main 
allegation that respondents unlawfully acquired the properties described in the 
amended petition. The new allegations of receipts and disbursements embodied in 
the amended petition objected to by the respondents merely supplement or amplify 
the facts of unlawful acquisition originally alleged in the original petition. 
These amendments hence relate back to the date of the filing of the original 
petition so that the prohibition contained in Rep. Act 1379 that no petition 
shall be filed' within one year before a general election cannot apply with 
respect to the new items of receipts and disbursements. The Court finds no 
merits in the respondents' contention that the amended petition should net be 
admitted on the allegation that his proceeding is penal in nature and no 
amendment as to matters of substance can be admitted after the respondents have 
filed their answer because this is a civil case and the rules respecting 
amendments in civil cases and not of informations in criminal cases should 
govern the admission of amendments in this case. The mere fact that a 
preliminary investigation is required to be held in a proceeding of this nature 
does not make the same a criminal proceeding. Hence, the rule that amendments of 
pleadings are favored and should be literally allowed in the furtherance of 
justice should be applied.</p>
<p>"With reference to the objection that no preliminary investigation was 
conducted insofar as the new respondent Mariano F. Almeda is concerned, the 
Court finds said objection to be well-founded because no preliminary 
investigation was in fact conducted insofar as said new respondent is concerned 
in violation of Sec. 2 of Rep. Act 1379.</p>
<p>"Wherefore, the Court hereby orders the petitioner to file, within ten days, 
a second amended petition without including therein Mariano F. Almeda as party 
respondent or make reference therein with respect to said person. </p>
<p>"SO ORDERED."</p></blockquote>
<p>The principal contention of the petitioners herein, respondents in the court 
below, is that Republic Act No. 1379 is penal in substance and effect, hence the 
presentation of the amended petition without the benefit of a previous 
preliminary investigation urfder the Act cannot be allowed; that the amendment 
would have the effect of presenting a charge (under Republic Act No. 1379) 
within one year from the date of a general election; and lastly, that the 
amendment may not be made on a matter of substance after the defendants had 
pleaded.</p>
<p>A study of the provisions of Republic Act No. 1379 readily discloses that the 
proceeding for forfeiture is civil in nature and not criminal, as claimed by the 
petitioners. A test has been suggested to determine whether the proceeding for 
forfeiture is civil or criminal, thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * Forfeiture proceedings may be either civil cr criminal in nature, and 
may be in rem or in personam. If they are under a statute such that if an 
indictment is presented the forfeiture can be included in the criminal case they 
are criminal in nature, although they may be civil in form; and where it must be 
gathered from the statute that the action is meant to be criminal in its nature 
it cannot be considered as civil. If, however, the proceeding does not involve 
the conviction of the wrongdoer for the offense charged the proceeding is of a 
civil nature; and under statutes which sped cally so provide, where the act or 
omission for which the forfeiture is imposed is not also a misdemeanor, such 
forfeiture may be sued for and recovered in a civil action." (37 CJS, 
Forfeiture, Sec. 5. pp. 15-16)</p></blockquote>
<p>In the first place a proceeding under the Act (Rep. Act No. 1379) does not 
terminate in the imposition of a penalty but merely in the forfeiture of the 
properties illegally acquired in favor of the state. (Sec. 6) In the second 
place the procedure outlined in the law leading to forfeiture is that provided 
for in a civil action. Thus there is a petition (Sec. 3), then an answer (Sec. 
4), and lastly, a hearing. The preliminary investigation which is required prior 
to the filing of the petition, in accordance with Sec. 2 of the Act, is provided 
expressly to be one <i>similar</i> to a preliminary investigation in a criminal 
case. If the investigation is only similar to that in a criminal case, but the 
other steps in the proceedings are those for civil proceedings, it stands to 
reason that the proceeding is not criminal. Had it been a criminal proceeding 
there would have been, after a preliminary investigation, a reading of 
information, a plea of guilty or not guilty, and a trial thereafter, with the 
publication of the judgment in the presence of the defendant. But these 
proceedings as above set forth, are not provided for in the law.</p>
<p>Section 12 of the law provides a penalty to the public officer, but said 
penalty is against the employee or officer for the transfer or conveyance of any 
unlawfully acquired properties. The law therefore penalizes an officer for 
transferring or conveying properties unlawfully acquired, but does not to do so 
for making the unlawful acquisition; it merely imposes the penalty of forfeiture 
of the properties unlawfully acquired.</p>
<p>As the proceeding for forfeiture, as pointed out and as provided for in the 
law, is not a penal proceeding but a civil one for the forfeiture of the 
properties illegally acquired, and as the procedure outlined in the law is that 
which is followed in civil actions, amendment of the charges or the petition for 
forfeiture may be made as in ordinary civil actions; <i>i. e.</i> the amendments 
may be made before trial or in the course of trial without need of another 
investigation. It also follows that amendments setting forth newly discovered 
acquisitions may be inserted in the petition without obtaining the consent of 
the respondent.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the petition should be, as it is hereby, denied, with costs.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,
