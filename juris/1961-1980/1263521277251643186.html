				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The question before respondent Court of Appeals, as before us, is
the right of private respondents, the <span class="SpellE">lessors</span> <span class="SpellE">Llorente</span> O. <span class="SpellE">Yarisantos</span> and
Lourdes O. <span class="SpellE">Yarisantos</span>, to rescind a contract of lease
for nonpayment of rentals on time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
facts as found by respondent Court left no doubt that there was indeed such a <span style="">failure to do so on the part of petitioners, <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> Tan and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pamintuan</span>,
respectively the lessees and <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 1659 of the Civil Code, which grants
the right to the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> in the event of the failure
on the part of the lessee to comply with his obligations, is thus applicable.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> So it was held by respondent Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot do otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We affirm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint for rescission was filed by private respondents who
succeeded to the rights of the previous <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Patrocinio</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span>, from whom the disputed two lots situated in <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
were purchased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lease contract in
favor of private petitioners Tan and <span class="SpellE">Pamintuan</span>
provided for an agreed monthly rental of P15.00 payable promptly at the end of
every month for each lot, or P30.00 for the two, the lease entered into on <st1:date year="1951" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1951</st1:date> to expire at the
discretion of the lessee after twenty years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was another provision that failure on the part of the lessee to
pay the rental for six consecutive months would automatically annul the
contract.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The complaint for rescission filed by private respondents as plaintiffs against
petitioners as defendants on <st1:date year="1959" day="12" month="11">November
 12, 1959</st1:date> alleged that with respect to the first lot, defendant, now
petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> Tan, was in arrears for a period
of twelve months and, with respect to the second lot, for a period of eight
months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment was in favor of
private respondents as plaintiffs, the contract of lease being rescinded by
virtue of the above Civil Code provision.</p>

<p class="BODY">An appeal was then taken to respondent Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It considered as "the one and only issue"
whether defendants, now petitioners, had violated the provision in the contract
of lease as to the monthly rental being promptly paid at the end of every month
as claimed by plaintiffs, now private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If they had not violated said provision, as
claimed by them in their answer to said complaint, then private respondents
have no right to ask for the rescission or annulment of the said contract of
lease.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This is how respondent Court resolved the issue:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"While claiming to have committed no
such violations, [petitioners] nevertheless admit that '[they] in their
pleadings nor at any time during the trial, never claimed to have offered to
pay the rental at the end of each month beginning the month of October,
1958.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, they impliedly admitted
in their plead­ings and they do now formally admit here, no such monthly
payments were ever made’ * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
[their] above admission that 'no such monthly payments were ever made' by them
to [private respondents] it stands clear that they violated the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> provision of paragraph 2 of the contract of
lease ‘That <span style="">the agreed monthly rental
of [Fifteen Pesos] (P15.00), Philippine Currency, payable promptly at the end
of every month for each lot or Thirty Pesos (P30.00), Philippine Currency for the
two lots, shall be maintained, * * *.' [So] clearly, said violation </span>of
lessees' * * * obligation 'to pay the price of the lease accord<span style="">ing to the terms stipulated' (Article 1657 of
the New Civil Code), </span>entitles [private respondents] to rescind said contract
of lease under Article 1659 of the same Code providing that 'If the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> or the lessee should not comply with the obligations
set forth in articles 1654 and 1657, the aggrieved party may ask for the
rescission of the contract and indemnification for damages or only the latter,
allowing the contract to remain in force.’"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">From the decision of respondent Court of Appeals of <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1967</st1:date> affirming the
judgment of the lower court, a petition for review was filed with this
Tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A careful perusal of the
records of the case and the legal grounds support of this petition yields the
conclusion that no error of law could be imputed to respondent Court.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much is made in the third
error assigned of private respondents being bereft of the right to ask for
rescission in view of their refusal to recognize the existence of the lease
contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an argument was raised
and rejected by respondent Court of Appeals in these words:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Of course, we do not overlook ‘* * *
that the defense of the appellants (against such failure to pay every month) is
that the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> as early as May, 1958, refused to
recognize the existence and/or binding effect of the lease contract, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A and the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
maintained this judicial stand until final decision was had in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case, Civil Case No. 63700, with the Municipal
Court of Manila, in December, 1959 or a month after they filed their complaint
in these proceedings.' * * * Refusal on plaintiffs' part to recognize the
existence and/or binding effect of the said lease contract Exhibit A is only
like saying that the latter would not accept payment of rentals <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such
a situation, defendants' remedy is not to violate their own obligation under
Exhibit A but to make tender of payment of such rentals and, if refused, to
make consignation thereof in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* *
*.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Nor </span>is this all
that was said by respondent Court of Appeals on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Defendants, however, take exception to the said remedy by
rescission, contending that there is paragraph 3 of the said lease contract
providing 'That failure on the part of the [lessee] to pay the rentals for <span style="">six </span>(6) consecutive months shall
automatically annul <span style="">this
contract'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Defendants' argument
at page 20 of their brief runs thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'What good is there to grant the<span style="">
lessees a six-month period of grace if the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> can
rescind the lease contract anyway, with but a month's failure to pay the same </span>rentals?'
The <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> argument was neatly answered by the
lower court as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'The right to
rescind the contract pursuant to Article <span style="">1659
</span>of the Civil Code is different from the automatic annulment of the same
contract in accordance with the provision of paragraph 3 thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They arise from different causes and are
based on different grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In making
deposit of rentals at six-month intervals, the defendants prevent the automatic
cancellation of the contract but did not deprive the owner to ask for the
rescission of the contract for failure of the lessee to pay the stipulated
rentals promptly at the end of every month.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was never contemplated that the rentals were to be payable every six
months, otherwise, there would have been no necessity for the stipulation in
paragraph 2 of the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the
intention <span style="">that </span>the lessee should
pay rentals monthly is emphasized by <span style="">the
provision </span>that such rentals should be paid ‘<u>promptly</u> at the end
of every month' * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It was likewise assigned as the second error that in view of
a previous favorable decision by the Court of First Instance of Manila of a consignation
case filed by private petitioner Tan against private respondents to compel the
latter to accept the rentals at the rate of P15.00 monthly as well as another
decision dismissing an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit filed by
private respondents against such petitioner, the principle of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span>
would apply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This point was raised and
decided adversely against petitioner by respondent Court of Appeals thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Another contention of defendants that
the consignation and <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases elsewhere
referred to constitute <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span>
or are a bar to the present action is also without merit because the
subject-matter and causes of action in the said cases are distinct from those
in the instant case."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Such a defense was thus
unavailing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not suffice to preclude
the operation of Article 1659.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An
independent and separate clause of action had, as correctly stated by
respondent Court, already come into being.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would thus appear
clear that the first error assigned to the effect that the contract of lease
could not be rescinded is devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Article 1659 speaks in categorical language.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents, as the aggrieved
parties, had the right to ask for rescission, there being a failure on the part
of petitioners to comply with their obligations as lessee and <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span>, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With the <span class="SpellE">lessors</span> having decided to avail
themselves of such a right under the law, no court can validly stand in the <span style="">way of the enforcement thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was what the lower court, presided by
the Honorable Judge <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Vasquez, and respondent
Court of Appeals did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To impute what was
done by them as error would be to disregard what the law so plainly commands.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">An excerpt from an opinion in <span class="SpellE">Malicsi</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Carpizo</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
penned by Justice Barrera, is relevant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"And, Article 1659 of
the same Code expressly provides, among others, that if the lessee should not
comply with his obligation of paying the price (rental of the lease according
to the terms stipulated), 'the <u>aggrieved party may ask for the rescission</u>
of the contract and indemnification for damages, or only the latter, allowing
the contract to remain in force'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
instant case, appellant failed and refused to pay the monthly stipulated rental
of the property subject matter of the aforementioned lease contract for the
months of January and February, 1958.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had the right under
said provision of the Civil Code to bring, as he did, the present action for
rescission of said Contract of Lease, and the trial court correctly declared
the rescission thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant claims
that she had not defaulted in the payment of said rental as no demand to make
payment was made on her by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a question of fact which can not be
raised here and the finding of the lower court to this effect is binding on
us.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That is all that need be said as to this petition for the review
