the possession of silver and/or nickel coins in an aggregate amount exceeding
fif­ty pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a <span class="GramE">prosecution</span> for violation of this special law.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1964</st1:date>,
at eight in the evening, <span class="SpellE">Ro­gelia</span> de <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, alias Rita Aguirre, was aboard the boat M/B <span class="SpellE">Mariquita</span>, at <span class="SpellE">Balamacan</span> pier, <span class="SpellE">Mogpog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span>, about to
leave for <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had in her posses­sion a <span class="SpellE">buri</span> bag and a rattan basket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A
Philippine </span>Cons­tabulary patrol, then on the lookout for smuggling,
asked to search her aforesaid belongings, which she allowed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inside them, they found three bags of coins.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Rogelia</span> de <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>
was taken to the PC headquarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An
inventory of the coins was taken; the total amount was P1<span class="GramE">,120.00</span>
consisting of <span style="">50¢, </span>20<span style="">¢</span>, 10<span style="">¢</span> and 1<span style="">¢</span>
denominations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The PC filed on <st1:date year="1964" day="16" month="9">September
 <span style="">16, 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>a complaint against <span class="SpellE">Rogelia</span> de <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> for said

aforesaid facts (Exhibit A).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">A corresponding</span> information was filed on
<st1:date year="1964" day="22" month="9">September 22, <span style="">1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>in
the Court of First instance of <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rogelia</span></span><span style=""> de <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> pleaded not guilty and stood trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1964" day="29" month="12"><span style="">December 29, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Court of First Instance rendered a
decision of conviction, sentencing her to serve one year imprisonment and to
pay a fine of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, plus costs and confiscation
of the amount of coins held in excess of fifty pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant appealed to raise a point of
statutory interpretation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's view is that the law punishes the <u>accumulation</u>
of silver and/or nickel coins in excess of <span style="">fifty </span><span style="">pesos; </span>that
a period of seven days is given by said law within which to turn over to any
bank, treasury or post office, and exchange for notes, an excess in coins above
fifty pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She claims, therefore, that
her possession of such coins in the total amount of P1,120.00, not hav­ing been
alleged or shown to be for more than seven days, is not an offense under the
statute.</p>

<p class="BODY">The relevant provisions of the law state:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 1.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It shall be the duty of eve­ry person,
partnership, association or corpo­ration, having in its possession silver
and/or nickel coins of the Philippine currency in an aggregate amount of more
than fifty pesos, to turn over any excess over said amount to any bank,
treasury or post office in the Phi­lippines in exchange for notes of legal cir­culation,
within seven days from the passage of this Act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the end of the seven days, as hereinabove provided, every person
conducting business, partnership, association or corpo­ration and every seven
days thereafter shall record in a cash book or memorandum an inven­tory of the
total amount of coins by denomi­nations that it has in its possession, and this
record and all cash and cash receptacles kept by such person, partnership, association
or corporation shall be open to inspection and verification by the Secretary of
Finance or his duly authorized representatives.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 2.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the period of seven days provided in
the preceding section, it shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, as­sociation
or corporation to hold, possess or keep silver and/or nickel coins in an aggre­gate
amount exceeding fifty pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The posses­sion
of such an <span style="">excess
</span>amount shall be punish­able with a fine of five thousand pesos and
imprisonment of one year, and the confiscation of the amount held in excess of
fifty pesos:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, That if
the person found guilty of violation of this section be a foreigner, the
sentence shall also include an order for his deportation immediately after
service of his term of imprisonment, principal as well as subsidiary."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant cannot successfully claim to fall under "persons
conducting business" <span style="">as </span>to whom the law alleged­ly grants a period of seven days, even
after the origi­nal seven-day period following the passage of the Act, within
which to turn in and exchange for notes, silver and/or nickel coins in excess
of fifty pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant was not
engaged in business, as an <u><span style="">incident</span></u><span style=""> </span>of which she possessed the coins in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She kept no record of
inventory of coins every seven days as required by law of persons conducting
business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, in Exhibit A she
admitted that she engaged in buying and selling of coins; that the coins she
had when she was apprehended were in­tended by her to be sold to someone in <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>; that she would gain some percentage thereby; that
someone in turn uses the coins for purchases in Hong Kong where the coins are
rated at a greater ratio than notes; that she de­rived these coins from agents
of her own who purchase coins and turn them over to her for a percentage; and
that she had previously consummated similar transactions four times before,
involving a total of P900.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">All the foregoing shows <span class="SpellE">Rogelia</span> de <span class="SpellE">Ocampo's</span> posses­sion of the P1<span class="GramE">,120.00</span>
in silver and/or nickel coins in­volved herein, to be punishable under the
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prac­tice she engaged in of
purchasing and selling, for a per­centage, silver and/or nickel coins,
constitutes an evil intended to be curbed by the law, for the same would re­sult
in the withdrawal of said coins from circulation, by systematic, deliberate and
excessive accumulation thereof, resulting in adverse effects on the economy.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, <span style="">the
judgment </span>appealed from is hereby affirmed, without costs in this
instance.</p>
