				<H3>ARSENIO N. SALCEDO, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. THE MUNICIPAL COUNCIL OF CANDELARIA, QUEZON, ET AL., RESPONDENTS AND APPELLEES. <BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>Petitioner Arsenio N. Salcedo, a  Civil Service  eligible,
      
had been, at the inception of the case at bar, for five  (5)
      
years, a Chief of Police of Candelaria, Quezon.  On July
      
10, 1960, Venancio N. Dia, Municipal Mayor of same town,
      
preferred against  petitioner,  an   Administrative  Complaint with the Municipal  Council, of same town,  for—  <div align="justify">
<ol><li>Violation of Rides and Regulations 17 &amp; 18 of Police Officer's
            
Manual and Handbooks, 1954; <br>
  </li><li>Misconduct, punishable  under Sec. 1 of Rep, Act No. 557; <br>
  </li><li>Serious irregularities in the performance of his duties, punishable under Sec.  1 of Rep.  Act No. 557. </li></ol>
<p>Petitioner objected to the admission of the complaint, because same
was not duly sworn to. The council overruled the objection. Before the
presentation of the administrative complaint, however, petitioner
herein was suspended by the Mayor, and on September 8, I960, by
Resolution, Annex B, the Council extended the period of suspension.
September 8, 1960, was the expiration of the 60 day period for
suspension. The Resolution, among others, reads as follows— </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The Municipal Mayor presented a letter from Atty.
Silvestre L. Tagarao inquiring from the Municipal Council as to whether
the Respondent Chief of Police, Arsenio N. Salcedo in Administrative
Case No. 5 can resume his official duties as Chief of Police on
September 9, 1960.&nbsp;
</p><p> After a careful study of the matter on premise and  upon motion
                
of Councilor  Artemio de Luna, duly seconded by Councilor Ramon
                
Reyes;  </p>
<p>RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved,  that the suspension of  the Chief
                  
of Police be  extended indefinitely until the investigation  (trial on
                  
the  merits) is resumed by the Municipal Council, Candelaria, Quezon.</p>
</blockquote><p align="center"> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p> (Res. No. 291—Approved by the Majority).</p>
<p> Under date of March 9, 1961, petitioner presented to the
                      
Council petitions to disqualify the councilors-respondents,
                      
on  the ground of bias  and interest, alleging that he had
                      
filed against them, with the Provincial Board, administrative charges  for  oppression, corruption and other  forms
                      
of  maladministration in office,  so  that said respondents
                      
could not be  expected to act, hear and decide the case of
                      
petitioner  with impartiality and fairness.  All the said
                      
moves to disqualify were overruled by  the respondents
                      
councilors.  </p>
<p>Claiming that respondents' acts (accepting the administrative
complaint which was not duly sworn to; extending the period of
suspension beyond the 60 day period; denying his petitions to
disqualify the majority members of the council), were performed without
or in excess of the council's jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of
discretion, and that there was no appeal, nor any plain, speedy and
adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, Salcedo presented with
the CFI of Quezon, a petition for "Prohibition &amp; Mandamus with
Preliminary Induction", being special Civil action No. 6006.</p>
<p> Petitioner  also  alleged that the  Municipal  Council  of
                          
Candelaria, was then composed  of nine  (9)  members,  including the Vice-Mayor; one was elected under the Liberal
                          
Party banner; two (2) from the Grand Alliance  Party and
                          
the rest,  including the Vice-Mayor, under the Nacionalista
                          
Party  banner; and  that even before the  presentation of
                          
the  administrative case,  the  Nacionalista Party council
                          
men, had already been agitating for his resignation and
                          
replacement.  Listed in the petition were five (5)  issues,
                          
which the petitioner wanted the lower court to pass upon,
                          
viz—   </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"1. May a complaint against  a civil service official that is  not
                                
 subscribed and  sworn  to  by the  complainant be given due course? </p>
  <p>2. Has the Municipal Council, acting through its majority members,
                                  
 the  power to extend  the period  of suspension originally  imposed
                                  
 upon a Chief  of Police by the  Mayor even before  the administrative case  against said Chief of Police is  heard?</p>
  <p> 3. When the Vice-Mayor presides over the  deliberations  of  the
                                    
 Municipal Council, does he have the right to vote?   </p>
  <p>4. Should the members, or any members, of the Municipal Council
                                      
 disqualify themselves  when it  has been shown that  through bias
                                      
 and  interest they cannot  act with impartiality  and fairness?  </p>
  <p>5.  Is it  proper and  lawful, for  justifiable reason, to require  the
                                        
 Municipal Council not to act  as a body, entire and whole, when
                                        
 trying an administrative case filed before it, but instead re-organize
                                        
 and reduce  the  council members to a mere majority on the basis'
                                        
 of party representation?"   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lower court  set the hearing for  the issuance of preliminary injunction and on the merits, on the same day. On
                                      
 May 2, 1961, before the date set for the  said hearing, the
                                      
 Provincial Fiscal filed  a Motion to Dismiss, claiming that
                                      
 the petition  does not state a cause  of action against the
                                      
 respondents and that "the  issues  raised  therein  are not
                                      
 sanctioned by law and jurisprudence."  </p>
<p>Over the  petitioner's opposition, on  June  6, 1961, the lower court promulgated an Order, dismissing the petition, not on the grounds
                                        
 interposed  by the Fiscal but on some other ground.  Thus,
                                        
 the  Court  held— </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The removal of a member of the municipal police
falls under Republic Act No. 557 and Section 2 of said law provides
that in all these cases the decision of the Provincial Board, the City
or Municipal Council shall be appealable to the Commissioner of Civil
Service. Nowhere in the petition does it appear that the petitioner has
appealed to the Commissioner of Civil Service or that he has exhausted
all administrative steps regarding his case.&nbsp;
</p><p>Wherefore, the petition  is hereby dismissed  with  costs against
                                            
 the petitioner."   </p></blockquote>
<p>The above Order  is now the object of the instant appeal,
                                              
 petitioner,  claiming that the  lower court erred&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"1. In holding that the appellant should first
appeal to the commissioner of civil service or exhaust all
administrative remedies regarding his case before he could file the
instant petition for prohibition and mandamus with preliminary
injunction against the municipal council of Candelaria, Quezon;</p>
  <p>2. In not taking
cognizance of, and passing upon and deciding the issues raised in the
petition for prohibition and mandamus." <br></p></blockquote><p>The Court in dismissing the
petition, relied on the following provisions of Republic Act No. 557:— </p><blockquote>
  <p>"Sec.
1. Members of the provincial guards, city police and municipal police
shall not be removed, and except in cases of resignation shall not be
discharged except for misconduct or incompetency, dishonesty,
disloyalty to the Philippine Government, serious irregularities in the
performance of their duties, and violation of law or duty, and in such
cases, charges shall be preferred by the * * * municipal mayor in cases
involving a member of the municipal police, and investigated by the * *
* municipal council, as the case may be, in public hearing, and the
accused shall be given the opportunity to make their defenses. * * *.
The trial of the case shall be finished within reasonable time, and the
investigating body shall decide the case within fifteen days from the
time the case is submitted for decision. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sec. 2. In all these cases, the decision of the provincial board, the
                                                      
 city or municipal council shall be appealable to the Commissioner of
                                                      
 Civil Service.</p>
<p> Manifestly, the trial judge in interpreting Sec. 2 of Act
                                                        
 No. 557, had considered the rulings  of the municipal  council in accepting and  giving due course to  the complaint, in
                                                        
 spite of the lack of oath, in not disqualifying themselves
                                                        
 from hearing the administrative case and in extending the
                                                        
 period of suspension beyond the 60 day period provided for
                                                        
 by law, as decisions appealable to the Commissioner of Civil
                                                        
 Service.  The trial judge misconstrued the law.  It is obvious that the decision appealable to the  Commissioner, is
                                                        
 the one having to do with the merits of the administrative
                                                        
 charges, after the proper hearing.   In presenting the petition before the lower court, Salcedo wanted the Court to
                                                        
 Rule on five (5) legal issues contained  therein.   The trial
                                                        
 court should have taken cognizance of the case and squarely vs. Coll. of Customs  of Manila
                                                        

                                                        
pass upon the legal issues laid before it, instead of dismissing the complaint on the  ground of failure  to exhaust
                                                        
administrative remedies, which was not even invoked by the
                                                        
Provincial Fiscal in his motion to dismiss.  As there was
                                                        
no decision rendered by the Municipal Council on the merits
                                                        
of the administrative charges preferred, for the investigation had not even commenced, there was no decision to be
                                                        
appealed to the  Commissioner of Civil Service.  At least,
                                                        
on  one important issue, (the right to extend the 60-day
                                                        
period of suspension by the council), evidence should have
                                                        
been received and the case decided.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the Writ is granted, the Order
                                                          
of the lower Court  dismissing  the petition, is hereby set
                                                          
aside, and another entered, remanding the case to the Court
                                                          
of origin,  for further appropriate proceedings.   No costs. </p>
