				<H3>PEDRO OPAREL, SR., COMPLAINANT, VS.
ATTY. DOMINADOR ABARIA, RESPONDENT.
<br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This administrative proceeding was started by Pedro <span class="SpellE">Oparel</span>, Sr., who identified himself as a pauper in his
complaint filed with this Court on August 27, 1970 against respondent <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Abaria</span>, a member of the
Philippine Bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The charge was that
respondent, whose services were retained to assist complainant recover damages
from his employer for injuries suffered, acted dishonestly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, a settlement was reached,
complainant having been made to sign a receipt in the sum of P500.00 for his
claim, out of which was deducted P55.00 as <span class="GramE">attorney's</span>
fees, when the truth, according to the complaint, was that respondent did
receive the much larger amount of P5,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In a resolution of September 14, 1970, the respondent was required to
file an answer within ten days from notice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was duly filed on October 19, 1970 with a vehement denial on the part
of the respondent, alleging that the complaint was "irresponsible,
baseless and [should] not merit even the scantiest consideration" of this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further alleged that while
complainant was asking only for P200.00, he was able to secure a settlement
from the employer in the sum of P500.00, admitting that he was given as fees
the aforesaid amount of P55.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
accounted for the alleged sum of P5,000.00 by stating that P3,500.00 was spent
by the employer for plaintiff's operation and medical bills, another P1,000.00
given to complainant's family during his confinement in the hospital, and then
the P500.00 received in cash by way of additional settlement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He prayed that the complaint be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court, in a resolution of October 23, 1970, referred the
matter to the Solicitor General for investigation, report and
recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such report and
recommendation was submitted on June 2, 1971.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was therein stated that the city fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>
City, who was designated to act as investigator, as the parties were residents
of the place, submitted on March 2, 1971 a report recommending dismissal due to
the desistance of complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
appeared that when the case was called for investigation on February 17, 1971,
the complainant manifested that he was no longer interested in pushing through
his complaint against respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his
affidavit of desistance, he admitted that the administrative charge arose out
of a mis­understanding between him and respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise admitted that there was no
deception practiced on him by respondent when he was made to sign the affidavit
of September 20, 1966 wherein it appeared that the amount received by him was
P500.00, no mention being made therein of the other P4<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>
which, as noted in the answer of respondent, con­sisted of P3,500.00 for
expenses incurred for complainant's operation and medical bills and P1,000.00
given to his family for support while he was staying in the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General agreed with such a recommendation
and prayed that the case be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it would appear that under the circumstances no case lies
against respondent <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Abaria</span>,
it is not amiss to impress on members of the Bar that the utmost care be taken
to minimize occasions for any misunderstanding between them and their
clients.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The relationship being one of
confidence, there is ever present the need for the latter being adequately and
fully informed of the mode and manner in which their interest is defended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They should not be left in the dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are entitled to the fullest disclosure
of why certain steps are taken and why certain matters are either included or
excluded from the documents they are made to sign.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only thus that their faith in counsel
may remain unimpaired.</p>

<p class="BODY">Where, as did happen here, the client happens to be poor and
unlettered, seeking to enforce what he considers his just demands against an
employer, it is even more imperative that matters be explained to him with all
precision and clarity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More than that,
no effort should be spared for him to get fully what he is entitled to under
the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same zeal should
characterize a lawyer's efforts as when he is defending the rights of property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it is, there is even the fear that a
lawyer works harder when he appears for men of substance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To show how unfounded is such a suspicion, he
must exert his utmost, whoever be his client.</p>

<p class="BODY">More specifically, in a case like the present, he should not
invite loss of trust by inadvertence or even by a failure to use the simplest
and most understandable language in communicating matters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For he may lend himself to the suspicion that
he is lacking in candor and may be taking undue advantage of his client for his
own profit and advantage in any dealing with the adverse party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, with complainant having been
satisfied with the explanation of respondent, he could not be justly charged of
being <span class="GramE">recreant</span> to his trust for personal gain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dismissal of this case is therefore
warranted.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the administrative case filed by Pedro <span class="SpellE">Oparel</span>, Sr. against respondent <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
<span class="SpellE">Abaria</span> is dismissed.</p>
