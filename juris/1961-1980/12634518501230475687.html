				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In April of 1964, forty-three (43) cases of Globe Leather worth
$85,563.33 were shipped from <st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state>
on board SS "Pioneer Mart", a vessel of the United States Lines
Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shipment was consigned to
Crown Embroidery Corporation in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Arriving here, the ship discharged the cargo
to the Bureau of Customs, which was <span class="GramE">then</span> <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, when the goods were delivered by the Bureau of
Customs to the consignee, the great portion of it was, <span class="SpellE">assertedly</span>,
found to have been damaged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atlantic
Mutual Insurance Company, insurer of the cargo, paid the consignee $3,855.97
for such damage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span>,
it filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila on <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1965</st1:date>, against the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the Bureau of Customs and, in the alternative, the United States Lines Co., an
action to recover the amount of $3,855.97 or its peso equivalent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Answering, the United States Lines Co. alleged that the entire
shipment was discharged to the Bureau of Customs in good order condition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in the event that it <span class="GramE">be</span>
held liable, it included a cross-claim against the Bureau of Customs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Republic of the Philippines and the Bureau of Customs, on the
other hand, moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that the Republic may not
be sued without its consent; that the Bureau of Customs has no personality to
be sued; and that there was no previous filing of the claim with the Auditor
General pursuant to Act 3083 as amended by Commonwealth Act 327.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ruling that the claim should have been first lodged with the
Auditor General under Act 3083 and Commonwealth Act 327, the Court of First
Instance dismissed the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
quote the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of its order:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Wherefore, the Court orders the
dismissal of the complaint, without special pronouncement as to costs."</p>

<p class="BODY">After denial of its motion for reconsideration, plain足tiff
appealed to <span class="GramE">Us</span> from said order of dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appel足lant argues that its claim is not
cognizable by the Auditor General, since it is an <span class="SpellE">unliquidated</span>
claim, the amount of which cannot be determined by arithmetical computation but
calls for the appreciation of the weight of evidence and the application of
judgment and discretion as to the amount of damages sustained by the cargo.</p>

<p class="BODY">The point that controls, however, is that, as ruled by this Court
in Mobil Philippines Exploration v. Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and subsequent cases,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operations, when done, as in this case, by the
Bureau of Customs as a <span style="color: windowtext;">necessary incident of the
prime governmental function of taxation, - the assessment and collection of
lawful revenues, tariffs and fees - is an activity protected from suit by
reason of public policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If at all, that
is, if the claims are money claims of the kind provided for in Act 3083 and
Commonwealth Act 327, the same should be presented with the Auditor General;
otherwise, the Republic or its agencies in question, cannot be sued without
their consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, even
assuming that appellant's claim is <span class="SpellE">unliquidated</span>,
since it does not involve loss of cases with definite, fixed value per case as
shown in the shipping documents but rather damage to a great portion of the
cargo, the amount of which cannot be reached by a simple computation but
involves discretion in appreciating evidence as to the extent of said damage,
the result for this case is still the same:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the Republic or the Bureau of Customs cannot be sued without its
consent.<i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's suit, however, should not have been dis足missed as
against the United States Lines Co., which did not file any motion to dismiss;
a reading of the dismissal order <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>
clearly shows that the dismissal was premised only on the non-suability of the
Republic and the Bureau of Customs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant, in its brief, assigned as error the dismissal of its
complaint; it points out that it was suing <span style="color: windowtext;">in
the alternative; and it argued and prayed that the dis足missal order be set
aside and its complaint reinstated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
in its reply brief, in answer to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="color: windowtext;">United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="color: windowtext;"> Lines Co.'s brief, it elaborates the same point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All this convinces <span class="GramE">Us</span>
that a fair interpretation of the rules and the dismissal order demands that
the dismissal should not extend to defendant United States Lines Co.<i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the dismissal order is affirmed as to the
Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the Bureau of Customs only; but the case is remanded for further
proceedings against defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> United States
Lines Co.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
