				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This appeal presents the grim picture of a son being prosecuted for
and convicted of parricide for causing the death of his father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor was there a denial on his part that such
a tragic fate befell his sire because of a weapon in his hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would however claim the justification of
self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court did not
believe him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither do we.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We affirm the appealed sentence of <u>reclusion</u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>,
subject to the modification as to the pecuniary liability.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court, in the
appealed judgment, relied principally on the testimony of an eyewitness, <span class="SpellE">Dionisia</span> <span class="SpellE">Malasarte</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
She declared on the witness stand that on <st1:date year="1960" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1960</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon, the deceased Ricardo Manos, left a bolo
and two bamboo tubes in her sari-sari store located in <span class="SpellE">Alegria</span>,
Lopez <span class="SpellE">Jaena</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00</st1:time> that evening of the same day, he returned to the
store, this time accompanied by appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He informed the witness, then upstairs, that he came back to get the
things he left with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went down
so that she could give them back to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was then that she heard him tell the appellant that it was time to go
home as it was already night, and his grandson, a child of the appellant, would
be looking for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently,
appellant misconstrued the remark and asked his father whether he resented the
fact that he was taking care of such child.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ricardo Manos took care to explain that such was not the case, for
otherwise the child might not have lived till then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant implied that the father was in a
bad mood precisely because of the trouble occasioned by the rearing of the
grandson.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this juncture, he pushed
aside his father who fell down face upward.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was then that appellant dealt the blows with his bolo that proved
fatal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim was hit first in the
stomach and then in the breast.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Dionisia</span> <span class="SpellE">Malasarte</span>
rushed to appellant, held him by the waist and pulled him away reproving him
for his act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was told to stop, but
the advice came too late as the victim was already dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then shouted for help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A man came on the scene, but the deed, as
above noted, had been consummated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
then sent for the authorities, the Chief of Police coming that evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following morning the judge of that
munici­pality, a doctor, and a sanitary inspector came.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was an entirely
different story testified to by the accused, Santiago Manos, who pleaded
self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would ascribe the
antecedents of the tragic incident to his leaving a brotherhood association in
which he and his deceased father were members.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Evidently such an act displeased the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was berated for his resignation which, in
the view of the father, according to the appellant, was a foolish thing to
do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sensing that he was under the
influence of alcohol and was thus in an ugly mood, appellant tried to pacify
the deceased, but his efforts were unsuccessful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, so he would impress on the court, his
father rushed at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He tried to pacify
the latter by saying that he was not going to fight in view of their
relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His father, according to
him, was not appeased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Feeling that he
was about to be killed and that he had to defend himself, his father having
unsheathed his own bolo, he was fortunate enough to be able to pin both of
father's hands against his stomach.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Then he proceeded: "He struggled and he was able to free
himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He blocked me again and pinned
me holding in that position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * I
still asked him and told him, I do not want to fight him because he is my
father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * After telling me I have no
son <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city> he again attempted to <span class="SpellE">unsheath</span> his bolo, and fortunately I was able to pin his
both hands on his belly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * But he
was able to extricate himself and then he held my hand and attempted to draw
out his bolo and still I was able to pin his hand and continued pleading that I
do not like to fight him inasmuch as I am the son and he is my father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this moment he insisted on the fight and
inasmuch as he was able to move and was able to <span class="SpellE">unsheath</span>
his bolo I parried it * * * and pinned both of his hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I drew my bolo and placed [it in front] of me
just with the intention to avoid his onrushing actions [to] kill me."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
He continued his efforts to pacify his father, and according to him, it was
then that the deceased "rushed at me which made the bolo to penetrate to
his stomach."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
As to how the other wound was inflicted, this was his version: "I did not
make any attempt to [lunge] at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was my father's unexpected onrushing towards me that made the bolo penetrate *
* * his breast."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the above testimony,
it becomes easy to understand why the lower court failed to believe appellant's
story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does tax one's credulity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An impartial party, even if sympathetic to
the plight in which appellant found himself, would find it difficult to give a
nod of approval to such a narration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
might be said, of course, that the act imputed to the appellant, that of
killing his own father, is one that is so shocking that there must have been an
impelling motive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the testimony of
appellant himself as well as that of his mother, it turned out that the deceased
was not a model family man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was drunk
very often and on such occasions, his wife, the mother of the appellant, was
maltreated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At such times, he did not
limit himself to using his fists, but would even employ his bolo, thus causing
wounds to be inflicted on his wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
bitterness arising from such display of cruelty must have built up through the
years in appellant's heart as from his testimony he did hold his mother in the
highest affection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That incident that
afternoon, when he felt that he was being berated by his father, must have
brought to the surface the seething and smoldering feeling of resentment deep
within him.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the lower
court is vested with considerable discretion in determining which of the
conflicting versions is to be lent credence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What was said in People v. <span class="SpellE">Gumahin</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
finds application in the present case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus: "The findings of the lower court embodied in a well-written
decision cannot only stand the test of the most rigid scrutiny but also has in
its favor the well-settled principle that as far as credibility is concerned,
the findings of the lower court which had the opportunity to see, hear and
observe the witnesses testify and to weigh their testimonies will be accorded
the highest degree of respect by this Tribunal."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
People v. <span class="SpellE">Tila</span>-on<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
and People v. <span class="SpellE">Lumayag</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
were cited in support of the <span class="SpellE">Gumahin</span> opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "As this Court stated in People v.
<span class="SpellE">Tila</span>-on: 'Finally the rule is now firmly established
to the point of becoming elementary in this jurisdiction and elsewhere that
where there is an irreconcilable conflict in the testimony of witnesses, the
appellate court will not disturb the findings of the trial court when the
evidence of the successful party considered by itself, is adequate to sustain
the judgment appealed from.' To the same effect: 'Appellate courts as a rule
desist from disturbing the findings of the trial court on the credibility of
witnesses, for the latter is in a better position to appreciate the same,
having seen and heard the witnesses themselves and observed their <span class="SpellE">be­haviour</span> and manner of testifying during the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no reason to depart from this settled
practice, since it has not been shown that the trial court has overlooked
certain facts of substance and value that, if considered, might affect the
result of the case.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus no merit attaches to
three of the assigned errors, the second, the third and the fourth assailing
the lower court for not giving full weight to the claim of self-defense on the
part of appellant and in giving full credence to the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Dionisia</span> <span class="SpellE">Malasarte</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor should the fifth assigned error as to the
admission of a medical certificate issued by one doctor when another doctor
testified as to the nature of the wounds necessitate any further discussion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Independently of such testimony, there is no
question as to the fact of death having been satisfactorily shown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fifth assigned error is thus taken care
of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor did the lower court misapply the
law when it required appellant to indemnify the heirs of the deceased even if,
as alleged in the sixth assignment of error, the mother as well as the brothers
and sisters of appellant, such heirs, would, perhaps feeling the natural
impulse, hope to exculpate appellant, a mother and a brother testifying in his
favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That should dispose of the sixth
assignment of error.</p>

<p class="BODY">Insofar as the first assigned error is concerned, namely, the
failure of the lower court to appreciate the mitigating circumstance of
voluntary surrender, appellant did have a point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out in the brief of the then
Solicitor General, now Associate Justice Antonio P. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>,
however, "since parricide is punishable with a penalty composed of two
indivisible penalties, namely, from <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
to death," it is immaterial insofar as the penalties concerned as the
presence of one mitigating circumstance still requires the imposition of the
lower of the two such indivisible penalties, namely, <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, which was done in this case.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the lower court of April 12,
1967 is affirmed with the modification as to the pecuniary penalty and the
accused, Santiago Manos, is hereby sentenced to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span><u>, </u>to indemnify the heirs of the
deceased, excluding himself, in the sum of P12,000.00 and to suffer the other
accessory penalty provided for by law.<span style="">&nbsp;
