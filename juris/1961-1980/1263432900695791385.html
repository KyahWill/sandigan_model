Relations dated April 29, 1970 in IPA Case No. 87 (8) entitled Government
Service Insurance System Supervisor's Union (GSISSU) vs. Government Service
Insurance System (GSIS) now G.R. No. L-32018, and 2) the Order of the same
Court dated June 10, 1970 in IPA Case No. 87 (9), entitled Government Service
Insurance System Employees Association - PAGE (GSISEA-PAGE) vs. GSIS,
GSISEA-CUGCO, <span class="SpellE">Intervenor</span>, now G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-32397.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts are as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="1">January
 1, 1968</st1:date>, petitioner GSIS implemented a new and higher pay scale to
which the salaries of all GSIS employees and officials were adjusted according
to a uniform pattern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The increase or
adjustment was equivalent to the next higher rate in the new scale not
necessarily the next higher step in that new scale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, in Pay Class 12, the first step
under the old scale was P12<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the new scale, the first step was P12<span class="GramE">,600</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the
employee receiving P12<span class="GramE">,000</span> under the old scale would
receive an adjustment of P600.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
However, it was discovered that some employees headed by Manuel <span class="SpellE">Perlada</span> (Pay Classes 7 to 13) received higher salary
readjustment although some of them were merely "acting designees".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other employees belonging to the rank and
file (Pay Classes 1-6) supposedly members of GSISEA-CUGCO received the same
adjustments as the aforementioned employees also effective <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Members of the GSISSU and the GSISEA-PAGE did not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This caused a growing agitation among the
rest of the GSIS officials and employees for the grant to them of the same
benefits.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a letter dated <st1:date year="1970" day="19" month="3">March
 19, 1970</st1:date> addressed to the GSIS General Manager, Mr. V. N. <span class="SpellE">Magadia</span>, as President of GSISSU, requested for a one (1)
rate increase of salary for all employees and officials of the GSIS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magadia</span> also
expressed the general sentiment and feelings of discrimination of the employees
due to the bigger adjustments given to some employees who were merely acting
designees in their positions (Exhibit "D").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Federico Romero, Personnel Manager of
GSIS, in a Memorandum dated March 19, 1970 addressed to the GSIS General
Manager, also recommended the extension of the same benefits given to certain
employees to all other employees of the System even if it was to entail a
budget of P4 million (Exhibit "A").</p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently, no immediate action was taken by the GSIS on the
matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, GSISSU and GSISEA-PAGE
filed their Petitions against the GSIS with the Court of Industrial Relations
on <st1:date year="1970" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1970</st1:date> (IPA Case
No. 87 [8]), and <st1:date year="1970" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1970</st1:date>
(IPA Case No. 87 [9]), respectively.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both Petitions alleged that the GSIS, to discourage membership in their
respective Unions, by-passed their members and others in promotion in pay in
the bargaining unit they represented, while the GSIS unduly favored a number of
employees who were members of GSISEA-CUGCO by granting said employees increases
in pay effective January 1, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
also alleged that despite demands made upon the GSIS to grant them a similar
one (1) rate increase in pay effective <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="1">January
 1, 1968</st1:date>, the latter refused to grant said demands, and that as a
consequence, petitioners had to retain counsel on a contingent basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(The matter of attorney's fees claimed by Attys.
<span class="SpellE">Magadia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> is the subject
of another appeal in G.R. <span class="GramE">No</span>. <span class="GramE">L-32772).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners then demanded the same increase
effective <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 1, 1970, the GSIS filed identical Oppositions to the
Petitions alleging that pursuant to GSIS Board Resolution No. 1461, approved on
September 3, 1968, all officials and employees of the System covered by the
collective bargaining agreement of March 26, 1968 were given and paid the
salary increases and adjustments effective January 1, 1968 subject to the terms
and conditions provided therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both cases were jointly tried by the Court of Industrial
Relations.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1970</st1:date>,
GSISEA-CUGCO filed a Motion for Intervention in IPA Case No. 87 (9)
(GSISEA-PAGE vs. GSIS), which was allowed by respondent Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its Answer in Intervention filed on April
25, 1970, GSISEA-CUGCO averred that the increases given to some of its members
were part of the collective bargaining agreement signed between the GSIS and
GSISEA-CUGCO; that even before the implementation of said increase, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Evangelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Savellano</span>, acting
President of GSISEA-CUGCO, in a letter dated February 10, 1970 to the General
Manager of GSIS, demanded the implementation of the collective bargaining
agreement for all members of GSISEA-CUGCO (Exhibit "I"); that as the
representative of 2,500 members of GSISEA-CUGCO, <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
prayed that should the Court be minded to grant the one (1) rate increase to
petitioners (GSISEA-PAGE), the same be extended also to all its members
(GSISEA-CUGCO), without any deduction of attorney's fees being claimed by
Attys. <span class="SpellE">Magadia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, the Court of Industrial Relations issued the
challenged Order, dated April 29, 1970, in IPA Case No. 87 (8) (GSISSU vs.
GSIS), the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, respondent GSIS is hereby ordered to cease and
desist from discriminating against petitioner, its members and other employees
in the unit of supervisors, and to grant to all of said employees the same
salary readjustment/increase as those already granted to Manuel <span class="SpellE">Perlada</span> and other members of GSISEA-CUGCO provided they
have not reached the maximum step of their respective pay classes."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The records show that respondent GSIS received a copy of the
above Order on <st1:date year="1970" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent GSIS filed its Motion for
Reconsideration of the Order of <st1:date year="1970" day="29" month="4">April
 29, 1970</st1:date> on <st1:date year="1970" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1970</st1:date>,
which was opposed by petitioner GSISSU on the ground that said Motion for
Reconsideration was filed out of time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On May 8, 1970, the Court of Industrial Relations <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
denied the Motion for Reconsideration as it was filed beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period provided by section 17-A of the Rules
of the Court of Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>GSIS filed a Notice of Appeal on <st1:date year="1970" day="29" month="5">May
 29, 1970</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, hearing in IPA Case No. 87 (9) (GSISEA-PAGE vs.
GSIS) continued in view of the intervention filed by GSISEA-CUGCO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other incidents pertaining to attorney's fees
were also being resolved by the Court of Industrial Relations, subject matter
of other appeals in G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-32772 and G.R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-32854.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, on <st1:date year="1970" day="10" month="6">June 10,

not yet reached the maximum step of their respective pay classes; and to deduct
from the employees in Pay Classes 1 to 6 who are entitled to salary
readjustment an amount equivalent to 15% of their respective recoveries as and
for attorney's fees and to deposit the amount to deducted in Court for further
disposition.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The GSIS filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> Order on <st1:date year="1970" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1970</st1:date>, which was denied by the Court of Industrial

filed a Motion to Dismiss Petition for Review on <st1:date year="1970" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
Motion was based primarily on the ground that the Order of the Court of
Industrial Relations dated April 29, 1970 had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> as the Motion for Reconsideration of the same was
filed beyond the four (4) day period provided in section 17-A of the Rules of

received by their Office on <st1:date year="1970" day="30" month="4">April 30,

<p class="BODY">A close scrutiny of this case leads this Court to believe that
there is no necessity to go into the merits of the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As previously mentioned, respondent GSISSU
filed a Motion to Dismiss Petition on the ground that the Court of Industrial
Relations Order, dated April 29, 1970, had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, the GSIS Motion for Reconsideration of the same
having been filed out of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although
said Motion to Dismiss was denied in the Minute Resolution of this Court dated <st1:date year="1970" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1970</st1:date>, said denial did not
delve into the merits of the Motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
while the grounds cited in the Motion to Dismiss are not reiterated in
respondent's Brief, we are taking cognizance of the same in view of the legal
implications.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 17-A of the Rules of the <st1:street><st1:address>Industrial

6 copies duly verified together with the supporting argument within a period of
four (4) days without extension from receipt of decision or order together with
proof of service of 1 copy thereof on the adverse party."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In a leading case, it has been held that
the 4-day period within which to file a motion for reconsideration is
jurisdictional and mandatory and failure to comply therewith is fatal.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

clerk of the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel on <st1:date year="1970" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So, petitioner had until <st1:date year="1970" day="4" month="5">May 4,

by respondent GSISSU, Atty. Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Mosqueda</span>, the
lawyer assigned to the case, stated that <st1:date year="1970" day="1" month="5">May
 1, 1970</st1:date> was a holiday and <st1:date year="1970" day="3" month="5">May

"A", Comment).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1970" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1970</st1:date>, he was absent due to

Reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">In our opinion, the reasons advanced by Atty. Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Mosqueda</span>, Assistant Government Corporate Counsel and
counsel for petitioner, for his admitted failure to file the Motion for
Reconsideration on time are not constitutive of excusable negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the case of NWSA vs. MWSA
Supervisors Union, <u>supra</u>, the failure of the lawyer to file the Motion
for Reconsideration on time due to illness of his clerk was not considered
excusable negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court held
that considering the matters being handled by the Office of the Corporate
Counsel, which involves public funds, one cannot but demand a more exacting
sense of responsibility from those concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;

processes may be promptly and properly attended to even on non-working days and
even in the absence of the head of office or the attorney assigned to the case.</p>

system, viz., life insurance fund, retirement fund and property insurance fund.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contention that the finding of financial capability
of GSIS to pay the salary increases cannot be based merely on a Statement of
Income and Expenses but should consider such other factors as the impact of
economic policies of the Government, the requirements of the future, the
magnitude of the commitments to pay dividends, the difficulties of collecting
some commercial and industrial loans, and a big overdraft, fails when we
consider that the GSIS had, in fact, already ordered payment of the increases,
besides the fact that no evidence to support such factors were presented in
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it has been held that
as long as there is evidence to support a Decision of the Court of Industrial
Relations, such Decision may not be revoked or reversed just because it is not
based on overwhelming or preponderance of evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In respect of the allegation that respondent Court erred in
awarding indiscriminately a one-step salary adjustment to all rank and file
employees (Pay Classes 1 to 6) and supervisory employees (Pay Classes 7 to 13)
in disregard of the merit <span class="GramE">system,</span> suffice it to state
that the merit system is not in point.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What respondent Court sought to correct was the discriminatory effect of
the act of petitioner GSIS in granting salary increases to a few and not to
members of other Unions which had no collective bargaining agreement with
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the only condition imposed
on the payment of increases as set forth in the Memorandum of the GSIS General
Manager dated <st1:date year="1970" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1970</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
was that those who were to be given salary adjustments were the ones "not
receiving the maximum of their respective Pay Classes."</p>

<p class="BODY">I register, however, my dissent from the ruling in the main
opinion in Case L-32018 that the one-day delay in petitioner's filing of its
Motion for Reconsideration of the questioned Order of April 29, 1970 was
"not constitutive of excusable negligence" and therefore fatal and
rendered the questioned order "final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>".</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated in the main opinion and by petitioner in its comments,
copy of the questioned Order was served on its counsel's receiving clerk in the
late afternoon of <st1:date year="1970" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it had until the 4th day, <st1:date year="1970" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1970</st1:date>, within which to file its
motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lawyer
in charge of the case, Atty. Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Mosqueda</span> of the
Office of the Government Corporate Counsel, was in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
on April 28 to 29 as well as on <st1:date year="1970" day="2" month="5">May 2,
 1970</st1:date> in connection with another case involving the Philippine
National Railways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:date year="1970" day="1" month="5">May 1, 1970</st1:date> was Labor Day (an official holiday)
and <st1:date year="1970" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1970</st1:date> was a
Sunday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the following day, <st1:date year="1970" day="4" month="5">Monday, May 4, 1970</st1:date>, he was absent due
to second degree burns on his left leg ankle, duly attested by his physician's
sworn certificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only on the
fifth day, then, that he learned personally of the adverse Order and lost no
time in filing on the same day the motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">U</span>nder such special
circumstances when three of the four days allotted by the industrial court's
rules for the filing of a motion for reconsideration in certified cases were
non-working days and nevertheless petitioner's counsel-in-charge was
furthermore occupied with the hearing of another case in <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
and had fallen sick besides on the only working day of the four-day period (Monday,
May 4th), the one-day delay in the filing of petitioner's motion for
reconsideration may certainly be deemed excusable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court so ruled in its Resolution of July 17, 1970 when in acting
upon respondent's motion to dismiss the petition at bar on the ground of
finality of the questioned order and alleged consequent loss of this Court's
jurisdiction to consider the appeal and petitioner's explanation and prayer
that "under the circumstances and in justice and fairness to
petitioner" its motion "be considered filed within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period," the Court denied without
qualification the motion to dismiss and maintained its Resolution of June 18,
1970 giving due course to the petition and required respondent to answer the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated in the main opinion (at
page 6), respondent union no longer raised the question in its brief and therefore
the same should have already been considered foreclosed and settled by the
Court's resolutions of June 18, 1970 and July 17, 1970.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stressed in <u>PBM Employees Organization vs. PBM Co., Inc</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
considering the special circumstances in the case at bar, <u>mutatis mutandis</u>,
the industrial court's 4-day rule should be deemed "unreasonable" and
<span class="SpellE">violative</span> of due process in its application, whether
the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> for reconsideration be the employer or the
employee.</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, in <u>De <span class="SpellE">las</span> Alas vs. Court
of Appeals</u><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>,
the Court stressed that "a one-day delay does not justify the dismissal of
the appeal under the circumstances obtaining in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The real purpose behind the limitation of the
period of appeal is to forestall or avoid an unreasonable delay in the
administration of justice and to put an end to controversies (<span class="SpellE">Dy</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Crossfield</span>,
38 Phil. 521-526)." No element of intent to delay the administration of
justice could be attributed to petitioner or its counsel in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">I hold, therefore, as stressed in the cited case of <u>De <span class="SpellE">las</span> Alas</u> that "litigations should, as much as
possible, be decided on their merits and not on technicality."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
At any rate, even if the industrial court's unorthodox 4-day rule for filing
motions for reconsideration were deemed jurisdictional and mandatory (so that
failure to comply therewith would result in the fatal loss of the right of
appeal), this Court has the power to grant relief from an excusable failure to
comply with the rule, as it did in this case per its above-cited Resolution of
July 17, 1970 denying respondent's motion to dismiss the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As reiterated in the PBM case, <u>supra</u>,
the Supreme Court has the inherent power to "suspend its own rules or to
except a particular case from its operation, whenever the purposes of justice
require."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Since the main errors assigned in the two cases under review are
identical and have been found to be without merit, with which finding I concur,
my vote in Case L-32018, therefore, is to affirm on the merits (and not to
dismiss the appeal for the excusable one-day delay in the filing of the motion
for reconsideration) the questioned Order of April 29, 1970 for the same
reasons and considerations stated for affirming the other questioned Order of
June 10, 1970 in Case L-32397.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
