				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">There is nothing commendable, much less exemplary, in the willful
omission by petitioner to lend an impress of plausibility to her special civil
action for <i style="">certiorari</i> and prohibition
against respondent Jose <span class="SpellE">Oreta</span> of the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
In seeking to nullify respondent Judge's decision in an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
case ordering her to vacate possession as well as the writ of execution
thereafter issued, she alleged that at the time of such decision there was a
restraining order against the respondent Judge, who was thus bereft of
authority to act on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
truth came out when in the motion to dismiss filed by one of the respondents,
the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, Q. &amp; S., Inc., it was shown that
before the decision on May 25, 1962, the restraining order previously issued
had been set aside as early as March 9 of that year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> and prohibition was dismissed by the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
City Branch, the Honorable Fernando Cruz presiding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal to us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We sustain the order of dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the order of dismissal now on appeal, express reference was
made to the failure of petitioner to mention that the restraining order had
already been lifted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In the instant petition, respondents
maintain, the petitioner willfully and deliberately withheld from this Court
the existence of the Order of March 9, 1962, of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in Civil Case No. 6974, wherein it was expressly
ruled that 'the previous order issued by this Court restraining the defendant
from proceeding with the case is hereby set aside'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was clear, therefore, that on <st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="5">May 25, <span style="">1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>when the <st1:place><st1:placename>Municipal</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Court</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>of</st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
tried and rendered its decision, there <span style="">was
</span>no longer a restraining order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The decision of the City Court having long become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, the issuance of the writ of execution became
merely a ministerial duty on the part of the respondent Judge to give due
course."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was the conclusion of the lower court therefore:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"After a careful consideration of the
petition and the motion to dismiss as well as the opposition thereto, the Court
is of the opinion that the petition does not state a cause of action since the
order of dismissal dated March 9, 1962 was without any qualification and did
not therefore, carry the stay of the restraining order of March 5, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it did, the said order of <st1:date year="1962" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1962</st1:date> should have stated in
clear and unequivocal language.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court is of the opinion that the order of <st1:date year="1962" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1962</st1:date> was superseded by the order of <st1:date year="1962" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1962</st1:date> and obliterated the
former."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The order of dismissal of <st1:date year="1967" day="16" month="2">February
 16, 1967</st1:date> now on appeal was thus a necessary consequence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the brief for petitioner,
now appellant, that would call for a different conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We affirm such order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner did not, because she could not, deny that the
restraining order had already been lifted as of the time the decision was
rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances then,
the power to act of respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Oreta</span> could not
be assailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, nonetheless, in
her brief as appellant, a persistence on the technicality that the Honorable
Fernando Cruz should rely not on the motion to dismiss but on the petition
before him which, as above noted, took careful pains to withhold from the Court
the vital information that such restraining order had already been lifted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's brief as appellant would stress this technical
objection thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Pursuant to the
above tests for the purpose of determining whether or not the Petition in the
present case sufficiently states a cause of action against the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, we can only go back to the causes of action as
alleged in the Petition, namely, the act of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Honorable Jose F. <span class="SpellE">Oreta</span>, through his auxiliary,
Honorable Salvador S. <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span>, of proceeding with the
trial of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case subject of Civil Case No.
4491 on May 25, 1962 despite the existence of the restraining Order dated March
5, 1962 issued by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
directing <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Honorable Jose F. <span class="SpellE">Oreta</span> to refrain from proceeding with the trial of Civil
Case No. 4491 until after a resolution on the Petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> and prohibition has been rendered and same becomes
final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact is sufficiently alleged
in the petition constituting the wrong or <span class="SpellE">delict</span> in
violation of petitioner-appellant's rights.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>* * * [Only the contents of such petition may be taken] into
consideration to determine whether or not the Petition states a cause of
action."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner is under a misapprehension as to the controlling
principle of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was held in <span class="SpellE">Arvisu</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>:<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
"Under section 8 of Rule 67, Rules of Court, once the answer to the
petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> is filed 'the
court may order the proceedings complained of to be forthwith certified up for
review and shall hear the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it
is not mandatory upon the court to order the elevation of the proceedings and
to hear the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court may deny the
writ if from the answer it finds that the petition should be dismissed in the
interest of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(II Moran, Comments
on the Rules of Court, 3rd ed., p. 180.)"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Even if petitioner were correct in his assumption that only what
he did set forth could be the basis of the lower court decision, still he had
failed to make a case for himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
insist on such a doctrine in the face of the admitted fact that the petition
was so artfully worded as to conceal the truth from the lower court which was
revealed in the motion to dismiss, is to put a premium on technicality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be to thwart the judiciary in its
avowed mission of rendering justice according to the facts as they exist, and
not as falsely painted by one of the parties, animated by desire to attain his
objective even at the cost of perverting the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even on the assumption that only in an answer,
and not in a motion to dismiss, could there be an allegation as to the
non-existence of the restraining order, still such a matter being brought to
the attention of the court and being verified would have sufficed for the
dismissal of this petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would
then be to sacrifice needlessly the ends of a just and expeditious solution to
a controversy if, in deference to what had been<span style=""> </span>shown to exist and could not thus be denied, the dismissal
sought was granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the
action taken by the lower court does not call for a reversal.</p>

entirety, "they were adopted not as ends in themselves for the compliance

<p class="BODY">There is need, likewise, to give expression to our disapproval of
what was done by counsel for petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is understandable, as a matter of fact it is expected of him, that he
should defend with zeal and militancy his client's cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a duty, however peremptory in character,
has its limits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It certainly cannot go
as far as justify a willful and deliberate omission to give the color of
persuasiveness to an action clearly devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For he is likewise an officer of the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is equally an instrument in
the dispensation of justice through law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is required of him that in discharging his role as advocate, he does
not mislead the court by an allegation which, as in this case, was clearly
shown to be contrary to the truth and was just as easily exposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, counsel for petitioner was
deaf to such a command that the profession rightfully imposes and thus was
guilty of a betrayal of the high standard expected of every member of the bar.</p>
