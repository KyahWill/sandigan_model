of the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission which reversed the
award made by Regional Office No. 10, Workmen's Compensation Unit, <st1:place><st1:placename>Zamboanga</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, in favor of petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, Norberto G. Sudario, Jr. was employed as Senior
Telegraph Operator with a monthly salary of P386.00 by the Bureau of
Telecommunications from <st1:date year="1953" day="16" month="9">September 16,
 1953</st1:date> until his retirement on <st1:date year="1973" day="1" month="1">January
 1, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His duties
consisted of starting the telegraph engine for about four or five times daily
in order to provide the power link between the Liloy telegraph station and the
nearby stations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also had to deliver
telegrams on foot to the residents of Liloy, Zamboanga del Norte.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most of the time he was at the mercy of the
elements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After some years in the
service, he started suffering chest pains and difficulty in breathing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he was transferred to Ipil, Zamboanga
del Sur he had himself x-rayed by Dr. Henry Sevilla and was found to be
suffering from <u>cardiac enlargement</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An x-ray examination made by Dr. Milagros Fernandez con­firmed said
findings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due to his ailments, he was
cons­trained to file an application for sick leave from November 11, 1971 to
December 12, 1971.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After recuperating
from his ail­ment he returned to work but only to perform light jobs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The recurrence of his ailment eventually
forced him to apply for retirement on January 1, 1973.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to his retirement, however, petitioner
filed a claim for compensation with Regional Office No. 10, Workmen's
Compensation Unit, Zamboanga City on March 20, 1972.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Regional Office, however, did not act on
his application because he failed to submit a physician's report of his ill­ness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 26, 1975, petitioner refiled his
claim and submitted an electrocardiographic examination performed on him by Dr.
Jose Generoso.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Acting Referee of the
Regional Office gave due course to the application and set the case for hearing
after which he rendered a decision granting compensation benefits to petitioner
in the sum of P2,315.56, pursuant to Section 18 of the Workmen's Compensation
Act.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Republic Bureau of Telecommunications filed a motion
for reconsideration of said decision on the ground that petitioner's illness
medically known as "cardiomegally-carditis chronic," is not
compensable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the denial of the motion, the records
of the case were forwarded to the Workmen's Compensation Commission as provided
by Section 4, Rule 15<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Rules of the Workmen's Compensation Commis­sion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Commission reversed the decision of the Acting
Referee on the following grounds:</p>

<p class="NUM">1) That petitioner failed to present substantial evidence to show
that his sickness which is not<span style=""> <u>per</u></span>
<u>se</u> a compensable illness, was service-connected or was aggravated by the
nature of his employment.</p>

<p class="NUM">2) That petitioner failed to show that prior to January 1, 1973,
he had been disabled to work for a certain period of time and that petitioner
having filed his claim after having retired from the service can no longer
claim for benefits under Act 3428.</p>

<p class="BODY">We reverse and set aside the ruling of the respondent
Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By presenting a physician's
report regarding his illness and his application for sick leave due to his
heart ailment, petitioner has sufficiently substantiated his claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the nature of his work which
consisted of deliver­ing telegrams to distant places by foot plus doing odd
jobs in the office due to lack of personnel therein, it is not difficult to
sustain the claim of petitioner that he acquired his illness in the course of
his employment or at least aggravated during his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has long been settled that once an illness
supervenes in the course of one's employ­ment, the presumptions established by
Section 44<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Workmen's Compensation Act stand in the employee's favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is then incumbent upon the employer to
rebut the said pre­sumptions with substantial evidence, which respondent
Republic failed to do in the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While it might have contested the claim, it has not presented sufficient
evidence to overcome Section 44 of Act 3428 except to contend that the illness
of petitioner is non-compensable.</p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">is </span>claimed by
respondent Republic that petitioner has never been disabled before his
retirement on Jan­uary 1, 1973.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
transcript of the stenographic notes of the proceedings of the Regional Office
shows that in 1972 petitioner was still sick and was incapacitated from doing
his regular work in the office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True it
is that he reported for work but with his physical condition at the time he
could not perform the work he used to do for the respondent Republic, like
starting the engine, delivering<span style=""> </span>telegrams
and so forth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was in such a bad shape
that it was physically impossible for him to perform his old job in the Bureau
of Telecommunications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of
fact his retirement was approved by the government, which only shows that he
had <span style="">met, </span>the conditions
prescribed for optional retirement pursuant to Memorandum Circular No. 133
issued by the Office of the President which among others provides that
"all applications for optional retirement under Commonwealth Act No. 180,
as amended by Republic Act No. 1616 and No. 4968 shall not be recommended for
approval unless funds are available in the office or bureau concerned for the
payment of applicant's retirement of its programmed projects and activities and
provided any of the following circumstances or conditions is present:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x x
x (2) The employee is below 65 years of age, is physically incapacitated to
render further efficient service." The approval of petitioner's application
for retirement is a clear indication that he was physically incapacitated to
render further efficient service.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also claimed by respondent Republic that petitioner is no
longer entitled to compensation benefits after having received his retirement
benefits from the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it
is true that retirement from the service results in the severance of
employer-employee relationship which relationship is the jurisdictional
foundation for a claim for compensation benefits under the Workmen's Compensation
Act, nevertheless, as long as the illness or injury for which compensation is
claimed arose out of or in the course of the employment, the retired employee
is still entitled to compensation benefits under the provisions of Act 3428.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The enjoyment by government employees covered
by the GSIS law of retirement benefits under said Act (C.A. 186, as amended),
concurrently with benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Act, is expressly
provided for in Section 3 of Act 3428 which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"This Act is also applicable to all officials, employees and
laborers in the service of the National Government and its political
subdivisions and instrumentalities; Provided, however, 'That officials,
laborers and employees insured with the Government Insurance System, and their
dependents when entitled to the benefits of the said in­surance system shall,
in addition to the same, be entitled to the benefits granted by this Act."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Thus in one case<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
the Supreme Court speaking thru Associate Justice Felix V. Makasiar has ruled
that the claim for death benefits is compatible with compulsory retirement
benefits from the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apart from
the fact that the retirement of government officials and employees and the
award of death benefits to <span style="">them are </span>governed
by different laws and therefore should be treated separately one from the
other, in <u>Reynaldo vs. Republic of the Philippines (Bureau of Public
Schools), et al., G.R. No. L-43108, June 30, 1976</u>, finding that the
claimant therein had been on sick and vacation leaves from 1971 to sometime
1972 when she retired at the age of 55 due to further aggravation of her
illness, this Court sustained the award of compensation benefits after finding
therein that petitioner's illness was traceable to her working condition which
was obtained by continuous and long use of her eyes in connection with her work
and that her illness might have been aggravated by her employ­ment.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF </b><b><span style="">THE </span>FOREGOING</b>,
the appealed decision of the respondent Com­mission is hereby reversed and set
aside and another one entered ordering private respondent to pay the petitioner

Act; to reimburse to him his medical expenses properly receipted for and also
