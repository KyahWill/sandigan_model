				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The parties agreed that judgment be rendered on the pleadings.<br><br>According to the 
complaint: The defendant Ramona Fabie de Marcos is the owner of a big parcel of 
land called Hacienda Fabie, in the districts of Paco and Sta. Ana, Manila, being 
administered by defendant Ventura Marcos; that on May 7, 1936, plaintiff 
purchased from one Antonio Castro, the house located at 2633 Herran, a lot 
pertaining to the Hacienda, which was built thereon years before the date of the 
purchase; that before buying the house, plaintiff was assured by the owner of 
the house and the rental collector, that it will remain thereon as long as 
rental is paid for; that in 1953, to show that he meant the assurance well, 
Marcos reduced the rental from P24.00 to P22.00 a month; that on August 23, 
1955, defendants herein filed a complaint for Ejectment with the Municipal Court 
of Manila against the herein plaintiff for having failed to pay the rentals from 
February 1954 to May, 1955 at the rate of P22.00 a month and to compel hint to 
pay an increased rental at P40.00 a month beginning August 1, 1955, which the 
municipal court dismissed on September 1, 1955, ordering the plaintiffs therein 
(defendants herein) to pay defendant therein (plaintiff herein) P200.00 as 
damages; that on appeal, the CFI affirmed the said judgment; that thereafter, 
defendants informed the plaintiff that the contract of lease would be terminated 
on April 30, 1956; that there was no written agreement between the parties as to 
the manner the rentals would be paid; that although they were usually paid 
monthly, on several occasions, however, the defendants had allowed the plaintiff 
to pay the rentals beyond one month; that if the intention of defendants was to 
increase the rentals from P22.00 to P40.00 monthly, plaintiff was willing to 
pay not more than P30.00 monthly; that because of the ejectment case, plaintiff 
had suffered P1,000.00 as damages, P500.00 for attorney's fees and P60.00 each 
day of trial; that because of the assurances aforestated, plaintiff made 
improvements, repairs and additions to his house in the sum of about P3,000.00; 
and that due to the filing of the present complaint, plaintiff was compelled to 
hire counsel for P500.00 and suffered damages In the sum of about P500.00.
<p>The Answer denied the giving of assurances, alleging that the persons who 
supposedly made them had no legal capacity or personality to bind the 
defendants; that the ejectment case was dismissed by agreement of the parties; that defendants had notified the plaintiff that the lease contract was 
deemed terminated on April 30, 1956; that in the instances of failure to pay the 
rentals on time, the defendants just permitted the payment at later dates, as act 
of grace; that the termination of the lease contract was "por pura conveniencia 
de sus intereses y no por motivos ulteriores" that the P30.00 monthly rental 
offered by the plaintiff was completely inadequate, considering that the 
lot/consisting of 221 square meters is now valued at P15,000.00. As special 
defenses, the defendants claim that the allegations of the complaint did not 
state a cause of action; that the ejectment case constitutes <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span> to the 
present action and the court lacks jurisdiction to take cognizance of the same. 
As counter-claim, defendants alleged that because of the unlawful detention of 
the lot, they were entitled for the use of the same, in the sum of P10.00 daily 
from May 1, 1956, until its delivery and that defendants had to employ the 
services of counsel for P2,000.00.<br></p>
<p>On November 16, 1956, the trial court rendered the following decision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When plaintiff's petition was called for hearing, the parties agreed that 
judgment be rendered on the pleadings in connection with such petition. 
According to the pleadings, there is no controversy that plaintiff has been 
occupying the lot in question since May 7, 1936, when he purchased from one 
Antonio Castro the house constructed thereon. It also appears that plaintiff was 
assured by the defendants that the house bought would remain thereon as long as 
plaintiff continues paying his rents. It further appears tiiat on March 19, 
1947, plaintiff constructed an addition to the house with the knowledge and 
consent of the defendants. Said addition cost the, plaintiff the amount of 
P20,000.00.</p>
<p>There is no written agreement as to the duration of the lease between 
plaintiff and defendants. The fact remains that plaintiff entered the premises 
with the knowledge and consent of the defendants and with the assurance of the 
latter that the plaintiff could remain occupying the lot as long as he pays the 
corresponding rents.</p>

<p>It seems that Art. 1687 of the new Civil Code is applicable. The question, therefore, is what period may the Court allow the plaintiff to 
remain, in the premises in question. To determine the period, the Court must 
take into consideration the circumstances surrounding the case. The plaintiff in 
thia case is an intelligent man. He being a lawyer, it is presumed that he 
knows the law. The Court is, therefore, inclined to believe that plaintiff 
entered, the premises and introduced improvements thereon with the knowledge and 
consent of the defendants. Plaintiff, aside from the purchase price of the 
house, also introduced improvements in the amount of P20,000.00.</p>
<p>Plaintiff's contention that Republic Act No. 1599 is applicable in the 
instant case, is untenable.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the 
defendants to execute a contract of lease in favor of the Plaintiff or a period 
of two years. Defendants' counterclaim is hereby dismissed. No pronouncement as 
to costs".</p></blockquote>
<p>The motions for reconsideration filed by both parties were denied, but only 
the defendants had appealed. The Court of Appeals certified the case to this 
Court, as the issues presented are purely legal in character.</p>
<p>In this appeal, the defendants-appellants submit two dominant propositions: 
(1) The trial court had no authority or jurisdiction to order them 
(defendants-appellants) to execute a lease contract in favor of the 
plaintiff-appellee for a period of 2 years, when the lease contract between them 
was already terminated; and (2) The trials court erred in (a) not fixing the date 
of rentals to be paid for the occupation of the lot, as well as attorney's fees, 
and (c) not ordering the automatic delivery or return of the possession of the 
lot to the defendants, upon the expiration of the period of two years, without 
further proceedings ("sin tramites ulteriores").</p>
<p>(1) We are of the opinion that the trial court was correct in applying 
Article 1687, in connection with Article 1197 of the new Civil Code, in this 
case. Article 1687 states:—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If the period for the lease has not been fixed, it is understood to be from 
year to year, if the rent agreed upon is annual; from month to month, if it is 
monthly; from week to week, if the rent is weekly; and from day to day, if the 
rent is to be paid daily. However, even though a monthly rent is paid, and no 
period for the lease has been set, the courts may fix a longer term for the 
lease after the lessee has occupied the premises for over one year. If the 
rent is weekly, the Court may likewise determine a longer period after the 
lessee has been in possession for over six months. In case of daily rent, the 
court may also fix a longer period after the lessee has stayed in the place for 
over one month."</p></blockquote>
<p>Commenting on the quoted article, this Court has said:—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * the power of the courts to 'fix a longer term for lease' is 
potestative or discretionary,—'may' is the word—to be exercised or not in 
accordance with the particular circumstances of the case; a longer term to be 
granted where equities come into play demanding extension, to be denied where 
xione appear, always with due deference to the parties' freedom to contract * * *" (Acasio vs. Corp. de los PP Dominicos de Filipinas, 100 Phil., 523; 53 Off. 
Gaz., 8066).</p></blockquote>
<p>The lot in question has been rented to the petitioner for about 20 years and 
his predecessor in interest for more. Even though rentals had been paid monthly, 
still no period for the duration of the lease had been set. The lease had been 
consistently and tacitly renewed ("tacita reconduccion") until the ejectment 
case was filed (Co Tiam vs. Diaz, 75 Phil, 672; Villanueva vs, Canlas. 77 Phil, 
381; Art, 1670 N.C.C.; Art. 1566 Old Civil Code). Having made substantial or 
additional improvements on the lot, and considering the difficulty of looking 
for another place to which petitioner could transfer such improvements, and the 
length of his occupancy of the lot (since 1936) and the impression acquired by 
him that he could stay on the premises, as long as he could pay the rentals, it 
would seem that there exists just grounds for granting the extension of lease 
and that the extension of two years granted by the trial court, is both fair and 
equitable.</p>2. To obviate difficulty or impossibility for the parties to reach an agreement 
as to the date the period of two years would start to run, we hold that the 
period should commence from February 19, 1957, the date of the denial of the 
motion for reconsideration, filed by the plaintiff. As far as the plaintiff is 
concerned, the decision became final on said date, for his failure to appeal.&nbsp;
<p>The rental of the lot which should be paid during the period of extension is 
P22.60 monthly. That was the rental plaintiff was paying, when the ejectment 
proceeding was initiated. But the appellee himself offered in his pleadings the 
sum of P30.00 which we deem reasonable, under the circumstances then obtaining. 
We, therefore, hold that plaintiff should pay P30,00 monthly rental, during the 
period of extension.</p>
<p>With respect to the automatic delivery of possession, without ulterior 
proceedings, we are of the opinion that the parties should be left to take such 
action as they deem proper under the law, when the occasion arises.</p>
<p>The execution of a new contract of lease between the parties, seems 
unnecessary, because the decision of this Court, final and definitive, will more 
than serve the purpose. It appearing that the respective contentions of the 
parties are not altogether unfounded, the trial court did not commit error in 
not providing attorney's fees, for either of them (Art. 2208, Civil Code).</p>
<p>Plaintiffs-appellees' contention that Republic Act No. 1599, is applicable in 
the instant case, was correctly held untenable by the trial court. As late as 
May 29, 1961, the parties were directed to show cause why the case at bar should 
not be dismissed for being moot, in view of the information that the Republic of 
the Philippines had already expropriated the property known as Fabie Estate in 
Paco, Manila, involved in the present case and that the Land Tenure 
Administration had assumed administration of said Estate (Republic vs. Vda. de 
Caliwan, 112 Phil., 492). From the manifestation and pleadings of the parties, 
however, it appears that the Estate in question has not been the object of 
expropriation proceedings under Act No. 1159.</p>
<p>Modified, in the manner indicated above, the judgment appealed from is hereby 
affirmed in all other respects, with costs against plaintiff-appellee Jacobo 
Divino.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Baustista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,
