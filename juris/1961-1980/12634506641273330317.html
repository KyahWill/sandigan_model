				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition to review and annul the resolution of the respondent
Commission on Elections of October 17, 1963 denying petitioner's petition to
declare invalid the certifi­cates of candidacy filed by the other respondents
herein, for failure to comply with the provisions of Section 32 of the Revised
Election Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 3522, in that said certificates
of candidacy did not contain a waiver of the privilege from public disclosure
of said respondents’ income tax returns and tax census statements for the years
1961 and 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, said Commission
advised its co-respondents to file, immediately, amended certificates of candi­dacy
including said waiver, even after the lapse of the period for the filing
thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the possibility that the respondents - except the
Commission on Elections - failed to be elected in the elections held in 1963 -
which, if true, would render the present case academic - the petitioner
Francisco Ortiz is hereby required to show cause, within five days from notice,
why the <span style="">p</span>etition for review
should not be dismissed.</p>
