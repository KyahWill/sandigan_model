				<H3>JUAN YSASI, PETITIONER, VS.
HON. JOSE F. FERNANDEZ, AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF NEGROS OCCIDENTAL (BACOLOD CITY, BRANCH

				<BR><STRONG>SANCHEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">When we decided this case last June, we thought that the explicit
mandate of this Court would readily be com­plied with, and that we had written <u><span style="">finis</span></u><span style=""> </span>to the question of possession <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">pendente</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>
of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Manucao</span>-<span class="GramE">A and</span>
other properties, between petitioner and private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, we made it clear that a husband had the
statutory <span class="GramE">right</span> to administer conjugal properties and
that adminis­tration could only be removed from him after proof of abuse of
administration.</p>

<p class="BODY">As it turned out, the preliminary mandatory injunc­tion issued by
respondent judge, rooted on a specific directive by this Court, was disobeyed
by private respond­ents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, it was
dissolved by respondent judge himself upon the mere filing of a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
we have before us a sequel to that judgment brought about by charges lodged by
petitioner of:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">first</span></u><span style="">, </span>contumacious conduct on the part of private respondents in
disobeying a lawful judicial order; and, <u><span style="">second</span></u><span style="">, </span>acts
attributed to respondent judge that impair the respect due this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following are the background facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1968</st1:date>,
this Court rendered judgment herein sustaining petitioner's right to administer
conjugal properties, <span style="">particularly
Hacienda </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Manucao</span></span><span style="">-A, </span><span style="">in the </span><span style="">absence of </span><span style="">evidence of maladministration thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment runs thus -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"For the reasons given –</blockquote>

<blockquote>We vote to grant the petition for certiorari;</blockquote>

<blockquote>We strike down the orders of re­spondent
judge of December 22, 1967 and January 17, 1968 complained of, in Civil Case
8306, and declare them null and void; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>We direct respondent judge to issue a writ
of preliminary mandatory injunction ordering and compelling respondents Maria <span class="SpellE">Aldecoa</span> de <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span> and Jon <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span> to turn over to petitioner the possession and control
of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Manucao</span>-A, and all the agricultural machinery,
implements, work animals, and other properties used in the operation of the
hacienda, as well as its records, papers, documents and books of accounts, upon
peti­tioner's filing, and said judge's approval, of a bond in the sum of
P50,000 to answer for any and all damages which private re­spondents or any of
them may suffer by reason of the issuance of said injunction."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1968" day="9" month="7"><span style="">July 9,
 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">, private
respondents moved for the modification of the aforesaid judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Motion was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment became final on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="23" month="7"><span style="">July 23,

Juan <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span> submitted for approval in the court below
the requisite bond, and moved for the issuance of the writ of preliminary
mandatory injunction called for in our aforesaid judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Resolution on this motion was deferred
pending receipt by the court of our resolution on private respondents' motion
for modifi­cation of judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On August 5, 1968,
respondent judge approved peti­tioner's bond of P50<span class="GramE">,000</span>
and directed Maria <span class="SpellE">Aldecoa</span> de <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span>
and Jon <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span> to turn over to Juan <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span> "the pos­session and control of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Manucao</span>-A, and all the agricultural machinery, implements,
work animals, and other properties used in the operation of the hacienda, as
well as its records, papers, documents and books of accounts." This order
was served on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="6" month="8"><span style="">August 6, 1968</span></st1:date><span style=""> upon Maria <span class="SpellE">Aldecoa</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span> but she "refused to turn over the
possession and control of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Manucao</span>-<span class="GramE">A</span> x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span style="">as she said, her son Jon <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span> is not here."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On August 7, 1968, but before the lower court's order of August 5
could be enforced, private respondents moved to dissolve the injunction,
alleging that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) con­tinuance thereof
will cause damage and irreparable injury to them; (2) the injunction will avail
Juan <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span> of an easy means to destroy or conceal the
records constituting the evidence against him to prove abuse of administra­tion;
and (3) the lifting of the injunction will cause no damage to Juan <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They invoked
Section 6, Rule 58 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Juan <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span> opposed, challenged the lower
court's power to dissolve the mandatory injunc­tion directed by this Court and
presented a counter-motion to hold private respondents in contempt for refusal
to comply with the lower court's order of August 5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To enable respondent judge to promptly rule
on the motion to dis­solve, the counter-motion was thereafter withdrawn.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the day the motion to dissolve was heard - <st1:date year="1968" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1968</st1:date> - respondent judge
lifted the injunction upon a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> of P60<span class="GramE">,000</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Juan <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span> came up to this Court on
August 21, 1968 upon an urgent motion asking us to overturn the lower court's
order of August 10, 1968 dissolving the injunction, and to cite respondents for
contempt.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1968</st1:date>,
by resolution, we ordered re­spondents to reply and show <span class="GramE">cause</span>
why they should not be punished for contempt.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On September 17, 1968,
after hearing the parties, </span>this Court resolved to <span style="">temporarily restrain respondent judge from
approving private respondents' <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>, or </span>if
the same had already been approved, from <span style="">enforcing
his </span>order of August 10, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court's restraining order was issued on <st1:date year="1968" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="10">October
 4, 1968</st1:date>, <span style="">private
respondents moved to lift the restraining order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On October 11, 1968, Juan <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span> again
filed with this Court another urgent motion alleging, amongst others, that on
October 1, 1968, his lawyer demanded from private respondents, through their
counsel, Atty. Rodolfo Herman, compliance with the preliminary mandatory
injunction issued upon this Court's order; that on October 2, 1968, the Chief
Deputy Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> served upon private re­spondents
copies of the lower court's order of August 5, 1968, and this Court's
restraining order of September 20, 1968, but that said respondents refused to
receive the same, which the sheriff thereupon left with them without an
acknowledgement receipt <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner reiterated his prayer that private
respondents be held in contempt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another hearing was had before this Court on <st1:date year="1968" day="7" month="11">Novem­ber 7, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">1. Respondents challenge the propriety of bringing the instant
matter before this Court by a mere motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They contend that the certiorari proceedings here started by petitioner
have terminated; because, so they claim, the lower court had issued the preliminary
mandatory injunction in implementation of this Court's judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They maintain that respondent judge's
dissolution of said injunction is a new matter distinct and separate from the
issuance thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They draw attention to
the fact that petitioner's position is that respondent judge, in so dissolving,
acted in excess of jurisdiction and with grave abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They thus submit that a motion before this
Court is not the vehicle for relief; that petitioner must avail of some other
proper remedy under the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We think it quite evident that these statements <span style="">do not </span>add up to a convincing
whole.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decree of this Court
directing respondent judge to "issue a writ of preliminary mandatory
injunction ordering and compelling" private re­spondents "to turn
over to petitioner the possession and control of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Manucao</span>-A"
and other properties, is a continuing mandate.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Any violation thereof or dis­obedience or obstruction thereto may be dealt with
by this Court in the same proceeding in which it was issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Re­spondent judge's compliance with it by
issuing the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction did not automatically
terminate this Court's control over said order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Enforce­ment thereof is part and parcel of the certiorari proceed­ings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is inherent upon any court to see to it
that <u>its</u> orders are obeyed to the full extent.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The dissolution by respondent judge of the injunction this Court
ordered him to issue is not an act new, distinct or separate from the previous
proceedings had before this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
cannot be gainsaid that the impact of that dis­solution was to destroy the
effectiveness of our directive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Obviously, to compel respondent judge to keep on abiding by our
judgment, the remedy must be here, in the same pro­ceedings where the mandatory
injunctive order was directed to be issued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's urgent motions before this Court, therefore, should be
sufficient to enable us to take action.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is not contended, nor
could it be, that a fresh suit or a separate proceeding - not a motion before
this Court in this case - could better advance the cause of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents' protestation - that petitioner's
urgent motions here should be thrown overboard - seems pointless when pitted
against the fundamental principle that multiplicity of suits is odious in law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We, accordingly, rule
that petitioner's urgent motions to compel obedience to our mandate issued in
this case and to declare respondents in contempt for refusal to abide thereby
are properly before this Court in this very same case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2. We now come to grips with respondent judge's alleged authority
to dissolve - upon mere <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> - the preliminary
mandatory injunction which, by mandate of this Court, he had to issue.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Justification for such dissolution below, re­spondents aver, is to
be found in Section 6, Rule 58 of the Rules of Court, which states, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that preliminary injunction "if
granted, may be dissolved, if it appears after hearing that although the
plaintiff is entitled to the injunction, the issuance or continuance thereof,
as the case may be, would cause great damage to the defendant while the
plaintiff can be fully compensated for such damages as he may suffer, and the
defendant files a bond in an amount fixed by the judge conditioned that he will
pay all damages which the plaintiff may suffer by the refusal or the
dissolution of the injunction."</p>

<p class="BODY">In his order of dissolution, respondent judge gave as bases <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> the bare allegations in private respond­ents'
motion below that continuance of the preliminary mandatory injunction would
result in great damage and irreparable injury to them and that said injunction
would avail Juan <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span> of an easy means to destroy or
conceal the records constituting the evidence against him which respondents
would utilize to prove abuse of administra­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be stressed, however, is that <u>these</u>
<u>were</u> <u>the</u> <u>very</u> <u>same</u> <u>reasons</u> earlier advanced
by respondents in their answer to Juan <span class="SpellE">Ysasi's</span>
original petition before this Court - the petition for certiorari which
resulted in the grant of the mandatory injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is quite obvious that so long as the same facts prevail, this
Court's directive stays.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course,
should new facts be established such that continuance of the in­junction would
impair private respondents' rights, then the same may be dissolved.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
No such new facts have surfaced.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be considered is that Juan <span class="SpellE">Ysasi's</span>
right to administer conjugal properties is conferred upon him by substantive
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 165 of the Civil Code is
explicit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It provides that "(t<span class="GramE">)he</span> husband is the administrator of the conjugal
partnership." This right cannot be taken<span style=""> away from him by his wife upon mere filing of a bond.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Because, the Civil Code, in its Article 167,
bestows the right of administration to the wife </span><u>only</u> "(<span class="SpellE">i</span><span class="GramE">)n</span> <span style="">case of abuse of powers of administration of the con­jugal partnership
property by the husband."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It was, indeed, with the
foregoing precepts in mind that in our judgment herein, we said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"At stake here is the husband's power of
administration and the wife's right to be protected from abuse thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Absent
that proof, the wife's right does not exist." And we there concluded
that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Petitioner may not be forced
to surrender his statutory right to administer the conjugal properties by the
simple expedient of merely charging him with the naked averment that he has
forfeited that right." In short, evidence of abuse of administration is a
condition precedent to deprivation of the husband's right of
administration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent judge's dissolution
of the injunction in question produced exactly the effect of what this Court
ruled out in the aforesaid decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
allowed administration by the wife upon mere filing of a bond pending
presentation of evidence on maladministration by the husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bond is no substitute for <u>proof</u> of
maladministration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appropriately to be recalled at this point is the teaching
sounded in <span class="SpellE"><u>Shioji</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <u>Harvey</u><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"If each and every Court of
First Instance could enjoy the privilege of overruling decisions of the Supreme
Court, there would be no end to litigation, and judicial chaos would
result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellate jurisdiction would be
a farce <span style="">if the Supreme Court did not
have the power of preventing inferior courts from meddling with decisions when
sent to them for compliance."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is, therefore, grave abuse of discretion which this Court
is now permitted to correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In con­sequence,
respondent judge's order of <st1:date year="1968" day="10" month="8">August 10,
 1968</st1:date>, directing the dissolution of the preliminary mandatory
injunction, should be set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">3. Private respondents are cited for contempt of this Court on
two counts, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) for refusing to
turn over to Juan <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span> Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Manucao</span>-A
and other properties upon being served on August 7, 1968 with the lower court's
order of preliminary mandatory injunction of August 5, 1968; and (2) for
persisting in their refusal <span style="">after </span>service
by the deputy sheriff on October 2, <span style="">1968
of said </span>order, together with the September 20 restraining order issued
by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Non-compliance with the
preliminary mandatory in­junction is not denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents, however, set up the
following defenses:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the first count,
Maria <span class="SpellE">Aldecoa</span> de <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span>
allegedly could not comply because her son and co-respondent, Jon <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span>, was not around.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the second count, they maintain that there is no order to be complied
with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They reason out that this Court's
restraining order is not directed to them for compliance; that this Court or
the lower court has not ordered the sheriff to serve on them on October 2, 1968
the prelim­inary mandatory injunction and this Court's restraining order, or to
effect the transfer of the litigated prop­erties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their thinking is that since it was the lower
court - not this Court - which issued the injunction, they are insulated from
the contempt charge before us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The preliminary mandatory injunction of <st1:date year="1968" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1968</st1:date>, it is well to remember, was issued
by the lower court upon a directive from this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, violation thereof or
disobedience thereto is an affront directly against the lower court and indirectly
against this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, to reiterate,
the aforesaid injunction came to be by specific command of this Court in
implemen­tation of our holding that petitioner is entitled to
administration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Non-compliance with the
lower court's order is no more than non-recognition of this Court's directive.</p>

<p class="BODY">To make matters difficult, respondent judge which issued the
injunctive order has shown indifference in enforcing the same or compelling
mother and son to abide by it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse,
said court aborted compliance by dissolution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It thus behooves this Court to take action with the end in view of
insuring that our judgment of <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="6">June 25,
 1968</st1:date> is carried out.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Maria <span class="SpellE">Aldecoa</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span> cannot be heard to say that she could not
comply with the injunctive order of </span><st1:date year="1968" day="5" month="8"><span style="">August 5, 1968</span></st1:date><span style=""> when served for the first time on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="6" month="8"><span style="">August 6,
 1968</span></st1:date><span style=""> because her
son, Jon <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span>, was not in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had at the </span>time custody and
control of the properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She could
have kept faith with the court's order had she wanted to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, she chose to shunt it aside upon the
pretext of Jon <span class="SpellE">Ysasi's</span> absence.</p>

<p class="BODY">As for Jon <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span>, the sheriff's return
of <st1:date year="1968" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1968</st1:date>, it is
true, does not state personal service of the order upon him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the events which transpired
thereafter show that he was informed of the mandatory injunction to surrender
possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to mention that
on <st1:date year="1968" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1968</st1:date>, two days
after the order <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> was issued, <u>he</u> and
Maria <span class="SpellE">Aldecoa</span> de <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span>
moved for the dissolution of the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is no reason for refusing obedience to the injunction that no service
at all is made on the party, if he is other­wise informed of its issuance.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents' adamant refusal to honor and carry out the
injunctive order is brought clearer to the open when we consider that this
Court has, on <st1:date year="1968" day="20" month="9">Sep­tember 20, 1968</st1:date>,
restrained the lower court from enfor­cing its dissolution order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, up to now, respondents have not turned
over Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Manucao</span>-<span class="GramE">A and</span>
other speci­fied properties to Juan <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Written demand so to do upon their counsel
and personal service upon them of the injunctive order below and this Court's
said restraining order were unavailing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Immaterial it is that the October 2 service on them of said orders was
allegedly <span class="GramE">effected</span> at the behest of petitioner's
counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Important is that by such service,
private respondents were notified that the injunctive order was still
operative.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is good reason to believe that their own lawyer
communicated to and advised them of the acts required to be done under the
order as well as the con­sequences of refusal to abide thereby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of the oral arguments before
this Court on November 7, 1968, there emerged a significant fact:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before October 3, but after the sheriff had
gone to private respondents in the morning of October 2, Atty. Rodolfo J. Herman,
private respondents' counsel, told his client, Jon <span class="SpellE">Ysasi</span>,
that the properties involved should really be delivered to petitioner in
obedience to the court order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their duty
then was to comply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No compliance was
made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But no justifiable reason there
is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their pattern of conduct does not
sit well with a desire to submit to the injunc­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contumacious disobedience is clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These re­spondents must know that this Court
is not expected to yield to assaults of disrespect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Punishment for contempt is in order.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">4. We now direct attention to the contempt charge against
respondent judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing below on <st1:date year="1968" day="10" month="8">August

<p class="BODY">From a reading of the transcript, it is not hard to come to a
deduction that at that time respondent judge knew and fully realized the import

Court" - are meaningful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His frame
of mind though was set on one thought:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that this Court committed "a little <span style="">mistake" or lapsed into "inadvertence".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, to cure such supposed mistake or
inadvertence, he <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>
suggested a solution - the filing of a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Which, in an afterglow, is but a flanking
movement in a deft sidestep of this Court's clear mandate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"3. As early as 1903, <span class="SpellE"><u>Weigall</u></span>
<u>vs</u>. <u>Shuster</u>, 11 Phil. 340, 354, has reminded us that 'maintenance
of public order and the existence of the commonwealth itself, depend upon the
enforcement of the mandates of the courts and require prompt obedience to them,
not only by private citizens, but in a special manner by the Government
officers who are particularly charged with a knowledge of the law and with the
duty of obeying it.' Respondent is a judge of a superior court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But his official character will not insulate
him from punishment for insubordination of an order of the highest Tribunal of
the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he took his oath of
office as a judge,<span style=""> he swore that he
would 'obey the laws, legal orders, and decrees promulgated by the duly
constituted authorities.' Canon 22 of the Canons of Judicial Ethics should have
re­minded him that '(t<span class="GramE">)he</span> judge should be studiously
careful himself to avoid even the slightest infraction of the law, lest it be a
demoralizing example to others.' <span class="GramE">As Mr. Justice Malcolm once
said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'It would seem hardly necessary to
add that <span style="">judges should </span>respect
the orders and deci­sions of an appellate court.'</span> A fundamental
principle in our democratic system of government is that no official, no matter
how high, is above the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in
this context that we </span>say that respondent judge <span style="">is accountable for the contempt committed by him."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It would not then be out of place to restate a truism long
accepted:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"(T<span class="GramE">)he</span>
Supreme Court, by tradi­tion and in our system of judicial administration, has
the last word on what the law is; it is the final arbiter of any <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> controversy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is only one Supreme Court from whose decision all other courts
should take their bearings."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, re­spondent judge should have known that "(a) becoming
modesty of inferior courts demands realization of the position that they occupy
in the interrelation and opera­tion of the integrated judicial system of the
nation."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the end, we say that it is not impermissible for a judge of
first instance to impress upon lawyers and the public the weight of his
authority in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be <span class="GramE">evident,</span> however, that he may not do so at the expense of
the dignity of a higher tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
prefer to think that restraint still is a trait desirable in those who dispense
justice.</p>
