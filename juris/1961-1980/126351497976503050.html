				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Nicolas A. <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>, Jr., City Judge
of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> City, filed before this Court a formal
complaint, on January 2, 1968, supported by affidavits, charging Hon. <span class="SpellE">Godofredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Escalona</span>, Presiding
Judge of Branch I of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>,
with (1) "inef­ficiency, <span class="SpellE">incompetency</span> and
falsification of public doc­uments"; and (2) "serious misconduct due
to violation of oath of office and/or <span class="SpellE">incompetency</span>".<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the first charge, complainant alleges that the respondent
was not holding session for five hours in hearing cases every day, as in fact
he oftentimes <span style="">held session for only one
hour, or less, a day, then would suspend the session till the next day, and as
a result "the grinding of the wheel of justice in his court is very
slow"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> that respondent Judge was not rendering his
decisions within 90 days after the sub­mission of the cases for decision, as
exemplified by Civil Case No. 3616 entitled "<span class="SpellE">Cesarea</span>
<span class="SpellE">Metran</span> vs. Victor <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>"
which, having been submitted for decision on March 23, 1967, was decided only
in November, 1967, although the decision was dated July 2, 1967, and that from
this very fact alone it was obvious that when respondent collected his salary
for the months of July, August, September, and October, 1967, he falsified his
certificate of service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the second charge, complainant alleged that respondent
Judge allowed himself to be influenced or pressured by the Hon. <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span>, Majority
Floor Leader of the House of Representatives, in his actuations in
Administrative Case No. 26 involving the complainant as the City Judge of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> City, wherein respondent Judge, as investigator,
made in his report findings of facts not supported by the evidence and the law,
and instead of recommending the dropping of the case because it had already
been the subject matter of another investigation - Administrative Case No. 25 -
he recommended that herein complainant be severely rep­rimanded.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint prayed that the corresponding dis­ciplinary action
be meted against respondent Judge.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his answer, supported
by affidavits, respondent Judge urges that the instant complaint has become
moot and academic because he had <span class="GramE">been</span> automatically
retired on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="12" month="1"><span style="">January 12, 1968</span></st1:date><span style=""> for having reached the retirement </span>age
<span style="">of seventy years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In answer to the first charge, respondent
Judge denied the charge that he was holding </span><span style="">ses­</span><span style="">sions for only one
hour a day, and in support of said denial he attached the affidavit of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Filomeno</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Arteche</span>, Jr., the
President of the <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> Bar Association, who stated
that the <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> Bar Association holds high esteem the
integrity and honesty of Judge <span class="SpellE">Godofredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Es­calona</span> and that it is not true that Judge <span class="SpellE">Godofredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Es­calona</span> </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">holding court sessions only one hour a day.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">Respondent
Judge likewise denied the charge that he was inefficient and incompetent, the
denial being supported by the certificate of the Clerk of Court re­garding the
number of cases that he disposed of yearly</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and by the fact that he had decided all the
cases, civil and criminal, that were pending in his court before his
retirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge explained
that his decision in Civil Case No. 3636 was not rendered within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period of ninety days from the date the case
was submitted for decision because from the number of days that elapsed from
March 13, 1967 when the case was submitted for decision, until July 2, 1967
when the court stenographer wrote on the typewriter the decision, 25 days, that
is, from March 14 to March 28, 1967 and from June 10 to June 19, 1967 when he
was on sick and vacation leaves, had to be deducted, and that the delay in the
advice of the notices of the decision to the parties was due to lack of
personnel in the of­fice of the Clerk of Court, which fact is certified to by
the Special Deputy Clerk of Court.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Respondent Judge denied that he had allowed
himself to be influenced by Congressman <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span> in his actuations in Administrative Case No. 26, and
in support thereof he attached supporting affidavits, including that of
Congress man <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span> himself who stated that he had
never seen the respondent Judge about any case pending in the lat­ter's <span class="SpellE">sala</span>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span><span style="">have examined carefully the record of this
case, and <span class="GramE">We</span> are persuaded that the charges against
respondent Judge have no merit, hence the complaint should be dis­missed.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The charge of
inefficiency cannot he sustained.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Judge's output of decided cases from the year 1964-65 to the
date of his retirement on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="12" month="1"><span style="">Janua­ry 12, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">, compares favorably with that of the Judges
of the other branches of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The certificate of the Clerk of Court shows that
during the fiscal year 1964-65 res­pondent Judge disposed of 224 cases, while
the Judge in Branch II disposed of 273 cases, and the Judge of Branch IV
disposed of 298 cases; in 1965-66, respond­ent Judge disposed of 291 cases, the
Judge in Branch II disposed of 295 cases, and the Judge in Branch IV disposed
of 288 cases; in 1966-67, respondent Judge disposed of 188 cases, the Judge in
Branch II disposed of 221 cases, and the Judge in Branch IV disposed of 269
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From </span><st1:date year="1968" day="2" month="1"><span style="">January 2<span class="GramE">,1968</span></span></st1:date><span style=""> to his retirement on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="12" month="1"><span style="">January 12, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondent Judge disposed of 7 cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason why respondent Judge disposed of
only 188 cases in the fiscal year 1966-67 was because he had been on sick leave
for one month.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The charge of alleged falsification of the service certificate by
respondent Judge in order to collect his <span class="GramE">salary,</span> is a
mere presumption and conclusion of com­plainant - this fact is evident even
from the wordings of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
find satisfactory the explana­tion of respondent Judge regarding his failure to
de­cide Civil Case No. 3636 within the period of <span style="">ninety</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">days from the date the case was submitted to
him for decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The charge of alleged serious misconduct on the part of
respondent Judge cannot be entertained.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The alleged conversation between respondent Judge and Congressman <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span> whereby the
Judge was al­leged to have been pressured by the Congressman to recommend the
dismissal of the herein complainant, in Administrative Case No. 26, has been
vehemently denied not only by the Congressman himself but also by the very
person who, according to the affidavits (Annexes F and G) supporting the
complaint, were present during said conversation (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
7, 8, and 9).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if it be assumed that
said conversation did take place, there is no clear showing that the actuation
of respondent Judge in Administrative Case No. 26 was in any way influenced by
Congressman <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The complainant claims that Congressman <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span>
pressured respondent Judge to recommend his dismissal, yet it appears that
respondent Judge simply recommended that complainant <span style="">be reprimanded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A charge of
partiality against a Judge, this Court has said, is to be expected from
disgruntled lawyers.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It is to be expected also from disgruntled
respondents in administrative cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, even if it were true, as alleged in the complaint -
although this is not clearly shown - that respondent Judge, in his report in
Administrative Case No. 26, made findings of fact not supported by evidence,
such would be error of judgment, and there being no proof that such actuation
was due to an in­tention to violate the law or was in disregard of well-known
rules, that actuation would not suffice to consti­tute "serious
misconduct."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE, </span></b><span style="">the Court resolved that the complaint in the
instant administrative case should be, as it is hereby, DISMISSED.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
