				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Once again, this Court, in this appeal from a lower court
decision<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
is faced with the question of resolving conflicting claims as to who, between a
<span class="SpellE">sublessee</span> in actual possession of a lot forming part
of an estate acquired under Commonwealth Act No. 539<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
for the purpose of resale at reasonable prices to <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u>
tenants or occupants and the lessee thereof, is entitled to its purchase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>, now
deceased, the <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span> and the
predecessor-in-interest of the present appellants before us<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
filed this complaint against defendant Gabriel de la Cruz, the lessee, for the
purpose of annulling the award of the then Executive Secretary, <span class="SpellE">Natalio</span> P. Castillo, to such defendant as the party
entitled to its purchase and of <span class="SpellE">cancel­ling</span> the deed
of sale thereafter executed by the defendant Land Tenure Administration in his
favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff was unsuccessful, the
lower court notwithstanding the recognition of his status as <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span> and occupant sustaining the right of defendant
Gabriel de la Cruz, the lessee, to acquire the disputed lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would thus clearly appear that such a
decision runs counter to the controlling doctrine explicitly reaffirmed in the
recent case of <span class="SpellE">Gongon</span> v. Court of Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
where in a sale under circumstances similar to that found in the present
litigation the right of the <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span> as the actual <u>bona</u>
<u>fide</u> occupant to its acqui­sition was accorded respect and
deference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appealed decision thus
cannot stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have to reverse.</p>

<p class="BODY">As set forth in fuller detail in the appealed decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The findings of the respondent
Executive Secretary show that Gabriel de la Cruz bought from one Petra Gloria
the leasehold rights over Lots Nos. 25, 26, 50 and 51 of the Hacienda de <span class="SpellE">Longos</span> in February 1936.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the estate was purchased by the Government in 1947 and
subsequently subdivided for resale, these lots with a total area of 593 square
meters were denominated as Lots Nos. 10, 11, 12 and 13, Block No. 4 of the <span class="SpellE">Longos</span> Estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
these lots were adjacent to each other, de la Cruz enclosed them with a fence
and filled them up with earth because at the time he purchased the leasehold
rights therein they were swampy, and in connection therewith spent around
P2,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter he constructed
three houses on Lots Nos. 10, 11 and 12, which houses were actually occupied by
his two married sons and his own family of ten children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These lots had already been sold to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>De la Cruz likewise desired to purchase Lot
No. 13, the lot in question, which is within his fence."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
It was further noted in the appealed decision that plaintiff's status as <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span> of Lot No. 13 commenced in 1945.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Why the lower court decided the matter adversely to the <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span> was explained in the appealed decision thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is contended that the [lessee] is not
the bona fide tenant of the lot in question because he is not in actual
occupancy and possession thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Executive Secretary however found that the records show that the appellant is
the registered lessee of the disputed lot from the previous owners of the <span class="SpellE">Longos</span> Estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
also enclosed the entire area of 593 square meters with a fence and filled it
up with earth long before the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> became the
sub-lessee thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These improvements
introduced by the appellant on the entire area including the lot in question
are sufficient <span class="SpellE">muniment</span> of his possession
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that the * * *
Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> is actually occupying a portion of
the lot in dispute, but his occupation thereof is that of a sub-lessee who held
the premises subject to the rights of the lessee, * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Executive Secretary states that any
person who holds the leasehold right over a property may also be called <i>a </i>tenant
even if the material possession is held by another."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, as was made mention of earlier, the decision now on appeal
finds no support in the prevailing doctrine that goes back to <span class="SpellE">Marukot</span> v. Jacinto,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> a
1955 decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To quote from the opinion
of the then Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"As a matter of fact, there is no
dispute that appellant Jacinto was the lessee of the entire Lot No. 35, who had
paid rentals thereon prior to the acquisition by the Government of the <span class="SpellE">Tambobong</span> Estate; that since 1931, he has lived in his
house built on his lot located in <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>; that the three <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
Gabriel <span class="SpellE">Marukot</span>, Felipe <span class="SpellE">Baisa</span>
and Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> have respectively occupied lots
35-B, 35-D and 35-E, the first since 1940, the second since 1946, and the third
since 1944, and all the three have their own houses thereon and have been
paying rentals as <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span> of appellant
Jacinto."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
After which, came this portion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In
our opinion, the trial court did not err in giving judgment in favor of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
necessary to decide herein whether a 'tenant' should enjoy priority over an
'occupant' who is a <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span>, because the effect of
the appealed decision is to accommodate both; and this certainly cannot be said
to be <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the intents and purposes of
Commonwealth Act No. 539.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is striking
to note that appellant Jacinto even gets about 300 square meters, or 100 square
meters in excess of the total area of the three lots awarded by the trial court
to the three <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came this affirmation as to who are <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> occupants
entitled to preference under the Act:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> are unquestionably <u>bona</u>
<u>fide</u> occupants within the meaning of Commonwealth Act No. 539 be­cause
they have their respective houses on the lots sublet to them by the tenant <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> Jacinto; and there is absolutely no showing that they
were ordered to vacate either before or after the acqui­sition by the
Government of the <span class="SpellE">Tambobong</span> Estate."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That such a doctrine reflects with fidelity the public policy
that lies behind the enactment of this legislation is clearly set forth in our
1970 decision in <span class="SpellE">Gongon</span> v. Court of Appeals.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In the case at bar it is not
disputed that respondent spouses have their house on another lot (lot No. 34,
block No. 7) in the <span class="SpellE">Tambobong</span> Estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, respondent <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
Rivera is the registered <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> tenant of still another lot,
also in <span class="SpellE">Tambobong</span>, with an area of 2,761 square
meters, which is considerably bigger than the lot in question, where petitioner
and his family constructed their residence and where they have been living
since 1934.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be said,
therefore, that the parties herein stand on an equal footing or under equal
circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice and equity
command that petitioner be given the preferential right to purchase in order to
carry out the avowed policy of the law to give land to the landless."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A reversal of the appealed decision is thus indicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the claim of a <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span>
actually in possession would be ignored or disregarded, the result would be to
heighten social tension and aggravate further the unrest that has its roots in
so many of our countrymen being denied the opportunity of owning even a small
piece of land on which their houses are built and wherein they reside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been the constant policy of this Court
in the con­struction of laws that find its origin in the social justice mandate
of the Constitution to assure that its <span class="SpellE">beneficient</span>
effects be enjoyed by those "who have less in life." Where, as in
this case, the lessee has already acquired three of the lots forming part of the
original lease, the <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span> being only awarded
another portion thereof where he has his small dwelling, justice and equity,
not to mention the prescription of the law itself, to quote anew from Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, "command that [the latter] be given the
preferential right to purchase in order to carry out the avowed policy of the
law to give land to the landless."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

From the decision of the late Judge Guillermo E. Torres of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, promulgated on June 26, 1964, an
appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals which however, in a resolution of

one of law, the judgment having been rendered on the pleadings submitted by the
parties.</p>
