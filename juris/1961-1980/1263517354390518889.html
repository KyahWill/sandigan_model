				<BR><STRONG>TEEHANKEE, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this appeal by the State from the adverse judgment of the
Court of First Instance of Manila, we reaffirm the doctrine of the State's
immunity from suit with respect to its operation of the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service in the Port of Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff, as <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span> of the importer,
Society <span style="">of </span>the Divine Word,
filed this action originally in the City Court of Manila on May 12, 1965
against defendants for the recovery of <span style="">the
value of one </span>of eight boxes of miscellaneous elevator <span style="">components in the amount </span>of P3<span class="GramE">,120.00</span>, which was lost while in the custody of the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service then operated by the Bureau of Customs,
and which plaintiff had in due course paid to the importer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The City Court, as well as the Court of First
Instance of <span style="">Manila, on </span>appeal,
both rendered judgment in favor of plaintiff, <span style="">notwithstand</span>ing defendants' plea of the State's immunity <span style="">from suit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Hence, <span style="">this
appeal.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue of non-suability of the Republic with res­pect to
its operation through the Bureau of Customs of the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Arras</span>tre</span> Service in the Port of
Manila has already been settled in the case of <u>Mobil Philippines
Exploration, Inc. vs. Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service, et al</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
decided by this Court on December 17, 1966 and in a long line of subsequent
decisions, reiterating the doctrine first enunciated in the <u>Mobil</u> case.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>By virtue thereof, the judgment appealed from
must be reversed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision in the <u>Mobil</u>
case indicates the remedy available to plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
and others similarly situated as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Now, the fact that a non-corporate government entity performs
a function proprietary in nature does not necessarily result in its being <span class="SpellE">suable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If said non­governmental
function, is undertaken as an incident to its governmental function, there is
no waiver <span style="">thereby </span>of the
sovereign immunity from suit extended to such gov­ernment entity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the doctrine recognized <span style="">in </span>Bureau of Printing, et al. vs.
Bureau of Printing Employees Association, et al., L-15751, January 28, 1961:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x</blockquote>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The
Bureau of Customs, to repeat, is part of the Department of Finance (Sec. 81,
Rev. Adm. Code), with no personality of <span style="">its
own apart from </span>that of the national government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its primary function is governmental, that of
assessing and collecting <span style="">law­</span>ful
revenues from imported articles and all other <span style="">tariff </span>and customs duties, fees, charges, fines and penalties
(Sec. 602, R. A. 1937).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this
function, <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service is a necessary incident.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Clearly, therefore, although said <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
function may be deemed proprietary, it is a necessary incident of the primary
and governmental function of the Bureau of Customs, so that engaging in the
same does not necessarily render said Bureau liable to suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For otherwise, it could not
perform its governmental function without necessarily exposing itself to suit.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sovereign immunity, granted as to the end,
should not be denied as to the necessary means to that end.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Regardless of the merits of the claim against it, the State, for
obvious reasons of public policy, cannot be sued without its consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff should have filed its present claim
to the General Auditing Office, it being for money under the provisions of
Common­wealth Act 327, which state the conditions under which money claims
against the government may be filed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'It must be remembered that statutory provi­sions waiving State
immunity from suit are strictly construed and that waiver of immunity, being in
<span style="">dero­</span>gation of sovereignty, will
not be lightly inferred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">From</span>
the provision authorizing the Bureau of Customs to lease <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operations to private parties, We see no authority to sue the said Bureau in
the instances where it undertakes to conduct said operation itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Bureau of Customs, acting as part of the
machinery of the national government in the operation of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service, pursuant to express legislative mandate
and as a necessary inci­dent of its prime governmental function, is <span style="">immune </span>from
suit, there being no statute to the contrary."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">ACCORDINGLY</span></b><span style="">, </span>the judgment appealed from is
reversed and the complaint is dismissed, without <span style="">pronouncement as to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
