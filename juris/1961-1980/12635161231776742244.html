				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The question involved in this appeal from an order of dismissal
of the lower court is one of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More specifically, is it the Court of First Instance or the Court of
Agrarian Relations that may take cognizance of a claim for separation pay, a
claim for pay differential, and a claim for overtime pay filed by
plaintiff-appellant, who, as alleged in the complaint and presumptively
admitted in the motion to dismiss of defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>,
which admission is expressly reiterated in their Brief, "was employed as
security guard in [their] agricultural enterprise * * * when the latter
terminated" such employment?<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
It was the holding of the lower court that the case should "be dismissed
on the ground that [it] has no jurisdictional ground to act on the same * *
*."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In thus sustaining defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' contention
that the matter was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian
Relations, the lower court was in error.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its order to dismiss cannot stand.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff-appellant was employed as security guard by defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in their agricultural enterprise in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city> from <st1:date year="1958" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1958</st1:date> until his dismissal, allegedly
without just cause and without prior notice on <st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
his first cause of action, he sought to recover in the concept of
"separation pay" in the amount of P317.50; for the second cause of
action, in the concept of a "claim for pay differential," he would
hold defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> liable for P392.00; and for
the third cause of action, in the concept of "claim for overtime
pay", allegedly due to his performing his work at night time for regular
working days from Monday to Saturday, as well as Sundays and legal holidays, he
would fix the responsibility of defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in
the sum of P1,231.02.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For each of the
above cause of action, he would further seek recovery of P300.00 as exemplary
damages, P100.00 as reimburse­ment of transportation expenses to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and return to <span class="SpellE">Mati</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>, and board and lodging while
in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and another P100.00 as reimbursement of "<span class="SpellE">litis</span>"
expenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">As above noted, the motion to dismiss before the lower court was
predicated on the plaintiff-appellant's status as a former agricultural
employee whose claim, under the Agri­cultural Land Reform Code, which took
effect on August 8, 1963, must be decided by the Court of Agrarian Relations,
which is vested with original and exclusive jurisdiction over all cases or
action involving matters, controversies, disputes, or money claims arising from
agrarian relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a plea, again
as was set forth above, elicited a favorable response from the lower court as
shown by the appealed order of dis­missal.</p>

<p class="BODY">To repeat, the lower court misread the law and the appeal must be
sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statutory provision<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
that controls vests original and exclusive jurisdiction in the Court of
Agrarian Relations over "money claims arising from agrarian relations * *
*." While defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> did operate an
agricultural enterprise, the employment of plaintiff-appellant, prior to his
alleged unjust dismissal, such employment and dismissal giving rise to the
money claims, was that of a security guard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would be to stretch unduly the interpretation of "agrarian
relations" to view the work performed by plaintiff-appellant as embraced
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it would not be
contrary to the reason that prompted the grant of such original and exclusive
jurisdiction to a tribunal, which neces­sarily has in its favor the presumption
of expertise, with its jurisdiction limited to the disposition of controversies
and disputes, as well as money claims arising from the relationship between a
proprietor on the one hand, and tenants, lessees, or workers on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What we have here is an ordinary employ­ment
relationship which gives rise to certain money claims. The work as security
guard lacks that element which would give rise to any form of agrarian
relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, the
controlling statutory provision is not susceptible of the interpretation
erroneously placed upon it by the lower court in granting the order of
dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a doctrine to which there has been an unwavering adherence
and steadfast fealty on the part of this Court that its first and fundamental
duty is to apply the law, theft being no need for an interpretation unless a
literal appli­cation is impossible.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The force of this well-settled principle calls for a reversal of the order of
dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">One last matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The brief
of plaintiff-appellant, dated <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="11">November
 6, 1967</st1:date>, was received by this Court on <st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, on January 15, 1968, a motion to dismiss the appeal, on the
ground that the record on appeal did not disclose on its face that the appeal
was timely perfected, was filed by defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>,
this notwithstanding the fact that the record on appeal was received by this
Court as far back as August 16, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The brief for defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, dated <st1:date year="1968" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1968</st1:date>, thus having been
presumably completed four (4) days prior to their motion to dismiss appeal, was
filed with the Court on <st1:date year="1968" day="24" month="1">January 24,
 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circums­tances,
the merit or lack of it of the motion to dismiss could not be inquired into,
being filed much too late.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, in the light of the constitutional, as well as <span class="SpellE">codal</span> and statutory mandates, there being an explicit
command of protection to labor as well as the promotion of social justice, such
a motion, under circumstances disclosing tardi­ness for which there was no
explanation, could hardly be considered as deserving of sympathy or consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due note should be taken of the long delay to
which plaintiff-appellant had already been subjected in his attempt to have a
judicial determination of whether his claims for separation pay, differ­ential
pay, as well as overtime pay were legally sanctioned by law; the sooner this
litigation then is terminated with finality, the better, not only for the
parties directly involved, but likewise for the primacy of the rule of law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of dismissal of <st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1966</st1:date>, by the lower court, is set
aside, and this case is remanded to it for further proceedings in accordance
with the above opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With costs.</p>
