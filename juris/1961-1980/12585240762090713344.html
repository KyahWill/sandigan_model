<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the month of February 1964, 
petitioners Roy P. <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span>, as administrator of the 
intestate estate of the spouses Manuel M. Mejia and Gloria <span class="SpellE">Laza</span> tin (Special Proceedings No. 48181 of the Court of 
First Instance of Manila), together with his co-petitioners Angelina Mejia Lopez 
and Aurora Mejia <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span> and other heirs of said 
spouses, entered into a contract with respondent Trinidad T. <span class="SpellE">Lazatin</span> for the development and subdivision of three parcels 
of land belonging to said intestate estate. Subsequently <span class="SpellE">Lazatin</span> transferred his rights under the contract to the 
Terra Development Corporation. Months later, petitioners and other coheirs filed 
an action in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> 
City (Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">Q-8344) for the rescission of said 
contract for alleged gross and willful violation of its terms.</span> 
Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Lazatin</span> and the Terra Development 
Corporation, in turn, filed with the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office 
of the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Angeles</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> a complaint against petitioners 
for an alleged violation of the provisions of Article 172 in relation to those 
of Article 171, paragraph 4, of the Revised Penal Code. After conducting a 
preliminary examination in connection therewith, the City Fiscal of Angeles 
filed with the Court of said City an information charging petitioners with the 
crime of falsification of a private document upon the allegation that they made 
it appear In the contract mentioned heretofore that Aurora M. <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span> was the "guardian" of the minor George L. Mejia and 
that Angelina M. Lopez was similarly the "guardian" of the minor Alexander L. 
Mejia, when in truth and In fact they knew that they were not the guardians of 
said minors on the date of the execution of the document (Criminal Case No. 
<span class="GramE">C-2268).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Upon petition of the parties thus 
charged, the City Fiscal of Angeles reinvestigated the case on March 7, 1965 to 
give them an opportunity to present exculpatory evidence, and after the 
conclusion of the reinvestigation the parties charged moved for the dismissal of 
the case mainly on the ground that the City Court of Angeles had no jurisdiction 
over the offense because the private document that contained the alleged false 
statement of fact was signed by them outside the territorial limits of said 
city. <span class="GramE">As the resolution of this motion to dismiss was delayed 
and In the meantime the City Court had set Criminal Case No.</span> C-2268 for 
arraignment, the defendants secured from said court several postponements of the 
arraignment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Finally, in view of the City 
<span class="SpellE">Fiscalâ€™s</span> continued failure to act on the motion to 
dismiss the case, petitioners filed on </span><st1:date month="11" day="26" year="1965"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 26, 
1965</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> with 
the City Court a motion to quash upon the ground that said court had no 
jurisdiction over the offense charged. The complainants in the case - with the 
conformity of the City Fiscal - filed an opposition thereto, and on 
</span><st1:date month="2" day="3" year="1966"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 3, 
1966</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the 
respondent judge denied said motion to quash and reset the arraignment of all 
the <span class="GramE">defendants</span> on March 5 of the same year. In view 
thereof, petitioners filed the present action for certiorari and 
prohibition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Upon the foregoing facts the only 
question to be resolved is whether or not the 
</span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Court</span></st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">of</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Angeles</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> has jurisdiction to try and 
decide Criminal Case No. <span class="GramE">C-2268 for alleged falsification of a 
private document by the parties named in the 
information.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is clear that petitioners are 
not charged with having used a falsified document, in violation of the last 
paragraph of Article 172 of the Revised Penal Code. The charge against them is 
that of having falsified a private document by knowingly and willfully stating 
therein that Aurora M. <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span> and Angelina M. Lopez 
were the "guardians" of their minor brothers George and Alexander, respectively, 
when in fact they knew that, at the time they made such written statement, it 
was Carolina M. de Castro who was the judicial guardian of said minors. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is settled law in criminal 
actions that the place where the criminal offense was committed not only 
determines the venue of the action but is an essential element of jurisdiction 
(</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">U. 
S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> vs. <span class="SpellE">Pagdayuman</span> 5 Phil. 265). Thus, under the provisions of 
Section 86 of the Judiciary Act of 1948, municipal courts have original 
jurisdiction only over criminal offenses committed within their respective 
territorial jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the present case, it is the 
claim of petitioners -a claim supported by the record - that Angelina M. Lopez 
and Aurora M. <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span> signed the private document 
wherein they are alleged to have made a false statement of fact, the first 
within the territorial jurisdiction of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, and the 
second within the territorial jurisdiction of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> 
City, both within the province of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We now come to consider the 
question of when and where is the offense of falsification of a private document 
deemed consummated or committed. Upon this point, We have ruled clearly and 
definitely in U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Infante</span>, 36 Phil. 146, that the 
crime of falsification of a private document defined and penalized by Article 
304 of the Penal Code (now paragraph 2, Article 172 of the Revised Penal Code) 
is consummated when such document is actually falsified with the intent to 
prejudice a third person, whether such falsified document is or is not 
thereafter put to the illegal use for which it was 
intended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Again in 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> vs. <span class="SpellE">Barreto</span>, 36 Phil. p. 207, <span class="GramE">We</span> said: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"xxx <span class="SpellE">xxx</span> <span class="SpellE">xxx</span> The contention of counsel 
would seem to be that the information was defective, in that it fails to set 
forth expressly the place where improper and illegal use was made of the 
falsified document, an allegation which counsel for appellant insists was 
absolutely essential for the proper determination of the court clothed with 
jurisdiction over the alleged offense. But under the definition of the crime of 
falsification of a private document as set forth in article 304 of the Penal 
Code, the offense is consummated at the time when and at the place where the 
document is falsified to the prejudice of or with the intent to prejudice a 
third person, and this whether the falsified document is or is not put to the 
improper or illegal use for which it was intended. It is evident, therefore, 
that the place where the crime is committed is the place where the document is 
actually falsified, and that the improper or illegal use of the document 
thereafter is in no wise a material or essential element of the crime of 
falsification of a private document; xxx <span class="SpellE">xxx</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Applying the above ruling to the 
facts before Us, it would appear that if the private document subject of the 
information was falsified by the persons therein charged, the act of 
falsification - the signing of the document and the coetaneous intent to cause 
damage - was committed and consummated outside the territorial jurisdiction of 
the City of Angeles, and that whether the falsified private document was 
thereafter put or not put to the illegal use for which it was intended, or was 
signed by the other contracting party within the territorial jurisdiction of the 
City of Angeles is in no wise a material or essential element of the crime of 
falsification of the private document, nor could it in any way change the fact 
that the act of falsification charged was committed outside the territorial 
jurisdiction of Angeles City. Thus, that the City Court of Angeles has no 
jurisdiction over the offense charged is beyond question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Respondents, however, contend 
that the motion to quash filed by the defendants necessarily assumes the truth 
of the allegation of the information to the effect that the offense was 
committed within the territorial jurisdiction of Angeles City and that they may 
not be allowed to disprove this at this early stage of the proceedings. This is 
not exactly the law on the matter at present. It was the law applicable to a 
demurrer - now obsolete - to <span class="GramE">an information</span>. The motion 
to quash now provided for in Rule 117 of the Rules of Court is manifestly 
broader in scope than the demurrer, as it is not limited to defects apparent 
upon the face of the complaint or Information but extends to issues arising out 
of extraneous facts, as shown by the circumstance that, among the grounds for a 
motion to quash, Section 2 of said Rule provides for former jeopardy or 
acquittal, extinction of criminal action or liability, insanity of the accused 
etc., which necessarily involve questions of fact in the determination of which 
a preliminary trial is required.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the present case, the portion 
of the record of the reinvestigation which was submitted to the respondent judge 
for consideration in connection with the resolution of the motion to quash filed 
by the <span class="GramE">defendants</span> shows beyond question that the 
offense charged was committed far beyond the territorial jurisdiction of 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Angeles</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On the propriety of the writs 
prayed for, it may be said that, as a general rule, a court of equity will not 
issue a writ of certiorari to annul an order of a lower court denying a motion 
to quash, nor issue a writ of prohibition to prevent said court from proceeding 
with the case after such denial, it being the rule that upon such denial the 
defendant should enter his plea of not guilty and go to trial and, if convicted, 
raise on appeal the same legal questions covered by his motion to quash. In this 
as well as in other jurisdictions, however, this is no longer the hard and fast 
rule.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The writs of certiorari and 
prohibition, as extraordinary legal remedies, are, in the ultimate analysis, 
intended to annul void proceedings; to prevent the unlawful and oppressive 
exercise of legal authority and to provide for a fair and orderly administration 
of justice. Thus, in Yu Kong Eng vs. </span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Trinidad</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 47 Phil. 385, <span class="GramE">We</span> took cognizance of a petition for certiorari and 
prohibition although the accused in the case could have appealed In due time 
from the order complained of, our action in the premises being based on the 
public welfare and the advancement of public policy. In <span class="SpellE">Dimayuga</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>, 43 Phil. 
304, <span class="GramE">We</span> also admitted a petition to restrain the 
prosecution of certain chiropractors although, if convicted, they could have 
appealed. We gave due course to their petition for the orderly administration of 
justice and to avoid possible oppression by the strong arm of the law. And in 
<span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Nepomuceno</span>, 63 
Phil. 627, the petition for certiorari challenging the trial court's action 
admitting an amended information was sustained despite the availability of 
appeal at the proper time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">More recently, <span class="GramE">We</span> said the following in </span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Yap</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> vs. the Hon.

30, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Manifestly, the denial, by 
respondent herein, of the motion to quash the information in case No. 16443, may 
not be characterized as 'arbitrary' or 'despotic', or to be regarded as 
amounting to 'lack of jurisdiction'. The proper procedure, in the event of 
denial of a motion to quash, is for the accused, upon arraignment, to plead not 
guilty and reiterate his defense of former jeopardy, and, in case of conviction, 
to appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, upon the ground that he had been 
twice put in jeopardy of punishment, either for the same offense, or for the 
same act, as the case may be. However, were we to require adherence to this 
pretense, the case at bar would have to be dismissed and petitioner required to 
go through the inconvenience, not to say the mental agony and torture, of 
submitting himself to trial on the merits in case No. 16443, apart from the 
expenses incidental thereto, despite the fact that his trial and conviction 
therein would violate one of his constitutional rights, and that, on appeal to 
this Court, we would, therefore, have to set aside the judgment of conviction of 
the lower court. This would, obviously, be most unfair and unjust. Under the 
circumstances obtaining in the present case, the flaw in the procedure followed 
by petitioner herein may be overlooked, in the interest of a more enlightened 
and substantial justice." <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Indeed, the lack of jurisdiction 
of the City Court of Angeles over the criminal offense charged being patent, it 
would be highly unfair to compel the parties charged to undergo trial in said 
court and suffer all the embarrassment and mental anguish that go with 
it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
