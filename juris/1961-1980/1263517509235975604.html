				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for a writ of <i style="">mandamus</i>
to compel the Auditor General to pass in audit and approve for payment a final
award of the Workmen's Compensation Commission against the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">By decision of <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="12">20
 December 1967</st1:date>, in its Case No. RO6-4911, the Workmen's Compensation
Commission ordered the Republic of the Philippines to pay claimant Modesto
Falcon the sum of P3,360.00 for the death in line of duty of his son, <span class="SpellE">Clarencio</span> T. Falcon, of the Philippine Navy's Naval Air
Unit, plus P336.00 as counsel fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Solicitor General, on behalf of respondent Republic, moved to reconsider,
praying that the gratuity paid to the claimant under Republic Act No. 610 be
deducted from the award, but such deduction was refused by the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No appeal having been perfected, the award
became final and the Commission's Secretary urged the Navy to satisfy the
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Payment was recommended by the
Solicitor General, but the Navy Auditor insisted on the deduction of the
gratuity paid under Republic Act 610, and he was supported by the Auditor
General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this petition for <i style="">mandamus</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The denial of the claimed deduction by the Workmen's Compensation
Commission having become final, the respondent Auditor General has no
alternative but to approve the payment of the Commission's award.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For him to insist on reducing the compensation
payable <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> (by insisting that the indemnity
paid under Republic Act No. 610 should be subtracted from it) amounts to a
review by him of the Commission's final award, and no such review is authorized
by law or jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decisions
of the Workmen's Compensation Commission are exclusively <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
to the Supreme Court, yet even the latter is powerless to alter awards that
have become final, so long as they are made within the Commission's
jurisdiction, which is not questioned in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Provincial Auditor vs. Judge <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>,
99 Phil. 504, relied upon by the respondent, is inapplicable, because there the
Auditor's office was not made a party and was not heard in its defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this Court said in that case:</p>

<blockquote>"and it is not fair to adjudge an
issue in a proceeding where the person to be affected is not a regular party,
and what is worse can not properly assert a defense particularly approved by
statutes and precedents."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case before us, the respondent in the case below was the
entire Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and the Auditor General lays no claim to be independent of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the finality of the award binds and
concludes the Republic, it should likewise conclude the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is elementary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The merits of the question raised by him were
there passed upon and finally resolved in the negative, and it is contrary to
justice and public interest that the issue should be invoked anew.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its denial has become <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A final judgment is conclusive between the parties with respect to the
matter directly adjudged or any other matter that could be raised in relation
thereto.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ prayed for is granted, and respondent
Auditor General is ordered to pass in audit the petitioner's claim as decided
by the Workmen's Compensation Commission in its final judgment of <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="12">20 December 1967</st1:date>. No costs.</p>
