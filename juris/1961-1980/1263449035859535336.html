				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of
Manila denying the petitioner-appellant <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Chun's
motion that he be allowed to take his oath of allegiance as a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Chun filed on <st1:date year="1960" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1960</st1:date> a petition for natuÂ­ralization
with the CFI of Manila (CC 42802).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
due trial, the court rendered judgment granting his petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="1">January
 7, 1963</st1:date> he filed a motion that he be permitted to take his oath of
allegiance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due hearing, the same
court denied the motion on the ground that he "does not have an adequate
knowledge of English."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His subsequent
motion for reconsideration was also denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two basic questions are posed by this appeal, namely, (1) at the
hearing of the motion to take oath, could the lower court still inquire into
any matter affecting the qualifications of the petitioner to become a citizen
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">and</span> (2) is he
possessed of the requisite language qualification?</p>

<p class="BODY">The first question is answered in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A
court which initially granted the petition for naturali</span>zation, at the
hearing of the motion to take oath, <span style="">is </span>not
limited to inquiring into whether the petitioner (1) has not left the
Philippines, (2) has dedicated himself con<span style="">tinuously
to a lawful calling or profession, (3) has not <span style="">been convicted of any offense or violation of Government </span>promulgated
rules; and (4) has not committed any act prejudicial to the interests of the
nation or contrary to any Government announced <span style="">policies </span>(sec. 1, <span style="">R.A.
530).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court may inquire into "<u>any</u>
<u>question</u> affecting the qualification of the applicant" (Lim <span class="SpellE">Hok</span> <span class="SpellE">Albano</span>, etc. vs. Republic,
L-10912, </span>Oct. 31, 1958, and the cases therein cited; <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ching</span> Guan vs. Republic, L-15691, March 27,
1961).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the Government <span style="">is </span>not <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
to <span style="">question </span>the petitioner's
status as a citizen, <span style="">even after hearing
on his petition for naturalization has been had, for unlike final decisions in
actions and other court </span>proceedings, a decision or order granting
citizenship does not immediately become <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
and, a naturalization proceeding not being a judicial adversary proceeding, the
decision therein <span style="">is not <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> </span>as
to <u><span style="">any</span></u><span style=""> <u>matter</u> which would support a judgment
<span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> the certificate of naturalization
(Republic vs. Go Bon Lee, </span>L-11499, April 29, 1961).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the second question, we agree that the petitioner is not
possessed of the requisite language qualification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When asked to translate into <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span> the sentence, "I in<span style="">tend to spend the rest of my life in this country", he wrote "<span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Filipinas ay <span class="SpellE">parang</span> <span class="SpellE">bayan</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span>."
The lower court </span>further found that the petitioner committed many errors
and wrote illegible words when asked to write the sentence above-quoted, and
the sentence "My children are studying in schools in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>."
Deficiency in "working knowledge" of the English language warrants
denial of his motion to take the oath as well as his petition for naturalization
itself (Lim Bun vs. Republic, <span style="">L-12822,
April 26, 1961).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the order appealed from is affirmed, and the
petition for naturalization is denied, at petitioner-appellant's cost.</p>
