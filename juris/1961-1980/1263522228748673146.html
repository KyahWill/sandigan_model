				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Posed in issue in these two cases is the constitutionality of the Anti-Subversion Act,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; which outlaws the Communist Party of the Philippines and other "subversive associations," and punishes any person who "knowingly, willfully and by overt acts affiliates himself with, becomes or remains a member" of the Party or of any other similar "subversive" organization. <p></p> <p> On March 5, 1970 a criminal complaint for violation of section 4 of the Anti-Subversion Act was filed against the respondent Feliciano Co in the Court of First Instance of Tarlac.&nbsp; On March 10 Judge Jose C. de Guzman conducted a preliminary investigation and, finding a <em>prima facie</em><em></em>&nbsp; case against Co, directed the Government prosecutors to file the corresponding information.&nbsp; The twice-amended information, docketed as Criminal Case No. 27, recites:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "That on or about May 1969 to December 5, 1969, in the Municipality of Capas, Province of Tarlac, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, feloniously became an officer and/or ranking leader of the Communist Party of the Philippines, an outlawed and illegal organization aimed to overthrow the Government of the Philippines by means of force, violence, deceit, subversion, or any other illegal means for the purpose of establishing in the Philippines a totalitarian regime and placing the government under the control and domination of an alien power, by being an instructor in the Mao Tse Tung University, the training school of recruits of the New People's Army, the military arm of the said Communist Party of the Philip­pines. </p>"That in the commission of the above offense, the following aggravating circumstances are present, to wit:&nbsp; <blockquote><p> “(a) That the crime has been committed in contempt of or with insult to public authorities; </p>‘(b) That the crime was committed by a band; and &nbsp; <p> “(c) With the aid of armed men or persons who insure or afford impunity."&nbsp; </p></blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Co moved to quash on the ground that the Anti-Subversion Act is a bill of attainder. </p> <p> Meanwhile, on May 25, 1970, another criminal com­plaint was filed with the same court, charging the respondent Nilo Tayag and five others with subversion.&nbsp; After preliminary investigation was had, an information was filed, which, as amended, reads:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "The undersigned Provincial Fiscal of Tarlac and State Prosecutors duly designated by the Secretary of Justice to collaborate with the Provincial Fiscal of Tarlac, pursuant to the Order dated June 5, above entitled case, hereby accuse Nilo S. Tayag, alias Romy Reyes alias TABA, ARTHUR GARCIA, RENATO (REY) CASIPE, ABELARDO GARCIA, MANUEL ALAVADO, BENJAMIN BIE alias COMMANDER MELODY and several JOHN DOES, whose identities are still unknown, for violation of REPUBLIC ACT No. 1700, otherwise known as the Anti-Subversion Law, committed as follows: </p>"That in or about March 1969 and for sometime prior thereto and thereafter, in the Province of Tarlac, within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, and elsewhere in the Philippines, the above-named accused knowingly, willfully and by overt acts organized, joined and/or remained as officers and/or ranking leaders, of the KABATAANG MAKABAYAN, a subversive organization as defined in Republic Act No. 1700; that BENJAMIN BIE alias COMMANDER MELODY, in addition thereto, knowingly, willfully and by overt acts joined and/or remained as a member and became an officer and/or ranking leader not only of the Communist Party of the Philippines but also of the New People's Army, the military arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines; and that all the above-named accused, as such officers and/or ranking leaders of the aforestated subversive orga­nizations, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, did then and there knowingly, willfully and feloniously commit subversive and/or seditious acts, by inciting, instigating and stirring the people to unite and rise publicly and tumultuously and take up arms against the government, and/or engage in rebellious conspiracies and riots to overthrow the government of the Republic of the Philippines by force, violence, deceit, sub­version and/or other illegal means, among which are the following:&nbsp; <blockquote><p> “1. On several occasions within the province of Tarlac, the accused conducted meetings and/or seminars wherein the said accused delivered speeches instigating and inciting the people to unite, rise in arms and overthrow the Government of the Republic of the Philippines, by force, violence, deceit, subversion and/or other illegal means; and toward this end, the said accused organized, among others a chapter of the KABATAANG MAKABAYAN in barrio Motrico, La Paz, Tarlac for the avowed purpose of undertaking or ­promoting an armed revolution, subversive and/or seditious propaganda, conspiracies, and/or riots and/or other illegal means to discredit and over­throw the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and to establish in the Philippines a Communist regime. </p>“2. The accused NILO TAYAG alias ROMY REYES alias TABA, together with FRANCISCO PORTEM alias KIKO Gonzales and others, pursued the above subversive and/or seditious activities in San Pablo City by recruiting members for the New People's Army, and/or by instigating and inciting the people to organize and unite for the purpose of overthrowing the Government of the Republic of the Philippines through armed revolution, deceit, subversion and/or other illegal means, and estab­lishing in the Philippines a Communist Government.&nbsp; </blockquote><p> "That the following aggravating circumstances attended the commission of the offense:&nbsp; (a) aid of armed men or persons to insure or afford impunity; and (b) craft, fraud, or disguise was employed." </p> </blockquote> <p> On July 21, 1970 Tayag moved to quash, impugning the validity of the statute on the grounds that (1) it is a bill of attainder; (2) it is vague; (3) it embraces more than one subject not expressed in the title thereof; and (4) it denies him the equal protection of the laws. </p> <p> Resolving the constitutional issues raised, the trial court, in its resolution of September 15, 1970, declared the statute void on the grounds that it is a bill of attainder and that it is vague and overbroad, and dismissed the informations against the two accused.&nbsp; The Government appealed.&nbsp; We resolved to treat its appeal as a special civil action for <em>certiorari.</em></p> <p align="center"><em> II.&nbsp; Is the Act a Bill of Attainder?</em></p> <p> Article III, section 1 (11) of the Constitution states that "No bill of attainder or <em>ex-post facto</em><em></em> law shall be enacted."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> A bill of attainder is a legislative act which inflicts punish­ment without trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Its essence is the substitution of a legislative for a judicial determination of guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The consti­tutional ban against bills of attainder serves to implement the principle of separation of powers<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> by confining legislatures to rule-making<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and thereby forestalling legislative usurpa­tion of the judicial function.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> History in perspective, bills of attainder were employed to suppress unpopular causes and political minorities,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; and it is against this evil that the constitutional prohibition is directed.&nbsp; The singling out of a definite class, the imposition of a burden on it, and a legislative intent, suffice to stigmatize a statute as a bill of attainder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p> <p> In the case at bar, the Anti-Subversion Act was, condemned by the court <em>a</em><em>quo</em>&nbsp; as a bill of attainder because it "tars and feathers" the Communist Party of the Philippines as a "continuing menace to the freedom and security of the country; its existence, a 'clear, present and grave danger to the security of the Philippines.' " By means of the Act, the trial court said, Congress usurped "the powers of the judge," and assumed "judicial magistracy by pronouncing the guilt of the CPP without any of the forms or safeguards of judicial trial." Finally, according to the trial court, "if the only issue [to be determined] is whether or not the accused is a knowing and voluntary member, the law is still a bill of attainder because it has expressly created a presumption of organizational guilt which the accused can never hope to overthrow." </p> <p> 1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Act is viewed in its actual operation, it will be seen that it does not specify the Communist Party of the Philippines or the members thereof for the purpose of punishment.&nbsp; What it does is simply to declare the Party to be an organized conspiracy for the overthrow of the Govern­ment for the purposes of the prohibition, stated in section 4, against membership in the outlawed organization.&nbsp; The term "Communist Party of the Philippines" is used solely for definitional purposes.&nbsp; In fact the Act applies not only to the Communist Party of the Philippines but also to "any other organization having the same purpose and their successors." Its focus is not on individuals but on conduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p> <p> This feature of the Act distinguishes it from section 504 of the U.S. Federal Labor-Management Reporting and Dis­closure Act of 1959<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> which, in <em>U.S. vs. Brown</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> was held to be a bill of attainder and therefore unconstitutional.&nbsp; Section 504 provided in its pertinent parts as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> “(a) No person who is or has been a member of the Communist Party * * * shall serve:<br></p><blockquote><p> "(1) as an officer, director, trustee, member of any executive board or similar governing body, business agent, manager, organizer, or other employee (other than as an employee performing exclusively clerical or custodial duties) of any labor organization * * *&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p align="center"> * * *&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> during or for five years after the termination of his membership in the Communist Party * * *&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p> “(b) Any person who willfully violates this section shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both." </p> </blockquote> <p> This statute specifies the Communist Party, and imposes disability and penalties on its members.&nbsp; Membership in the Party, without more, <em>ipso</em><em>facto</em>&nbsp; disqualifies a person from becoming an officer or a member of the governing body of any labor organization.&nbsp; As the Supreme Court of the United States pointed out:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "Under the line of cases just outlined, sec. 504 of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act plainly constitutes a bill of attainder.&nbsp; Congress undoubtedly possesses power under the Commerce Clause to enact legislation designed to keep from positions affecting interstate commerce persons who may use of such positions to bring about political strikes.&nbsp; In sec. 504, however, Congress has exceeded the authority granted it by the Constitution.&nbsp; The statute does not set forth a generally applicable rule decreeing that any person who commits certain acts or possesses certain characteristics (acts and characteristics which, in Congress' view, make them likely to initiate political strikes) shall not hold union office, and leaves to courts and juries the job of deciding what persons have committed the specified acts or possessed the specified characteristics.&nbsp; <em>Instead, it designates in no uncertain terms the persons who possess the feared characteristics</em> and therefore cannot hold union office without incurring criminal liability — <em>members of the Communist Party</em>. </p>"Communist Party <em>vs</em>. Subversive Activities Control Board, 367 US 1, 6 Led 2 d 625, 81 S CT 1357, lends support to our conclusion.&nbsp; That case involved an appeal from an order by the Control Board ordering the Communist Party to register as a 'Communist-action organization,' under the Sub­versive Activities Control Act of 1950, 64 Stat 987, 50 USC sec. 781 <em>et</em><em>seq</em>. (1958 ed).&nbsp; The definition of 'Communist-action organization' which the Board is to apply is set forth in sec. 3 of the Act:&nbsp; <blockquote><p> " `[A]ny organization in the United States * * * which (i) is substantially directed, domina­ted, or controlled by the foreign government or foreign organization controlling the world Communist movement referred to in section 2 of this title, and (ii) operates primarily to advance the objectives of such world Communist movement * * *' 64 Stat 989, 50 USC sec. 782 (1958 ed.) </p></blockquote><p> "A majority of the Court rejected the argument that the Act was a bill of attainder, reasoning that sec. 3 does not specify the persons or groups upon which the deprivations set forth in the Act are to be imposed, but instead sets forth a general definition.&nbsp; Although the Board has determined in 1953 that the Communist Party was a `Communist-action organization,' the Court found the statutory definition not to be so narrow as to insure that the Party would always come within it:&nbsp; </p><p>"In this proceeding the Board has found, and the Court of Appeals has sustained its conclusion, that the Communist Party, by virtue of the activities in which it now engages, comes within the terms of the Act.&nbsp; If the Party should at any time choose to abandon these activities, after it is </p> </blockquote> <p> once registered pursuant to sec. 7, the Act provides adequate means of relief.&nbsp; (367 US, at 87, 6 L ed 2d at 683)" </p> <p> Indeed, were the Anti-Subversion Act a bill of attainder, it would be totally unnecessary to charge Communists in court, as the law alone, without more, would suffice to secure their punishment.&nbsp; But the undeniable fact is that their guilt still has to be judicially established.&nbsp; The Government has yet to prove at the trial that the accused joined the Party knowingly, willfully and by overt acts, and that they joined the Party, knowing its subversive character and with specific intent to further its basic objective, <em>i.e</em>., to overthrow the existing Government by force, deceit, and other illegal means and place the country under the control and domination of a foreign power. </p> <p> As to the claim that under the statute organizational guilt is nonetheless imputed despite the requirement of proof of knowing membership in the Party, suffice it to say that that is precisely the nature of conspiracy, which has been referred to as a "dragnet device" whereby all who participate in the criminal covenant are liable.&nbsp; The contention would be correct if the statute were construed as punishing mere membership devoid of any specific intent to further the unlawful goals of the Party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> But the statute specifically requires that membership must be <em>knowing</em>&nbsp; or active, with specific intent to further the illegal objectives of the Party.&nbsp; That is what section 4 means when it requires that membership, to be unlawful, must be shown to have been acquired "knowingly, willfully and by overt acts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The ingredient of specific intent to pursue the unlawful goals of the Party must be shown by "overt acts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <em>This</em><em>constitutes</em>&nbsp; an element of "membership" distinct from the ingredient of guilty knowledge.&nbsp; The former requires proof of direct participation in the organization's unlawful activities, while the latter requires proof of mere adherence to the organization's illegal objectives. </p> <p> 2. Even assuming, however, that the Act specifies individuals and not activities, this feature is not enough to render it a bill of attainder.&nbsp; A statute prohibiting partners or employees of securities underwriting firms from serving as officers or employees of national banks on the basis of a legislative finding that the persons mentioned would be subject to the temptation to commit acts deemed inimical to the national economy, has been declared not to be a bill of attainder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; Similarly, a statute requiring every secret, oath-bound society having a membership of at least twenty to register, and punishing any person who becomes a member of such society which fails to register or remains a member thereof, was declared valid even if in its operation it was shown to apply only to the members of the Ku Klux Klan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p> <p> In the Philippines the validity of section 23 (b) of the Industrial Peace Act,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; requiring labor unions to file with the Department of Labor affidavits of union officers "to the effect that they are not members of the Communist Party and that they are not members of any organization which teaches the overthrow of the Government by force or by any illegal or unconstitutional method," was upheld by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p> <p> Indeed, it is only when a statute applies either to named individuals or to easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to inflict punishment on them without a judicial trial does it become a bill of attainder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> It is upon this ground that statutes which disqualified those who had taken part in the rebellion against the Government of the United States during the Civil War from holding office,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> or from exercising their profession,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; or which prohibited the payment of further compensation to individuals named in the Act on the basis of a finding that they had engaged in subversive activities,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> or which made it a crime for a member of the Communist Party to serve as an officer or employee of a labor union,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> have been invalidated as bills of attainder. </p> <p> But when the judgment expressed in legislation is so universally acknowledged to be certain as to be "judicially noticeable," the legislature may apply its own rules, and judicial hearing is not needed fairly to make such determina­tion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p> <p> In <em>New York ex rel. Bryant vs. Zimmerman</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; the New York legislature passed a law requiring every secret, oath-bound society with a membership of at least twenty to register, and punishing any person who joined or remained a member of such a society failing to register.&nbsp; While the statute did not specify the Ku Klux Klan, in its operation the law applied to the KKK exclusively.&nbsp; In sustaining the statute against the claim that it discriminated against the Ku Klux Klan, while exempting other secret, oath-bound organizations like masonic societies and the Knights of Columbus, the United States Supreme Court relied on common knowledge of the nature and activities of the Ku Klux Klan.&nbsp; The Court said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "The courts below recognized the principle shown in the cases just cited and reached the conclusion that the classification was justified by a difference between the two classes of associations shown by experience, and that the difference consisted (a) in a manifest tendency on the part of one class to make the secrecy surrounding its purposes and membership a cloak for acts and conduct inimical to personal rights and public welfare, and (b) in the absence of such a tendency on the part of the other class.&nbsp; In pointing out this difference one of the courts said of the Ku Klux Klan, the principal association in the included class:&nbsp; 'It is a matter of common knowledge that this organization functions largely at night, its members disguised by hoods and gowns and doing things calculated to strike terror into the minds of the people;' and later said of the other class:&nbsp; 'These organizations and their purposes are well known, many of them having been in existence for many years.&nbsp; Many of them are oath-bound and secret.&nbsp; But we hear no complaint against them regarding violation of the peace or interfering with the rights of others.' Another of the courts said:&nbsp; 'It is a matter of common knowledge that the association or organization of which the relator is concededly a member exercises activities tending to the prejudice and intimidation of sundry classes of our citizens.&nbsp; But the legislation is not confined to this society;' and later said of the other class ‘Labor unions have a recognized lawful purpose.&nbsp; The benevolent orders mentioned in the Benevolent Orders Law have already received legislative scrutiny and have been granted special privileges so that the legislature may well consider them benefi­cial rather than harmful agencies.' The third court, after recognizing 'the potentialities of evil in secret societies,' and observing that 'the danger of certain organizations has been judicially demonstrated,' — meaning in that state, said:&nbsp; 'Benevolent orders, labor unions and college fraternities have existed for many years, and, while not immune from hostile criticism, have on the whole justified their existence." </p>"We assume that the legislature had before it such information as was readily available, including the published report of a hearing, before a com­mittee of the House of Representatives of the 57th Congress relating to the formation, purposes and activities of the Ku Klux Klan.&nbsp; If so it was advised — putting aside controverted evidence — that the order was a revival of the Ku Klux Klan of an earlier time with additional features borrowed from the Know Nothing and the A.P.A. orders of other periods; that its membership was limited to native-born, gentile, protestant whites; that in part of its constitution and printed creed it proclaimed the widest freedom for all and full adherence to the Constitution of the United States; in another exacted of its members an oath to shield and preserve 'white supremacy;' and in still another declared any person actively opposing its principles to be ‘a dangerous ingredient in the body politic of our country and an enemy to the weal of our national commonwealth;' that it was conducting a crusade against Catholics, Jews, and Negroes, and stimulating hurtful religious and race prejudices; that it was striving for political power and assuming a sort of guardianship over the adminis­tration of local, state and national affairs; and that at times it was taking into its own hands the punishment of what some of its members conceived to be crimes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><p> </p> </blockquote> <p> In the Philippines the character of the Communist Party has been the object of continuing scrutiny by this Court.&nbsp; In 1932 we found the Communist Party of the Philippines to be an illegal association.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; In 1969 we again found that the objective of the Party was the "overthrow of the Philippine Government by armed struggle and to establish in the Philippines a communist form of government similar to that of Soviet Russia and Red China."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> More recently, in <em>Lansang vs. Garcia</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; we noted the growth of the Communist Party of the Philippines and the organization of Communist fronts among youth organizations such as the <em>Kabataang Makabayan (KM)</em>&nbsp; and the emergence of the New People's Army.&nbsp; After meticulously reviewing the evidence, we said:&nbsp; "We entertain, therefore, no doubts about the existence of a sizeable group of men who have publicly risen in arms to overthrow the government and have thus been and still are engaged in rebellion against the Government of the Philip­pines." </p> <p> 3.&nbsp; Nor is it enough that the statute specify persons or groups in order that it may fall within the ambit of the prohibition against bills of attainder.&nbsp; It is also necessary that it must apply retroactively and reach past conduct.&nbsp; This requirement follows from the nature of a bill of attainder as a legislative adjudication of guilt.&nbsp; As Justice Frankfurter observed, "frequently a bill of attainder was * * * doubly objectionable because of its <em>ex-post facto</em><em></em> features.&nbsp; This is the historic explanation for uniting the two mischiefs in one clause — 'No Bill of Attainder or <em>ex-post facto</em><em></em> law shall be passed.' * * * Therefore, if [a statute] is a bill of attainder it is also an <em>ex-post facto</em><em></em> law.&nbsp; But if it is not an <em>ex-post facto</em><em></em> law, the reasons that establish that it is not are persuasive that it cannot be a bill of attainder."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p> <p> Thus in <em>Gardner vs. Board of Public Works</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the validity of the Charter of the City of Los Angeles which provided:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "* * * [N]o person shall hold or retain or eligible for any public office or employment in the service of the City of Los Angeles, in any office or department thereof, either elective or appointive, who has within five (5) years prior to the effective date of this section advised, advocated, or taught, or who may, after this section becomes effective, become a member of or affiliated with any group, society, association, organization or party which advises, advocates or teaches or has within said period of five (5) years advised, advocated, or taught the overthrow by force or violence of the Government of the United States of America or of the State of California." </p> </blockquote> <p> In upholding the statute, the Court stressed the prospective application of the Act to the petitioner therein, thus:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "* * * Immaterial here is any opinion we might have as to the charter provision insofar as it purported to apply retrospectively for a five-year period to its effective date.&nbsp; We assume that under the Federal Constitution the Charter Amendment is valid to the extent that it bars from the city's public service persons who, subsequently to its adoption in 1941, advise, advocate, or teach the violent overthrow of the Government or who are or become affiliated with any group doing so.&nbsp; The provisions operating thus prospectively were a reasonable regulation to protect the municipal service by establishing an employment qualifica­tion of loyalty to the State and the United States. </p>"* * * Unlike the provisions of the charter and ordinance under which petitioners were removed, the statute in the Lovett case did not declare general and prospectively operative standards of qualification and eligibility for public employment.&nbsp; Rather, by its terms it prohibited any further payment of compensation to named individuals or employees.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, viewed against the legislative background, the statute was held to have imposed penalties without judicial trial."  </blockquote> <p> Indeed, if one objection to the bill of attainder is that Congress thereby assumes judicial magistracy, then it must be demonstrated that the statute claimed to be a bill of attainder reaches past conduct and that the penalties it imposes are inescapable.&nbsp; As the U.S. Supreme Court observed with respect to the U.S. Federal Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950: </p> <p> "Nor is the statute made an act of 'outlawry' or of attainder by the fact that the conduct which it regulates is described with such particularity that, in probability, few organizations will come within the statutory terms.&nbsp;

Section 4 thereof expressly states that the prohibition therein applies only to acts committed "After the approval of this Act." Only those who "knowingly, willfully and by overt acts affiliate themselves with, become or remain members of the Communist Party of the Philip­pines and/or its successors or of any subversive association" after June 20, 1957, are punished.&nbsp; Those who were members of the Party or of any other subversive association at the time of the enactment of the law, were given the opportunity of purging themselves of liability by renouncing in writing and under oath their membership in the Party.&nbsp; The law expressly provides that such renunciation shall operate to exempt such persons from penal liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The penalties prescribed by the Act are therefore not inescapable. </p> <p align="center"><em> III.</em> &nbsp; <em>The Act and the Requirements of Due Process</em></p> 1.&nbsp; As already stated, the legislative declaration in section 2 of the Act that the Communist Party of the Philippines is an organized conspiracy for the overthrow of the Govern­ment is intended <p> not to provide the basis for a legislative finding of guilt of the members of the Party but rather to justify the proscription spelled out in section 4.&nbsp; Freedom of expression and freedom of association are so fundamental that they are thought by some to occupy a "preferred position" in the hierarchy of constitutional values.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; Accor­dingly, any limitation on their exercise must be justified by the existence of a substantive evil.&nbsp; This is the reason why before enacting the statute in question Congress conducted careful investigations and then stated its findings in the preamble, thus:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "* * *[T]he Communist Party of the Philip­pines, although purportedly a political party, is in fact an organized conspiracy to overthrow the Government of the Republic of the Philippines not only by force and violence but also by deceit, subversion and other illegal means, for the purpose of establishing in the Philippines a totalitarian regime subject to alien domination and control; </p>"* * * [T]he continued existence and activities of the Communist Party of the Philippines consti­tutes a clear, present and grave danger to the security of the Philippines; &nbsp; <p> "* * * [I]n the face of the organized, systematic and persistent subversion, national in scope but international in direction, posed by the Communist Party of the Philippines and its activities, there is urgent need for special legislation to cope with this continuing menace to the freedom and security of the country." </p> </blockquote> <p> In truth, the constitutionality of the Act would be open to question if, instead of making these findings in enacting the statute, Congress omitted to do so. </p> <p> In saying that by means of the Act Congress has assumed judicial magistracy, the trial court failed to take proper account of the distinction between <em>legislative</em><em>fact</em> and <em>adjudicative</em><em>fact</em>.&nbsp; Professor Paul Freund elucidates the crucial distinction, thus:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "* * *A law forbidding the sale of beverages containing more than 3.2 per cent of alcohol would raise a question of legislative fact, i.e., whether this standard has a reasonable relation to public health, morals, and the enforcement problem.&nbsp; A law forbidding the sale of intoxicating beverages (assuming it is not so vague as to require supplementation by rule-making) would raise a question of adjudicative fact, i.e., whether this or that beverage is intoxicating within the meaning of the statute and the limits on governmental action imposed by the Constitution.&nbsp; Of course what we mean by fact in each case is itself an ultimate conclusion founded on underlying facts and on criteria of judgment for weighing them. </p>"A conventional formulation is that legislative facts those facts which are relevant to the legislative judgment will not be canvassed save to determine whether there is a rational basis for believing that they exist, while adjudicative facts those which tie the legislative enactment to the litigant - are to be demonstrated and found according to the ordinary standards prevailing for judicial trials."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><p> </p> </blockquote> <p> The test formulated in <em>Nebbia vs. New York</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> and adopted by this Court in <em>Lansang vs. Garcia</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> is that "if laws are seen to have a reasonable relation to a proper <em>legislative</em><em>purpose</em>, and are neither arbitrary nor discrimina­tory, the requirements of due process are satisfied, and judicial determination to that effect renders a court <em>functus</em><em>officio</em>." The recital of legislative findings implements this test. </p> <p> With respect to a similar statement of legislative findings in the U.S. Federal Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950 (that "Communist-action organizations" are controlled by the foreign government controlling the world Communist movement and that they operate primarily to "advance the objectives of such world Communist movement"), the U. S. Supreme Court said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "It is not for the courts to reexamine the validity of these legislative findings and reject them.&nbsp; * * * They are the product of extensive investiga­tion by Committees of Congress over more than a decade and a half.&nbsp; Cf. Nebbia <em>vs</em>. New York, 291 U.S. 502, 516, 530.&nbsp; We certainly cannot dismiss them as unfounded or irrational imaginings.&nbsp; * * * And if we accept them, as we must, as a not unentertainable appraisal by Congress of the threat which Communist organizations pose not only to existing government in the United States, but to the United States as a sovereign, independent Nation.&nbsp; * * we must recognize that the power of Congress to regulate Communist organizations of this nature is extensive."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> This statement, <em>mutatis mutandis</em><em></em>, may be said of the legislative findings articulated in the Anti-Subversion Act. </p> <p> That the Government has a right to protect itself against subversion is a proposition too plain to require elaboration.&nbsp; Self-preservation is the "ultimate value" of society.&nbsp; It surpasses and transcends every other value, "for if a society cannot protect its very structure from armed internal attack, * * * no subordinate value can be protected."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> As Chief Justice Vinson so aptly said in <em>Dennis vs. United States</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "Whatever theoretical merit there may be to the argument that there is a 'right' to rebellion against dictatorial governments is without force where the existing structure of government provides for peaceful and orderly change.&nbsp; We reject any princi­ple of governmental helplessness in the face of preparation for revolution, which principle, carried to its logical conclusion, must lead to anarchy.&nbsp; No one could conceive that it is not within the power of Congress to prohibit acts intended to overthrow the government by force and violence." </p> </blockquote> <p> 2.&nbsp; By carefully delimiting the reach of the Act to conduct (as explicitly described in section 4 thereof), Congress reaffirmed its respect for the rule that "even though the governmental purpose be legitimate and substantial, that purpose cannot be pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental personal liberties when the end can be more narrowly achieved."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> The requirement of <em>knowing</em> membership, as distinguished from <em>nominal</em> membership, has been held as a sufficient basis for penalizing membership in a subversive organization.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> For, as has been stated:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "Membership in an organization renders aid and encouragement to the organization; and when membership is accepted or retained with knowl­edge that the organization is engaged in an unlawful purpose, the one accepting or retaining membership with such knowledge makes himself a party to the unlawful enterprise in which it is engaged."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> 3. The argument that the Act is unconstitutionally overbroad because section 2 merely speaks of "overthrow" of the Government and overthrow may be achieved by <em>peaceful</em>, means, misconceives the function of the phrase "knowingly, willfully and by overt acts" in section 4.&nbsp; Section 2 is merely a legislative declaration; the definitions of and the penalties prescribed for the different acts proscribed are stated in section 4 which requires that membership in the Communist Party of the Philippines, to be unlawful, must be acquired "knowingly, willfully and by overt acts." Indeed, the first "whereas" clause makes clear that the overthrow contem­plated is "overthrow not only by force and violence but also by deceit, subversion and other illegal means." The absence of this qualification in section 2 appears to be due more to an oversight rather than to deliberate omission. </p> <p> Moreover, the word "overthrow" sufficiently connotes the use of violent and other illegal means.&nbsp; Only in a metaphorical sense may one speak of peaceful overthrow of governments, and certainly the law does not speak in metaphors.&nbsp; In the case of the Anti-Subversion Act, the use of the word "overthrow" in a metaphorical sense is hardly consistent with the clearly delineated objective of the "overthrow," namely, "establishing in the Philippines a totalitarian regime and place [sic] the Government under the control and domination of an alien power." What this Court once said in a prosecution for sedition is <em>apropos</em>:&nbsp; "The language used by the appellant clearly imported an overthrow of the Government by violence, and it should be interpreted in the plain and obvious sense in which it was evidently intended to be understood.&nbsp; The word 'overthrow' could not have been intended as referring to an ordinary change by the exercise of the elective franchise.&nbsp; The use of the whip [which the accused exhorted his audience to use against the Constabulary], an instrument designed to leave marks on the sides of adversaries, is inconsistent with the mild interpretation which the appellant would have us impute to the language."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> </p> <p align="center"><em> &nbsp;IV.&nbsp; The Act and the Guaranty of Free Expression</em></p> <p> As already pointed out, the Act is aimed against conspiracies to overthrow the Government by force, violence or other illegal means.&nbsp; Whatever interest in freedom of speech and freedom of association is infringed by the prohibition against knowing membership in the Communist Party of the Philippines, is so indirect and so insubstantial as to be clearly and heavily outweighed by the overriding considerations of national security and the preservation of democratic institu­tions in this country. </p> <p> The membership clause of the U.S. Federal Smith Act is similar in many respects to the membership provision of the Anti-Subversion Act.&nbsp; The former provides:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "Whoever organizes or helps or attempts to organize any society, group, or assembly of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage the overthrow or destruction of any such government by force or violence; or becomes or is a member of, or affiliated with, any such society, group or assembly of persons, knowing the purpose thereof - </p>"Shall be fined not more than $20,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both, and shall be ineligible for employment by the United States or any department or agency thereof, for the five years next following his conviction.&nbsp; * * *”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><p> </p> </blockquote> <p> In sustaining the validity of this provision, the Court said in <em>Scales vs. United States</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "It was settled in <em>Dennis</em> that advocacy with which we are here concerned is not constitu­tionally protected speech, and it was further established that a combination to promote such advocacy, albeit under the aegis of what purports to be a political party, is not such association as is protected by the first Amendment.&nbsp; We can discern no reason why membership, when it constitutes a purposeful form of complicity in a group engaging in this same forbidden advocacy, should receive any greater degree of protection from the guarantees of that Amendment." </p> </blockquote> <p> Moreover, as was held in another case, where the problems of accommodating the exigencies of self-preservation and the values of liberty are as complex and intricate as in the situation described in the legislative findings stated in the U.S. Federal Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, the legislative judgment as to how that threat may best be met consistently with the safeguards of personal freedoms is not to be set aside merely because the judgment of judges would, in the first instance, have chosen other methods.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; For in truth, legislation, "whether it restrains freedom to hire or freedom to speak, is itself an effort at compromise between the claims of the social order and individual freedom, and when the legislative compromise in either case is brought to the judicial test the court stands one step removed from the conflict and its resolution through law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> </p> <p align="center"><em> V.&nbsp; The Act and its Title</em></p> <p> The respondent Tayag invokes the constitutional command that "no bill which may be enacted into law shall embrace more than one subject which shall be expressed in the title of the bill."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> </p> <p> What is assailed as not germane to or embraced in the title of the Act is the last proviso of section 4 which reads:&nbsp;

Section 1 provides that' "This Act shall be known as the Anti-Subversion Act." Together with the main title, the short title of the statute unequivocal­ly indicates that the subject-matter is subversion in general which has for its fundamental purpose the substitution of a foreign totalitarian regime in place of the existing Government and not merely subversion by Communist conspiracies. </p> <p> The title of a bill need not be a catalogue or an index of its contents, and need not recite the details of the Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; It is a valid title if it indicates in broad but clear terms the nature, scope, and consequences of the proposed law and its operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; A narrow or technical construction is to be avoided, and the statute will be read fairly and reasonably in order not to thwart the legislative intent.&nbsp; We hold that the Anti-Subversion Act fully satisfies these requirements. </p> <p align="center"><em> VI.</em> &nbsp; <em>Conclusion and Guidelines</em></p> <p> In conclusion, even as we uphold the validity of the Anti-Subversion Act, we cannot overemphasize the need for prudence and circumspection in its enforcement, operating as it does in the sensitive area of freedom of expression and belief.&nbsp; Accordingly, we set the following <em>basic</em><em>guidelines</em>&nbsp; to be observed in any prosecution under the Act.&nbsp; The Govern­ment, in addition to proving such circumstances as may affect liability, must establish the following elements of the crime of joining the Communist Party of the Philippines or any other subversive association:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> (1) &nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of subversive organizations other than the Communist Party of the Philippines, (a) that the purpose of the organization is to overthrow the present Government of the Philippines and to establish in this country a totalitarian regime under the domination of a foreign power; (b) that the accused joined such organization; and (c) that he did so knowingly, willfully and by overt acts; and </p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of the Communist Party of the Philippines, (a) that the CPP continues to pursue the objectives which led Congress in 1957 to declare it to be an organized conspiracy for the overthrow of the Government by illegal means for the purpose of placing the country under the control of a foreign power; (b) that the accused joined the CPP; and (c) that he did so willfully, knowingly and by overt acts.  </blockquote> <p> We refrain from making any pronouncement as to the crime of remaining a member of the Communist Party of the Philippines or of any other subversive association; we leave this matter to future determination. </p> <p><strong> ACCORDINGLY </strong> , the questioned resolution of September 15, 1970 is set aside, and these two cases are hereby remanded to the court <em>a</em><em>quo</em> for trial on the merits.&nbsp; Costs <em>de</em><em>oficio.</em></p> <p><em> Makalintal, Zaldivar, Teehankee, Barredo, </em> and<em> Esguerra, JJ., </em>concur.</p> <p> <em>Concepcion, C.J., </em>concurs in the result.</p> <p> <em>Fernando, J., </em>dissents in a separate opinion.</p> <p> <em>Makasiar </em>and<em> Antonio, JJ., </em>took no part.</p> <hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rep.

Laurel (of the 1934 Constitutional Convention) referred to the Anglo-American origin of this right, thus:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"<em>No ex post facto law or bill of attainder shall be enacted</em>.&nbsp; This provision is found in the American Federal Constitution (Art. 1, Sec. 9) and is applicable to the States (<em>id</em> Sec. 10).&nbsp; An <em>ex-post facto</em><em></em>&nbsp; law is a law which makes an act punishable in a manner in which it was not punishable when committed.&nbsp; It creates or aggravates the crime or increases the punishment, or changes the rules of evidence for the purpose of conviction.&nbsp; The prohibition against the passage of <em>ex-post facto</em><em></em>&nbsp; laws is an additional bulwark of personal security protecting the citizen from punishment by legislative act which has a retrospective operation. </p>"The phrase <em>ex-post facto</em><em></em> has a technical meaning and refers to crimes and criminal proceedings.&nbsp; It is in this sense that it was used in England.&nbsp; It was in this sense that the convention of 1787 understood it.&nbsp; (Calder <em>vs</em>. Bull, <em>supra</em>; Watson <em>vs</em>. Mercer, 8 Pet. 88, 110; Suterlee <em>vs</em>. Mathewson, 2 Peters, 380; Kring <em>vs</em>. Missouri, 107 U.S. 221.) This interpretation was upheld by our Supreme Court (U.S. <em>vs</em>. Ang Ken Ko, 6 Phil. 376.) &nbsp; <p> "A bill of attainder is a legislative act which inflicts punishment without judicial trial.&nbsp; (Cummings <em>vs</em>. United States, 4 Wall. 277, 18 L ed 356.) In England, the Bill of Attainder was an act of Par­liament by which a man was tried, convicted and sentenced to death without a jury, without a hearing in court, without hearing the witnesses against him and without regard to the rules of evidence.&nbsp; His blood was attainted or corrupted, rendering him devoid of all heritable quality — of acquiring and disposing property by descent.&nbsp; (Ex Parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333, 18 L ed 366.) If the penalty imposed was less than death, the act was known as a "bill of pains and penalties." Bills of attainder, like <em>ex-post facto</em><em></em> laws, were favorite methods of Stuart oppression.&nbsp; Once, the name of Thomas Jefferson was included in a bill of attainder presented to Parliament because of his reform activities. </p>"Often, such bills were 'stimulated by ambition or personal resent­ment, and vindictive malice.' (Calder <em>vs</em>. Bull, <em>supra</em>.) A well known case illustrating the ruthless manner in which a bill of attainder was resorted to was that of Thomas Wentworth, chief adviser of Charles I.&nbsp; He was brought to impeachment charged with attempting to subvert the liberties of England.&nbsp; He defended himself so ably that his enemies, fearing his acquittal, withdrew the impeachment and a bill of attainder was passed instead.&nbsp; Wentworth was beheaded.&nbsp; Bills of attainder were also passed in the Colonies (North, The Constitution of the U.S., its Sources and Applications, p. 85.) The pro­hibition in the Bill of Rights, therefore, seeks to prevent acts of violence and injustice brought about by the passage of such bills." (3 J.

Laurel in his address on November 19, 1934 as Chairman of the Committee on the Bill of Rights quoted in the opinion of the Court:&nbsp; "A bill of attainder is a legislative act which inflicts punishment without judicial trial.&nbsp; (Cummings <em>vs</em>. United States, 4 Wall. 277, 18 L ed 356).&nbsp; In England, the Bill of Attainder was an act of Parliament by which a man was tried, convicted and sentenced to death without a jury, without a hearing in court, without hearing the witnesses against him and without regard to the rules of evidence.&nbsp; His blood was attainted or corrupted, rendering him devoid of all heritable quality — of acquiring and disposing property by descent.&nbsp; (Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333, 18 L ed. 366) If the penalty imposed was less than death, the act was known as a 'bill of pains and penalties.' Bills of attainder, like <em>ex-post facto</em><em></em>&nbsp; laws, were favorite methods of Stuart oppression.&nbsp; Once, the name of Thomas Jefferson was included in a bill of attainder presented to Parliament because of his reform activities."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Two American Supreme Court decisions were thus in the minds of the framers.&nbsp; They are Cummings <em>vs</em>. Missouri<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and Ex parte Garland.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; They speak unequivocally.&nbsp; Legislative acts, no matter what their form, that apply either to named individuals or easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to inflict on them punishment amounting to a deprivation of any right, civil or political, without judicial trial are bills of attainder prohibited by the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p> <p> Cummings <em>vs</em>. Missouri<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; was a criminal prosecution of a Catholic priest for refusing to take the loyalty oath required by the state Constitution of Missouri of 1865.&nbsp; Under such a provision, lawyers, doctors, ministers, and other professionals must disavow that they had ever, "by act or word," manifested a "desire" for the success of the nation's enemies or a sympathy" with the rebels of the American Civil War.&nbsp; If they swore falsely, they were guilty of perjury.&nbsp; If they engaged in their professions without the oath, they were criminally liable.&nbsp; The United States Supreme Court condemned the provision as a bill of attainder, identified as any legislative act inflicting punishment without judicial trial.&nbsp; The deprivation of any right, civil or political, previously enjoyed, amounted to a punishment.&nbsp; Why such a conclusion was unavoidable was explained in the opinion of Justice Field thus:&nbsp; "A bill of attainder is a legislative act, which inflicts punishment without a judicial trial.&nbsp; If the punishment be less than death, the act is termed a bill of pains and penalties.&nbsp; Within the meaning of the Constitution, bills of attainder include bills of pains and penalties.&nbsp; In these cases the legislative body, in addition to its legitimate functions, exercises the powers and office of judge; it assumes, in the language of the textbooks, judicial magistracy; it pronounces upon the guilt of the party, without any of the forms or safeguards of trial; it determines the sufficiency of the proofs produced, whether conformable to the rules of evidence or otherwise; and it fixes the degree of punishment in accordance with its own notions of the enormity of the offense.&nbsp; * * * If the clauses of the 2d article of the Constitution of Missouri, to which we have referred, had in terms declared that Mr. Cummings was guilty, or should be held guilty, of having been in armed hostility to the United States, or of having entered that state to avoid being enrolled or drafted into the military service of the United States and, therefore, should be deprived of the right to preach as a priest of the Catholic church, or to teach in any institution of learning, there could be no question that the clauses would constitute a bill of attainder within the meaning of the Federal Constitution.&nbsp; If these clauses, instead of mentioning his name, had declared that all priests and clergymen within the state of Missouri were guilty of these acts, or should be held guilty of them, and hence be subjected to the like deprivation, the clauses would be equally open to objection.&nbsp; And further, if these clauses had declared that all such priests and clergymen should be so held guilty, and be thus deprived, provided they did not, by a day designated, do certain specified acts, they would be no less within the inhibition of the Federal Constitution.&nbsp; In all these cases there would be the legislative enactment creating the deprivation, without any of the ordinary forms and guards provided for the security of the citizen in the administration of justice by the established tribunals."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p> <p> On the very same day that the ruling in Cummings was handed down, Ex parte Garland<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; was also decided.&nbsp; That was a motion for leave to practice as an attorney before the American Supreme Court.&nbsp; Petitioner Garland was admitted to such bar at the December term of 1860.&nbsp; Under the previous rules of such Court, all that was necessary was that the applicant have three years practice in the state courts to which he belonged.&nbsp; In March 1865, the rule was changed by the addition of a clause requiring that an oath be taken under the Congressional acts of 1862 and 1865 to the effect that such candidate for admission to the bar had never voluntarily borne arms against the United States.&nbsp; Petitioner Garland could not in conscience subscribe to such an oath, but he was able to show a presidential pardon extended on July 15, 1865.&nbsp; With such act of clemency, he moved that he be allowed to continue in practice contending that the test oath requirement was unconstitutional as a bill of attainder and that at any rate, he was pardoned.&nbsp; The same ruling was announced by the Court again through Justice Field.&nbsp; Thus:&nbsp; "In the exclusion which the statute adjudges, it imposes a punishment for some of the acts specified which were not punishable at the time they were committed; and for other of the acts it adds a new punishment to that before prescribed, and it is thus brought within the further inhibition of the Constitution against the passage of an <em>ex post facto</em> law.&nbsp; In the case of <em>Cummings vs. Missouri,</em> just decided, * * we have had occasion to consider at length the meaning of a bill of attainder and of an <em>ex-post facto</em><em></em>&nbsp; law in the clause of the Constitution forbidding their passage by the states, and it is unnecessary to repeat here what we there said.&nbsp; A like prohibition is contained in the Constitution against enact­ments of this kind by Congress; and the argument presented in that case against certain clauses of the Constitution of Missouri is equally applicable to the act of Congress under consideration in this case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p> <p> There was a reiteration of the Cummings and Garland doctrine in United States <em>vs</em>. Lovett,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; decided in 1946.&nbsp; There it was shown that in 1943 the respondents, Lovett, Watson, and Dodd, were and had been for several years working for the government.&nbsp; The government agencies, which had lawfully employed them, were fully satisfied with the quality of their work and wished to keep them employed on their jobs.&nbsp; Over their protest, Congress provided in Section 304 of the Urgent Deficiency Appropriation Act of 1943, by way of an amendment attached to the House Bill, that after November 15, 1943, no salary or compensation should be paid respondent out of any money then or thereafter appropriated except for services as jurors or members of the armed forces, unless they were prior to November 15, 1943, again appointed to jobs by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.&nbsp; Notwithstanding such Congressional enactment, and the failure of the President to reappoint the respondents, the agencies kept all the respondents at work on their jobs for varying periods after November 15, 1943, but their compensation was discontinued after that date.&nbsp; Respondents brought this action in the Court of Claims for the salaries to which they felt entitled.&nbsp; The American Supreme Court stated that its inquiry was thus confined to whether the action in the light of proper construction of the Act presented a justiciable controversy, and, if so, whether Section 304 is a bill of attainder insofar as the respondents were concerned. </p> <p> After holding that there was a justiciable view, the American Supreme Court in an opinion by Justice Black categorically affirmed:&nbsp; "We hold that Section 304 falls precisely within the category of Congressional actions which the Constitution barred by providing that 'No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed.' In Cummings <em>vs</em>. State of Missouri, * * * this Court said, 'A bill of attainder is a legislative act which inflicts punishment without a judicial trial.&nbsp; If the punishment be less than death; the act is termed a bill of pains and penalties.&nbsp; Within the meaning of the Constitution, bills of attainder include bills of pains and penalties.' * * * On the same day the Cummings case was decided, the Court, in Ex parte Garland, also held invalid on the same grounds an Act of Congress which required attorneys practicing before this Court to take a similar oath.&nbsp; Neither of these cases has ever been overruled.&nbsp; They stand for the proposition that legislative acts, no matter what their form, that apply either to named individuals or to easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to inflict punishment on them without a judicial trial are bills of attainder prohibited by the Constitution.&nbsp; Adherence to this principle requires invalidation of Section 304.&nbsp; We do adhere to it."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p> United States <em>vs</em>. Brown<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; a 1965 decision was the first case to review a conviction under the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, making it a crime for a member of the Communist Party to serve as an officer or, except in clerical or custodial positions, an employee of a labor union.&nbsp; Respondent Brown, a longshoreman on the San Francisco docks, and an open and avowed Communist, for more than a quarter of a century was elected to theExecutive Board of Local 10 of the International Longshore­men's and Warehousemen's Union for consecutive one-year terms in 1959, 1960, and 1961.&nbsp; On May 24, 1961, respondent was charged in a one-count indictment returned in a district court of California with serving as a member of an executive board of a labor organization while a member of the Communist Party, in willful violation of the above provision.&nbsp; The question of its validity under the bill of attainder clause was thus properly raised for adjudication.&nbsp; While convicted in the lower court, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.&nbsp; It was sustained by the American Supreme Court.&nbsp; As noted in the opinion by Chief Justice Warren, "the wide variation in form, purpose and effect of ante-Constitution bills of attainder indicates that the proper scope of the Bill of Attainder Clause, and its relevance to contemporary problems, must ultimately be sought by attempting to discern the reasons for its inclusion in the Constitution, and the evils it was designed to eliminate.&nbsp; The best available evidence, the writings of the architects of our constitutional system, indicates that the Bill of Attainder Clause was intended not as a narrow, technical (and therefore soon to be outmoded) prohibition, but rather as an imple­mentation of the separation of powers, a general safeguard against legislative exercise of the judicial function, or more simply — trial by legislature."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; Then after referring to Cummings, Garland, and Lovett, Chief Justice Warren continued:&nbsp; "Under the line of cases just outlined, Sec. 504 of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act plainly constitutes a bill of attainder.&nbsp; Congress undoubtedly posses­ses power under the Commerce Clause to enact legislation designed to keep from positions affecting interstate commerce persons who may use such positions to bring about political strikes.&nbsp; In Sec. 504, however, Congress has exceeded the authority granted it by the Constitution.&nbsp; The statute does not set forth a generally applicable rule decreeing that any person who commits certain acts or possesses certain characteristics (acts and characteristics which, in Congress' view, make them likely to initiate political strikes) shall not hold union office, and leave to courts and juries the job of deciding what persons have committed the specified acts or possessed the specified characteristics.&nbsp; Instead, it designates in no uncertain terms the persons who possess the feared characteristics and therefore cannot hold union office without incurring criminal liability — members of the Communist Party."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <p> Even Communist Party <em>vs</em>. Subversive Activities Control Board,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; where the provision of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950 requiring the Communist Party of the United States to register was sustained, the opinion of Justice Frankfurter for the Court, speaking for a five-man majority, did indicate adherence to the Cummings principle.&nbsp; Had the American Communist Party been outlawed, the outcome certainly would have been different.&nbsp; Thus:&nbsp; "The Act is not a bill of attainder.&nbsp; It attaches not to specified organizations but to described activities in which an organization may or may not engage.&nbsp; The singling out of an individual for legislatively prescribed punishment constitutes an attainder whether the individual is called by name or described in terms of conduct which, because it is past conduct, operates only as a designation of particular persons.&nbsp; * * * The Subversive Activities Control Act is not of that kind.&nbsp; It requires the registration only of organizations which, after the date of the Act, are found to be under the direction, domination, or control of certain foreign powers and to operate primarily to advance certain objectives.&nbsp; This finding must be made after full administrative hearing, subject to judicial review which opens the record for the reviewing court's determination whether the administrative findings as to fact are supported by the preponderance of the evidence.&nbsp; Present activity constitutes an operative element to which the statute attaches legal consequences, not merely a point of reference for the ascertainment of particular persons ineluctably designated by the legislature."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p> <p> The teaching of the above cases, which I find highly persuasive considering what appeared to be in the minds of the framers of the 1934 Constitutional Convention yields for me the conclusion that the Anti-Subversion Act falls within the ban of the bill of attainder clause.&nbsp; It should be noted that three subsequent cases upholding the Cummings and Garland doctrine were likewise cited in the opinion of the Court.&nbsp; The interpretation accorded to them by my brethren is, of course, different but I am unable to go along with them especially in the light of the categorical language appearing in Lovett.&nbsp; This is not to lose sight of the qualification that for them could deprive such a holding of its explicit character as shown by this excerpt from the opinion of the Court:&nbsp; "Indeed, were the Anti-Subversion Act a bill of attainder it would be totally unnecessary to charge communists in court, as the law alone, without more, would suffice to secure their conviction and punishment.&nbsp; But the fact is that their guilt still has to be judicially established.&nbsp; The Government has yet to prove at the trial that the accused joined the Party knowingly, willfully and by overt acts, and that they joined the Party knowing its subversive character and with specific intent to further its objective, <em>i.e.,</em>&nbsp; to overthrow the existing Govern­ment by force, deceit, and other illegal means and place it under the control and domination of a foreign power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> While not implausible, I find difficulty in yielding acceptance.&nbsp; In Cummings, there was a criminal prosecution of the Catholic priest who refused to take the loyalty oath.&nbsp; Again in Brown, there was an indictment of the labor leader who, judging by his membership in the Communist Party, did transgress the statutory provision subsequently found offensive to the bill of attainder clause.&nbsp; If the construction I would place on the oft-repeated pronouncement of the American Supreme Court is correct, then the mere fact that a criminal case would have to be instituted would not save the statute.&nbsp; It does seem clear to me that from the very title of the Anti-Subversion Act, "to outlaw the Communist Party of the Philippines and similar associations," not to mention other specific provisions, the taint of invalidity is quite marked.&nbsp; Hence, my inability to concur in the judgment reached as the statute not suffering from any fatal infirmity in view of the Constitutional prohibition against bills of attainder. </p> <p> 3. This brings me to the question of the alleged repugnancy of the Anti-Subversion Act to the intellectual liberty safeguarded by the Constitution in terms of the free speech and free association guarantees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> It is to be admitted that at the time of the enactment of Republic Act No. 1700, the threat that Communism, the Russian brand then, did pose was a painful reality for Congressional leaders and the then President.&nbsp; Its shadow fell squarely across the lives of all Subversion then could neither be denied nor disparaged.&nbsp; There was, in the expert opinion of those conversant with such matters, a danger to our national existence of no mean character.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the remedies to ward off such menace must not be repugnant to our Constitution.&nbsp; We are legally precluded from acting in any other way.&nbsp; The apprehension justly felt is no warrant for throwing to the discard fundamental guarantees.&nbsp; Vigilant we had to be, but not at the expense of constitutional ideals. </p> <p> One of them, certainly highly-prized of the utmost significance, is the right to dissent.&nbsp; One can differ, even object; one can express dissatisfaction with things as they are.&nbsp; There are times when one not only can but must.&nbsp; Such dissent can take the form of the most critical and the most disparaging remarks.&nbsp; They may give offense to those in authority, to those who wield power and influence.&nbsp; Nevertheless, they are entitled to constitutional protection.&nbsp; Insofar as the content of such dissent is concerned, the limits are hardly discernible.&nbsp; It cannot be confined to trivial matters or to such as are devoid of too much significance.&nbsp; It can reach the heart of things.&nbsp; Such dissent may, for those not so adventurous in the realm of ideas, possess a subversive tinge.&nbsp; Even those who oppose a democratic form of government cannot be silenced.&nbsp; This is true especially in centers of learning where scholars competent in their line may, as a result of their studies, assert that a future is bleak for the system of government now favored by Western democracies.&nbsp; There may be doubts entertained by some as to the lawfulness of their exercising this right to dissent to the point of advocacy of such a drastic change.&nbsp; Any citizen may do so without fear that thereby he incurs the risk of a penal sanction.&nbsp; That is merely to affirm the truth of this ringing declaration from Jefferson: "If there be any among us who would wish to dissolve this union or to change its republican form, let them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> As was so well put by the philosopher, Sidney Hook:&nbsp; "Without holding the right to the expression of heresy at any time and place to be absolute — for even the right to non-heretical speech cannot be absolute — it still seems wise to tolerate the expression even of Communist, fascist and other heresies, lest in outlawing theim we include other kinds of heresies, and deprive ourselves of the opportunity to acquire possible sounder ideas than our own."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p> <p> The line is to be drawn, however, where the words amount to an incitement to commit the crime of sedition or rebellion.&nbsp; The stage has been reached, to follow the formula­tion of Cardozo, where thought merges into action.&nbsp; Thus is loyalty shown to the freedom of speech or press ordained by the Constitution.&nbsp; It does not bar the expression of views affecting the very life of the state, even if opposed to its fundamental presuppositions.&nbsp; It allows, if it does not require as a matter of fact, that unorthodox ideas be freely ventilated and fully heard.&nbsp; Dissent is not disloyalty. </p> <p> Such an approach is reinforced by the well-settled constitutional principle "that even though the governmental purposes be legitimate and substantial, they cannot be pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental personal liberties when the end can be more narrowly achieved.&nbsp; For precision of regulation is the touchstone in an area so closely related to our most precious freedoms."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; This is so for "a governmental purpose to control or prevent activities consti­tutionally subject to state regulation may not be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; It is indispensable then that "an overbreadth" in the applicability of the statute be avoided.&nbsp; If such be the case, then the line dividing the valid from the constitutionally infirm has been crossed.&nbsp; That for me is the conclusion to be drawn from the wording of the Anti-Subversion Act. </p> <p> There is to my mind support for the stand I take in the dissent of Justice Black in the Communist Party case discussed above.&nbsp; What is to be kept in view is that a legislative measure certainly less drastic in its treatment of the admittedly serious communist problem was found in the opinion of this noted jurist offensive to the First Amendment of the American Constitution safeguarding free speech. Thus: “If there is one thing certain about the First Amendment it is that this Amendment was designed to guarantee the freest interchange of ideas about all public matters and that, of course, means the interchange of <em>all</em> ideas, however such ideas may be viewed in other countries and whatever change in the existing structure of government it may be hoped that these ideas will bring about.&nbsp; Now, when this country is trying to spread the high ideals of democracy all over the world – ideals that are revolutionary in many countries – seems to be a particularly inappropriate time to stifle First Amendment freedoms in this country.&nbsp; The same arguments that are used to justify the outlawry of the ideas of democracy in other countries."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; Further he stated:&nbsp; "I believe with the Framers of the First Amendment that the internal security of a nation like ours does not and cannot be made to depend upon the use of force by Government to make all the beliefs and opinions of the people fit into a common mold on any single subject.&nbsp; Such enforced conformity of thought would tend only to deprive our people of the bold spirit of adventure and progress which has brought this Nation to its present greatness.&nbsp; The creation of public opinion by groups, organiza­tions, societies, clubs, and parties has been and is a necessary part of our democratic society.&nbsp; Such groups, like the Sons of Liberty and the American Corresponding Societies, played a large part in creating sentiment in this country that led the people of the Colonies to want a nation of their own.&nbsp; The Father of the Constitution — James Madison — said, in speaking of the Sedition Act aimed at crushing the Jefferson Party, that had that law been in effect during the period before the Revolution, the United Sates might well have continued to be 'miserable colonies, groaning under a foreign yoke.' In my judgment, this country's internal security can better be served by depending upon the affection of the people than by attempting to instill them with fear and dread of the power of Government.&nbsp; The Communist Party has never been more than a small group in this country.&nbsp; And its numbers had been dwindling even before the Government began its campaign to destroy the Party by force of law.&nbsp; This was because a vast majority of the American people were against the Party's policies and overwhelmingly rejected its candidates year after year.&nbsp; That is the true American way of securing this Nation against dangerous ideas.&nbsp; Of course that is not the way to protect the Nation against <em>actions</em>&nbsp; of violence and treason.&nbsp; The Founders drew a distinction in our Constitution which we would be wise to follow.&nbsp; They gave the Government the fullest power to prosecute overt actions in violation of valid laws but withheld any power to punish people for nothing more than advocacy of their views."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> </p> <p> With the sentiments thus expressed uppermost in my mind and congenial to my way of thinking, I cannot share the conclusion reached by my brethren as to the Anti-Subversion Act successfully meeting the test of validity on free speech and freedom of association grounds. </p> 4.&nbsp; It could be that this approach to the constitutional questions involved arises from an appraisal of the challenged statute which for me is susceptible of an interpretation that it does represent a defeatist attitude on the part of those of us, who are devotees at the shrine of a liberal-democratic state.&nbsp; That certainly could not have been the thought of its framers; nonetheless, such an assumption is not devoid of plausibility for why resort to this extreme measure suscepti­ble as it is to what apparently are not unfounded attacks on constitutional grounds?&nbsp; Is this not to ignore what previously was accepted as an obvious truth, namely that the light of liberalism sends its shaftes in many directions?&nbsp; It can illuminate, and it can win the hearts and minds of men.&nbsp; It is difficult for me to accept the view then that a resort to outlawry is indispensable, that suppression is the only answer to what is an admitted evil.&nbsp; There could have been a greater exposure of the undesirability of the communist creed, its contradictions and arbitrariness, its lack of fealty to reason, its inculcation of disloyalty, and its subservience to centralized dictation that brooks no opposition.&nbsp; It is thus, in a realistic sense, a manifestation of the fear of free thought and the will to suppress it.&nbsp; Far better, of course, is the propaganda of the deed.&nbsp; What the communists promise, this government can fulfill.&nbsp; It is up to it then to take remedial measures to alleviate the condition of our countrymen whose lives are in a condition of destitution and misery.&nbsp; It may not be able to change matters radically.&nbsp; At least, it should take earnest steps in that direction.&nbsp; What is important for those at the bottom of the economic pyramid is that they are not denied the opportunity for a better life.&nbsp; If they, or at least their children, cannot even look forward to that, then a constitutional regime is nothing but a mockery and a tragic illusion.&nbsp; Such a response, I am optimistic enough to believe, has the merit of thinning, if not completely eliminating, the embattled ranks and outposts of ignorance, fanaticism and error.&nbsp; That for me would be more in accordance with the basic proposition of our polity.&nbsp; This is not therefore to preach a doctrine of abject surrender to the forces apparently bent on the adoption of a way of life so totally opposed to the deeply felt traditions of our people.&nbsp; This is, for me at least, an affirmation of the vitality of the democratic creed, with an expression of regret that it could not have been more impressively set forth in language worthy of the subject. <p> It is in the light of the views above expressed that I find myself unable to yield concurrence to the ably-written opinion of Justice Castro for the Court sustaining the validity of the Anti-Subversion Act. </p> <hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rep.
