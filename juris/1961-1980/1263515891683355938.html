<p class="BODY">The appellate jurisdiction of this Court is invoked by the con­victed
defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their vehement claim is that
they were not involved in the crime at all; that the prosecution witnesses were
trapped in the <span class="SpellE">bogholes</span> of falsity; that at the very
least the story related by said witnesses lacks the stamp of credibility and is
denuded of that illuminating concreteness so essential to bring about
conviction. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Their attack is <span class="SpellE">levelled</span> primarily on the two alleged eyewitnesses to the
crime, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gregorio Navarro and <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gulariza</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Silva.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did
the two tell the truth?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here are their
respective versions:</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Gregorio</u> <u>Navarro</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His narrative begins with the statement that at about 8:00 o'clock on
the night of March 15, 1964, he (Gregorio, alias <span class="SpellE">Regor</span>),
together with his brothers <span class="SpellE">Briccio</span> Navarro and the
deceased Perfecto Navarro, alias <span class="SpellE">Pistoy</span>, came from
their farm, proceeded to town (<span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While on the street leading to Perfecto's
house, they came upon a group of policemen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They greeted them "Good evening." The latter did not
answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They proceeded to the house of <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gulariza</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Silva at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Dalakit</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, in the same
town of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perfecto asked <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span>
for a cigarette.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter gave him
tobacco instead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While Perfecto was
rolling the tobacco, chief of police <span class="SpellE">Mananguite</span>
barked an order:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Alright, you kill
him now because he is already here." Fidel <span class="SpellE">Cerenado</span>,
alias <span class="SpellE">Bakot</span>, fired a shot from a carbine while
Perfecto was standing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It found its mark
in Perfecto's left leg producing a through and through wound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fidel followed this with a second shot which
hit Perfecto on the right buttock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
felled Perfecto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Down, Perfecto (<span class="SpellE">Pistoy</span>) said:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Enough now, because <span class="SpellE">Pistoy</span> is already
dead." Fidel fired the 3rd, 4th and 5th shots which missed as Perfecto had
already fallen down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the shooting
occurred, Gregorio and <span class="SpellE">Briccio</span> were on both sides of
the victim about 1-1/2 meters away from the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fidel was two meters away from the victim
when the chief gave the order; <span class="SpellE">Mananguite</span>, <span class="SpellE">Morillo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Montaño</span> were opposite
the Navarro brothers, also at a distance of about two meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gregorio knew that these officers had their
pistols cocked because "there was clicking sound and there was loading of
ammunition in the chamber." The night was dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he was able to recognize defendants
because the latter then had a torch with them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Gregorio and <span class="SpellE">Briccio</span> Navarro left their
brother Perfecto when he was already dead.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They proceeded to Perfecto's house, which was some 30 meters away,
informed Perfecto's wife, <span class="SpellE">Eutiquia</span> <span class="SpellE">Manongsong</span>, that her husband was dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The brothers visited the cadaver of
Perfecto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They wanted to report to the
authorities but were afraid of the chief of police.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><u>Paciencia</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Gulariza</u></span>
(<span class="SpellE"><u>Vda</u></span>. <u>de</u> <u>Silva)</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her version is this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="3">March
 15, 1964</st1:date>, she was at her residence (<st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Dalakit</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>). <span style="">&nbsp;</span>She knew that the shooting took place after <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time> because she heard the church bell
toll the hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gregorio and perfecto
Navarro popped up in her house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
came from the farm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perfecto asked for
tobacco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She gave him tobacco leaf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perfecto dried it on her lamp, crushed the
same, wrapped it in newspaper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
then by the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While Perfecto was
lighting the smoke, chief <span class="SpellE">Managuite</span> remarked:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Alright, you kill him now because he is
still standing.” Fidel <span class="SpellE">Cerenado</span> fired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perfecto cried "I am hit,” then
fell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fidel <span class="SpellE">Cerenado</span>
fired again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perfecto, raising his hand,
remarked:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Enough now because <span class="SpellE">Pistoy</span> is already dying." After that, Fidel approached
Perfecto and asked:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Pistoy</span>, are you still alive?" The latter did not
answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was already dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chief <span class="SpellE">Mananguite</span>
then approached Perfecto, inquired:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Do you recognize me, I am the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span>." No answer came.</p>

<p class="BODY">The companions of Perfecto (<span class="SpellE">Pistoy</span>)
remained standing at the place for about one hour. </p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Fidel <span class="SpellE">Cerenado</span>
ordered <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span> to get out of her house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Together with her three daughters, she went
to the house of <span class="SpellE">Oboy</span> (Pablo <span class="SpellE">Loyogoy</span>),
husband of a certain <span class="SpellE">Bening</span>, her cousin, which was
about two meters from her home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While on
her way to her cousin's house, she saw <span class="SpellE">Reyning</span>
(Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Morillo</span>), <span class="SpellE">Anoy</span> (<span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Mananguite</span>), <span class="SpellE">Bakot</span> (Fidel <span class="SpellE">Cerenado</span>), and Eden
(<span class="SpellE">Edencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Montaño</span>) in the
yard.</p>

<p class="BODY">She called to the occupants of the house of <span class="SpellE">Loyogoy</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Oboy</span>) which was already closed, to open the door,
saying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Oboy</span>,
I will go upstairs because <span class="SpellE">Pistoy</span> is already
dead." She had a short conversation with <span class="SpellE">Loyogoy's</span>
wife, <span class="SpellE">Bening</span>, telling the latter that she heard five
shots, and then they went to sleep.</p>

<p class="BODY">Following are other pertinent facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">Cause of death of Perfecto Navarro was severe hemorrhage from the
femoral vessels which were hit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
autopsy, performed the next morning by Dr. Manuel C. de Leon, municipal health
officer, at the municipal building, revealed that Perfecto's stomach
contained:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"liberal amount of fluid
which smells [of] a local beverage (tuba) with light brown color.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gas in the stomach emits a sour tuba
odor."</p>

<p class="BODY">Evidence stands <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> that in
the early morning of the next day, <st1:date year="1964" day="16" month="3">March
 16, 1964</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Eutiquia</span> <span class="SpellE">Manongsong</span>
and Francisca Navarro, widow and sister, respectively, of the deceased Perfecto
Navarro came to the home of defendant chief of police <span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mananguite</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The two solicited his help in reference to the death of Perfecto
Navarro, whose body then lay dead at the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police chief inquired from <span class="SpellE">Eutiquia</span> how Perfecto was killed and who killed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eutiquia</span> answered
that she did not know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police chief
then told the two to stay in his house as he was to fetch another policeman to
go with him to where Perfecto's body was.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the municipal building, the police chief got hold of his
co-defendants here, Sgt. Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Morillo</span> and
policeman <span class="SpellE">Edencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Montaño</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They passed by the chief's house, picked up <span class="SpellE">Eutiquia</span> and Francisca Navarro, went to the scene of the
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, they found below the
window of the house of <span class="SpellE">Pacencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gulariza</span>
the body of the deceased Perfecto Navarro.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Found near the body was a bolo, Exhibit "9".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Francisca Navarro picked up an empty carbine
shell which is now Exhibit "8".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the autopsy, Dr. de Leon who examined the premises recovered one
slug, Exhibit "C", beside the post of the house where Perfecto was shot.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused police chief <span class="SpellE">Mananguite</span>
started an investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He called upon
the people in the neighborhood to shed light.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Five persons gave their versions:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gulariza</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Silva, defense
witness <span class="SpellE">Probo</span> <span class="SpellE">Loyogoy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Virgines</span> <span class="SpellE">Majerano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Esuga</span> and Emilio <span class="SpellE">Montaño</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The chief
asked them to fall in line.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span> was the first to be questioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span> stated
that she did not know who killed Perfecto Navarro near her house because it was
dark the previous night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Loyogoy</span> was next.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
answered that he did not know as it was dark.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Virgines</span> <span class="SpellE">Majerano</span>
also gave an identical answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, so
did <span class="SpellE">Esuga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Montaño</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that they could tell the police chief was
that they heard gun reports.</p>

<p class="BODY">The police chief then asked his men to request the municipal
judge and the municipal health officer to come.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The policemen returned without them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The municipal judge could not be located; he was out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctor told them that if the relatives of
the deceased would consent to the autopsy, the cadaver should be brought to the
municipal building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eutiquia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Manongsong</span>, the widow, agreed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said she was interested to know who
killed her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police chief
sent for Gregorio and <span class="SpellE">Briccio</span> Navarro, brothers of the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parenthetically, it may be
stated that, according to the defense, at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30</st1:time>
in the night of March 15 chief <span class="SpellE">Mananguite</span> himself
jailed Gregorio and <span class="SpellE">Briccio</span> Navarro because they were
"very drunk," and that they were only released at about <st1:time minute="40" hour="18">6:40</st1:time> that morning of the 16th.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two brothers brought the body of Perfecto in a hammock to the
municipal building where the autopsy heretofore adverted to was performed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The chief of police continued the investigation at his office in
the municipal building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, separate
statements were made by the five persons heretofore mentioned:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gulariza</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Silva, Exhibit
"1", subscribed before municipal judge J. Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mangada</span>,
translation, Exhibit "1-A"; <span class="SpellE">Probo</span> <span class="SpellE">Loyogoy</span>, Exhibit "3", translation, Exhibit
"3-A"; <span class="SpellE">Virgines</span> <span class="SpellE">Majerano</span>,
Exhibit "4", translation, Exhibit "4-A"; <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Esuga</span>, Exhibit
"5", translation, Exhibit "5-A"; and Emilio <span class="SpellE">Montaño</span>, Exhibit "6", translation, Exhibit
"6-A".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The essence of all of
these statements is that nobody knew who killed Perfecto.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Will the testimony of
the two alleged eyewitnesses to the crime survive conscientious appraisal?</p>

<p class="BODY">The description made by Gregorio Navarro as to how the crime was
committed, right at the very start, dealt a crippling blow to the People’s case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here is what he said:</p>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Fidel <span class="SpellE">Cerenado</span> was facing you when he fired his gun, is that
right?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was facing our brother.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(p. 16, Tr., 1st vol.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> *</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the first shot was
fired, what was the posi­tion of your brother, Perfecto?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>His back was facing...</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was his back towards
Fidel?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The back of Perfecto was
turned towards Fidel <span class="SpellE">Cerenado</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After that shot what
happened to Perfecto?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He fell down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(p. 17, Tr., 1st vol.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> *</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those five shots were all
fired while Perfecto was still standing?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the first shot
Perfecto was not hit and the second he did not mind it because they would have
thought that Perfecto would fight back and Perfecto never thought he would be
killed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And the 3rd and 4th
shots?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <u>second</u> <u>shot</u>
was the shot which hit him on the <u>right</u> <u>buttock</u> which hit his
left and right thigh.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You said that the first
shot did not kit Perfecto and now you said that he was hit on the buttock,
which is which?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <u>first</u> <u>shot</u>
hit him oh the <u>left</u> <u>leg</u> but it was through and through.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>second</u> <u>shot</u> hit his <u>buttock</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first and second
shots were fired when Perfecto was still standing?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <u>first</u> <u>shot</u> of which he
was hit on the left leg he was <u>still</u> <u>standing</u> and the <u>second</u>
<u>shot</u> was the one which caused him to fall.” (pp. 18-19, Tr., 1st vol.;
emphasis supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But the testimony of Dr. Manuel de Leon which follows sweeps the ground
from under Gregorio's version:</p>

<blockquote>“Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Will you please, doctor,
tell this court what<span style="">&nbsp; </span>you found on the
cadaver of Perfecto Navarro?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
autopsied the cadaver of Perfecto Navarro on March 16, 1964 and I found an <u>entrance</u>
gunshot wound, as stated in this report, on the <u>right</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>dorso</u></span><u>-medial</u> <u>aspect</u> of the right thigh
coming out on the upper third of the ventral, aspect of the medial portion of
the same thigh and <u>entered</u> again on the <u>left</u> <u>upper</u> <u>third</u>
of the left thigh on the <span class="SpellE">ventro</span>-medial aspect which
measures 1 inch in diameter circular in form and at the same level of the exit
wound of the right thigh <u>coming</u> <u>out</u> on the <u>lower</u> <u>third</u>
of the <u>ventral</u> <u>aspect</u> of the <u>left</u> <u>thigh</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those are the injuries <u>only</u>, doctor?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>Yes</u>, <u>sir</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In other words, how many bullets entered the body? </blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>One</u> (<u>1</u>) <u>bullet</u> <u>entered</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From the position of the wounds, will you be able to demonstrate
the position of Perfecto Navarro when he was hit?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I think so.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What was the position of Perfecto Navarro, doctor?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He must have been <u>slightly crouching.</u>” (pp. 45-46, Tr.,
2nd vol.; emphasis supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This is confirmed by his medico-legal
necropsy report, Exhibits "A" And "A-1", and his
diagrammatic representation of a human body showing the trajectory of the
wounds caused by one single shot, Exhibit "A-2", and the fact that
the doctor himself found at the scene of the crime one carbine slug, Exhibit
"C".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot therefore be
true, as stated by Gregorio Navarro, that his brother Perfecto Navarro was
first shot at while standing, and that <u>two</u> <u>different</u> shots hit
his body, first on the left leg, and second on the right buttock.</p>

<p class="BODY">If Gregorio Navarro were to be believed, that night he informed <span class="SpellE">Eutiquia</span> <span class="SpellE">Manongsong</span>, wife of
Perfecto, that the latter was dead.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Strangely enough, this very same wife early the following morning went
to the chief of police asking for help to ascertain who the killer was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the normal course of events, Gregorio
should have told the wife who gunned down Perfecto - <u>if</u> <u>he</u> <u>really</u>
<u>knew</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the record
suggests that he did so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The balance of
probabilities then is that Gregorio, with his brother <span class="SpellE">Briccio</span>,
was <u>not</u> at the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because that night, both were incarcerated for drunkenness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Police blotter, Exhibit "10-A",
confirms this.</p>

<p class="BODY">If the chief of police was really the author of the crime, it is
doubtful if he could have had the temerity of testifying in court that <span class="SpellE">Eutiquia</span> <span class="SpellE">Manongsong</span> and Francisca
Navarro, wife and sister of the deceased, came to see him - to help identify
the killer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The chief's instinct of
self-preservation would then have warned him that the two women would naturally
contradict him if what he said were not true.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More so, because before he took the stand, Gregorio Navarro and <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gulariza</span> had already
pinpointed him as the man who, in their presence, ordered Perfecto's
liquidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the People did not care
to present the widow or the sister to destroy this version of the police
chief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no difficulty in saying
that if the wife or the sister had information that the chief of police was
involved, neither one nor the other would exhibit any hesitancy in going to
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, a wife is a wife, and
a sister is a sister.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inference is
quite obvious.</p>

<p class="BODY">Gregorio Navarro testified that he visited the cadaver of his
brother at the place of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gulariza</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Silva, Gregorio and <span class="SpellE">Briccio</span>
Navarro stayed at the scene of the crime for a space of about one hour after
the shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But they did not take the
body away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Could they not have taken the
cadaver to the home of <span class="SpellE">Eutiquia</span> <span class="SpellE">Manongsong</span>,
their sister-in-law, which was but 30 meters away?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gregorio's excuse:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he was afraid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But nobody was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If Gregorio was afraid, could he have visited
the dead body?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is evidence that he
was troublesome - especially when under the influence of liquor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was he really afraid?</p>

<p class="BODY">We now come to <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gulariza</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Silva.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her testi­mony, referring to the time of the
shooting, indicates that only two of the accused were then present:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Anoy</span> (chief of
police <span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Mananguite</span>),
and <span class="SpellE">Bakot</span> (Fidel <span class="SpellE">Cerenado</span>),
the alleged triggerman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gregorio
Navarro, it will be remembered, declared that there were four of them:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mananguite</span>, <span class="SpellE">Morillo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Montaño</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cerenado</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first
time that <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span> ever made mention of defendants <span class="SpellE">Morillo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Montaño</span> was when she
went to the house of her cousin <span class="SpellE">Bening</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to her, she saw the four in the
yard of <span class="SpellE">Bening's</span> house.</p>

<p class="BODY">A shoddy strand, we believe, in the fabric of <span class="SpellE">Paciencia's</span>
court testimony is her sworn statement, Exhibit "1" (translation,
Exhibit "1-A").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That affidavit
was but a confirmation of her oral version given to the police that same
morning at the place of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There, during the earlier spot investigation, so many people were
present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of them was <span class="SpellE">Probo</span> <span class="SpellE">Loyogoy</span> the husband of <span class="SpellE">Paciencia's</span> own cousin <span class="SpellE">Bening</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">Loyogoy</span> testified
in court that late in the night of the crime, when <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span>
came unexpectedly up his house, she told him that "<span class="SpellE">Pistoy</span>
was shot," but, in <span class="SpellE">Paciencia's</span> own words,
"I do not know (who killed him) because it was dark and there was no
person there anymore." (Tr., p. 35, 1st vol.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Loyogoy</span> further
declared that in the investigation at the crime scene, <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span>
verbally repeated that she did not know who killed Perfecto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And then, so <span class="SpellE">Loyogoy</span>
added, at the <span style="color: windowtext;">subsequent investigation </span>in
the municipal building, when <span class="SpellE">Paciencia's</span> written
statement was prepared, the latter confirmed what she told the chief of police
at the place where the killing occurred.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And this, not to mention the testimony of defendants, police chief <span class="SpellE">Mananguite</span>, and policemen <span class="SpellE">Morillo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Montaño</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They all stated, too, that during the investigation at the place where
the dead body was found, <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span> disclaimed
knowledge of who the killer was.</p>

<p class="BODY">The statement, Exhibit "1", is clear in that <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span> did not know who killed Perfecto Navarro <u>because</u>
<u>she</u> <u>was</u> <u>then</u> <u>asleep</u>, <u>and</u> <u>she</u> <u>had</u>
<u>gone</u> <u>to</u> <u>sleep</u> <u>at</u> <u>about</u> <st1:time minute="0" hour="12"><u>12:00</u> <u>o'clock</u></st1:time> <u>that</u> <u>night</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A wide time-gap exists between her testimony
in court as to the time the crime occurred (past <st1:time minute="0" hour="20">8:00
 p.m.</st1:time>) and the time she slept according to her statement (about <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>).</p>

<p class="BODY">There is of course no denying the fact that <span class="SpellE">Paciencia's</span>
sworn statement was prepared in the office of the chief of police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Equally true is that at the time that
statement was taken, there were four other persons present who were waiting for
their turn to make affidavits:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>her
neighbors <span class="SpellE">Probo</span> <span class="SpellE">Loyogoy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Virgines</span> <span class="SpellE">Majerano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Esuga</span> and Emilio <span class="SpellE">Montaño</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In court,
however, <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span> was to say that they - without
mentioning names - "were intending to shoot me," if she did not sign
Exhibit "1", only to soften afterwards to tell the court that chief <span class="SpellE">Mananguite</span> merely <u>taught</u> her what she was to declare
in her sworn statement, Exhibit "1".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The improbability of her court version is at once apparent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span> had time to throw that
affidavit away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not right away
subscribe thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told the court at
the trial that at the time she signed the affidavit, <u>only</u> Municipal
Judge <span class="SpellE">Mangada</span> and she were present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mananguite</span> was not
there.</p>

<p class="BODY">But in the vertiginous version <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span>
gave out in court, we find surfacing the fact that the questions and answers
that are stated in her sworn statement, Exhibit "1", were
correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said she:</p>

<blockquote>“Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was that investigation
read by the municipal judge to you?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was read to me.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Showing
to you this document, which for purposes of identification I request that the
same be marked as <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. “1” for the accused and the
translation as <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. “1-A”, will you please see
whether you have <span class="SpellE">thumbmarked</span> on this document?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>The</u> <u>truth</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But <u>that</u> <u>was</u>

according to you they wanted you to sign and you only signed it because you
were threatened to be shot?</blockquote>

that because they wanted me to testify what they taught me.</blockquote>

they told you to declare?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Anoy</span>
<u>taught</u> me to testify that I heard a gun report but I did not see the
person who made the shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did you say that to the
Justice of the Peace?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I told him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT</blockquote>

<blockquote>Proceed, Atty. De <span class="SpellE">Guia</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY. DE GUIA</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How did you tell the
Municipal Judge what you have just stated now?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What I narrated was what
was <u>taught</u> to me that I would say that I heard a gun report but I did
not see the person who shot.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But you said a while ago
that this document, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. “1”, was read to you by the
municipal judge and you <u>confirmed</u> that all the statements you made in
answer to the questions appearing therein were <u>correct</u>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir, the
truth." (Tr., pp. 40-41, 2nd vol.; emphasis supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-left: 0.3in;">It would seem that at the investigation
leading to the execution of Exhibit "1", <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span>
had to make a position statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For,
the chief of police did ask her to lay bare the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this was because <span class="SpellE">Eutiquia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Manongsong</span>, Perfecto Navarro's widow, pointed at her
the finger of guilt for her husband's death and accused her of being her
husband's paramour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police chief
goaded her "tell the truth, do not hide anything." (Tr., p. 53, 2nd
vol.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was after the statement was
already typed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The chief of police was
to testify on this point that this drew a reply from <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span>
who, crossing her fingers, said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I
have nothing more to say, Chief, because these are the whole truth even if I
will be killed.” (Tr., p. 85, 2nd vol.).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Or, according to witness <span class="SpellE">Loyogoy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Paciencia's</span> retort was:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"that is all the truth <span class="SpellE">Mano</span> <span class="SpellE">Anoy</span> (<span class="SpellE">Mananguite</span>)"; and she
even said, "I could die if what I'm testifying now is not true."
(Tr., p. 53, 2nd vol.).</p>

<p class="BODY">Misgivings here could still be entertained as to the <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> of <span class="SpellE">Paciencia's</span>
sworn statement, Exhibit "1", were it not for the presence therein of
one piece of evidence which is at once inaudible but hugely formidable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before that statement was sworn to, Municipal
Judge <span class="SpellE">Mangada</span> obviously was not satisfied with the
completeness thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, Judge <span class="SpellE">Mangada</span> asked the following questions from <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span> and got the following answers (written by the
judge himself <u>in</u> <u>ink</u> at the margin of Exhibit "1") thus
- </p>

<blockquote>“Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did you hear gun
explosions last night? </blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, four gun explosions.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What did you do?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I seized my children, then I ran to the house of <span class="SpellE">Pening</span> <span class="SpellE">Montaño</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The circumstance just noted nails down the question - the
statement was voluntary.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing all serve to underscore the fatal distance between
doubtful proof and proof beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We say that the People failed to make out a
legally sustainable case against defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would thus serve no
useful purpose now to dig deep into the claim defendants so elaborately
presented at the trial that the prosecution herein was politically motivated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor do we find it necessary to describe at
length defendant’s alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether
political persecution against defendants was the motive or not, or that their
alibi is weak or strong, would not now be of any consequence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither of these two defenses would alter the
legal precept that in criminal cases the burden is on the People to prove
defendant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
For, such is a marked characteristic of our criminal law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Absent proof beyond reasonable doubt in the
present case, herein defendants are entitled to acquittal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Viewed in the light of the entire record</b>, we vote to
