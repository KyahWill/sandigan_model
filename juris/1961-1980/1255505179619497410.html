				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Cebu, the Hon. 
Modesto R. Ramolete, presiding, sentencing the accused-appellant to an 
indeterminate penalty of 3 years of <i>prision correccional</i> as minimum, to 7 
years of <em>prision mayor</em> as maximum and to pay the costs.
<p>Appellant Toribio C. Tabanao was charged with malversation of public funds in 
Criminal Case No. V-5773 of the Court of First Instance of Cebu. The information 
alleges:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about the 23rd day of August, 1956 and for sometime prior 
thereto, in the municipality of Moalboal, province of Cebu, Philippines, and 
within the jurisdiction of this Court, the above-named accused, then employed as 
Clerk-Bookkeeper of the Office of Municipal Treasurer of said municipality, and 
as such had among his official duties the collection of taxes and other public 
properties and issuing official receipt for said collection and hence 
accountable for public funds in his possession, with deliberate intent of gain 
and taking advantage of his position, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully 
and feloniously misappropriate for his own use and benefit the amount of Two 
Thousand Three Hundred Seventy-Six Pesos and forty three centavos (P2,376.43), 
which was then in his possession, to the damage and prejudice of the government 
of the amount aforestated."</p></blockquote>
<p>Arraigned on March 3, 1960, the defendant-appellant, assisted by his counsel, 
pleaded guilty to the charge. Upon the basis of his plea, the trial court found 
him guilty beyond reasonable doubt as charged and appreciating his plea of 
guilty as a mitigating circumstance, without any aggravating circumstance to 
offset it, forthwith sentenced him to suffer the penalty above stated. No 
indemnity was decreed because the defendant had previously fully reimbursed the 
amount misappropriated, (pp. 2-3 t.s.n.)</p>
<p>In his brief, appellant claims that after the liberation, his son developed 
an illness due to the war; that it was extreme necessity due to the illness of 
his son that drove him to commit the offense charged; that the amount was taken 
on several occasions to finance the lingering illness of his son; that the 
assistant provincial fiscal had recommended to the trial judge that in addition 
to the plea of guilty, his poverty be considered also as another mitigating 
circumstance. These statements were objected to by theSolicitor General on the 
ground that they are not supported by the record.</p>
<p>Appellant argues that under par. 2 of Art. 217 of the Revised Penal Code, as 
amended by Republic Act No. 1060, the penalty for malversation of an amount of 
more than P200 but not more than P6,000 is <em>prision correccional</em> in its 
maximum period to <em>prision mayor</em> in its medium period, or from 4 years, 
2 months, and 1 day to 10 years; that the fiscal having recommended to the trial 
judge that appellant's extreme poverty be considered as another mitigating 
circumstance, appellant should be credited with two (2) mitigating circumstances 
and consequently, the penalty imposable upon him should be <em>prision 
correccional</em> in its minimum, which is from 6 months and 1 day to 2 years 
and 2 months, and that applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the sentence 
would only be for an indeterminate penalty ranging from the maximum of arresto 
mayor to the minimum of <em>prision correccional</em>, or 4 months and 1 day to 
2 years and 4 months.</p>
<p>The penalty for the offense charged in this case is not <em>prision 
correccional</em> in its maximum period to <em>prision mayor</em> in its medium 
period, as the appellant argues; but <i>prision mayor</i> in its minimum and 
medium periods, as provided for in Rep. Act 1060, amending Art. 217 of the 
Revised Penal Code. The penalty lower by one degree of this penalty is 
<em>prision correccional</em> in its medium and maximum periods. Applying the 
Indeterminate Sentence Law and taking into consideration the mitigating 
circumstance of plea of guilty, the minimum of the penalty is from 2 years, 4 
months and 1 day to 6 years of <i>prision correccional</i> while the maximum is 
from 6 years and 1 day to 7 years and 4 months of <em>prision mayor</em>.</p>
<p>The Indeterminate Sentence Law provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 1.â€”Hereafter, in imposing a prison sentence for an offense punished by 
the Revised Penal Code, or its amendments, the court shall sentence the accused 
to an indeterminate sentence <em>the maximum term of which shall be that which, 
in view of the attending circumstances, could be properly imposed under the 
rules of the said Code, and to a minimum which shall be within the range of the 
penalty next lower to that prescribed by the Code for the offense; * * 
*</em>"</p></blockquote>
<p>The penalty prescribed for the offense charged in the case at bar is 
<i>prision mayor</i> in its mimium and medium periods, or from 6 years, 1 day to 
10 years. In view of the presence of one mitigating circumstance and no 
aggravating, the proper penalty imposable is the minimum of the penalty 
prescribed, which is from 6 years, 1 day to 7 years, and 4 months of <em>prision 
mayor</em>. One degree lower to that penalty prescribed by the Code is 
<em>prision correccional</em> in its medium and maximum periods, or 2 years, 4 
months, 1 day to 6 years. The penalty imposed by the trial court as minimum is 3 
years. This is within the range of the penalty next lower in degree to that 
prescribed by the Code; the 7 years maximum is also within the range of the 
penalty properly imposable under the circumstances.</p>
<p>It is also argued that extreme poverty should be considered as an additional 
mitigating circumstance, for which reason the penalty could be lowered by two 
degrees because of two mitigating circumstances, namely plea of guilty and 
poverty. The mitigating circumstance of poverty was neither admitted by the 
prosecution nor found by the judge. According to the record, of the P2,376.43 
misappropriated, only P50.00 was used for the illness of appellant's son. 
Furthermore, appellant may not claim poverty for he was a clerk receiving a 
salary. Poverty is a condition worse than that of a poor person. (Webster's 
International Dictionary) He may have been poor, but with his salary as clerk he 
certainly was not in a condition of poverty. The claim of an additional 
mitigating circumstance can not, therefore, be justified.</p>
<p>Finding no error in the sentence imposed, the judgment is hereby affirmed, 
with costs.</p>
<p>So ordered.</p> <em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Reyes, J. B. L., Paredes, 
Dizon,</em> and <em>Makalintal, JJ.,</em> concur.</div>
