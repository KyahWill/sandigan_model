				<H3>PEDRO VIDAL AND DAVID BAETIONG, PETITIONERS, VS.
PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, RESPONDENT.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.P., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Pedro Vidal executed on May <span style="">16,
1961 </span>a deed of sale in favor of David Baetiong, purporting to sell and
trans­fer a certificate of public convenience, allegedly granted to Vidal by
the Public Service Commission in its Case No. <span style="">63708, </span>and several jeepneys for P7,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An application was thereafter filed, on June <span style="">2, </span><span style="">1961, </span>by both Pedro Vidal and David Baetiong in the Public
Service Commission for the approval of the aforesaid sale and transfer of the
cer­tificate of public convenience (PSC Case No. <span style="">61-4668).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Public Service Commission through Associate Com­missioner
Antonio Aspillera, issued an order on June <span style="">6, </span><span style="">1961, </span>provisionally approving, for the duration of said
application's pendency, the sale and transfer aforementioned, <u>subject to
revocation or modification at any time</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, on November <span style="">29,
</span><span style="">1961, </span>the Public Ser­vice
Commission dismissed the application and set aside the provisional approval, on
the ground that neither the statistics records nor the records of the
Transportation Division show that the certificate of public convenience was
issued to Vidal in PSC Case No. <span style="">63708.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The plates of the five Jeepneys also
covered <span style="">by </span>the sale, were
ordered immediately confiscated.</p>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration was filed by applicants on December <span style="">13, </span><span style="">1961 </span>praying for a formal inquiry on the matter and asking that
there be no immediate confiscation until the persons responsible for the fraud
are known.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An amended and supplemental
motion was filed on February <span style="">8, </span>1963,
to set aside the order of November 29, 1961, for immediate return of the confiscated
plates and for new hearing to allow the presentation of some documents al­legedly
discovered evidencing the existence of the certi­ficate issued in Case No.
63708.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said alleged documents were: (1) A <u><span style="">certified true co</span></u><u><span style="">py</span></u><span style=""> </span>of the decision of the Public Service
Commission in Case No. 63708 penned by Commissioner Feliciano Ocampo dated
December 12, <span style="">1955, </span>granting the
certificate in Vi­dal's favor; (2) <u><span style="">a </span></u><u><span style="">certified true copy</span></u><span style=""> </span>of
an order dated <span style="">May 29, 1961 </span>issued by Commissioner Aspillera allowing the substitution
of <span style="">5 </span>jitneys in Case No. 61-3897
for the <span style="">5 </span>jitneys in Case No.
63708; (3) a <u><span style="">certification</span></u><span style=""> </span>stating that the orders in Vidal's
favor in Cases Nos. 61-3897 and <span style="">61-4068
</span>have been recorded in the statistics section of the Public Service
Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Public Service Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> denied on
March 30, 1965 the motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">This petition for review was then filed here on July <span style="">7, </span>1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">vas </span>dismissed on October 19, 1965 for failure
to file petitioners' brief, but subsequently, We allowed petitioners further
time to file their brief, and the same was filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">At issue is whether respondent Commission should have ruled on
the basis of the newly-offered documents that a certificate was in fact issued
in Vidal's favor in Case No. 63708.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Public Service Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> held that not­withstanding
diligent search no <span style="">record</span> <span style="">of a</span><span style=""> </span>certificate of public convenience awarded to Pedro Vidal in
Case No. 63708 could be found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not even
its docket, which indicates the proceedings held, reflects it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And no statistical record thereof appears nor
was a time schedule prepared and approved for said franchise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These facts were sworn to by the respective
personnel in charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">As against this state of the record attested to by their
custodians, petitioners would rely on a certified true copy of an alleged
"decision" in Case No. 63708 grant­ing a franchise in favor of
Vidal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such certified true copy cannot
prevail over the records of the Public Service Commission unless <span style="">it </span><span style="">is </span>shown that the latter's records are
defective or incomplete, which is not the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that plainly arises is that the so-called certified true copy <span style="">was </span>fraudulently made; that there was
in fact no such decision; and, indeed, applicants have not presented or offered
to present anything convincing to the effect that there was really a decision
promulgated in Case No. 63708 granting Vidal a franchise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be deemed an error on the part of
respondent Commission not to rely on <span style="">a </span>mere certified true copy of an alleged decision,
in the absence of anything in their records to show that there was such a
decision and in the absence of competent proof that such decision was actually
rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Com­<span style="">mission, therefore,
did </span>not err in denying new trial for the presentation of said certified
true copy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the provisional approval of the sale and transfer, the
same, by <span style="">its
terms, </span>could be revoked at any time and was intended to last only during
the pendency of the application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the
fact of its grant and recording does not affect the issue of whether a
certificate of pu­<span style="">blic convenience was really given in favor </span>of Vidal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, <span style="">moreover, even </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">this, </span>it <span style="">was </span>found that the same<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a>
was granted due to forgeries in the initials of the personnel who recommend
action thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same, therefore,
were properly revoked.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the alleged injustice to the buyer, the vendee <span style="">may proceed against
his vendor </span>for recovery, and the lat­ter, may <span style="">go against </span>the persons responsible for
the fraud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The point <span style="">involved in </span>the
present suit <span style="">is
simply </span>that there is no record of a certificate of public convenience
granted <span style="">to
Vidal in </span>Case No. 63708 and that, therefore, the sale thereof to
Baetiong cannot be approved and the vehicles in­cluded in the <span style="">sale </span>cannot
be allowed to operate under the non-existing franchise.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the <span style="">appealed </span>orders are hereby affirmed, with
costs.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
