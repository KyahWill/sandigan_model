				<BR><STRONG>BARREDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Original petition for <i>certiorari</i> - seeking the annulment
of an order issued by the herein respondent Judge of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> <span style="">in its Civil Case No. 3295 - with a prayer
for the is­suance of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction commanding the
herein respondent judge of the Muni­cipal Court of San <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span>
(same province) to pro­ceed with its Criminal Case </span><span style="">No. </span><span style="">817 therein </span><span style="">initiated by the herein petitioner against
private respondent, which proceedings were cancelled indefinitely </span><span style="">by the municipal
judge pursuant to the order of the former court, secured in an action for
prohibition filed before it by private respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The following facts alleged in the petition and in the answer,
albeit the latter is unverified, appear to be indisputable:</p>

<p class="BODY">Herein petitioner Alberto <span class="SpellE">Valino</span> was
the tenant or agricultural lessee of certain lands situated in San <span class="SpellE">Ilde­fonso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, belonging to
the herein private respond­ent <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> <span class="SpellE">Vasallo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime
before January 22, 1964, said private respondent must have filed with the Court
of Agrarian Relations a request for permission to eject pe­titioner, for it
appears that on said date, in CAR Case No. 909-Bul. '63, the said court
rendered a decision pur­portedly based on an amicable settlement reading as fol­lows:</p>

<blockquote>"The parties, assisted by their re­spective counsel, submitted
to this Court an amicable settlement dated Ja­nuary 22, 1964, the pertinent
portions of which are hereunder-quoted as fol­lows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.35in;">‘(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the respondent agrees that a decision be
rend­ered against him authorizing the petitioner to eject him from the
landholding in ques­tion, without admitting <span style="">bad faith for non-payment of the rentals for
the last two (2) agricultural years to the petitioner on the belief that the
landholding belongs to his parents;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.35in;"><span style="">‘(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That
petitioner agrees to suspend the execu­tion of the judgment <span style="">authori­</span>zing him to eject the respondent
from the landholding in question, as long as the here­in respondent complies
with his obligations in the payment of the yearly rental to the petitioner in
the amount of thirty (30) <span class="SpellE">cavanes</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> per agricultural year begin­ning the 1964-1965
agricultu­ral year and thereafter;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.35in;">‘(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That parties agree, in connection with the
deposited sixty <span class="SpellE">cavanes</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>
at the Belen <span class="SpellE">Ricemill</span>, peti­tioner shall receive
forty (40) <span class="SpellE">cavanes</span> of said deposit and respondent
shall receive 20 <span class="SpellE">cavanes</span> of said deposit, thus
leaving a balance of 25 <span class="SpellE">cavanes</span> as indebtedness of
the respondent to the peti­tioner;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.35in;">‘(4)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That parties agree that the indebtedness of
the respondent to the petitioner in the amount of 25 <span class="SpellE">cavanes</span>
shall be paid to the peti­tioner in two equal install­ments beginning with the
agri­cultural year 1964-1965, in addition to the yearly rental;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.35in;">‘(5)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">That
parties agree that any violation of the respondent, of the above agree­ment,
will entitle the peti­tioner for an immediate execution of the judgment to
eject the respondent.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">'WHEREFORE, parties pray to this Honorable Court that judgment be
rendered in the above-entitled case based on the terms and conditions of the
foregoing amicable settlement.'</p>

<blockquote>"Finding the foregoing amicable set­tlement not to be contrary
to law, mo­rals or public policy, the same is here­by approved; judgment is
rendered in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, and the parties
are enjoined to comply strictly therewith."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"SO ORDERED."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Petitioner having allegedly failed to
comply with the terms of the above amicable settlement, on <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1965</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Vasa­llo</span>
dispossessed <span class="SpellE">Valino</span> of the said landholdings and re­placed
the latter with a new tenant, Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Quiazon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On account of such dispossession <span class="SpellE">Valino</span> sought the interven­tion of the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under date of <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="5">7 May 1965</st1:date>, he filed <span style="">a </span>criminal complaint against <span class="SpellE">Vasallo</span>, with the aforemention­ed municipal court alleging
that the latter had "willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with malice
aforethought, dis­possessed him of his landholding."</p>

<p class="BODY">Not content with this criminal complaint, on 31 May 1965,
petitioner also lodged against the same respondent a complaint for damages
before the Court of Agrarian Rela­tions at <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, which was docketed <span style="">as </span>CAR Case No. 1186, alleging, as
main basis thereof substantially the same act of alleged illegal dispossession
as that made the subject of the criminal case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After the filing of this
latter case, while the People was presenting its evidence in the criminal case,
the accused, herein private respondent, presented a motion to suspend the
proceedings on the ground that as the sole question to be resolved in it as
well as in the case be­fore the Agrarian Relations Court was whether or not the
dispossession of petitioner was justified, the determina­tion of such question
by the latter court constituted a prejudicial one which must first be resolved
in the Agra­rian Court, considering that under the Land Reform Act, all
controversies, disputes or money claims arising from agrarian relations fall
within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian
Relations. This mo­tion having been denied, private respondent commenced the
action for prohibition above referred to in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> which, after due hearing, is­sued an order
enjoining the municipal judge from continu­ing with the hearing of the criminal
proceedings before it until after CAR Case No. 1186 shall have been disposed
of. Respondent superior judge reasoned out his order thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It appears that petitioner here­in is accused before the
municipal court of San <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
under Criminal Case No. 817 for a violation of Par. 1, Sec. 31, Republic Act
3844 otherwise known as the Land Reform Code; that the complaining witness
therein, Alberto <span class="SpellE">Valino</span>, like­wise filed with the
Court of Agrarian Relations, a complaint against herein petitioner, also for a
violation of the <span style="">same act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The latter case is de­signated as <span style="">Case No. </span>1186 of the Court of Agrarian
Relations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering that the contro­versy between the complainant and
<span style="">herein petitioner </span>subject of the
two cases falls within the juris<span style="">diction
of the </span>Court of Agrarian <span style="">Re­lations
</span>to pass upon the question of the legality of dispossession and that
whatever resolution of the latter Court on the said ques­tion will necessarily
have a bear­ing on the <span style="">criminal </span>case
pending before the <span style="">municipal </span>court
of San <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>; </blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, upon plaintiff's filing of a bond in the sum of
P500.00, let a writ of preliminary injunction be issued enjoining the Municipal
Judge of San <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
from continuing with the hearing of Criminal Case No. 817 until after CAR Case
No. 1186 shall have been disposed of."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, however, <span style="">was </span>not made a party to the said action for
prohibition; so, immediately after he came to know of the issuance of the
above-quoted order, he filed an urgent motion to intervene in the case which
was granted, but when he moved to have the said <span style="">order reconsidered, </span>his motion was denied, hence the instant
petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is now charged by petitioner that respondent superior judge
acted without or in excess of jurisdic­tion or with grave abuse of discretion
when he enjoin­ed the respondent inferior court from proceeding with the
criminal case, considering the circumstances that: (1) private respondent's
petition for prohibition which led to the issuance of the order in question was
not even sufficiently verified as required by Sec. 6, Rule 7 of the Rules of
Court, since said respondent had only stated in his verification that "all
the allegations therein (the petition) are true and correct of my own knowledge
and <span style="">belief"; (2) </span>petitioner
was not joined as a party defendant with the municipal judge in the action for
prohibition - in violation of Sec. 5, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court - so that
he was not notified of the hearing of the petition for the writ of preli­minary
injunction and he, therefore, was not given his day in court; (3) the petition
for prohibition is, in effect, an appeal from the interlocutory and <span class="SpellE">unappeal<span style="">able</span></span><span style=""> order of the municipal court denying
petitioner's mo­tion therein to suspend the hearing of its Criminal Case No.
817; and (4) the issuance of the order </span><span style="">in question is improper because the
institution of the criminal case and </span><span style="">the case before the agrarian court, separately and inde­pendently of
each other, is sanctioned by </span><span style="">Section </span><span style="">2,
Rule 111 of the Rules of Court, or, in other words, that the CAR Case is not a
prejudicial question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The first three points thus raised by appellant de­serve very
little consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As regards the
alleged defect of the verification supporting the petition in the court below,
suffice <span style="">it </span>to say that assuming
that the rule on verification, Section 6 of Rule 7 has not been strictly
complied with, it <span style="">has been held anyway that ab­sence </span>of verification is a mere
formal, not jurisdictional defect,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
particularly when the <span style="">facts alleged are more or less </span>indisputable or borne clearly by
the records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"First, respondents claim that the petition, not being
verified, is fatally defective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do
not think so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is </span>true that Rule 67, sec. 1 of the
Rules of Court, requires that the petition for<i> </i>certiorari <span style="">be </span>verified, the appar­ent object
thereof being to insure good faith in the averments of the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where, however, the ma­terial facts alleged
are a matter of record in the court below, con­sisting in pleadings filed or
pro­ceedings taken therein, and the questions raised are mainly of law, a
verification as to the truth of said facts <span style="">is not an ab­</span><span style="">solute </span>necessity and may be waiv­ed (42 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>.,
sec. 42, p. 177), <span style="">as this Court has
done in this case when we gave due course to the present petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, many authorities consider the
absence of verification a mere formal, not jurisdictional, defect, the ab­sence
of which does not of itself justify a court in refusing to al­low and act in
the case (71 C.J.S., 744-745)."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Anent the intimation of petitioner that he was not given a day in
court because he was not made a party de­fendant with the respondent municipal
judge <span style="">in </span>the case <span style="">of </span>prohibition filed with the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, in violation of <span style="">sec. </span>5,
Rule 65, it may not be said that the said rule had been disregarded, for the re­cord
shows that petitioner's motion to <span style="">intervene
was </span>granted by the respondent judge and his motion for recon­sideration
of the order complained of was thereafter con­sidered, albeit it was denied for
lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as regards the point
that the petition in the court below was virtually an appeal from an
interlocutory order, all that need be said is that it cannot be disputed that
the case filed by petitioner in the court of respondent superior judge was a
special civil action of <i>certiorari</i>, precisely the appropriate remedy,
inasmuch as the ques­tioned order of the respondent inferior judge denying
petitioner's motion for suspension of the criminal proceeding was an
interlocutory one and not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the more important question to consider in this case is
whether or not the respondent superior judge acted in accordance with law in
enjoining the respondent municipal judge from continuing with the hearing of
the criminal <span style="">case
</span>until after the CAR case shall have been disposed of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We sustain <span style="">the </span>injunction, but on a dif­ferent ground - definitely <span style="">not on </span>the ground that the de­termination
by the CAR of whether or not the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> <span style="">is </span>justified
under any of the circumstances enumerated under Section 36 of the Land Reform
Code <span style="">is a prejudicial </span>question
as to the criminal liability of a landowner who <span class="SpellE">disposses</span>
his tenant or lessee without prior <span style="">judicial
</span>authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court would like
to make it clear that the language of Sec. 31 of the Land <span style="">Reform Code </span><span style="">which pro­</span><span style="">vides pertinently that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"SEC. 31.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Prohibitions to the Agri­cultural <span class="SpellE">Lessor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- It shall

the agricultural lessee shall be entitled to disturbance compensation equi­valent
<span style="">to </span>five years rental on his
landholding in addition to his rights under Sections twen­ty-five and
thirty-four, except when the land owned and leased by the agricultural <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> is not more than five hectares, in which case
instead of distur­bance compensation the lessee may be entitled to an advanced

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">is definite and unmistakable as to the
spirit, intent and purpose of the lawmakers that under no circumstances may a
tenant or lessee be deprived or dispossessed of his land­holding without a
prior final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment of <span style="">the Court of
Agrarian Relations rendered after proper hear­ing where, understandably, the
tenant or lessee has been given an opportunity to be heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, once </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">landowner or <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> dispossesses his tenant or lessee of his landholding
without prior permission of the CAR and a criminal case is filed for violation
of Section 31 in re­lation to Section 167 of the Land Reform Code, the criminal
</span><span style="">case
may </span><span style="">proceed
to judgment irrespective of whether or not another case is filed with the CAR
whether by the landowner or <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> or by the tenant or
lessee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any sub­sequent or independent
finding of the CAR that the <span class="SpellE">eject­ment</span> may be
authorized under Section 36 cannot cure the</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">criminal
liability that already attaches upon the actual dispossession without previous
court authority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, however, the situation of respondent <span class="SpellE">Vasallo</span> stands on a different footing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here there was authority given by the CAR
upon petition of <span style="">said respondent in </span>CAR Case No. <span style="">909-Bul. '63, as stated </span>earlier above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely, this is the circumstance that was
seemingly overlooked in the proceedings in the court below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said authority, of course, was qualified in
the sense that it would take effect only <span style="">upon viola</span>tion of the petitioner of the terms and conditions contained
in the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue to be decided
<span style="">in this </span>case, therefore, is not
whether or not there was permis­sion of the CAR but whether or <span style="">not such authority could already be taken
advantage </span>of or utilized by <span class="SpellE">Vasallo</span> upon the
failure of the petitioner to comply with the terms and conditions of the
decision granting said au­thority as alleged by him.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, it may be mentioned that the compromise
judgment <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> expressly states that the
parties agreed "that any violation of <span style="">(sic) the re­</span>spondent of <span style="">the
above agreement, will entitle the petitioner </span>for an immediate execution
of the judgment to eject the respondent." Still the <span style="">question would be what the parties meant in
their stipulation with the phrase "will entitle the petitioner for (sic)
an immediate exe­</span>cution".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Had the agreement stipulated that the petitioner would be entitled
"to secure a writ of execution" or "to seek immediate
execution", it would have been clear enough that even on the assumption
that petitioner might have failed to comply with his obligations <span style="">under the de­cision, the landowner or <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> could not dispossess pe­titioner without first
securing a writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any
event, </span>it <span style="">is </span>not for this
Court to pass on these questions in this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All that We hold now <span style="">is that
until </span>the CAR which rendered the decision on the amicable compromise has
determined whether or not the authority granted by it to respondent to
dispossess petitioner has been properly exercised by respondent, <span style="">it is </span>but logical and proper that the
criminal case be held <span style="">in </span>abeyance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We reiterate that this <span style="">is </span>not a case where the landowner has
absolutely no CAR authority or permission to eject his tenant or <span style="">lessee; rather, the question here is </span>whether
or not the authority <span style="">given has been pro</span>perly
exercised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not respondent can
be held <span style="">criminally liable under the
circumstances can be fairly decided only after </span>it <span style="">is </span>known whether <span style="">or not he has acted in accordance with the
authority given to him by the CAR in Case No. 909-Bul. '63.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the result, the </span>respondent superior
judge acted <span style="">properly in enjoining the
