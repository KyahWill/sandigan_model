<span style="">63 of</span> the municipal coun­cil of <span class="SpellE">Mambajao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camiguin</span> <span class="SpellE">subprovince</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental,
dated <st1:date year="1960" day="2" month="8">August <span style="">2, </span>1960</st1:date>, abolished the position of municipal <span style="">clerk in the Mayor's office in said
municipality, effec­tive </span><st1:date year="1960" day="3" month="8"><span style="">August </span><span style="">3, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">premising the same on reasons of eco­nomy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Domingo <span class="SpellE">Arao</span>, the
occupant of said position since </span><st1:date year="1952" day="4" month="1"><span style="">January </span><span style="">4, </span><span style="">1952</span></st1:date><span style="">, moved for reconsideration with said coun­cil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said motion was however considered dropped
when <span class="SpellE">Arao</span> failed to appear at a subsequent date fixed
for him to be heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from this, <span class="SpellE">Arao</span> complained to the Civil Service Commissioner, alleging
that the municipal council removed him from office in violation of his right
under the Constitution to security of tenure as a civil service eligible
holding a permanent appointment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Without awaiting the ruling of the Commissioner of Civil Service,
<span class="SpellE">Arao</span> filed on June 21, <span style="">1961 </span>a petition for mandamus <span style="">in </span>the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Orien­tal, against the municipal mayor, council and
treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Mambajao</span>, to compel them to reinstate
him in his posi­tion and to pay his salary from the time he was separated from
the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pending the same, on <st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="7">July <span style="">3, </span>1961</st1:date>,
the Commissioner of Civil Service, deciding <span class="SpellE">Arao's</span>
complaint, ruled that the municipal council had the power to abolish the
position in question for <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> reasons of economy, subject to
Department head approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Secretary
of Finance, to whom the matter was then endorsed upon the theory that such
abolitions for reasons of economy are made subject <span style="">to his </span>approval under Republic Acts <span style="">1062 </span>and 1063, recognized said abolition as fully within the
power of municipal council, in light of Republic Act 2260 pro­viding for local
autonomy.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1964</st1:date>,
the Court of First Instance de­cided the petition for mandamus, dismissing it
upon the finding that the position at issue was duly abolished in good faith
for reasons of economy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
appealed directly to Us to raise questions purely of <span style="">law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant contends that Resolution No. 62 abolishing his position
was not duly passed in accordance with Sec­tion 2224 of the Revised
Administrative Code:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 2224….The affirmative vote of a ma­jority of <span style="">all </span>the
members of the <span style="">municipal </span>council
shall be <span style="">necessary to the passage </span>of
any ordinance or any proposition creating indebted­ness; but other measures,
except as otherwise specially provided, shall prevail upon the <span style="">ma­</span>jority vote of the members present
at any meet­ing duly called and held."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Appellant points out that Resolution No. <span style="">62 was voted </span>upon as <span style="">follows:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Three in favor; two against; and three abstaining.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And </span>thus, he argues, the required
majority of those present, five out of eight, <span style="">was </span>not obtained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The point
however becomes <span style="">academic in view of
Resolution </span>No. 63, passed the same day, <span style="">providing for the municipal </span>budget, wherein two positions, one of
which is that of messenger-clerk herein involved, are stated as
"abolished" instead of being appropriated for with salaries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Resolution No. 63 was passed unanimously
by all members of the council, except one who was absent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suppression of items in the municipal budget
resolution or ordinance amounts to abolition of the positions thus eliminated (<span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> v. Rodriguez, L-<span style="">17336, </span>December 26, 1963).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">As </span>the Court of First Instance aptly
observed:</p>

<blockquote>"Subsequent to the consideration of Re­solution No. 62, on the
same date, <st1:date year="1960" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1960</st1:date>,
Resolution No. 63, approving the Budget wherein the position of petitioner was
abolished, together with the position of field clerk, was unanimously approved
by the members of the council, except one who was absent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it is important to note that the approval
of said resolution was upon motion of Councilor Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Peñaloza</span>
who previously voted against Resolution No. 62, and seconded by Councilor <span class="SpellE">Melecio</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Sagrado</span> who abstained
from voting on Said Resolution No. 62(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 3, p.
111).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, thru Resolution No. 63, the <span style="">will </span>of the Municipal Council was
expressed, clearly and unequivocally, in approving the Budget and in abolishing
the two positions."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant would claim that the reason why his posi­tion was
abolished is not really to promote economy but to remove and unseat him without
cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant stress­es that the same
budget Resolution No. <span style="">63 </span>provided
for salary increases in other items, <span class="SpellE">totalling</span>
P4,872.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that there was still a
reserve of P<span style="">3,144.98 </span>so that <span style="">his </span>salary of <span style="">P1,</span><span style="">145.00 </span>a year
could have easily been provi­ded <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The finding of the trial court is that petitioner's office was
abolished because its functions were super­fluous, light and simple and could
readily be absorbed by other existing offices; that in fact it was so under­taken
by the municipal secretary; that no one was appoin­ted in his place, nor was <span style="">a </span>new
position created; that although the budget granted salary increases to
different officials, the same was pursuant to Republic Act <span style="">2368 </span>standardizing the salaries of
municipal officials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the reserve
of <span style="">P3,144.98 </span>the same appears
reasonably ne­cessary, as the record shows that it was intended to meet
statutory obligations of <span class="SpellE">Mambajao</span> in connection with
the creation of parts of its former territory as the new municipality of <span class="SpellE">Mahinog</span>, and for volcano eruption contingency.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said findings are in the nature of facts regarding which the
trial court's determination ought to be left un­disturbed herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's clerical position, was within the power of the
municipal council to create, and was also within its power to abolish, provided
the exercise of said power is not used as a subterfuge to cover removal from
office without cause of a civil service employee.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> Abolition
of the position in good faith is <span style="">not </span><span style="">a </span>removal,
so the Cons­titutional provision, Sec. 4, Art. XII, providing that re­moval of
employees in the civil service be only for cause, does not apply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is the situation herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner not only failed to prove that
personal or political rea­sons were behind the abolition of his position; the
fact that reasons of economy alone were what prompted the abo­lition, <span style="">has </span>been fully substantiated.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from, dismissing the
petition for mandamus, is hereby affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No costs.</p>
