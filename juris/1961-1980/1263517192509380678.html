Deles filed with this Court on November 6, 1963, charging the former with ha­ving
made under oath, false and unfounded allegations against her in a motion filed
in Court of Agrarian Relations cases 1254 and 1255 Iloilo, which allegedly
caused her great mental torture and moral suffering.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">On </span><st1:date year="1963" day="13" month="11"><span style="color: windowtext;">November 13, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;"> this Court required the respondent to answer the
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1963" day="10" month="12"><span style="color: windowtext;">December 10,
 1963</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;"> the respondent filed his
answer, affirming the truth of the allegations in the questioned motion, but
claiming in his defense that in preparing it, he relied not only upon
information received but also upon other matters of public record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also averred that the complainant had made
a si­milar charge against him in a counter-motion to declare him in contempt of
court filed in the same C.A.R cases, which was however dismissed together with
the complainant's counterclaims when the main cases were dismissed; that the
complainant failed to move for the reconsideration of the said dismissal or to
appeal there­from; and that during the few years that he has been a member of
the bar, he has always comported himself correctly, and has ad­hered
steadfastly to his conviction that the practice of law is a sa­cred trust in
the interest of truth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">This Court, on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="12"><span style="color: windowtext;">December 14,
 1963</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, referred the case to
the Solicitor General for investigation, report, and recommenda­tion. Because
both parties reside in </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="color: windowtext;">Iloilo</span></st1:placename><span style="color: windowtext;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="color: windowtext;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="color: windowtext;">, the Solicitor Ge­neral in turn referred the case to
the City Fiscal of Iloilo for in­vestigation and reception of (evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both the petitioner and the respondent
adduced evidence in the investigation which was conduc­ted. Thereafter, the
City Fiscal forwarded to the Solicitor Gene­ral the record of the
investigation, including the recommendation of the assistant city fiscal who
personally conducted the investiga­tion that the petition for disbarment be
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General
thereafter filed with this Court his report, concurring in the recommendation
of the assistant city fiscal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">Aurora Soriano Deles (hereinafter
referred to as the complainant) is the administratrix of the intestate estate
of the late Joaquina Ganzon (the deceased mother of Aurora and Enrique Soriano,
Sr. who are heirs of the estate concurrently with other forced heirs) in
special proceeding 128 of the Court of First Ins­tance of Iloilo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">On </span><st1:date year="1961" day="26" month="7"><span style="color: windowtext;">July 26, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, upon motion of Enrique Soriano, Sr. and over and
above the opposition of the complainant, the intestate court issued an order
denying a proposed lease of ten hectares of the estate by the complainant to
one Carlos Fuentes and sustaining the possession of Enrique as lessee of the
said land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect, the order likewise
sustained the possession by the brothers Fede­rico and Carlos Aglinao of a
portion of the said land being tenanted by them upon authority of the lessee,
Enrique Soriano, Sr.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">In disregard of the abovementioned
order, the complainant attempted to take possession of the landholdings by
placing there­on her own tenants. Predictably, the Aglinao brothers, to protect
their rights, countered by filing against the complainant two petitions with
the Court of Agrarian Relations in Iloilo (hereinafter re­ferred to as the
agrarian court), docketed therein as C.A.R. cases 1254 and 1255 (hereinafter
referred to as the C.A.R. cases).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
alleged in their respective petitions that they have been tenants of Enrique
Soriano, Sr. since 1960 on a parcel of riceland located barrio Malapoc,
Balasan, Iloilo, held by the complainant as ad­ministratrix of the intestate
estate of the deceased Joaquina Gan­zon; and that they had started to plow
their leaseholds consisting of two hectares each at the start of the
agricultural year 1962-63 when "on March 7, 1962, the respondent
[complainant herein] or­dered one Bonifacio Margarejo to harrow the plowed land
without the knowledge and consent" of the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, they prayed for the issuance of
an interlocutory order enjoining the complainant and her representatives from
interfering with their peaceful cultivation of the lands in question pending determination
of the merits of their petitions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, consideration of the petitioners' prayer for the issuance of an
interlocutory order of in-junction <u>pendente</u> <u>lite</u> was considerably
delayed not only by reason of several postponements granted at the behest of
the complainant but also because of the assurance made by her through counsel
in open court at the hearing of June 16, 1962, that neither she nor any of her
men would disturb or interfere with the petitioners' possession of their
leaseholds until their petitions shall have been finally resolved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">But on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="6"><span style="color: windowtext;">June 18, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, barely two days after the abovemen­tioned hearing,
the complainant's men again entered the land in question and planted rice
thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This unauthorized entry promp­ted
the Aglinao brothers, through their counsel, the herein res­pondent Atty.
Vicente Aragona, Jr. (hereinafter referred to as the respondent), to file on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="6"><span style="color: windowtext;">June 20, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;"> an "Urgent Motion for Is­suance of Interlocutory
Order." There being no objection by the complainant against the said
motion, and finding the same merito­rious, the agrarian court issued on June
21, 1962 the interlocutory order prayed for, directing "the respondent,
her agent, or any person acting for and in her behalf to refrain from molesting
or in any way interfering with the work of the petitioners in their respective
landholdings."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="6"><span style="color: windowtext;">June 24, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, upon the agrarian court's direction, the PC
detachment stationed in Sara, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="color: windowtext;">Iloilo</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="color: windowtext;">, served copies of the or­der on the complainant's
men, Bonifacio Margarejo and Carlos Fuentes, and restored the Aglinao brothers
to the possession of their landholdings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the same day, Margarejo and Fuentes in­formed their landlord, the
complainant, about the said order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">For several months thereafter
nothing of significance hap­pened in the C.A.R. cases until the palay planted
on the land in question became ripe and ready for harvest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">Then on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="10"><span style="color: windowtext;">October 2, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;"> Enrique Soriano, Sr. showed to the respondent in </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="color: windowtext;">Iloilo</span></st1:placename><span style="color: windowtext;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="color: windowtext;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="color: windowtext;"> a telegram</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="color: windowtext;"> which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="color: windowtext;">The sender
of the telegram was Mrs. Isabel Soriano, wife of En­rique, the addressee Gilda
Acolado, their daughter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">After reading the telegram, the
respondent asked Soriano whether his wife (Mrs. Soriano) was coming to </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="color: windowtext;">Iloilo</span></st1:placename><span style="color: windowtext;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="color: windowtext;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="color: windowtext;">; when informed that she was arriving, he decided to
wait for her. Mrs. Soriano arrived from Balasan in the afternoon of that same
day, </span><st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="10"><span style="color: windowtext;">October
 2, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went to see the respondent, and informed
the latter that it was she who had sent the telegram upon request of the
Aglinao brothers; that she was personally present when one Albert, a tenant of
the complainant, accompanied by many armed men, went to the land in question
and harvested the palay thereon over the protests of the Aglinao brothers; that
upon inquiring why the said Albert and his armed companions harvested the
palay, she was told that they were acting upon orders of the complainant; and that
instead of filing a complaint with the chief of police as she originally
planned, she decided instead to see the respondent without delay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">Possessed of the above
information, the respondent prompt­ly prepared and filed with the agrarian
court, on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="10"><span style="color: windowtext;">October 3, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, a verified "Urgent Motion to Declare Respondent
in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contempt of Court" (hereinafter
referred to as motion for contempt), praying that the complainant and "her
armed goons" be declared in, and punished for, contempt of court for
violating the interlocutory or­der of June 21, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion for contempt elicited, on the ve­ry
same day it was filed, an instant reply from the complainant who moved to
strike it out from the records, claiming that the al­legations therein libelled
her, and that it was the respondent who should be punished for contempt for
deliberately misleading the agrarian court. Moreover, not content with this
reply and counter-motion for contempt, the complainant also lodged on October
4, 1962 a criminal complaint for libel against the respondent with the City
Fiscal of Iloilo, based on the same allegedly libelous allega­tions made
against her by the respondent in the latter's motion for, contempt filed in the
C.A.R. cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, after
preliminarily investigating the said complaint, the assistant city fiscal to
whom it was assigned dismissed the same on the ground that the allega­tions of
the motion for contempt were privileged communications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant did not appeal from the said
dismissal to the city fiscal; neither did she elevate the same for review to
the Depart­ment of Justice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">Meanwhile, no action was taken by
the agrarian court in the C.A.R. cases on the motion for contempt filed by the
respon­dent against the complainant, as well as on the latter's counter-motion,
also for contempt, against the former.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead, by order dated </span><st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="10"><span style="color: windowtext;">October 24, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, the agrarian court dismissed C.A.R. ca­ses 1254 and
1255, including the complainant's counterclaims there­in, for lack of interest
to prosecute on the part of the petitioners, the Aglinao brothers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of course, the dismissal of the
main cases carried with it the dismissal of all incidents therein, including
the motion for contempt and counter-motion for contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, the complainant did not ask for reconsideration
of the order of dismissal, nor did she appeal therefrom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She filed instead the present administrative
complaint against the respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">The only issue raised in the
present disbarment proceed­ing is whether the respondent, Atty. Vicente E.
Aragona, Jr., should be disciplined or disbarred for having prepared and filed
under oath the "Urgent Motion to Declare Respondent in Contempt of
Court" in C.A.R. cases 1254 and 1255-Iloilo, which allegedly contains
false and libelous imputations injurious to the honor of the complainant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">For easy reference, the motion for
contempt is hereunder reproduced <u>in toto</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">The complainant's testimony is to
the effect that (1) on October 2, 1962 she was not in Balasan but in Iloilo
City where she testified at the trial of C.A.R. cases 1254 and 1255, after,
which she left for her home which is situated also in Iloilo City; (2) the
distance between Balasan and Iloilo City is 135 kilometers, and to reach
Balasan from Iloilo City one has to travel four hours by car or six hours by
bus; (3) although she knows that the person Albert, mentioned in the motion, is
Alberto Boneta, a helper of Carlos Fuentes, one of the tenants she had placed
on the lands in­volved in the C.A.R. cases, she never met or saw Boneta or Fuen­tes
from the time she was informed of the interlocutory order da­ted June 21, 1962
in the aforesaid cases, until October 2, 1962 when the said Alberto Boneta and
several armed men allegedly harvested the crops on the lands in question; (4)
she did not order Boneta to harvest the said crops; and (5) she never visited
the aforesaid lands in 1962. Her uncontradicted testimony lends cre­dence to
her claim that she did not order Alberto Boneta to har­vest, with the aid of
armed men, the crops on the Aglinao bro­thers' landholdings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">Nonetheless, this Court is loath
to uphold the view that the preparation and the filing of the questioned motion
for contempt, furnish sufficient basis for disciplinary action against the
respon­dent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">In <u>People vs. Aquino</u></span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="color: windowtext;"> this Court laid down the decisional authority that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="color: windowtext;">"[S]<u>tatements made in the
course of judicial proceedings are absolutely that is, privileged</u> – that
regardless of defamatory tenor and of the presence of malice - <u>if the same
are relevant, pertinent or material to the cause in hand or subject of the
inquiry</u>. <u>And that; in view of this, the person who makes them</u> - <u>such
as a</u> judge, <u>lawyer</u>, or witness - <u>does not thereby incur the risk
of being found liable thereon</u> in a criminal prosecution or an action for
the reco­very of damages." (emphasis supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="color: windowtext;">Since
there is no doubt that the allegations made by the respondent in the questioned
motion for contempt are statements made in the course of a judicial proceeding
- i. e., in C.A.R. cases 1254 and 1255 - besides being relevant, pertinent or
material to the subject-matter of the said cases, they are absolutely
privileged, thereby precluding any liability on the part of the respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">To be sure, the charges levelled
by the respondent against the complainant in the questioned pleading lack
sufficient factual basis. But even this circumstance will not strengthen the
complain­ant's position. "The privilege is not affected by factual or
legal in­accuracies in the utterances made in the course of judicial proceed­ings."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="color: windowtext;"> In fact, "Even when the statements are found to
be false, if there is probable cause for belief in their truthfulness and the
charge is made in good faith, the mantle of privilege may still co­ver the
mistake of the individual. The privilege is not defeated by the mere fact that
the communication is made in intemperate terms... A privileged communication
should not be subjected to microscopic examination to discover grounds of
malice or falsity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such excessive
scrutiny would defeat the protection which the law throws over privileged
communications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ultimate test is
that of <u>bona</u> <u>fides</u>."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">Indeed, the actuations of the
respondent were motivated by the legitimate desire to serve the interests of
his clients.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, contrary to the
complainant's claim, the respondent did not rely merely on Mrs. Soriano's
telegram (exh. 5) when he prepared the motion for contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to his unrebutted testimony, when
Mr. Soriano brought to him the said telegram on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="10"><span style="color: windowtext;">October 2, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, he asked the former whether his wife, the sender of
the telegram, was coming to </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="color: windowtext;">Iloilo</span></st1:placename><span style="color: windowtext;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="color: windowtext;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="color: windowtext;">, and, when informed that she was arriv­ing, he waited
for her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True enough, Mrs. Soriano saw
the respon­dent in the afternoon of that same day and informed him that she was
personally present when one Albert, a tenant of the complainant, accompanied by
several armed men, went to the landholdings of the Aglinao brothers and, against
the objections of the latter, harvested the palay crop thereon, and that upon
her inquiry, she was informed that they were acting upon orders of the
complainant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">Considering that the foregoing
information which impelled the respondent to file the questioned motion for
contempt, was ob­tained by him first-hand from someone who claimed to have
actual­ly witnessed the incident in question, coupled with the complain­ant's
own admission that the Albert referred to by Mrs. Soriano was indeed a helper
of Carlos Fuentes, one of the tenants whom she had illegally placed once on the
landholdings of the Aglinao bro­thers, it was not unseemly for the respondent
to assume that Albert did act at the behest of the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, the complainant had, in the past,
committed the same forcible act of entering the said landholdings on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="6"><span style="color: windowtext;">June 18, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, only two days after she had as­sured the agrarian
court that she would not disturb or interfere with the Aglinao brothers'
possession, pending final resolution of the pe­titions filed by them against
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In truth, it is precisely such
forci­ble entry into the said lands that precipitated the issuance of the ve­ry
interlocutory order dated </span><st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="6"><span style="color: windowtext;">June 21, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;"> which the respondent accused her of disobeying in his
motion for contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unquestionably, the
aforenarrated circumstances provided the respondent a probable cause for belief
in the truthfulness of the allegations which he couch­ed in rather intemperate
language in his motion for contempt. He had merely acted in righteous
indignation over the wrong supposedly done to his aggrieved clients - believing
as he did in the truth of his charges - without deliberate intention whatsoever
to malign and villi­fy the complainant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">The doctrine of privileged
communication is not an idle and empty principle. It has been distilled from
wisdom and experience. "The privilege is not intended so much for the
protection of those engaged in the public service and in the enactment and
administration of law, as for the promotion of the public welfare, the purpose
being that members of the legislature, judges of courts, jurors, <u>lawyers</u>,
and witnesses may speak their minds freely and exercise their res­pective
functions without incurring the risk of a criminal prosecu­tion or an action
for the recovery of damages."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="color: windowtext;"> Lawyers, most es­pecially, should be allowed a great

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">The object of a disbarment
proceeding is not so much to pu­nish the individual attorney himself, as to
safeguard the adminis­tration of justice by protecting the court and the public
from the misconduct of officers of the court, and to remove from the pro­fession
of law persons whose disregard for their oath of office have proved them unfit
to continue discharging the trust reposed in them as members of the bar.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="color: windowtext;"> Thus, the power to disbar attorneys ought always to
be exercised with great caution, and only in clear cases of misconduct which
