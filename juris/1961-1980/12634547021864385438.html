a shooting incident occurred at the market place of <span class="SpellE">Tubigon</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bohol</span></st1:place>. Shortly after the
occurrence of said incident, five criminal <span class="SpellE">informa­tions</span>
were filed in the Court of First Instance of that province.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Criminal Case No. 3361, <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span> (<span class="SpellE">Piddy</span>) Wong, Vicente Montoya, Julian (<span class="SpellE">Ejac</span>)
<span class="SpellE">Binasbas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> (<span class="SpellE">Mongmong</span>) <span class="SpellE">Vedra</span> and Rolando (Boy)
Montoya were charged with the crime of murder allegedly committed on the person
of Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Carmona</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Criminal Case No. 3372, Rolando Montoya was charged with
attempted homicide, committed according to the information on the person of <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Anova</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Criminal Case No. 3373, all the five defend­ants (in case No.
3361) were charged with the crime of frustrated murder, committed as alleged in
the information on the person of <span class="SpellE">Teodula</span> Lopez.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Criminal Case No. 3374, Rolando Montoya was charged with
illegal possession of firearms.</p>

<p class="BODY">And in Criminal Case No. 3375, <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span>
Wong, Vi­cente Montoya and <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Vedra</span> were accused of at­tempted murder with direct assault

<p class="BODY">Julian <span class="SpellE">Binasbas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vedra</span>, being at large, were neither arraigned nor
tried.</p>

<p class="BODY">After presentation of the prosecution evidence in chief, the
court dismissed the case of illegal posses­sion of firearms for failure of the
prosecution to prove the same. The trial of the four other cases having been
concluded, decision was rendered by the court disposing as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"PREMISES CONSIDERED, the court renders judgment in criminal
case No. 3361 finding accused <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span> (<span class="SpellE">Piddy</span>) Wong, Vicente Montoya and Rolando Mon­toya alias Boy
guilty of the crime of murder, punished by Article 248, par. 1 of the Revised
Penal Code, without the attendance of any aggravating or mitigating
circumstance, and each of them is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span><u>.<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The above mentioned accused are further sentenced to
indemnify jointly and severally the heirs of the deceased in the amount of six
thousand pesos (P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>); but they shall not suf­fer
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They are finally sentenced to pay three-fifth (3/5) of the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"THE COURT RENDERS JUDGMENT IN CRIMINAL CASE No. 3373 finding
accused <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span> (<span class="SpellE">Piddy</span>)
Wong, Vicente Montoya and Rolando Montoya guilty of the crime of less serious
physical inju­ries, punished by Article 265 of the Revised Penal Code, with the
aggrava­ting circumstance of treachery, and sentencing each of them to suffer
the penalty of six (6) months of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span><u>
mayor</u>, and to pay three-fifths (3/5) of the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The court refrains from making any pronouncement as to the
civil liability of the three accused, since the offended party had reserved the
right to institute a separate civil action for damages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Pursuant to Article 70 of the Revised Penal Code, the court
orders that the three accused shall begin to serve the penalty imposed herein
after they have fully served the penalty im­posed upon them in criminal case
No. 3361.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"THE COURT ALSO RENDERS JUDGMENT IN CRIMINAL CASE No. 3372
finding ac­cused Rolando Montoya alias Boy guilty of the crime of slight
physical injuries, punished by Article 266 of the Revised Penal Code, and
sentencing him to suffer a penalty of ten (10) days of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>menor</u></span>, and to pay the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The court refrains from making any pronouncement as regards
the civil lia­bility of the accused, because the of­fended party had reserved
the right to institute a separate civil action for damages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Pursuant to Article 70 of the Revised Penal Code, accused
Rolando Montoya shall begin to serve the penalty imposed herein after he has
completed serving the penalty imposed in criminal case No. 3373.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"FINALLY, THE COURT RENDERS JUDGMENT IN CRIMINAL.</span>
CASE No. 3375 acquit­ting accused from the crime charged in the information
with costs <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>, and cancellation
of their bail bonds."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Dissatisfied with the judgment, the three accused who stood
trial, appealed to this Court.</p>

conver­sing with Romeo <span class="SpellE">Cosare</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span>
Andaman at the gate of the public market of <span class="SpellE">Tubigon</span>,
a jeep suddenly parked in front of <span class="SpellE">Cosare</span> store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as the jeep stopped, Vi­cente
Montoya, <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span> Wong, <span class="SpellE">Mongmong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vedra</span>, Rolando (Boy) Montoya and Julian <span class="SpellE">Binasbas</span> fired their guns. (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span> p. 64, <st1:date year="1961" day="25" month="10">Oct.

directed at the deceased Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Carmona</span>, who was 4
or 5 meters away from her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased
was seated on a bamboo bench called "<span class="SpellE">lantay</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shots hit Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Carmona</span>
and herself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was hit on the right jaw
and lower right cheek. <span class="GramE">(p. 65, Ibid.)</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the shooting, the jeep sped away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But one of the men in the jeep, Boy Montoya,
jumped out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another man grappled with
Boy for the possession of a pistol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
did not come to know the result of the grappling because she was brought inside
a tailoring shop where she was given a first aid treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, she was taken to the clinic of Dr.
Falcon where she stayed for one night and a half day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, she was transferred to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bohol</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Pro­vincial</st1:placename>

confined for two weeks.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Anova</span>
testified that on <st1:date month="10" day="12" year="1961">October 12, 1961</st1:date>,
at about <st1:time hour="17" minute="0">5:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the
afternoon, he was in front of the <span class="SpellE">Tubigon</span> market,
seated on a <span class="SpellE"><u>tartanilla</u></span><u>.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw a jeep running towards the place where
the deceased Ja­cinto <span class="SpellE">Carmona</span> was seated, which was
about three <span class="SpellE">brazas</span> distant to the store of <span class="SpellE">Cosare</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased
was seated on a bench called "<span class="SpellE">lantay</span>",
about 2 feet high from the ground, drinking beer. Inside the jeep were the five
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Seeing that the occupants of
the jeep <span class="GramE">were<span style="">&nbsp; </span>armed</span>
and knowing that Vicente Montoya and the deceased<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">quarrelled</span> the day
before</u>, "I shouted at Jacinto (<span class="SpellE">Car­mona</span>) to
be careful." (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span> p.
187) The persons riding in the jeep fired their guns as soon as the jeep
stopped.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the shooting, as the jeep started to run, Rolando Montoya
jumped off the vehicle and went after the deceased who was crawling towards a
store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rolando fired again at the
deceased, although <span class="SpellE">Anova</span> cannot tell whether the
deceased was hit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He (witness) jumped
from the <span class="SpellE"><u>tartanilla</u></span> and grappled with Rolando
for the posses­sion of a .45 caliber pistol the latter was then holding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before he could grab the pistol, Rolando hit
him on the head with the butt of the gun and he was wounded. After he had
grabbed the pistol, Rolando ran to the store of <span class="SpellE">Sosing</span>
Wong, father of appellant <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span> Wong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said store was about 15 <span class="SpellE">brazas</span>
distant to the place where the shooting incident happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He pursued Rolando in the store, but the
latter threw a bottle at him, injuring him at the wrist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wounded, he ran to the municipal building to
surrender the gun to the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
next day, he was treated of his injuries at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bohol</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Provin­cial</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Policemen of <span class="SpellE">Tubigon</span> claim to have seen
the accused with the exception of Rolando Montoya proceeding in a jeep to <span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span> after shots were heard near the market place at <span class="SpellE">Tubigon</span>. Pat. <span class="SpellE">Policarpo</span> Elle went
as far as to say that when he met the jeep of the accused, on his way to the <span class="SpellE">Cosare</span> store, <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span> Wong and
Vicente Montoya fired at him with their rifles.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He sought shelter behind <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bohol</span></st1:place>
transit Bus No. 104 and it was the mudguard of said bus that was hit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This claim, however, did not impress the
trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court acquitted the
accused in criminal case No. 3375 upon the following considerations:</p>

<blockquote>"With respect to the case of the alleged offended party <span class="SpellE">Policarpo</span> Elle in criminal case No. 3375, we seriously
entertain doubt regarding the facts established by the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, only <span class="SpellE">Policarpo</span>
Elle had declared about the fact that he was fired at by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony had been contradicted by the
accused and other witnesses for the defense.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is hinted that the hole on the front side of the truck, as
it appears on the pictures (Exhibits L and M) came from the bullet fired by
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defense, however, offered the
testimony of the owner of the truck to the effect that such hole was caused by
a person who was drunk and who struck with a piece of iron that front part of
the truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution failed to
prove that the bullet causing the alleged hole on the fender had also hit the
interior thereof, thus raising doubt as to whether or not the <span class="GramE">hole</span> was in reality caused by a bullet coming from the jeep
used by accused." (p. XLIX, appellants' brief)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Dr. <span class="SpellE">Godofredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Ganade</span>,

<st1:date month="10" day="12" year="1961">October 12, 1961</st1:date>, the
deceased Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Car­mona</span> was admitted at the

commenced, but when the surgeons were opening the abdomen, the patient <span class="SpellE">vomitted</span> blood which choked him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Death occurred one and a half hour after
admission.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Pacomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Galve</span>
of the Philippine Constabulary testified that at about 7:00 o'clock in the
evening of October 11, 1961, Vicente Montoya, accompanied by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Zafra</span> and three others, came to camp <span class="SpellE">Dagohoy</span>
at <span class="SpellE">Tagbila­ran</span> to complain that he was mauled by the
deceased <span class="SpellE">Ja</span> <span class="SpellE">cinto</span> <span class="SpellE">Carmona</span> and the latter's companions at about 1:00 o'clock
in the afternoon of that day at the market place in <span class="SpellE">Tubigon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An affidavit of Vicente Montoya was prepared,
but the same was not signed.</p>

explain why?</blockquote>

or if not, he said, we will meet in the office of the clerk of court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following day, he did not come, so I went
to the office of the clerk of court but he did not come also." <span class="GramE">(p. 51, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>.</span> <st1:date month="10" day="25" year="1961">Oct. 25, 1961</st1:date>.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Zenon</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>,
also of the PC, testi­fied that in the morning of <st1:date month="10" day="12" year="1961">October 12, 1961</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span>
Wong, Vicente Montoya and <span class="SpellE">Mongmong</span> <span class="SpellE">Vedra</span> came to <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dagohoy</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span> Wong
declared that he saw the mauling of Vicente Montoya the day before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He reduced the statement of Wong in writing,
Exhibit H, but the same was not signed.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;"><u>EVIDENCE OF THE DEFENSE</u>:</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the defense tended to establish that the
deceased Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Carmona</span> was of a violent character,
and that he was shot by Rolando Montoya in defense of his brother, Vicente
Montoya.</p>

<p class="BODY">Vicente Montoya testified that in the elections of 1961, he sided
with <span class="SpellE">congressional<span class="GramE">,candidate</span></span>
Jose <span class="SpellE">Zafra</span> while Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Carmona</span>
supported <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the afternoon of <st1:date month="10" day="11" year="1961">October 11, 1961</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Carmona</span>
asked Vicente to side with <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he refused, the deceased clubbed him on
the head with an empty bottle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Carmona’s</span> companions, Diego, <span class="SpellE">Francing</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Anova</span> were then
present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vicente lost consciousness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon regaining con­sciousness, Vicente
noticed that he was surrounded by the deceased and his companions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The chief of police of <span class="SpellE">Tubigon</span>
took Vicente to the clinic of Dr. Falcon for treat­ment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Late in the afternoon of that date, candidate <span class="SpellE">Zafra</span>
fetched Vicente from his house and took him to the PC barracks at <span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
failed to sign the affidavit because <span class="SpellE">Zafra</span> told him
not to sign until <span class="GramE">he</span> (<span class="SpellE">Zafra</span>)
had returned, and <span class="SpellE">Zafra</span> did not come back the
following morn­ing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following
morning, Vicente and <span class="SpellE">Piddy</span> Wong re­turned to the PC
headquarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The affidavit of Wong was
prepared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lt. Lara of the PC told them
to come back in the afternoon, but Vicente answered that they could not come
back because <span class="SpellE">Zafra</span> instructed them to proceed that
afternoon to barrio <span class="SpellE">Tugois</span> in the town of Lila,
around 19 to 20 kilometers distant from <span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span>,
to cam­paign.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the afternoon of <st1:date month="10" day="12" year="1961">October
 12, 1961</st1:date>, Vicente, <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span> Wong, <span class="SpellE">Mongmong</span> <span class="SpellE">Vedra</span> and <span class="SpellE">Herminiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Salera</span> went to <span class="SpellE">Tigois</span>, arriving thereat at <st1:time hour="13" minute="0">1:00

Vicente and his companions should not follow to <span class="SpellE">Batuan</span>
but must return to <span class="SpellE">Tubigon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the group of Vicente went to <span class="SpellE">Tubigon</span> in the house of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Salustiano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Baura</span>, which served as the campaign headquar­ters of <span class="SpellE">Zafra</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After about
one-half hour, <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span> Wong extended an invitation
for snacks at their store near the market place of <span class="SpellE">Tubigon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vicente Montoya and <span class="SpellE">Mong­mong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vedra</span> went with Wong, and they were joined by Ro­lando
Montoya, younger brother of Vicente, and Julian <span class="SpellE">Binasbas</span>
who were at the headquarters at the time.</p>

<p class="BODY">Reaching the market of <span class="SpellE">Tubigon</span>, the

the <span class="SpellE">Panyang</span> store.<span style="">&nbsp;

Wong, father of <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span> <span class="GramE">Wong.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Next to the <span class="SpellE">Panyang</span>
store on the same side of the street was the <span class="SpellE">Cosare</span>

alighted from the jeep, Vicente noticed the presence of Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Carmona</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
deceased was standing with left foot on top of a bam­boo bench outside the <span class="SpellE">Cosare</span> store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aiming
a pistol at Vicente Montoya, the deceased remarked:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"You are here again, ha? You are not
afraid of what happened yester­day?" (p. 148, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
Oct. 18, 1962) Vicente Montoya ans­wered:<span style="">&nbsp;

us." (p. 149, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Ibid)</p>

<blockquote>"Q.-<span style=""> </span>Again, in answer to the question of the Hon.

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Teodula</span> Lopez started with the
declaration that a single person fired his gun.</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span class="GramE">.-</span> When that jeep stopped, what did
you observe?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A.-</span> Somebody
fired his gun. (TSN, p. 64, Oct. 25, 1961)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But when the <span class="SpellE"><u>promotor</u></span> <u>fiscal</u>,
in the next question, asked her who "were the ones" who fired the
gun, the wit­ness responded by naming all the five accused.</p>

gum, do you know? Will you please mention their names?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A.-</span> Vicente

p. 64, Ibid)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After a few questions, <span class="SpellE">Teodula</span> Lopez
toned down her testimony by saying that all the accused were <u>armed</u>.</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span class="GramE">.-</span> Why did you say that they were
armed?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A.-</span> Why should

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Before the start of the
cross-examination, the court pro­pounded questions to the witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She reverted to the former position that all
the five accused fired their guns.</p>

fired their guns?</blockquote>

because I was facing at them. (TSN, p. 71, Ibid)</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The court was skeptical:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span class="GramE">.-</span> Were you not telling a lie when
you said that the five of them had fired their guns?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A.-</span> I am
telling the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, pp. 70-71,
Ibid)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Witness was reminded of her moral
responsibility as a wit­ness, but she <span class="SpellE">stucked</span> to her
claim that all the five ac­cused discharged their firearms.</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span class="GramE">.-</span><span style=""> </span>Are
you conscious of the fact that your testimony is very serious, and the crime
here is very serious that the accused might be sentenced to death once
convicted, therefore, you must be honest in your testi­mony?</blockquote>

firearms?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A.-</span> Yes, I
insist. (TSN. p. 71 (Ibid)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">She then proceeded to describe the
participation of each of the accused, upon questions propounded by the court.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">After the series of questions by the
court, the session was adjourned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
resumption of the hearing the next day, the fiscal asked leave to propound
additional questions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The witness
switched to the claim that only Vicente Montoya and <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span>
Wong aimed their firearms.</p>

<blockquote>"Q.- Yesterday when you were testifying you testified that the

<p class="BODY">The foregoing shows up <span class="SpellE">Teodula</span> Lopez as
a vacillat­ing witness, who would change her testimony as a chame­leon would
vary its hues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her tendency to
exaggerate is patent, and she has very little respect for her oath as a
witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, from the claim that a
single person fired a gun, her testimony soon metamorphosed into the pre­tense
that all the five accused discharged their firearms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No sooner had she made this pretense then she
switched to the claim that the five accused were only "armed".<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a few questions, however, she reverted

said that Julian had a gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She pretends
to know the color of the gun of Vicente Montoya, but more noticeable objects
that would immediately arrest the attention of even a casual observer, such as
the windshield of the jeep, escaped her notice.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Then, he was confronted with his

stated that "Vicente Montoya, holding a .45 caliber revolver, aimed at <span class="SpellE">Cinto</span> <span class="SpellE">Carmona</span>."</span> And
he was asked in court to point to the person of Vicente Montoya.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ac­cused he fingered, however, was
Rolando Montoya.</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span class="GramE">.-</span> At the time when you executed

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In his affidavit, he also stated that
"<span class="SpellE">Mongmong</span> with a .45 caliber who was the one
driving, did not fire and one whom I do not know, was also holding a .45
caliber but did not also fire." <span class="GramE">Asked in Court to point

to Vicente Montoya.</span></p>

where he is?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A.-</span> That
Vicente Montoya (witness pointing to accused Vicente Montoya) [p. 189 Ibid]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing reveals that the same defects which taint the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Teodula</span> Lopez <span class="GramE">vitiates</span>
the testi­mony of <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Anova</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the beginning, this witness tried to
impress the Court that all the accused fired their guns at the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, he reduced the num­ber of the
assailants to three, but he was careful to include appellant Vicente
Montoya.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Confronted with a con­tradictory
statement in his affidavit, the witness relent­ed and excluded Vicente Montoya
from amongst those who discharged their firearms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He tried to disguise the con­tradiction by
mistaking Rolando Montoya for Vicente Mon­toya.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But this appears to us as a mere pretext consider­ing that this witness
knew the <span class="SpellE">Montoyas</span> and he could pin­point Rolando
Montoya as the one who jumped from the jeep and with whom he grappled for the possession
of the .45 caliber pistol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense
has reason to complain in their brief that <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Anova</span> has an axe to grind against the appellants because he
was a henchman of the deceased Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Carmona</span>, not
to speak of the fact that in the encounter on <st1:date month="10" day="12" year="1961">October 12, 1961</st1:date>, he sustained in­juries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is patent that the purpose of the witness
in claiming that Vicente Montoya was the principal and mov­ing spirit in the
slaying of the <span class="GramE">deceased,</span> is to give some semblance of
truth to the theory of the prosecution that the shooting on October 12 was done
in retaliation of the maltreatment of Vicente Montoya, the day before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A rigid cross-examination exposed <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Anova</span> as an <span class="SpellE">untrusthworthy</span> witness, and we are not prepared to base the
factual setting of this case upon his narration of this incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">Third, we seriously doubt if <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Anova</span> had not distorted the <span class="SpellE">truefacts</span>,
for pretending to have observed the incident even before the firing at Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Carmona</span>, yet there is in the record a categorical admission
of <span class="SpellE">Anova</span> that when he jumped from the <span class="SpellE"><u>tartanilla</u></span> and approach­ed <span class="SpellE">Carmona,"the</span>
shooting was finished already." (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span>.
p. 196)</p>

<p class="BODY">Vital contradictions are found in the testimonies of the two
prosecution witnesses who allegedly witness­ed the occurrences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon an examination of their decla­rations,
independently of each other, substantial discre­pancies are also revealed by a
comparison of their res­pective testimonies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, while the net result of the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Teodula</span>
Lopez is to the effect that <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span> Wong and Vicente
Montoya were the only ones who fired at the deceased, <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Anova</span> on the other hand, finally admitted that
Vicente Montoya did not discharge his fire­arm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This leaves only one accused, <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span> Wong, as
the supposed triggerman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we are not
persuaded to believe that this accused is responsible for the death of the de­ceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the record, he has absolutely no reason
to lay his hands on the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
most logical assail­ant would either be Vicente Montoya or Rolando Montoya, who
are brothers, if we are to concede momentarily and for arguments sake that the
slaying was done in a spirit of vengeance for what Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Carmona</span>
had done to Vicente Montoya on <st1:date month="10" day="11" year="1961">October
 11, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as
prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Anova</span>,
however, admitted that Vicente Montoya did not fire his gun, only Rolando
Montoya re­mains as the triggerman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
this is precisely the ver­sion of the defense, to wit: that only Rolando
Montoya fired at the deceased Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Carmona</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two vital facts weaken the theory of the prosecu­tion that the
deceased was gunned down by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>First, the incident was unexpected, as the evidence re­veals. In the
words of the lower court which deserve our approval:</p>

<blockquote>"If we took into account that accused were using a jeep of Jose
<span class="SpellE">Zafra</span>, candidate for Congressman, because their
mission was to make a campaign for the candidacy of the latter; if we took
further into account that the incident was rather unexpected, there would be
reason to say that the evident premeditation alleged in the information has not
been proved beyond reasonable doubt." (p. XLV, Brief of Appellants)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Second, even the lower court doubted that all the accused were
armed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated in the decision
appealed from:</p>

<blockquote>"There is also doubt as to whe­ther or not the five accused,
who were riding on the jeep, were armed because while <span class="SpellE">Teodula</span>
Lopez asserted that the five accused pointed their guns at Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Carmona</span>, witness <span class="SpellE">El­pidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Anova</span> said that only accused Vicente Montoya, <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span> (<span class="SpellE">Piddy</span>) Wong and Rolando
Montoya had pointed their guns at the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More­over, it is beyond human comprehen­sion why accused <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> (<span class="SpellE">Mong­mong</span>) <span class="SpellE">Vedra</span> should be using firearm, when his mission in the jeep
was to drive it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, therefore,
doubt as regard the fact that more than three persons were armed with unli­censed
firearms, although this might be possible." (p. XLVI, Ibid)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the mind inquires why, if the accused were really all
armed, supposedly with high-powered guns at that, they scampered towards the
jeep and sped away, leaving Rolando Montoya behind, at the mere warning that
the companions of Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Carmona</span> were coming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The more probable is that only Rolando
Montoya tarried behind be­cause he alone was armed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The claim of the defense that only Rolando Montoya fired the <span class="GramE">shots,</span> is corroborated by the fact that the deceased
sustained no more than three gunshot wounds, as appears in the medical
certificate, Exhibit A.</p>

<p class="BODY">It could well be that the gunshot wound sustained by <span class="SpellE">Teodula</span> Lopez, also came from the gun of Rolando Mon­toya,
for as this prosecution witness admitted, she was hit and wounded at the first
burst of gunfire.</p>

<p class="NUM"><span class="GramE">2.-</span> The next question that confronts the
Court is whether or not conspiracy among the accused existed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In holding the affirmative, the lower court
took into con­sideration three factors, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that the accused, Vi­cente Montoya and Rolando Montoya are brothers and
the other accused, <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span> Wong is their
brother-in-law; these accused made a common cause in retaliating against the
late Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Carmona</span> in consequence of the bloody
incident that have taken place on October 11, 1961, whence the victim was
Vicente Montoya; and that after Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Carmona</span> had
been hit by the bullets, accused Rolando Montoya still had the temerity of
approaching the vic­tim and causing additional injuries on the head of the
latter, indicating that all the accused had the abso­lute determination of
snuffing out the life of the vic­tim (p. XXXIX, Brief of the Appellants).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are unable to agree with the first and
second factors cited by the lower court in support of its finding of a
conspiracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The finding of the lower
court itself that the incident was rather unexpected, which is borne out by the
evi­dence, immediately precludes the idea that the brothers Montoya and their
brother-in-law Wong, agreed or made a common cause to retaliate against the
deceased, Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Carmona</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As regards the third factor, we cannot see
our way clear through the reasoning that the act of one of the alleged
co-conspirators, after all his companions had left the scene of the crime,
could be considered as the act of said companions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not even the presence of the appellants
Vicente Montoya and <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span> Wong, while Rolando
Montoya was shooting the deceased, could be ta­ken as evidence against the two <span class="GramE">appellants, that</span> they conspired with their co-appellant in
committing the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no
evidence of a prior agreement to assault the deceased, those who were present
but who did not actually inflict injuries, cannot be consider­ed as
co-conspirators.</p>

<blockquote>"Although four persons were pre­sent when a fatal assault was
made upon another and each of the four contributed somewhat to the unlawful
aggression, nevertheless, in view of the fact that no prior conspiracy was
shown and the acts done did not clearly show commu­nity of purpose, it was held
that the individual who inflicted the fatal blow was alone responsible in the
character of principal." (People v. <span class="SpellE">Tumayao</span>, et
al., 56, Phil. 587)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The principal element <span class="GramE">of every punishable
compli­city</span> in any crime consists in the concurrence of the will of the
co-conspirators with the direct author of the crime, pre-supposing the mediate
or immediate agree­ment of all to carry out the commission of an offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where such concurrence is lacking, as in the
case at bar, conspiracy cannot be said to have existed.</p>

<p class="NUM"><span class="GramE">3.-</span> It is agreed on behalf of the
appellants that even Rolando Montoya should be acquitted because in slaying the
deceased, he acted in defense of his bro­ther. Settled is the rule that an
accused invoking self-defense or for that matter, defense of a relative, must
prove his case clearly and convincingly otherwise, conviction would follow from
his admission that he killed the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not impressed by the claim that Rolando Montoya happened
to have a pistol on that fateful af­ternoon because <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vedra</span> temporarily entrusted a gun to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that <span class="SpellE">Vedra</span>
would be inconve­nienced in his driving with a gun tucked in his waist, there
was the seat of the jeep beside him, if not a compartment in the vehicle, where
he could place his revolver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
disbelief is heightened by the claim that the gun entrusted to Rolando Montoya
was cocked and ready to fire.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither is it credible that the deceased al­though he had a gun, as
testified to by the witness for the defense, cocked his pistol before Rolando
Mon­toya started shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering,
according to the defense, that the deceased was trigger-happy and a man of
violence, Rolando Montoya would not emerge from the encounter <span class="SpellE">unscatched</span>, if the deceased and Rolando Montoya confronted
each other, face to face, and the former cocked his pistol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact is that the num­ber and nature of
the injuries sustained by the deceased completely negates the claim of defense
of a relative.</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel for the appellants countered, however, that Rolando
Montoya did not act treacherously when he shot Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Carmona</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this point, the evidence show that when
the jeep where the accused were riding, passed by the side of <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Anova</span>, the latter shouted
at Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Carmona</span> and warned of the presence of the
accused. There is evidence that for a short time, the deceased and Ro­lando
Montoya were face to face before the shooting oc­curred, as shown by the
testimony of Rolando Montoya that the first shot found its mark on the thigh of
the deceased, and when the latter turned to the left, pre­sumably due to the
force of the impact of the bullet, the assailant fired the second shot hitting
the victim on the other side, which clearly show that the attack was not
treacherous because it gave the victim a chance to defend himself. The evidence
does not clearly show the presence of treachery in the commission of the
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the process of the shooting of
Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Car­mona</span>, Rolando Montoya inflicted injuries
on <span class="SpellE">Teodula</span> Lopez, <u>albeit</u> without the least
intent of killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For all these
considerations, <span class="GramE">We</span> find Rolando Montoya responsible
for the death of Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Carmona</span>, qualified as
homicide without the presence of any modifying cir­cumstance, and for the physical
injuries suffered by <span class="SpellE">Teodula</span> Lopez.</p>

<p class="NUM"><span class="GramE">4.-</span> The case involving complainant <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Anova</span>, however, is
different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said complainant claims that
before he succeeded in wresting the gun from Rolando Montoya, the latter shot
him three times without hit­ting him because he dodged. We reject this as <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">incre­dibble</span></span><span class="GramE"> .</span>
The fact is that <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Anova</span>,
as soon as he noticed that his leader, Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Carmona</span>,
was felled by the bullets of Rolando Montoya, pursued the latter and wrestled
his gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was testified to by Rolan­do
Montoya, which testimony is corroborated by the de­claration of <span class="SpellE">Teodula</span> Lopez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Anova</span> was not content with wresting the gun from Rolando
Montoya, He pursued the latter to the store of <span class="SpellE">Sosing</span>
Wong, determined to kill him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, he
declared:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span class="GramE">.-</span> You followed Vicente Montoya
(actually he meant Rolando) to the house of <span class="SpellE">Sosing</span>
because you were determined to kill him is it not?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A.-</span> Yes,
sir." (pp. 201, 202, Oct. 26, 1961)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Under the circumstances, the infliction
of injuries upon him by Rolando Montoya was clearly done in self-defense.</p>
