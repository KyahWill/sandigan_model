of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, dated January 12, 1962,
dismissing plaintiff's complaint in Civil Case No. 3738, and from the order
dated February 12, 1962, denying the motion for reconsideration of the order of
dismissal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On September 25, 1961,
plaintiff-appellant Belen Cruz filed a complaint against </span><span style="">defendants-</span><span style="">appellees</span><span style=""> Luis M. </span><span style="">Simon Mossesgeld, Raquel Salamanca and her
husband Carlos Salamanca, the Philippine National Bank, and Angela Concepcion
and her husband Honorato Perez, before the Court of First Instance of Nueva
Ecija, </span><span style="">al­</span><span style="">leging, among others:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that plaintiff had acquired ownership and
possession of four lots, known as Lots Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 of Block No. 27,
being portions of </span>Lot No. 317-A, PSD-23407, situated at Cabanatuan City,
Philippines, containing an area of 862 square meters, and covered by Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 10715 issued by the Register of Deeds of Cabanatuan
City, in virtue of a contract of sale executed in her favor on September 3,
1949 by Pedro M. Maximino Mossesgeld in his own behalf and in behalf of Jose
Maria Gaspar Mos­sesgeld, Luis M. Domingo Mossesgeld and Aquiles M. Pablo
Mossesgeld, copy of which contract was annexed to the complaint; that under
said contract of sale, the price of the lots was P1,443.70, which plaintiff
undertook to pay by installments, and the plaintiff was ready to pay the last
installment of P428.20 but payment could not <span style="">be effected due to </span>the fraudulent acts <span style="">of the defendants; that plaintiff was placed in actual possession of
the </span>aforementioned lots by the vendor, and the plaintiff took material
possession of the lots as owner thereof; <span style="">that
it came to the knowledge of plaintiff that on March 22, 1955, defendant Luis M.
Simon Domingo Mossesgeld, </span>without any right or authority and with intent
to pre­judice plaintiff, fraudulently sold the same lots to his co-defendant
Raquel Salamanca who knew that plaintiff <span style="">had
already bought those lots and that plaintiff </span>had only <span style="">a </span><span style="">small amount remaining unpaid as the last installment </span>on the
price of the lots; that in connivance with her co-defendant Luis <span style="">M. Simon </span>Domingo Mossesgeld, defendant
Raquel C. Salamanca secured the issuance of Transfer Cer­tificate of Title No.
3034 in her favor, thereby canceling Transfer Certificate of Title No. 10715,
and then, on March 26, 1955, she mortgaged the said lots to the Philippine
National Bank, Cabanatuan City Branch, to guarantee a loan of P900.00; that <span style="">on </span>August 16, 1961 defendant Raquel C.
Salamanca conveyed Lots Nos. 1 and 2 to her co-defendant Angela Concepcion, who
is her niece and who also knew that plaintiff had already bought <span style="">those lots and </span><span style="">was </span>in possession thereof, and as <span style="">a </span>result Transfer Certificate <span style="">of </span>Title No. <span style="">6908 was
issued in </span>favor of Angela Concepcion; that prior to the filing of this
action, plaintiff demanded of the defendants the cancellation of the deed of
absolute sale in favor of defendant Raquel Salamanca and the deed of sale in
favor of Angela Concepcion, and likewise the cancellation of Transfer
Certificates of Title Nos. 3034 and 6908; that the price of the lots at the <span style="">time the plaintiff bought </span>them was
at<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P1.50 per square meter, but at the
time the complaint was filed the square meter was valued at P4.00, and as a
direct result of the malicious and fraud­ulent acts of defendants, plaintiff
had suffered actual and moral damages and had to pay the services of an
attorney in connection with this suit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The complaint prayed the
court:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) to declare </span>null and
void the deed of sale in favor of defendant Raquel C. Salamanca, the deed<span style=""> </span>of mortgage
in favor of defendant Philippine National Bank, and the deed of sale in favor
of defendant Angela Concepcion; (2) to declare Transfer Certificates of Title
Nos. 3034 and 6908 null and void; (3) to declare the plaintiff the owner and
entitled to possession of the four lots in question; (4) to condemn the
defendants jointly and severally to pay the plaintiff the sum of P3,848.00 as
actual damages, the sum of P3,000.00 as moral damages, the sum of P1,000.00 as
attorney's fees, and the costs of the suit.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="">On
November 2, 1961, defendants-spouses Raquel Salamanca and Carlos Salamanca, and
defendants-spouses Angela Concepcion and Honorato Perez, filed a motion to </span>dismiss
the complaint upon the grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) that
the cause of action is barred by prior judgment or order, and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(b) that there is no cause of action against
said defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These defendants allege
in their motion to dismiss that there was previously filed with the Court of First
Instance of Nueva Ecija Civil Case No.2773 entitled "Belen Cruz vs. Luis M.
Simon Domingo Mossesgeld and the Spouses Raquel Salamanca and Carlos
Salamanca" which had been dismissed on February 10, 1961 for failure of
the parties to prosecute, and the order of dismissal was without any
reservation that <span style="">the </span>dismissal was without <span style="">pre</span>judice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said defendants allege that the present case was entirely a refilling of
that Civil <span style="">Case </span>No. 2773 which
was already dismissed, the original parties being reproduced, with the only
exception that defendants Angela Concepcion and <span style="">Honorato Perez </span>had been added, but the
subject matter of the two cases is the <span style="">same. </span>It is urged by thee defendants that the
dismissal of Civil Case <span style="">No. </span>2773
had the effect of an adjudication upon the merits because the dismissal was
with prejudice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These defendants further
point out that the addition of the spouses Angela Concepcion and Honorato Perez
as co-defendants in the instant case is of no moment because these new
defendants merely stepped into the shoes of the spouses Raquel Salamanca and<span style=""> Carlos Salamanca as regards Lots 1 and 2</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also
contended by</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">these defendants that there is no </span>cause
of action against defendants Raquel Salamanca and Carlos Salamanca and Angela
Concepcion and Honorato Perez because while paragraph 3 of the complaint
alleges that the plaintiff had bought the land i<span style="">n question by </span>virtue of a contract executed in her favor by
defendant Simon <span style="">Domingo Mossesgeld on
September 3, 19</span>4<span style="">9, said sale was
</span>not registered with the office of the Register of Deeds of Cabanatuan
City, whereas the sale made by <span style="">Luis M. </span>Simon Domingo Mo<span style="">ss</span>esgeld in favor of Raquel Salamanca
and Carlos Salam<span style="">a</span>nca was
registered with the office of the Register of <span style="">Deeds </span>of Cabanatuan City.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On November 16, 1961 the
plaintiff filed an answer to the motion to dismiss.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span><span style="">an </span><span style="">order dated January </span>12, 1<span style="">962,
the lower court dismissed the com</span>p<span style="">laint
as far defendants-movants were concerned, which order is quoted as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"After due consideration of the motion to dismiss, together
with supporting annexes, filed on November 2, 1961, by the defendants spouses <span style="">Raquel </span><span style="">Salamanca and Carlos Salamanca, Angela Concepcion and Honorato </span>C.
Perez, and the Motion to <span style="">Dismiss of</span>
defendant <span style="">Philippi</span>n<span style="">e National Bank, filed on Nov</span>emb<span style="">e</span>r <span style="">2, </span>1<span style="">961</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> which were set for hearing on November 7,
1961 by</span><span style="">
the mo</span><span style="">vants, </span><span style="">the plaintiff's answers thereto and the bank</span>'<span style="">s reply filed on November 27, 1961, the court
is of the opinion and so holds that the said motions are well taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, </span><span style="">th</span>e<span style=""> complaint</span><span style=""> with </span><span style="">respect to the said movants</span><span style="">
is</span><span style=""> hereby dismissed </span>without
<span style="">costs."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On January 29, 1962,
plaintiff filed </span><span style="">a motion</span><span style=""> for
reconsideration of the order of dismissal, dated January 12, </span>1<span style="">962, insofar as the </span><span style="">spouses Raquel</span> C. <span style="">Salamanca and Carlos Salama</span>n<span style="">ca </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">Angela Concepcion and
Honorato Perez are </span><span style="">concern</span><span style="">e</span><span style="">d.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On February 12, 1962, after defendants' opposi­tion to the motion
for reconsideration was filed, the lower court issued an order denying the
motion for <span style="">re­consideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the two above-mentioned orders of the lower
court, dated January 12, 1962 <span style="">and
February </span>12, 1962, plaintiff interposed the present <span style="">appeal </span>before this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The only question for
this Court to <span style="">decide in</span> the
present appeal is whether, or not, the lower court had correctly dismissed the
complaint with <span style="">respect to the
defendants-appellees, Raquel Salamanca, Carlos Sala­manca, Angela </span>Concepcion,
and Honorato C. Perez.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the lower court committed no error when it issued
the orders appealed from.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that on February <span style="">20, 1958 here­in plaintiff-appellant filed a complaint in Civil Case No. </span>2773
in the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, entitled "Belen Cruz,
plaintiff, vs. Luis M. Simon Domingo Mossesgeld, the spouses Raquel Salamanca
and <span style="">Carlos </span>Salamanca, and the
Philippine National Bank, de­fendants." Answer was duly filed by the
defendants, the spouses Salamanca, in that case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 10, 1961 the Court of First
Instance of Nueva Ecija <span style="">dismissed the
case </span>"for failure of the parties to prosecute the case."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The order of dismissal did not make any statement as to whether the dismissal
was with or with­out prejudice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, on September 14, 1961, <span style="">in denying </span>the motion to reconsider the order of dismissal the
court stated "that for over three years since the <span style="">case was </span>filed on February 20, 1958 the plaintiff never <span style="">caused </span>the service of the summons and
the copy of the complaint on the other defendants, the said petition <span style="">is </span>hereby
denied."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The order of <span style="">dismissal became final.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the <span style="">complaint
in </span>the case at bar <span style="">(Civil </span>Case
No. 3738) is substantially the same <span style="">as </span>the <span style="">complaint </span>filed in the prior case (Civil Case No. 2772).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The subject matter is the <span style="">same - </span>Lots
Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4, <span style="">in </span>question;
the cause of action is the same; the party plaintiff is the same; and the
parties defendants <span style="">named in the prior
case are included in the case at </span><span style="">bar, </span><span style="">with
the addition of defendants Angela Concepcion </span>and Honorato Perez who are
alleged to have acquired <span style="">rig</span>h<span style="">t</span>s<span style="">
</span>over Lots Nos. 1 and 2 in question from the defendant Raquel Salamanca
on August 16, 1961 or after the <span style="">dismissal
</span>of the first case on February 10, 1961.</p>

<p class="BODY">The dismissal of Civil Case No. 27773 – the prior <span style="">case - </span>without any reservation by the
court of plaintiff's right to file the complaint anew was a <span style="">dismissal "with prejudice", or a</span>
<span style="">dismissal that had the effect of
adjudication upon the merits, in accordance with Section 3, Rule 30 of </span><span style="">the old Rules</span><span style=""> of Court </span>(now Section<span style="">
3, Rule 17 of the Revised Rules of Court), which provides as</span> <span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"When plaintiff <u><span style="">fails</span></u><span style=""> </span>to appear at the time of the trial,
or <u>to pro</u><u><span style="">secute his action
for an unreasonable length of time</span></u><span style="">, or to comply with the rules or any order of the court, the </span>action
may be dismissed upon motion of the defendant or upon the <span style="">court's </span>own <span style="">motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>This dismissal shall
have the </u></span><u>effect of <span style="">an
adjudication upon </span>the merits, unless otherwise provided by </u><u><span style="">the court</span></u><span style="">." (Underscoring supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We </span><span style="">believe </span><span style="">that the lower court correctly dismissed the
complaint, insofar as herein defendants-appellees, Raquel Salamanca, Carlos
Salamanca, Angela Concepcion and Honorato Perez are concerned, based upon the
ground that the </span><span style="">cause of ac</span><span style="">tion is barred by a prior judgment, as urged
below by said defendants-appellees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The elements of <u>res</u>
<u>adjudicata</u> are here present to bolster the case for the
defendants-appellees:</p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>(a) There is a final
judgment or order in the prior case - Civil Case No. 2773;</p>

<p class="NUM">(b) The court that rendered the judgment or order <span style="">in </span>the prior case had jurisdiction
over the subject matter, and over the parties concerned in the present
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The<span style=""> </span>contention of plaintiff-appellant that in the prior case the
defendants Luis M. Simon Domingo Mossesgeld and the Philippine National Bank
had not been <span style="">served </span>with summons<span style=""> </span>and so the court did not acquire <span style="">jurisdiction </span>over them - and this was
precisely the <span style="">reason why </span>the
case was dismissed for failure <span style="">to
prosecute - is of </span>no <span style="">moment, </span>because,
at any rate, the <span style="">order of dismissal of
the complaint in Civil Case No. 3738, subject of the present appeal, is
"with </span><span style="">respect to the </span><span style="">said movants", and herein defendants-appellees
</span><span style="">Raquel </span><span style="">Salamanca, Carlos Salamanca, Angela
Concepcion and Honorato Perez are the very movants in the court below;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">(c) There was judgment or order on the merits <span style="">in </span>the <span style="">prior case;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">(d) There is, <span style="">as </span>between the prior case and the case now at bar, identity of
parties, identity of subject matter, and identity of cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that Angela Concepcion and Honorato <span style="">Perez </span>were
added as parties defendants in the case at bar is of no moment because they
have simply stepped into the shoes, so to say, of defendant Raquel <span style="">Salamanca, </span>as
regards Lots Nos. 1 and 2 in question, after the judgment in the first
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, those two
additional de­fendants simply derived rights which had already accrued <span style="">in favor </span>of
defendant Raquel Salamanca after the judg­ment in the first case had become
final, and whatever was the defense of Raquel <span style="">Salamanca in the first </span>case is <span style="">also the </span>defense of Raquel Salamanca and these <span style="">two addi­</span><span style="">tional defendants
in </span><span style="">the present </span><span style="">case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the orders of the lower court <span style="">appealed </span><span style="">from - namely, </span><span style="">the order dated January 12, 1962 dis­</span><span style="">missing </span>the
complaint, and <span style="">the order dated February
12, </span><span style="">1962
denying </span><span style="">the motion for
reconsideration of the order of dismissal - are affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against the plaintiff-appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
