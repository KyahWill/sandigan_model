				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Under date of <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="8">August 7,
 1965</st1:date>, Susana <span class="SpellE">Rendora</span> filed below a
petition for authority to change the <u>surname</u> of her minor children known
<span style="">as </span>Cesar
<span style="">UN, </span><st1:place><st1:city>Norberto</st1:city>
 <st1:state>ON</st1:state></st1:place> and <st1:place><st1:city><span class="SpellE">Ursulina</span></st1:city> <st1:state>ON</st1:state></st1:place>,
to TIU - the surname of <span class="GramE">their</span> father.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the lower court issued an order setting the hearing
of the petition on <st1:date year="1965" day="21" month="9">September <span style="">21, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>the same
having been published in accordance with <span style="">law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
through the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City, filed an
opposition to the petition on the following grounds:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That considering the proximity of the date
set for the hearing of the petition, the court will not have acquired
jurisdiction over the <span style="">case </span>on that day, invoking in support of this ground, the
provisions of Section 3, Rule 104 of the Rules of Court;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And that the newspaper in which the order of
the court was to be published was not of a general circulation.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The evidence shows that Cesar UN, Norberto ON and <span class="SpellE">Ursulina</span> ON are the children of petitioner Susana <span class="SpellE">Rendora</span> with TIU HONG, a Chinese citizen; that TIU HONG and
said children were registered with the Bureau of Immigration; <span style="">that </span>the surnames ON and UN carried by
the children are the same; <span style="">that TIU
HONG </span>is commonly known in the Chinese <span style="">community of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> </span>City as YUTIAN ON;
that petitioner learned of the error in recording the surname of her children
only when they started going to school.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the above evidence,
the lower court </span><span style="">subsequently </span><span style="">rendered the
following very uninformative decision:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"This is a petition for a change of name of Cesar <span class="GramE">Un</span> <span style="">to </span>CESAR
TIU, Norberto On to NORBERTO TIU and <span class="SpellE">Ursulina</span> On to
URSULINA TIU filed by the natural guardian, Susana <span class="SpellE">Rendora</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After the necessary publication in the "MORNING TIMES",
no opposition has been filed <span style="">either by </span>the
City Attorney <span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City or by the Solicitor General of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
although both of them were furnished a copy of the petition <span style="">as </span>early as
<st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>City <span style="">Fiscal </span>Ramon O. de <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Veyra</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> appeared for the
Solicitor General to cross examine the witness presented by the petitioner.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It appears from the evidence presented that Cesar <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span>, Norberto <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ursulina</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> as well as their
natural guardian, Susana <span class="SpellE">Rendora</span>, have been permanent
residents of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City for more than three (3) years
prior to the filing of this petition; that Susana <span class="SpellE">Rendora</span>
is the natural mother of Cesar <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span>, Norberto <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ursulina</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>This petition was made for the purpose of giving the minors the
true family name of the father because the surnames <span class="GramE">Un</span>
and On presently carried by said minors in their Alien <span style="">Certi</span>ficate of <span style="">Registration
</span>is <span style="">a </span>community
surname by which their father is known.</blockquote>

<blockquote>No creditors appear to be prejudiced by the change of name of Cesar
<span class="GramE">Un</span> to CESAR TIU, Norberto On to NORBERTO TIU and <span class="SpellE">Ursulina</span> On to URSULINA TIU.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Let copies of this decision <span class="GramE">be</span> furnished
the Local Civil Registrar of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City.</blockquote>

<blockquote>City Attorney Ramon O. de <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span> and
Attorney <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Derecho</span>
are notified of this decision in open court.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="">SO
ORDERED."</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The State appealed and prays for the reversal of the above
decision and for the dismissal of the petition, claiming that the lower court
had not acquired jurisdiction to hear the petition and that petitioners had
failed to prove a proper and reasonable cause to justify the change of their
respective surnames.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record discloses that the birth certificate of Cesar UN gives
his name as Cesar ON HIA TIAN and that of his father as ON HIA TIAN (Exhibit
"H"); that the birth certificate of Norberto UN records his name <span style="">as </span>Norberto
TIAN and that of his father as ON HIO TIAN (Exhibit "J"), while the
birth certificate of <span class="SpellE">Ursulina</span> ON records the name of
her father as YUTIAN UN (Exhibit "I").</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be borne in mind in this connection that, for legal
purposes, the true name of a person is that given him in the Civil Register,
and that for the purpose of a petition such as the one filed by petitioners,
what <span style="">is </span>or
may be changed is their true or official name as recorded in the Civil
Register.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the publication
required by law, must give that true or official name of the petitioners to
enable the State to undertake the proper investigation regarding the truth of
the allegations made in their petition (Jesus Ng etc. vs. Republic, G.R. No.
L-20306, <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1966</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the order published in connection with the
present proceeding did not give the true or correct surnames of the
petitioners, said publication was rendered ineffective in law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Testifying in support of the petition, Susana <span class="SpellE">Rendora</span>,
mother of the minors whose surnames are sought to be changed, testified that
she wants them "to bear the family name of TIU" but then proceeded to
answer the question of what was the family name of her husband by saying that
it was TIU HONG.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the alien
certificate of her husband shows that he was also known under an alias, to wit,
TIU SONG PIN.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, while Susana <span class="SpellE">Rendora</span> claims to be married to TIU HONG, no marriage
contract was presented as part of the evidence, nor did her husband
testify.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither was evidence presented
that TIU HONG was authorized <span style="">to </span>use
the alias TIU SONG PIN, or that he is the same person <span style="">as </span>the one whose name was given in the birth certificates of
their children as YUTIAN UN, ON HIO TIAN and ON HIA TIAN.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion and so hold, that the
evidence of record is utterly insufficient to support the decision appealed
from.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">WHEREFORE</b><span style="">, th</span><span style="">e </span><span style="">decision appealed from is reversed and the petition filed below </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">hereby dismissed, </span><span style="">without </span><span style="">prejudice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
