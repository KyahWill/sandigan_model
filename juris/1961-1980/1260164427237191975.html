				G.R. No. L-17377, April 29, 1961</h4>
				<H3>FRANCISCO LAGUNILLA, PETITIONER, VS. HON. JUAN O. REYES, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE, SAN FERNANDO, LA UNION, THE PROVINCIAL FISCAL OF LA UNION AND FERMIN MOTAS, RESPONDENTS.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Upon complaint of one Fermin Motas, petitioner Francisco Lagunilla was 
charged before the Justice of the Peace Court of Bangar, La Union, with the 
crime of slight physical injuries and, after trial, convicted of the crime 
charged and ordered to pay a fine P20.00. Lagunilla appealed to the Court of 
First Instance of La Union, where the provincial fiscal filed the corresponding 
information on February 16, 1960 (Criminal Case No. 2925). The case was set for 
trial on July 7, 1960, and at the hearing on said date, the accused entered a 
plea of not guilty. After the plea, the case was called for trial, but the 
assistant provincial fiscal moved for postponement on the ground that the 
complainant Fermin Motas and his witnesses were not present although according 
to the fiscal himself, "* * * complainant appeared in his office yesterday (July 
6, 1960) and informed him (sic) of the trial of this case that is set for this 
morning" (Order of July 7, 1960, Annex "B", Petition). Whereupon, the accused 
moved for the dismissal of the case, but the Court waited until 10:30 for the 
complainant and his witnesses to appear. When they still failed to show up, the 
Court promulgated the following order dismissing the case:
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"ORDER"</p>
<p align="center">(Information, Filed February 16, 1960; Hearing, July 7, 1960; 
Case Dismissed July 7, 1960.) (sic)</p>
<p>When this case was called for the arraignment of the accused and trial of the 
case, the accused appeared with hia counsel. Upon arraignment, he entered a plea 
of not guilty. The Fiscal in charge moved for the postponement of the hearing on 
the ground that neither the complainant nor his witnesses are now present 
although according to the Fiscal the complainant appeared in his office 
yesterday and informed him of the trial of this case that is set for this 
morning.</p>
<p>In view of the apparent lack of interest on the part of the complainant to 
further prosecute this ease as shown by his failure to appear today (the Court 
waited until 10:30 a.m.), on motion of the defense this case is hereby dismissed 
with costs <i>de oficio</i>. The bail bond filed for the provisional liberty of 
the accused is declared cancelled and whatever papers submitted to support said 
bail bond may be returned to the respective owners or to the counsel of the 
accused.</p>
<p>IT IS SO ORDERED."</p>
<p align="center">(Annex B, Petition)</p></blockquote>
<p>On July 11, 1960, the assistant provincial fiscal filed a motion to 
reconsider the above order on the ground that his witnesses were not present at 
the trial because complainant Fermin Motas "had not been duly served with 
subpoena", that while it is true that one day before the trial, the Chief of 
Police accompanied said Fermin Motas to his (the fiscal's) office because of a 
previous subpoena issued to him, "perhaps the said complaining witness and his 
witness may have thought that the hearing of the said case was on that day"; and 
that it was not true that complainant lacked interest ta the prosecution, of the 
case and that if the order of dismissal was reconsidered, complainant and his 
witnesses would be present at the hearing (Annex "C", Petition). Accused 
Lagunilla opposed the motion for reconsideration, insisting that the fiscal 
himself had informed the court that complainant Motas knew of the date of the 
hearing, and that anyway, the dismissal was equivalent to an acquittal and 
reconsideration of the same would place him . twice in jeopardy for the sanje 
offense. In spite of the opposition, however, the trial court, on July 26, 1960, 
reconsidered its previous order, setting the same aside, and ordered that the 
case be set for trial on August 22, 1960. Unable to obtain reconsideration of 
this second order, accused Lagunilla interposed this petition for certiorari 
with prohibition.</p>
<p>We find the petition well-taken.</p>
<p>In the case of Gandicela <i>vs</i>. Hon. Lutero, 88 Phil., 299, we held that 
if the prosecution asks for the postponement of the hearing and the court 
believes that the hearing cannot be postponed without violating the right of the 
accused to a speedy trial, the court should deny the postponement and proceed 
with the trial, and if the fiscal fails to prove thÂ£ defendant's guilt beyond a 
reasonable doubt, the court, upon the motion of the defendant, should dismiss 
the case; and that this dismissal is not in reality a dismissal in the general 
sense but an acquittal based on the failure of the prosecution to prove the 
defendant's guilt, which bars another prosecution for the same offense.</p>
<p>Later, in the case of People <i>vs</i>. Diaz, 94 Phil., 714, wherein the 
prosecution was not even present at the trial, we reiterated the Gandicela 
ruling, pointing out that there was more reason to dismiss the case upon the 
instance of the accused because the prosecution was not even: present on the day 
of the trial so as to be in a position to proceed with the presentation of 
evidence to prove the guilt of the accused, and that said dismissal should 
likewise be regarded ag an acquittal.</p>
<p>Still later, in People <i>vs</i>. Tacneng, L-12082, April 30, 1959, wherein 
the prosecution, after asking for several postponements, confessed to the court 
that it was not ready for trial because none of its witnesses had appeared, and 
the accused, invoking his constitutional right to a speedy trial, asked for 
dismissal, and the court dismissed the case, we also ruled that such dismissal 
amounted to an acquittal.</p>
<p>Finally, in the case of People <i>vs</i>. Robles, 105 Phil., 1016, wherein 
the court ordered dismissal of the case upon the motion of the accused because 
the prosecution was still not prepared for trial after several postponements, we 
again held that the dismissal was tantamount to an acquittal that would bar 
further prosecution of the accused for the same offense.</p>
<p>In the case now before us, the lower court ordered the dismissal of the 
criminal case against petitioner because of the apparent lack of interest of the 
complainant to prosecute the case. Such dismissal, made unconditionally and 
without reservation, after plea of not guilty, and apparently predicated on the 
constitutional right of the accused to a speedy trial, is, following the 
above-cited authorities, equivalent to an acquittal. And being an order of 
acquittal, it became final immediately after promulgation and could no longer be 
recalled for correction or reconsideration (People <i>vs</i>. Sison, L-11669, 
January 30, 1959; Catilo <i>vs</i>. Abaya, 94 Phil., 1014; 50 Off. Gaz., [6] 
2477; People <i>vs</i>. Yelo, 83 Phil., 618; 46 Off. Gaz., [11th Supp.] 71), 
with or without good reason.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order of the court below of July 26, 1960 is set aside and the 
order of dismissal of July 7, 1960 reinstated, with costs <i>de 
oficio</i>.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, 
Paredes,</i> and <i>Dizon, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
