<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Salaveria</span>,
Police Sergeant of the <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> Police Force,
testified that at around 10:00 o'clock in the morning of October 8, 1966, he
was ordered by the Acting Chief of Police, <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span>
Gonzales, to take the <i><span style="">ante mortem</span></i><span style=""> </span>statement of one Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span>, who had been stabbed and was then at the North
General Clinic at <span class="SpellE">Torno</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon arrival at the aforesaid clinic, he found Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span> in critical condition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then took the <i><span style="">ante mortem</span></i><span style=""> </span>statement
of Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span> (Exhibits "A",
"A-1" and "A-2') by writing in longhand the questions and
answers of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was done in
the presence of several persons, including Jose <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span>,
brother of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards,
Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span> affixed his left and right <span class="SpellE">thumbmarks</span> on the <i>ante mortem</i> statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He affirmed that all the answers therein were
given by Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P.G. Sales, a nurse at the clinic signed the
statement as a witness to its execution (Exhibit "A-8").</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Salaveria</span> further testified that while
taking the victim's statement, he called up the Chief of Police and requested
him to bring the accused to the clinic for identification by the victim; that
at that time <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Lanza</span>
was already being detained at the municipal jail of <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span>
as a suspect in the stabbing; that when appellant was brought <span class="SpellE">infront</span> of the victim, the latter identified him as the
very same person who stabbed him.</p>

<p class="BODY">On cross examination, this witness stated that when he arrived at
the clinic, the victim was still alive and lying in bed, with his eyes closed;
that he called the victim by name, identified himself and when the latter
agreed, he took the statement in the presence of several relatives of the
victim.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Basilia</span> Luna <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span>, widow of the victim, testified for the
prosecution, stating that in the morning of <st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1966</st1:date>, while she was in her house, she was
informed by her brother-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span>, that her husband was at the North General
Clinic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she went to the clinic, she
found her husband lying on the bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was feverish and his clothes were bloody and he had a wound on the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She likewise identified the shirt won by her
husband on the night of the incident, showing the hole (Exhibit “C”) allegedly
caused by the stab wound.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jose <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span>, brother of the deceased,
corroborated policeman <span class="SpellE">Salaveria's</span> testimony, stating
that he stayed in the North General Clinic until the following day and was
present when Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Salaveria</span> took the <i>ante mortem</i>
statement of his brother; that while the statement was being taken, he was
about one-half meter from Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Salaveria</span> and Leonardo
<span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span>; that when asked who stabbed him, Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span> pointed to <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Lanza</span>, who was present; that at that time, the condition of
his brother was "not so serious"; that the <i>ante mortem</i>
statement was taken at around 10:00 o'clock in the morning of October 8, 1966,
and his brother died on October 9, 1966, at about 3:00 o'clock in the
afternoon.</p>

<p class="BODY">When asked whether his brother was asked each of the questions
appearing on the <i>ante mortem</i> statement and whether his brother answered
the same, this witness replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p class="BODY">On cross examination, he stated that his brother could not talk
from 1:00 o'clock dawn until he was given dextrose that morning; that at around
9:00 o'clock his brother could already talk a little; and that when their
sister, Elma <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span>, inquired as to who was
responsible for his wound, he answered that it was a man who had followed him
from the municipal building.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Jose Noriega, the surgeon who attended to the victim,
testified that the latter was in a state of shock when admitted to the hospital
at about 1:40 a.m. on October 8, 1966; that the victim was able to say that he
was stabbed and to indicate the painful part of his body, but thereafter he
remained incoherent until his condition was gradually improved by blood
transfusion and the administration of medical remedies; that his blood pressure
was revived and returned to normal only at about 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon
of the same day; that because of such improvement he was immediately operated
upon; that in the course of the four-hour operation, it was found that there
were fatal injuries on the left kidney and fatal injuries on the great vessels
of the mesentery; that the victim died twenty four hours after surgery due to
secondary hemorrhage or cerebral embolism; and that he issued a certificate as
to the cause of death of Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> D. Gonzales, Acting Chief of
Police of <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span>, confirmed the fact that although
appellant denied having stabbed Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span>, he
nevertheless admitted to him that he followed the victim along <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue</st1:address></st1:street> when his wife
complained to him that the victim had stepped on her while she was lying on the
floor of the municipal building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant,
however, explained that he was not able to overtake the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">He further testified that shortly before <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1966</st1:date>, Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Salaveria</span>
informed him by telephone that the victim was conscious and could talk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, he brought the accused to the
clinic for identification by the victim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When they arrived in the hospital there were several civilians.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also saw Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Salaveria</span>,
Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Calibo</span> and Pat. <span class="SpellE">Limbaga</span>
in the premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared that the
victim recognized him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he asked the
victim whether he could identify his assailant, the latter answered in the
affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then brought the appellant
inside the room, and in the presence of all the people present the victim pointed
to the appellant as the person who had stabbed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This witness likewise confirmed that Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Salaveria</span> asked the questions and the victim, Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span>, gave the answers appearing in the <i>ante mortem</i>
statement, and that they <span style="">both </span>spoke
in <span class="SpellE">Cebuano</span>, which was translated into the English
language by Cpl. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Salaveria</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Further,
he attested to the fact that the <span class="SpellE">thumbmarks</span> appearing
on the statement were those of Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span>, and
that he was present when the same were affixed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Vicente <span class="SpellE">Limbaga</span>, formerly municipal
policeman of <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
del Norte, testified that he served in such capacity up to October 21, 1967;
that at about 1:30 in the early morning of October 9, 1966, Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span> arrived at the municipal building where he was
detailed as guard and reported to him about the disappearance of his (Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span>') car; that after making such report, Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span> went down to the ground floor of the municipal
building; that not long after, he heard a commotion and immediately went
downstairs and found many people lying on the floor of the municipal building
because it was the town fiesta of <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span>; that when
he inquired what was the cause of the commotion one Luisa, the wife of <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Lanza</span>, told him that a
certain short and stocky man passed by and stepped on her foot while she was
lying on the floor, and he tried to hold her shoulder and <span class="SpellE">signalled</span>
her to go to a room with him and thus caused the commotion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he asked her why she did not report the
matter to him so the person could be investigated, she answered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Well, anyway, all would be known later
because my husband followed him.” Not long after, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lanza</span> returned and he observed that <span class="SpellE">Lanza</span> appeared restless, kept moving from one place to
another, continued whispering something to his wife, could not sleep and repeatedly
went to the comfort room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, he
received a report that Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span> had been
stabbed near the Shell gasoline station.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Suspecting that <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Lanza</span>
had something to do with the stabbing, he took <span class="SpellE">Lanza</span>
into his office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He recorded the
incident in the police blotter and conducted an investigation of the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused was again
investigated by the Acting Chief of Police.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense presented in evidence the testimonies of Pat. <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Maginsay</span> and accused <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Lanza</span>, as well as various
documentary evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pat. <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Maginsay</span>
of the <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> Police Force testified that since
February 1966, he has been the custodian of the police blotter of the <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> Police Force; that he was the one who recorded the
entries in the police blotter for October 8, 1966; that said entries were made
from the records of the night blotter, which was in the care of the building
guard; and that therefore, the entries in the night blotter and of the police
blotter are the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Lanza</span>
alleged that on the night in question he was sleeping, together with his
family, inside the municipal building of <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span>, his
livelihood being that of a "<span class="SpellE">feriante</span>" and
he was there to maintain the shooting gallery and some gambling devices inside
the plaza where the "<span class="SpellE">feria</span>" was being held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared that after midnight, he was
awakened by two policemen and brought to the office of the Chief of Police
where he was asked whether he had gone out of the building or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he replied that he had not, he was
brought and confined inside the municipal jail.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later the following morning he was investigated by the police sergeant
after which he was brought to the hospital by the Chief of Police and one Pat. <span class="SpellE">Centino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
taken inside the operating room, presented before a wounded man for
identification, but the latter, whose eyes were closed, could not identify
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After staying inside the operating
room for half an hour, he was returned to the municipal building.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his brief, appellant stated that the alleged <i><span style="">ante mortem</span></i><span style=""> </span>statement could not have been given by the victim as he was not
in a position at the time of the alleged confrontation either to talk to the
investigators or to identify his alleged assailant, and assuming that the <i><span style="">ante mortem</span></i><span style=""> </span>statement is genuine, the same is inadmissible as evidence of a
dying declaration because at the time of its execution, the victim had
expectations or hopes of recovery.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant makes capital of the testimony of Dr. Jose Noriega that from
8:00 o'clock in the morning to 12:00 noon of October 8, 1966, the victim was
still bleeding and in a state of shock; the declaration of the widow, <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span> Luna <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span>, that her husband could not talk to her while he
was on the hospital bed; and the statement of Jose <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span>
that upon seeing his brother he called his name but the latter did not answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">These arguments are not supported by the record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant cited portions of
testimonies out of context of the entire declarations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, while Dr. Jose Noriega admitted that
the witness was “semi-conscious” at the time of his admission, he was positive
that the victim was able to tell him that he was stabbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He even complained of pain on the
abdomen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise stated that the
condition of the victim improved to such a degree that he was strong enough
after the blood transfusion to be operated on at around noontime of the same
day.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
As testified to by the other witness, he was able to talk by mid-morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, his brother, Jose <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span>,
testified that he was able to talk intelligently some hours before the
operation, although in the beginning he could not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified on cross examination as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Up
to <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 o'clock</st1:time> of the same day,
October 8, the same condition -- could not still talk?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A. <span style=""> </span>He could talk already but not yet clear.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q. <span style=""> </span>Do you mean to say he will just murmur?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A. <span style=""> </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">* * *<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*
* *<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* * *<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q. <span style=""> </span>At. <st1:time minute="30" hour="9">9:30 o'clock</st1:time>,
<st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1966</st1:date>, what
happened right in the bedroom of the deceased?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A. <span style=""> </span>Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span> was
still lying in bed but could talk.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q. <span style=""> </span>Do you mean to say he could just talk by him
self, nobody asking?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A. <span style=""> </span>No, after he was asked.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q. <span style=""> </span>How do you know that at <st1:time minute="30" hour="9">9:30 o'clock</st1:time>, <st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="10">October
 8, 1966</st1:date>, he talked?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A. <span style=""> </span>Because we asked him some questions,</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q. <span style=""> </span>Who asked the deceased some questions?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A. <span style=""> </span>My sister, Elma <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q. <span style=""> </span>What was the statement (<i style="">sic</i>) asked?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A. <span style=""> </span>My sister inquired as to who was the person
responsible for his wound.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q. <span style=""> </span>What was his answer?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A. <span style=""> </span>He answered that (it was) the man following him
from the municipal building.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q. <span style=""> </span>There was no name mentioned?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A. <span style=""> </span>No name mentioned.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q. <span style=""> </span>And that was in a harsh voice?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a natural voice."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, the testimony of the widow, <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span>
Luna <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span> to the
effect that her husband did not talk to her on <st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1966</st1:date>, does not necessarily preclude the
possibility that at some other time that day the deceased was able to reveal to
the police investigators the identity of his assailant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, this witness stated on cross
examination that on <st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1966</st1:date>,
her husband could talk to other persons.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, it will be recalled that when the <i><span style="">ante mortem</span></i> statement was taken by
Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Salaveria</span>, there were several persons present,
including relatives of the victim, as well as the Acting Chief of Police who
brought appellant from the jail to the bedside of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These police officers positively declared
that they were present when the victim pointed to appellant as his
assailant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No possible motive has been
advanced why these witnesses should falsely incriminate the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next question that arises centers on the admissibility of the
<i><span style="">ante mortem</span></i> statement as
a dying declaration so as to constitute an exception to the hearsay rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An <i><span style="">ante
mortem</span></i> statement is a declaration made by a victim of a homicide
while about to die, and without any hope of recovery, concerning the facts and
circumstances under which the fatal injury was inflicted, and offered in
evidence at the trial of the person charged with having caused the death of the
<span class="SpellE">declarant</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In order that a dying declaration may be admissible in evidence,
four (4) requisites must concur, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) it must concern the crime and the surrounding circumstances of the <span class="SpellE">declarant's</span> death; (2) at the time it was made, the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span> was under a consciousness of an impending death;
(3) the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span> was competent as a witness at the
time the same was executed; and (4) the declaration is offered in a criminal
case for homicide, murder or parricide in which the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span>
was the victim.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is imperative, for a dying declaration to be admissible, that
the same had been made under a consciousness of impending death.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
This is so because dying declarations, made when the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span>
had no more hope of recovery, are admissible by reason of necessity and
trustworthiness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessity because the <span class="SpellE">declarant's</span> death renders impossible his taking the witness
stand, and it often happens that there is no other satisfactory evidence as to
the cause of his death; and trustworthiness because the declaration is made in
extremity and every motive of falsehood is silenced, and the mind is induced by
the most powerful considerations to speak the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A situation so solemn and so awful as
to be considered by the law as creating an obligation equal to that which is
imposed by a positive oath in a court of justice."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that death of the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span>
did indeed occur shortly after the declaration was made is not sufficient to
render the declaration admissible, absent the requisite proof that the victim
was under the consciousness of impending death at the time the declaration was
made, and he had no more hope of recovery.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A belief in the mind of the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span>, at the
time the declarations are made, that death is near is indispensable to the
admission of such statements as dying declarations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the text of the declaration shows that
the deceased himself was in doubt as to whether he would die or not, the dying
declaration is not admissible.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the victim, when asked whether he believed
he was going to die as a result of his injuries, replied:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It all depends." Also, it appears
from the records that his condition had progressively improved from the time he
was admitted to the time the statement was taken by the police so much so that
a short time thereafter he was considered strong enough to undergo an
operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances, it
can be concluded that the deceased was, himself, hesitant to accept the fact of
his impending death and entertained hopes of recovery, obviously depending on
the result of the scheduled operation and further medical treatment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding the fact, however, that the victim's statement
may not be admitted as a dying declaration, it is nevertheless admissible as
part of the <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">gestae</span></i>
against herein appellant in <i>People v. <span class="SpellE">Tumalip</span></i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court held that the positive identification of the accused by the victim,
made a few hours after he had been shot and while suffering from the agonies of
his injuries, although not an <i>ante mortem</i><span style=""> </span>declaration, may, however, be considered as part of the <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">gestae</span></i>, for it
was made almost immediately after the startling occurrence.</p>

<blockquote>"It is well-settled that as an exception to the hearsay rule,
such evidence must comply with these requisites, an occurrence both startling
and unusual in character and an utterance made before the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span>
could have any opportunity for falsification or distortion, one moreover
limited to such event as the immediate attending circumstances."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Briefly stated, the spontaneous declaration must have been made
while the nervous excitement caused by the startling occurrence was still working
on the <span class="SpellE">declarant's</span> mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This may be a short time after the incident
or some hours later, as long as the influence of the startling occurrence still
persists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is important is that the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span> must have had no opportunity to devise or
contrive anything contrary to the real facts that occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the law distrusts is not <span class="SpellE">afterspeech</span> but afterthought.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

particular case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The acts or
declarations are not required to be contemporaneous with the primary fact, but
they must be so connected with it as to make the act or declaration and the
main fact practically inseparable, or be generated by an excited feeling which
extends, without break or letdown, from the moment of the event they
illustrate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, if the acts
or declarations sprang out of the principal transaction, tend to explain it,
were voluntary and spontaneous, and were made at a time so near it as to
preclude the idea of deliberate design, they may be regarded as contemporaneous
in point of time, and are admissible."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The clement of time is, therefore, not
controlling, but merely of importance, on the question of spontaneity.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The general rule is that where declarations are unconsciously associated
with and related to the homicidal deed even though separated from it by a short
time, they are evidence of the character of <span style="">the deed and a part of the </span><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">res</span></i></span><i><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">gestae</span></span></i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No </span><span style="">inflexible rule as to the length of the

killed can be formulated; in such matter, the facts of each case stand alone
and must speak for themselves.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">From the circumstances of the case, the victim could not have had
time to concoct or devise a story different from what actually transpired, and
his narration, at the first opportunity, of the incident and his identification
of his assailant must be considered as part of the startling occurrence, the
influence of which was still working on his mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it is significant that the victim
did not name a specific person, as his assailant was a person not familiar to
him, but merely described him as the one who followed him from the municipal
building after an altercation which arose when he (victim) accidentally stepped
on appellant's wife while she lay on the floor of the municipal building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant has failed to advance any reason or
motive why the victim, who did not know him prior to the incident, would
identify him as the perpetrator of the offense if this were not true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be recalled that there were many
persons sleeping in the municipal building and yet he was singled out by the
police, as a consequence of the series of events that transpired, starting from
the commotion that ensued when the victim accidentally stepped on appellant's
wife and appellant's suspicious actuations after he returned to the municipal
building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was shortly after
appellant's return that the police received information of the stabbing of the
victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court found that the crime was committed with the
qualifying circumstance of treachery and the aggravating circumstance of
evident premeditation, offset by the mitigating circumstance of passion and
obfuscation, hence it imposed upon the <span style="">herein
appellant the penalty of <i>reclusion</i></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><i>perpetua</i></span>, </span><span style="">among others.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We find no proof that evident premeditation and treachery accompanied
the commission of the crime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Evident premeditation could not have existed because immediately
after the commotion caused by the accidental stepping on his wife, the
appellant followed the victim and stabbed him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the trial court observed, the Shell gasoline station where the victim
was stabbed was "not far from the municipal building",<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
and, in the few minutes it took to follow and overtake the victim, the
appellant could not have had sufficient opportunity to meditate upon and
determine the killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is settled
that where a previous incident preceded the assault, evident premeditation is
not present,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
and that in the absence of reflection and persistence of criminal intent, said
circumstance cannot be appreciated.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, treachery cannot be appreciated against the herein accused
because there is no showing whatsoever that the mode of attack employed by him
was calculated to insure the commission of the crime without risk to himself,
arising from any defense that the victim may put up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, the mode of attack is
not known at all, there being no eyewitness to the stabbing incident.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Treachery must be shown by convincing evidence,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
and the same degree of proof to dispel reasonable doubt is required before any
conclusion may be reached respecting its attendance, whether as a qualifying or
an aggravating circumstance, in a criminal case.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, consistent with the finding that the killing was not premeditated,
there can be no treachery in the instant case because the decision to attack
was arrived at on the spur of the moment.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, the factual circumstances obtaining in the case
indicate that the victim knew that he was being followed from the municipal
building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, he was able to state in
the <i>ante mortem</i> statement that the person who stabbed him was the one
who had followed him from the municipal building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This being the case, and considering that he was
well aware of the previous altercation between them, the victim must have been
on his guard and aware that the appellant meant him harm.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the foregoing, We hold that due to the absence of any
qualifying circumstance, the crime committed is not murder but homicide,
defined and penalized under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code, unattended
by any aggravating or mitigating circumstance.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not convinced that passion and obfuscation should be appreciated
in favor of herein appellant so as to mitigate his criminal liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accidental stepping by the victim on
appellant's wife was insufficient cause for passion or obfuscation to so affect
appellant's reason that he commits a vicious crime as a result thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order for such mitigating circumstance to
be appreciated, it is necessary to establish the existence of an act both
unlawful and sufficient to produce such a condition of mind that the culprit is
precluded from a sober realization of the wrongfulness of the course of action about
to be taken.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>
