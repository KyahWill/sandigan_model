				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the Court of First Instance of Quezon, petitioners Gaudencio
Vera, Restitute Figueras, Lorenzo Ambas, Justo Florido, Paulino Bayran,
and 92 others, as John Does, were charged with the complex crime of
kidnapping with murder of Amadeo Lozañes, alias Azarcon. Upon
petitioners' motion, invoking the benefits of Amnesty Proclamation of
the President, series of 1946, the case was referred to the Eighth
Guerilla Amnesty Commission, which actually tried it.<p></p>
<p> During the hearing, none of the petitioners-defendants admitted
having committed the crime charged. In fact, Gaudencio Vera, the only
defendant who took the witness stand, Instead of admitting the killing
of the deceased Lozañes, categorically denied it. Hence, the
Commission, in its decision of January 12, 1956, held that it could not
take cognizance of the case, on the ground that the benefits of the
Amnesty Proclamation, could be invoked only by defendants in a criminal
case who, admitting the commission of the crime, plead that said
commission was in pursuance of the resistance movement and perpetrated
against persons who aided the enemy during the Japanese occupation.
Consequently, the Commission ordered that the case be remanded to the
court of origin for trial. A motion for reconsideration filed1 by
petitioners was denied by the Commission in its order dated January 11,
1957 , which partly reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "The Commission is convinced that the motive for
the kidnapping and killing of Lt. Amadeo Lozañes of the Hunters was the
keen rivalry, between the Vera'a Guerrilla Party and the Hunter's ROTC
Guerilla organizations. It is noteworthy that the Hunters were driven
away by General Vera from Pitogo in December, 1944, and that after said
kidnapping and killing on February 13 and 14, 1945, Mayor Ramon Isaac
of Unisan, was in turn kidnapped by the Hunters, Leopoldo Miciano,
secretary of Col. de Luna, of the Vera'a Guerrilla Party, testified
that General Vera told him of his (Vera's) suspicion that Mayor Isaac
"was kidnapped by way of reprisal as lie, Vera, had ordered the
liquidation of Lt. Losañes (dinispatcha).</p>
  <p> "In any event,
since it is an established fact that when Lozañes was kidnapped,
tortured, and later killed, he was actually a lieutenant of the
Hunter's ROTC Guerrilla organization then engaged in the resistance
movement, it may not be said with any amount of truth that the
aforesaid killing was to further the resistance movement at the time,
as the defense intimates. Rather, the killing of Lt. Losañes of the
Hunters ROTC Guerrilla would tend to weakened commensurately the
resistance movement against the Japanese invaders.</p>
  <p> "The
Commission noted, however, that nowhere in the evidence of record has
it been shown that defendant Jaime Garcia had any participation in the
complex crime charged. Neither does the evidence reveal that he
admitted or disclaimed any role therein. Consequently, there would be
no room, either for his conviction, or for the application of the
provisions of the aforementioned amnesty proclamation.</p>
  <p> "FOR
ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, this Eighth Guerrilla Amnesty
Commission denies the defendants' motion for reconsideration and
maintains its order contained in its decision, to return the case to
the Court of First Instance of Quezon for the latter to act on IL
accordingly, not only because of lack of jurisdiction, but also
because, even if it has jurisdiction, the defendants are not untitled
to the benefits of the amnesty proclamation."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> From this order of the Commission, petitioners appealed to the
Court of Appeals. The latter, on July 27, 1959 , certified, the appeal
to us, in view of the legal issue involved, namely, whether or not
persona invoking the benefit of amnesty should first admit having;
committed the crime of which they were accused. On August 13, 1959 we
ordered the docketing of the appeal m this Court (C.R. No. L-15808).
However, en petitioners' motion to return the record of the case to the
Court of Appeals (on the ground that the appeal was originally coursed
to said Court, due to "factual issues to the effect that the death of
Amadeo Lozañes did not spring from personal motive or on account of
rivalry between guerilla units, but owing to the fact that said
decedent had sided in the war efforts of the enemy, by having been a
member of the Jap-sponsored Philippine Constabulary organization, and
by having been one of those who arrested and subsequently massacred
innocent civilians and guerrillas in Catanauan, Quezon)", we ordered
the return of said record to said Court.</p>
<p> On November 16, I960, the Court of Appeals rendered a decision,
affirming the Order of the Commission, stating in part, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Appellants stressed in their aforementioned motion
for reconsideration that they had impliedly admitted their
participation in the killing of Amadeo Lozañes. But more implied
admission is not sufficient, for Administrative Older No. 144 of the
Department of Justice, dated October 11, 1950, amending Administrative
Order No. 179 thereof, and issued on November 17, 1949, explicitly
directs that "where the offense charged against any person is not one
against chastity bat is covered by the Revised Penal Code, and the
offense took place between December 8, 1941 and the date of the
liberation of the province or city where the offense is alleged to have
been committed, 'm order that the Amnesty Commission may take
cognizance of the ease, the accused or respondent must allege or claim
verbally or in writing that he committed, the acts charged against him
in furtherance of the resistance movement or against persons who aided
in the war efforts of the enemy', for amnesty presupposes the
commission of a crime.’</p>
  <p align="center"> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
  <p>
"Therefore, and since appellants did not claim verbally or in writing
that they committed the offense with which they were charged in
furtherance of the resistance movement or against persons who aided in
the war efforts of the enemy, but on the contrary, as already stated,
herein appellants had verbally denied the charge against them, their
case should be tried by the ordinary courts of justice. Hence, the 8th
Guerrilla Amnesty Commission could not take cognizance of their case.</p>
  <p>
"Appellants, however, want us to rule one way or the other, as to the
factual question that the death of Amadeo Lozañes did not spring from
personal motive or an account of rivalry of guerrilla, units, but owing
to the fact that the said decedent had aided in the war efforts of the
enemy. Without shirking from our duty to make a finding or
pronouncement on a question of fact, we are constrained not to make a
pronouncement on this question, in view of our ruling stated earlier
that the Commission is not competent to take cognizance of this case,
for the reasons already stated, but it should be the ordinary courts of
justice. Any ruling that we would make now on the factual issue
postulated by appellants would not only be premature and prejudicial,
but also useless, because this case proceeded from a body (the
Commission) that has no jurisdiction to entertain the same. It may be
stated, in this connection, that jurisdiction could be raised at any
stage of the proceedings.</p>
  <p> WHEREFORE, the decision and order appealed from are hereby affirmed.<br>
"IT IS SO ORDERED."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Their motion for reconsideration of said decision having been denied, petitioners instituted the present petition for review.</p>
<p> Petitioners contend (as they did in the Court of Appeals), that, to
be entitled to the benefits of Amnesty Proclamation No. 8, dated
September 7, 1946, it is not necessary for them to admit the commission
of the crime charged, citing in support of their submission the cases
of Barrio-quinto, et al. vs. Fernandez, et al, (L-1278, January 21,
1949, 82 Phil. 642), Provincial Fiscal of Ilocos" Norte <em>vs</em>. De Los Santos, et al, (L-2502, December 1, 1949, 85 Phil. 77) and Viray <em>vs</em>.
Amnesty Commission, et al. (L-2540, January 28, 1950, 85 Phil. 354), to
the effect that "in order to entitle a person to the benefits of
Amnesty Proclamation (No. 8) of September 7, 1946, it is not necessary
that he should, as a condition precedent or <em>sine qua non</em>,
admit having committed the criminal act or offense with which he is
charged, and allege the amnesty as a defense; it is sufficient that the
evidence, either of the complainant or the accused shows that the
offense committed comes within the terms of said Amnesty Proclamation."</p>
<p> But said cases have been superseded and deemed over-ruled by the subsequent cases of, People <em>vs</em>.
Llanita, et al. (L-2082, April 26, 1950, 86 Phil. 219) and People vs.
Guillermo, et al. (L-2188, May 19, 1950, 86 Phil. 395), wherein we held
that—</p>
<p> "It is rank inconsistency for appellant to justify an act, or seek
forgiveness for an act which, according to him, he has not committed. <em>Amnesty
presupposes the commission of a crime, and when an accused maintains
that he has not committed a crime, he cannot have any use for amnesty</em>.
Where an amnesty proclamation imposes certain conditions, as in this
case, it is incumbent upon the accused to prove the existence of such
conditions. <em>The invocation of amnesty is in the nature of a. plea
of confession and avoidance, which means that the pleader admits the
allegations against him but disclaims liability therefor on account of
intervening facts which, if proved, would bring the crime charged
within the scope of the amnesty proclamation.”</em> (Italics supplied.)</p>
<p> At any rate, the facts established before the Commission do not
bring this case within the terms of Amnesty Proclamation No. 8. Note
that said proclamation extends its provisions to "all persons who
committed any act penalized under the Revised Penal Code in furtherance
of the resistance to the enemy or against persons aiding in the war
effort of the enemy." As found by the Commission, the killing of the
deceased (Lozañes) was not in furtherance of the resistance movement,
but was due to the rivalry between the Hunter's Guerrilla, to which he
belonged, and the Vera's Guerrilla of petitioners.</p>
<p> Neither may petitioners rely on the case of Buyco <em>vs</em>.
People, et al. (L-6327, July 29, 1954) because in said case, we held
that petitioner was not entitled to the benefits of the Amnesty
Proclamation not only because "the evidence did not suffice to show
that appellant had acted in the manner contemplated in the amnesty
proclamation", namely, that he killed the deceased Luis Gonzales due to
his being an enemy collaborator, but also because if petitioner's
version was true that he had no participation whatsoever in the killing
of the deceased, then he "had committed no crime whatsoever, and,
hence, there would be no room, either for his conviction or for the
application of the provisions of the aforementioned amnesty
application", which, in effect, reiterates our previous ruling in the <em>Llanita</em> and <em>Guillermo</em> cases, <em>supra</em>, that amnesty cannot be invoked, where the accused actually denies the commission of the offense charged.</p>
<p> We find no merit in petitioners' claim that the Court of Appeals
erred in applying or citing Department of Justice Administrative Order
No. 144, series of 1950,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
considering that the latter was issued precisely pursuant to our ruling
in the aforesaid Llanita and Guillermo cases, Petitioners also argue
that the Court of Appeals erred in declining to resolve the factual
issues they had raised before it. The argument is untenable, because as
the appellate court correctly pointed out, any ruling that it would
make on the factual issues presented by petitioners, "would not only be
premature and prejudicial, but also useless, because this case
proceeded from a body (the Commission) that had no jurisdiction to
entertain the same."</p>
<p> Wherefore, finding no error in the decision of the Court of Appeals
sought to be reviewed, the same is hereby affirmed, with costs against
the petitioners. So ordered.</p>
<em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador , Concepcion , Reyes, J. B. L., Dizon, Regala </em>and <em>Makalintal, JJ.</em>, concur.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Which provides that "in
order that the Amnesty Commission may take cognizance of the case, the
accused or respondent must allege or claim verbally or in writing that
he committed the acts charged against him in furtherance or the
resistance movement or against persons who acted in the war efforts of
the enemy."
