				<H3>NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND NATIONAL TEXTILE WORKERS UNION, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REGALA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a case for review from the Court of Industrial Relations. The 
pertinent facts are the following.
<p>At the National Development Co., a government-owned and controlled 
corporation, there were four shifts of work. One shift was from 8 a.m. to 4 
p.m., while the three other shifts were from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m.; then from 2 p.m. 
to 10 p.m. and, finally, from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. In each shift, there was a 
one-hour mealtime period, to wit: from (1) 11 a.m. to 12 noon for those working 
between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. and from (2) 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. for those working 
between 2 p.m. and 10 p.m. </p>
<p>The records disclose that although there was a one-hour mealtime, petitioner 
nevertheless credited the workers with eighth hours of work for each shift and 
paid them for the same number of hours. However, since 1953, whenever workers in 
one shift were required to continue working until the next shift, petitioner, 
instead of crediting them with eight hours of overtime work, has been paying 
them for six hours only, petitioner claiming that the two hours corresponding to 
the mealtime periods should not be included in computing compensation. On the 
other hand, respondent National Textile Workers Union whose members are employed 
at the NDC, maintained the opposite view and asked the Court of Industrial 
Relations to order the payment of additional overtime pay corresponding to the 
mealtime periods.</p>
<p>After hearing, Judge Arsenio I. Martinez of the CIR issued an order, dated 
March 19, 1959, holding that mealtime should be counted in the determination of 
overtime work and accordingly ordered petitioner to pay P101,407.96 by way of 
overtime compensation. Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration but the 
same was dismissed by the CIR <i>en banc</i> on the ground that petitioner 
failed to furnish the union a copy of its motion.</p>
<p>Thereafter, petitioner appealed to this Court, contending, first, that the 
CIR has no jurisdiction over claims for overtime compensation and, secondly, 
that the CIR did not make "a correct appraisal of the facts, in the light of the 
evidence" in holding that mealtime periods should be included in overtime work 
because workers could not leave their places of work and rest completely during 
those hours.</p>
<p>In support of its contention that the CIR lost its jurisdiction over claims 
for overtime pay upon the enactment of the Industrial Peace Act (Republic Act 
No. 875), petitioner cites a number of decisions of this Court. On May 23, 1960, 
however, We ruled in Price Stabilization Corp. vs. Court of Industrial 
Relations, et al., 108 Phil., 138, 139, that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Analyzing these cases, the underlying principle, it will bt noted in all of 
them, though not stated in express terms, is that were the employer-employee 
relationship is still existing or is sought to be reestablished because of its 
wrongful severance, (at where the employee seeks reinstatement), the Court of 
Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over all claims arising out of, or in 
connection with the employment, such as those related to the Minimum Wage Law 
and Eight-Hour Labor Law. After the termination of their relationship and no 
reinstatement is sought, such claims become mere money claims, and come within 
the jurisdiction of the regular courts.</p>
<p>"We are aware that in 2 cases, some statements implying a different view have 
been made, but we now hold and declare the principle set forth in the next 
preceding paragraph as the one governing all cases of this 
nature."</p></blockquote>
<p>This has been the constant doctrine of this Court since May 23, 1960<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>A more recent definition of the jurisdiction of the CIR is found in Campos, 
et al. vs. Manila Railroad Co., et al., G. R. No. L-17905, May 25, 1962, in 
which We held that, for such jurisdiction to come into play, the following 
requisites must be complied with: (a) there must exist between the parties an 
employer-employee relationship or the claimant must seek his reinstatement; and 
(b) the controversy must relate to a case certified by the President to the CIR 
as one involving national interest, or must have a bearing on an unfair labor 
practice charge, or must arise either under the Eight-Hour Labor Law, or under 
the Minimum Wage Law. In default of any of these circumstances, the claim 
becomes a mere money claim that comes under the jurisdiction of the regular 
courts. Here, petitioner does not deny the existence of an employer-employee 
relationship between it and the members of the union. Neither is there any 
question that the claim is based on the Eight-Hour Labor Law (Com. Act No. 444, 
as amended). We therefore rule in favor of the jurisdiction of the CIR over the 
present claim.</p>
<p>The other issue raised in the appeal is whether or not, on the basis of the 
evidence, the mealtime breaks should be considered working time under the 
following provision of the law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The legal working day for any person employed by another shall be of not 
more than eight hours daily. <i>When the work is not continuous, the time during 
which the laborer is not working and can leave his working place and can rest 
completely shall not be counted</i>." (Sec. 1, Com. Act No. 444, as amended. 
Italics ours.)</p></blockquote>
<p>It will be noted that, under the law, the idle time that an employee may 
spend for resting and during which ha may leave the spot or place of work though 
not the premises<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of his employer, is 
not counted as working time only where the work is broken or is not 
continuous.</p>
<p>The determination as to whether work is continuous or not is mainly one of 
fact which We shall not review as A long as the same is supported by evidence. 
(Sec 15, Com. Act No. 103, as amended; Philippine Newspaper Guild vs. Evening 
News, Inc., 86 Phil. 303).</p>
<p>That is why We brushed aside petitioner's contention in one case that workers 
who worked under a 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. schedule had enough "free time" and, 
therefore should not be credited with four hours of overtime and held that the 
finding of the CIR "that claimants herein rendered services to the Company from 
6:00 a.m. to 6 p.m. including Sundays and holidays, * * * implies either that 
they were not allowed to leave the spot of their working place, or that they 
could not rest completely." (Luzon Stevedoring Co., Inc., vs. Luzon Marine 
Department Union, et al., 101 Phil., 257).</p>
<p>Indeed, it has been said that no general rule can be laid down as to what 
constitutes compensable work, but rather the question is one of fact depending 
upon the particular circumstances, to be determined by the courts in 
controverted cases. (31 Am. Jur. Sec. 626 pp. 877-378)</p>
<p>In this case, the CIR's finding that work in the petitioner company was 
continuous and did not permit employees and laborers to rest completely is not 
without basis in evidence and following our earlier rulings, We shall not 
disturbed the same. Thus, the CIR found:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While it may be corrected to say that it is well-nigh impossible for an 
employee to work while he is eating, yet under Section 1 of Com. Act No. 444 
such, a time for eating can only be segregated or deducted from his work, if the 
same is not continuous and the employee can leave his working place and rest 
completely. The tune cards show that, the work was continuous and without 
interruption. There is also the evidence adduced by the petitioner that the 
pertinent employees cannot freely leave their working places nor rest 
completely. There is furthermore the aspect that during the period covered by 
the computation the work was on a 24 hour basis and as previously stated divided 
into shifts."</p></blockquote>
<p>From these facts, the CIR correctly concluded that work in petition company 
was continuous and therefore the mealtime breaks should be counted as working 
time for purposes of overtime compensation.</p>
<p>Petitioner gives an eight-hour credit to its employees who work a single 
shift, say from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m.. Why cannot it credit them sixteen hours should 
they work in two shifts?</p>
<p>There is another reason why this appeal should be dismissed and that is that 
there is no decision by the CIR <i>en banc</i> from which petitioner can appeal 
to this Court. As already indicated above, the records show that petitioner's 
motion for reconsideration of the order of March 19, 1959 was dismissed by the 
CIR <i>en banc</i> because of petitioner's failure to serve a copy of the same 
on the union.</p>
<p>Section 15 of the rules of the CIR, in relation to Section 1 of Commonwealth 
Act No. 103, states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The movant shall file the motion (for reconsideration), in six copies within 
five (5) days from the date on which he receives notice of the order or 
decision, object of the motion for reconsideration, the same to be verified 
under oath with respect to the correctness of the allegations of fact, and 
<i>serving a copy thereof, personally or by registered mail, on the adverse 
party</i>. The latter may file an answer, is six (6) copies duly verified under 
oath." (Italics ours)</p></blockquote>
<p>In one case (Bien, et al. vs. Castillo, etc., et al. G. R. No. L-7428, May 
24, 1955), We sustained the dismissal of a motion for reconsideration filed 
outside of the period provided in the rules of the CIR. A motion for 
reconsideration, a copy of winch has not been served on the adverse party as 
required by the rules, stands on the same footing. For "in the very nature of 
things, a motion for reconsideration against a ruling or decision by one Judge 
is in effect an appeal to the Court of Industrial Relations, <i>en banc</i>," 
the purpose being "to substitute the decision or order of a collegiate court for 
the ruling or decision of any judge." The provision in Commonwealth Act No. 103 
authorizing the presentation of a motion for reconsideration of a decision or 
order of the judge to the CIR, <i>en banc</i>, and not direct appeal therefrom 
to this Court, is also in accord with the principle of exhaustion of 
administrative remedies before resort can be made to this Court (Broce, et al. 
vs. The Court of Industrial Relations, et al., 106 Phil. 388; 56 Off. Gaz. (49) 
7445).</p>
<p>Petitioner's motion for reconsideration having been dismissed for its failure 
to serve a copy of the same on the union, there is no decision of the CIR <i>en 
banc</i> that petitioner can bring to this Court for review.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order of March 19, 1959 and the resolution of April 27, 1959 
are hereby ammend and the appeal is dismissed, without pronouncement as to 
costs.</p> <i>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera,
