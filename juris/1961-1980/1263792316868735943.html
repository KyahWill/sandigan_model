				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">It is not often that this Court has occasion to make use of its
power to impose a temporary suspension on members of the bar for failure to
live up to the obligation incident to his status as an officer of the
Court.  It had to do so in this case of
respondent Cesar G. Fajardo, who for a period close to four months paid no
attention to a resolution of this Court, and when required to pay a fine for
such omission did nothing about it.  He
now seeks to lift the order of suspension, explaining that the rather blatant
disregard of what ought to have been done was due to the mental and emotional
state he was in.  Considering the lapse
of time that had elapsed and his disavowal of any intent to disobey what is
ordered by this Tribunal, his plea is granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The train of events that led to his sad plight started from his
failure to comment on a letter from the Senior Executive Assistant and Acting
Administrative Officer of the Bureau of Prisons informing this Court that,
according to appellant Rodolfo Balinas, his counsel was a certain Cesar Fajardo,
care of Criminal Court, Manuel Pamaran, City Hall, Manila.  In a resolution of May 16, 1974, he was
asked to explain this omission.  Again,
there was no compliance on his part, resulting in this resolution of June 18,
1974:  "It appearing that Atty. Cesar
Fajardo failed to show cause why he failed to comply with the resolution of
February 21, 1974, which required him to comment on the letter of Julio M.
Alcantara, that according to appellant Rodolfo Balinas y Villena, the complete
name and address of his counsel is Atty. Cesar Fajardo, c/o Circuit Criminal
Court, City Hall, Manila, within the period which expired on June 1, 1974, the
Court Resolved:  (a) to [Impose] a fine
of P100.00 upon Atty. Fajardo payable to this Court for his failure to file the
aforesaid comment; and (b) to require him to [comply] with the aforesaid
resolution of February 21, 1974, both within ten (10) days from notice
hereof." Surprisingly, he still was not heard from, thus necessitating the
resolution of suspension of August 6, 1974.  It is worded thus:  "For
failure of Atty. Cesar Fajardo to comply with the resolution of February 21,
1974 within the period which expired on March 10, 1974 and to pay the fine of
P100.00 imposed upon him in the resolution of June 18, 1974, within the period
which expired on July 8, 1974, the Court Resolved:  (1) to [Suspend] Atty. Fajardo from the practice of law until
further orders from this Court; (b) to [Circularize] this resolution to all
courts in the Philippines; and (c) to require appellant Balinas to [State]
within ten (10) days from notice hereof, whether or not he has another lawyer
to represent him in this case or whether he desires that a counsel <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">de officio</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt"> </span>be appointed for him by this Court.  Let a copy of this resolution be attached to the personal records
of Atty. Fajardo." It appears, however, that as far back as July 19, 1974,
he had prepared a Motion for Reconsideration and Explanation, but it was not
submitted for the consideration of this Court until after the aforesaid resolution.
  As set forth in such Motion for
Reconsideration and Explanation:  "1. That herein counsel was ordered to comment 'on the letter of
Julio M. Alcantara, Senior Executive Assistant and Acting Administrative
Officer of the New Bilibid Prison, Muntinglupa, Rizal, informing this Court
that according to appellant Rodolfo Balinas y Villena, the complete name and
address of his counsel in this case is Atty. Cesar Fajardo, c/o Circuit
Criminal Court, Manuel Pamaran, City Hall, Manila' within the period prescribed
in said Order; 2. That failure of herein counsel to make said comment within
the period specified in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">said </span>resolution
and for his subsequent failure to explain such failure to comment, this
Honorable Tribunal fined him ONE HUNDRED PESOS (P100.00); 3. That undersigned
herein has no intention of disregarding the order of the Honorable Tribunal,
and if ever <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">he </span>failed to make
the comment on time, the same was caused by some pressing personal problems
brought about by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">detention </span>of
a relative (sister) by the military in the province and hence he was not able
to attend the said resolution of the Court within such reasonable period; 4.
That undersigned counsel has no intention of disregarding the resolution of
this Honorable Tribunal and for his failure to comply with its order,
undersigned herein is respectfully begging the indulgence of the Court and
undertakes that no similar incident will occur; ... 6. That herein counsel is
not the present counsel of appellant Rodolfo Balinas, as his services have not
been formally engaged by said appellant.  This representation merely acted as de oficio lawyer upon order of the
Circuit Criminal Court during the trial of said case and upon its termination
his appointment as de oficio counsel was also extinguished.  However, as member of the Bar, this
representation will be most willing to assist appellant Rodolfo Balinas in his
appeal, should this Honorable Tribunal order him to do so as de oficio
counsel."</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter came this plea for the reconsideration of the
resolution of August 6, 1974 suspending respondent:  "1.   That in the
Resolution of the Honorable Tribunal dated August 6, 1974, and received by
undersigned on August 12, 1974, this representation was ordered [suspended]
from the practice of law until further orders from this Honorable Tribunal, for
his failure to comply with the Resolution of February 21, 1974, with the period
prescribed by law; 2.   That this
representation humbly seeks the indulgence of this Honorable Tribunal for the
reconsideration of the aforesaid resolution on the ground that he never
intended to disregard the orders of this Court, and by way of further
explanations, this representation is manifesting that he is incorporating
herein the contents of his Motion for Reconsideration and Explanation dated July
19, 1974 by way of reference to this petition as reasons for his failure to
comply with the resolutions of this Honorable Tribunal; 3.   That the suspension of herein counsel from
the practice of law in the Philippines will adversely affect not only his entire
family but also his numerous clients with pending cases both before the
different trial Courts as well as before the Court of Appeals and the Supreme
Court; 4.   That if given another chance
and the suspension of undersigned herein will be reconsidered and lifted,
herein counsel undertakes that no similar incident will occur and promises to
be more careful and prompt in the fulfillment of his duties and obligations as
member of the Bar; 5.   That likewise,
undersigned herein is reiterating his willingness and readiness to help assist
accused-appellant Rodolfo Balinas in his appeal before this Court, should this
Honorable Tribunal give him another chance to do so as counsel de oficio."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious that respondent would desire to make amends.  He has affirmed not once but twice the lack
of any intention on his part to disregard orders and resolutions from this
Tribunal that may be corrected, but it is equally certain that the <i>contretemps</i>
in which he now finds himself would have been avoided had he shown the
slightest diligence.  He does not deny
that he has received the copy of the resolution that dates back to February 21,
1974, when he was given 10 days to comment on the letter of the Senior
Executive Assistant and Acting Administrative Officer of the Bureau of
Prisons.  He simply ignored it.  Even on the assumption that there were
pressing personal problems traceable to the detention of a sister by the
military, he could have filed a motion asking for additional period within
which to do so.  He did not.   He could have done so within a period of
well-nigh four months, but again there was nothing but silence on his
part.  There was clearly then a failure
to exercise due diligence.  The fine was
not imposed until the resolution of June 18, 1974, but it has never been
paid.  What could he expect then?  It does appear quite manifest that
respondent's conduct had to be visited with the appropriate sanction.  Nonetheless, as mentioned at the outset, his
plea for the lifting of the suspension may be acted on favorably.  Sufficient time for him to feel the dire
consequence of such inattention to duty has elapsed.  Moreover, due note is taken of the mental and emotional stress he
must have been laboring under during such period.  Nor is this all.  With the
penalty that he had to suffer, there ought to be a reminder that he should
display greater awareness of the obligations incident to membership in the bar,
especially so where a command is traceable to an order of this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the resolution of August 6, 1974 suspending
respondent Cesar G. Fajardo from the practice of the law is lifted and set
aside.  This resolution becomes <i>effective</i>,
however, only upon respondent Fajardo paying the fine of P100.00.  Let a copy of this resolution be entered in
his record.</p>
