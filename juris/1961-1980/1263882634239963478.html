				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The city court of Iloilo City, <span style="">in </span>a decision dated <st1:date year="1976" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1976</st1:date>, ordered <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> Once to vacate an apartment in a building owned
by <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> and to pay
a monthly rental of P290 until the premises have been vacated, plus P1<span class="GramE">,000</span> as attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was not indicated in the decision when the payment of the monthly
rental should commence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No back rentals
were adjudged (Civil Case No. 11312).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> Once filed a motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He alleged that he had
been occupying the apartment (one of the four doors of the said building made
of cement hollow blocks and wood, with galvanized iron roofing) since 1966;
that he was the only one singled out for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>;
that the commissioner's report on the alleged dilapidated condition of the
building was not set for hearing; that he occupied the apartment as residence
and for <span style="">use as a <span class="SpellE"><u>carinderia</u></span>
which allegedly was his sole means of livelihood, and that he should be given a
preference to reoccupy the apartment after the completion of the repairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The city court denied the motion in its order of <st1:date year="1976" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> Once
appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He deposited in the city court
on <st1:date year="1976" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1976</st1:date> P580 as
rentals for April and May, 1976, Official Receipt No. 4763496.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the Court of First Instance, he deposited
P290 on July 16, 1976 as rental for June, 1976, Official Receipt No. 1257740;
P290 on August 11, 1976 as rental for July, 1976, Official Receipt No. 1977508,
and P290 on September 9, 1976, as rental for August, 1976, Official Receipt No.

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>,
the owner of the apartment, filed in the Court of First Instance a motion dated
<st1:date year="1976" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1976</st1:date> for immediate
execution of the city court's judgment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He invoked, as grounds, <span class="SpellE">Once's</span> alleged failure
to file a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond and the supposed <span class="SpellE">untenantable</span> condition of the apartment.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> Once, through his lawyer,
Marietta J. <span class="SpellE">Homena</span>­-Valencia, an employee of the
Citizens Legal Assistance Office (CLAO), opposed the motion for execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once alleged that he had deposited the
current rentals; that the apartment occupied by him was not in danger of
collapsing; that the building was stable, as shown by the fact that the owner, <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>, and his family occupied the apartment adjoining the
door leased to Once; that, if repairs were needed, all the occupants of the
building should vacate it, and that the commissioner, who reported on the
condition of the building, was not competent to assess its tenantable condition
since he is not an engineer but a court interpreter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Executive Judge <span class="SpellE">Valerio</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Rovira</span> granted the motion for execution in his terse order
of <st1:date year="1976" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1976</st1:date>, which
reads:</p>

<blockquote>"It appearing that the <u>defendant has not filed the <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond</u> and considering the provisions of
section 8, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court, let a writ of <span style="">execution issue to effect the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of
the defendant from the premises."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> Once filed a motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He reiterated his
contention that the execution was improper because he had deposited in court
the current rentals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cited the rule
that a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond is not necessary in case the
tenant had deposited in court the rentals due (<span class="SpellE">Mitschiener</span>
vs. Barrios, 76 Phil. 55; <span class="SpellE">Bagtas</span> vs. Tan, 93 Phil.
804).</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court denied the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It issued a writ of execution dated <st1:date year="1976" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> Once
filed a motion for suspension of the execution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He offered to file a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stressed that he had occupied the apart­ment
for ten years and that his ejection was in contravention of Presidential Decree
No. 20.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1976</st1:date>
<span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> Once, through three CLAO lawyers, filed in
this Court the instant special <span style="">civil </span>actions
of <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition in order to set aside the order and writ
of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A temporary restraining
order was issued by this Court but before it could be implemented <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> Once was constrained to vacate the apartment in
litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue is whether the lower court erred in ordering execution
of the city court's judgment pending appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the lower court committed a patent error in ordering
execution of the city court's judgment on the ground that <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span>
Once did not file a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such bond was necessary because no back
rentals were adjudged in the city court's judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attorney's fees of P1<span class="GramE">,000</span>
need not be covered by a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(De <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Adil</span>, L-43345, July 29, 1976, 72 SCRA 148, 155).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Once's</span> timely deposit of the rentals
for April, May, June, July and August, <span style="">1976
</span>stayed the execution of the judgment pending <span style="">appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In </span>such a
situation, no <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond was required to <span style="">stay execution of the city court's
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Sison</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span>, 109 Phil. 557, 561).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the order of execution was groundless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not justified under section 8, Rule 70
of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 8
requires a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond only if there are accrued
rentals in arrears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It dispenses with
that bond if the defeated tenant deposits in court the rentals due from time to
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The execution proceeding already
mentioned is void.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be noted that according to <span class="SpellE">Once's</span>
manifestation of March 22, 1977, the lower court in its decision of February 5,
1977 reversed the city court's judgment and ordered that Once be allowed to
reoccupy the leased premises.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the lower court's orders of August 9 and <st1:date year="1976" day="14" month="9">September 14, 1976</st1:date> are set aside with
costs against respondent <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>.</p>
