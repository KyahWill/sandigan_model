the services I had rendered for <span class="SpellE">Earthwealth</span> referred
to therein as CLIENT, and that the services therein contem­plated not only

I had to appear before the Cabinet in my capacity as a lawyer, especially so

the testimony that I had a hard time convincing the Department of Justice, the
Secretary of Justice, as to the feasibility and reasonableness of the action
taken by the PHHC in connection with my client's views, because the Secretary
of Justice rendered an opinion, very much adverse to the <span class="SpellE">Earthwealth</span>,
and this opinion is the one appearing on pages 186 to 188, which is Exhibit M
for the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And because of this
opinion I had to file a memorandum with the Cabinet, dated <st1:date year="1960" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1960</st1:date>, copy of which appears on pages
189 to 192 of the <span class="SpellE">expediente</span> which is marked as
Exhibit N for the plaintiff, to contradict the opinion of the Secretary of
Justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequent to that time, when
the Cabinet met, resulting in the approval of the sale as shown by the letter
dated December 14, 1960, I was called upon to argue orally before the Cabinet
the transaction of my client <span class="SpellE">Earthwealth</span> with the
PHHC to justify the purchase of the property so much so that this reference you
made to the contract, to the portion of the contract you made, refers to legal
representation insofar as appearing before the Cabinet is concerned."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is thus quite clear from the foregoing that the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> services were those of a real estate broker and
a lawyer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Better Living, Inc. has adopted the claim of Tropical Homes, Inc.
that the Memorandum Agreement, wherein <span class="SpellE">Earthwealth</span>
had agreed to pay the late plaintiff, Julio de la Cruz the amount of
P320,000.00 for the latter's services, is in violation of Republic Act No.
3019, the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act and therefore, inexistent and
void from the beginning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support
thereof, the appellant points to certain admissions made by the late plaintiff
during the trial that the sale to <span class="SpellE">Earthwealth</span> was
mainly due to his representation and close personal relations with the then
General Manager of the PHHC which actions amounted to "influence
peddling" within the concept of the Anti-Graft Law.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (Rep. Act No. 3019) was
enacted on August 17, 1960 and Section 4 of the said act provides, among
others, that it shall be unlawful for any person having family or close
personal relation with any public official to capitalize or exploit or take
advantage of such family or close personal relation by directly or indirectly
requesting or receiving any present, gift or material or pecuniary advantage
from any other person having some business, transaction, application, request
or contract with the government, in which such public official has <span style="">to </span>intervene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Family relation shall include the spouse or
relatives by consanguinity or affinity in the third civil degree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The word "close per­sonal relation"
shall include close personal friendship, social and fraternal connections, and
professional employment all giving rise to intimacy which assures free access
to such public officer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Here, it is contended that there is a violation of the Anti-Graft
Law since the late plaintiff admitted that there existed a close intimacy
between him and Bernardo Torres, the then General Manager of the PHHC; that the
late plaintiff did capitalize upon, exploit and take advantage of such close
personal relation; that plaintiff capitalized and took advantage of such
relation by directly receiving pecuniary advantage from the <span class="SpellE">Earthwealth</span>
through their agreement,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
and that the public official he influenced, Mr. Bernardo Torres had to
intervene in the transaction which <span class="SpellE">Earthwealth</span> had
with the PHHC of which Mr. Torres was the Chairman of the Board and General
Manager.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, it is very clear on the records that the late plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had capitalized on his friendship and intimacy
with the General Manager of the PHHC in promoting the sale of the <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span> Estate to his client, <span class="SpellE">Earthwealth</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exploitation of friendship, however,
ceased on July 21, 1960, when the PHHC Board of Directors approved the said
sale through its Resolution No. 38.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Considering that the Anti-Graft Law was enacted subsequent thereto, on <st1:date year="1960" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1960</st1:date>, the provisions of
said law cannot be given retroactive effect and invoked against the late
plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although the sale was finally approved by the President and/or his
Cabinet on <st1:date year="1960" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1960</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
there is no evidence to show that the late Julio de la Cruz is a close intimate
of the President and capitalized on such close personal relations in the final
approval of the sale.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, and in <span style="">view
</span>of the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> com­promise agreement
executed by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> on one hand and appellant

The testimony reads in part, as follows:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: -22.5pt;">"Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now going over the exhibits, I noted Mr. de la Cruz a memorandum
by the then Manager of the People's <span class="SpellE">Homesite</span> and

Philippines, justifying the <span class="SpellE">Earthwealth</span> contract,
which is Exhibit J of the records, appearing on pages 173 to 177.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Have you had occasion to read this exhibit

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: -22.5pt;">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, as a matter of fact, I was the one who prepared this before

typed in my own typewriter.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: -22.5pt;">Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And it was signed by Mr. Torres after you prepared it?</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: -22.5pt;">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We worked together to justify the sale.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: -22.5pt;">Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Knowing, as you alleged, that the decision, as you testify now,
to dispose of the <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span> Estate in favor of third

suggestion, did you not protest to Mr. Torres that no mention was ever made of
the fact that you made such suggestion in Exhibit 'J'?</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: -22.5pt;">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was no need for that.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All that I was interested was that the sale would go through.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not want to claim credit for it, and it
would have been ridiculous for Mr. Torres to make mention there that this
memorandum was made by Mr. de la Cruz.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: -22.5pt;">Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Will you be kind enough to inform the <st1:street><st1:address>Hon.

I are from the same province, and he knows me in­timately, and he has trust in
me, that <span style="">is </span>why he asked me to
