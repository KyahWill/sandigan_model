				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On December 30, 1954 Otiak Omal was charged with robbery in band in the 
Justice of the Peace Court of Datu Piang, Cotabato (Criminal Case 2175). The 
preliminary investigation having been waived, the case was elevated to the Court 
of First Instance of Cotabato where the bail bond fixed for Omal's provisional 
liberty was reduced from P24,000 to P10,000. Upon the filing by appellee Luzon 
Surety Company, Inc. of the bail bond in this amount and its approval by the 
court, Omal was released.
<p>On August 10, 1956 Omal was arrested anew because he was charged with rape in 
Criminal Case No. 2627 of the same court. On August 23 of the same year he was 
placed "under the custody of the governor * * * pending a proposal of amicable 
settlement, the case being private" according to an entry appearing on page 71 
of the Provincial Jail Blotter.</p>
<p>On December 12, 1956 Datu Udtog, the Governor of the province, ordered one of 
his men named Candado and the Chief of Police of Cotabato to bring Omal home 
because he was reported causing trouble in a certain place. Omal was last seen 
walking towards the Governor's place with the Iatter's emissaries, and 
thereafter he disappeared. It was only on December 20, 1957 that appellee filed 
an <em>ex-parte</em> motion for the withdrawal of the bail bond mentioned 
heretofore and it further prayed that it be relieved of responsibility in 
connection, therewith, alleging, as ground, therefor, that it had exerted 
efforts to find Omal but was unable to locate and apprehend him; that 
considering the gravity of the charges Omal was facing, appellee had "reasons to 
believe that (our) efforts to find him will eventually prove fruitless; that had 
the Provincial Warden and Provincial Governor performed their duties well in 
connection with the custody of Omal, appellee would not have any difficulty in 
surrendering him to the court".</p>
<p>The State opposed the motion on the ground that appellee did not ask for the 
cancellation of the bond when Omal was rearrested in connection with the charge 
for rape filed against him, but did so only after he had disappeared on December 
12, 1956. It was, therefor, argued that appellee had chosen to continue with its 
liability under the bond and should be held accountable for the accused who 
escaped after his rearrest.</p>
<p>After appellee had presented evidence in support of its motion, the lower 
court issued the appealed order cancelling the bail bond. Hence this appeal by 
the State.</p>
<p>In People <em>vs</em>. De la Cruz, 93 Phil., 487; 49 Off. Gaz., [8] 3389, we 
held, among other things, that the surety's right, duties and liabilities after 
the prisoner is, for another offense, arrested and then escapes and/or absconds, 
must be controlled by statutory provisions other than those of section 16, Rule 
110, Rules of Court, or by the General principles of contract. In consonance 
with this principle it was held in U.S. <em>vs</em>. Bunuan, 22 Phil., 1: U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Sunico, 40 Phil., 826, 832, that bail will be exonerated where the 
performance of its condition is rendered impossible by act of God, the act of 
the obligee, or the act of law.</p>
<p>In ordering the cancellation of the bail bond in question the lower court 
apparently was of the opinion that appellees' inability to produce the person of 
Omal was due to the negligence or irregular conduct of the Provincial Warden and 
of the Provincial Governor of Cotabato, which facilitated the escape of the 
prisoner. While this may be true, we do not believe it is sufficient to justify 
the cancellation of the bail bond.</p>
<p>It is well settled that a surety is the jailer of the accused and is 
responsible for the letter's custody. Therefore, it is not merely his right but 
his obligation to keep the accused at all times under his surveillance, 
considering that his authority emanating from his character as surety is no more 
nor less than the Government's authority to hold the accused under preventive 
imprisonment (People <em>vs</em>. Tuising, 61 Phil., 404). The surety being in 
legal contemplation the jailer of the accused, appellee in this case should not 
have allowed the irregular conduct of the Warden and the Provincial Governor to 
go on for a considerable time until it ended in the escape of the prisoner. It 
is, therefore, equally chargeable with negligence in this connection.</p>
<p>Even when a surety's performance of the bond is rendered impossible by the 
act of God, or of the obligee, or of the law, it is the surety's duty to inform 
the court of the happening of the event so that it may take action or decree the 
discharge of the surety. In the present case the surely took no such steps when 
Omal was rearrested, nor did it ask for the cancellation of the bail bond until 
after Omalâ€™s escape or disappearance. In a case quite similar to the present we 
held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The only question to be determined is whether, while the accused was out on 
bail, was picked up by the constabulary authorities in the province for 
questioning in connection with subversive activities, and thereafter escaped 
from their custody, will excuse the surety, the Rizal Surety &amp; Insurance 
Company, from the non-performance of its obligation under the bond.</p>
<p>"It is a well-settled doctrine that a surety is the jailer of the accused. 
'He takes charge of, and absolutely becomes responsible for. the latter's 
custody, and under such circumstance, it is incumbent upon him, or rather, it is 
his inevitable obligation, not merely a right, to keep the accused at all times 
under his surveillance inasmuch as the authority emanating from his character as 
surety is no more nor less than the Government's authority to hold the said 
accused under preventive imprisonment." (People <em>vs</em>. Tuising, 61 Phil. 
404).</p>
<p>"When the surety in this case put up the bond for the provisional liberty of 
the accused it became his jailer and as such was at all times charged with the 
duly to keep him under its surveillance. This duty continues until the bond is 
cancelled, or the surety is discharged. The procedure for the discharge of a 
surety is clear in the Rules of Court. Thus, it is there provided that the bail 
bond shall be cancelled and the sureties discharged of liability (a) where the 
sureties so request upon surrender of the defendant to the court; (b) where the 
defendant is re-arrested or ordered into custody on the same charge or for the 
same offense; (c) where the defendant is discharged by the court at any stage of 
the proceedings, or acquitted, or is convicted and surrendered to serve the 
sentence; and (d) where the defendant dies during the pendency of the action. 
(Section 16, Rule 110)</p>
<p>"It is true that a surety may also be discharged from the non-performance of 
the bond when its performance is rendered impossible by the act of God, the act 
of the obligee, or the act of the law (U.S. <em>vs</em>. Sunico, 40 Phil. 
826-832), but even in these cases there still remains the duty of the surety to 
inform the court of the happening of the event so that it may take appropriate 
action and decree the discharge of the surety (Sec. 16, Rule 110). Here no such 
step was taken by the surety when the accused was re-arrested by the 
constabulary authorities. The surety kept silent since it did not take any of 
the steps pointed out by law if it wanted to be relieved from its liability 
under the bond. It only gave notice to the court of that fact when the court 
ordered the appearance of the accused either for arraignment or for trial. It 
was only then that it informed the court that the accused was re-arrested and 
that while he was detained, he made good his escape. Since at that time his bond 
was still valid and binding, and notwithstanding the re-arrest of the accused 
the surety kept silent, it must be presumed that the surety chose to continue 
with its liability under the bond and should be held accountable for what may 
later happen to the accused. It has been held that "The subsequent arrest of the 
principal on another charge, or in other proceedings, while he is out on bail 
does not operate <em>ipso facto</em> as a discharge of his bail * * *. Thus, if, 
while in custody on another charge, he escape, or is again discharged on bail, 
and is a free man when called upon his recognizance to appear, his, bail are 
bound to produce him. (6 C. J. p. 1026.)</p>
<p>"This case should be distinguished from the recent case of people 
<em>vs</em>. Mamerto de la Cruz, 93 Phil., 487., 49; Off. Gaz., 3389, wherein 
this Court said: 'It has been seen that if the sureties did not bring the person 
of the accused to court, which they were powerless to do due to causes brought 
about by the Government itself, they did the next best thing by informing the 
court of the prisoner's arrest and confinement in another province and impliedly 
asking that they be discharged. On its part, the court, by keeping quiet, and 
indeed, issuing notices of the hearings direct to the prisoner through the 
Sheriff of Camarines Norte and ignoring the surety, impliedly acquiesced in the 
latter's request and appeared to have regarded the accused surrendered. No such 
step was taken by the surety in this particular case for it failed to inform the 
court of the apprehension made of the accused by the constabulary authorities." 
(People <em>vs</em>. Lee Diet, 94 Phil., 31).</p></blockquote>
<p>Moreover, there is no sufficient evidence in the record to show that appellee 
had exerted all possible efforts in the premises to arrest or cause the arrest 
of Omal. That it was not impossible to rearrest him is, in fact, shown by the 
circumstance that on November 28, 1958 , he surrendered to the Provincial 
Government of Cotabato and was forthwith committed to and confined at the 
provincial jail of said province (see appellee's petition for the dismissal of 
this appeal, dated February 2, 1959 ). While the petition just referred to was 
denied by this Court, the denial should be understood as without prejudice to 
appellee filing with the lower court, after the remanding of this case below, a 
motion for the cancellation of its bail bond if at that time Omal is still in 
custody of the proper authorities.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order appealed from is hereby reversed, with 
costs.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Barrera, Paredes, De Leon,</em> and <em>Natividad, JJ.,</em> concur.</div>
