which was done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the Board
immediately proceeded with the canvass, recessed at </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="14"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">two o'clock</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, past </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="0"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">midnight</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, to resume at </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="10"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">10:00

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On 26
November and 3 December 1969, Jorge A. <span class="SpellE">Abad</span>, Liberal
Party official candidate, and Mrs. Renee <span class="SpellE">Agudo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party official candidate, filed independent
petitions with COMELEC, contesting the pro­clamation of <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
Antonio, Jr. by the Provincial Board of Canvassers on the basis of terrorism
practiced by armed men brought to <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span> by can­didate
Antonio and strategically distributed in all towns, who destroyed communication
facilities and blocked airport landings, thereby effectively isolating the
province; and that on election day these armed men had attacked the precincts
of <span class="SpellE">Itbayat</span>, <span class="SpellE">Uyugan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ivana</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mahatao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sabtang</span> (except Precinct 4 of the latter), driven away the
voters filled in the unused ballots with the name of Antonio, destroyed the
ballots of those voters who had previously managed to vote, prepared the
election returns without counting the votes, and thereafter coerced and
intimidated the boards of inspectors of the precincts to sign the same at
gunpoint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both petitioners prayed that
the proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> Antonio, Jr. by the Board
of Canvassers be annulled and set aside, and that the election returns in all
precincts in the towns of <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span>, except <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> and Precinct No. 4 of <span class="SpellE">Sabtang</span>,
be declared null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But while can­didate
Abed also prayed that the canvassing board be directed to make another canvass
on the basis of election returns from Precinct 4 of <span class="SpellE">Sabtang</span>
and the nine (9) precincts of <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> and thereafter
proclaim the winner, candidate <span class="SpellE">Agudo</span>, in her turn,
asked that the returns from <span class="SpellE">Sabtang</span>, Precinct 4, and <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> be declared not expressive of the will of the ma­jority,
since they represent only 28% of the registered voters of <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span>,
and that the holding of a special election be recommended to the Pre­sident of
the Philippines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Respondent
(petitioner herein) <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> Antonio; Jr. answered both
petitions traversing the allegations thereof, and pleading the regularity and
freedom of the election held, and, by way of special defenses, urged (1) lack
of jurisdiction of COMELEC to determine questions involving election returns
regarding members of the House of Representatives; (2) <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
of Jorge <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> to maintain the pro­ceedings because he
had filed a protest against Antonio in the House Electoral Tribunal; (3) that
COMELEC had no power to annul the proclamation or suspend its effects; (4) that
both Abed and <span class="SpellE">Agudo</span> waived their rights to contest
the proclamations or are <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from asserting it
in view of their failure to attend the canvass and impugn therein the validity
of the questioned returns; and (5) lack of power of the COMELEC to annul the
election or declare a failure to elect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">At the
initial hearing on 5 December 1969, the COMELEC issued a resolution suspending
the effects of the proclamation of Antonio pending final termination of the
case and rejected the motions to dismiss filed by Antonio and the Provincial
Board of Canvassers based on grounds substantially identical to the special
defenses pleaded in Antonio's answers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thereafter,
COMELEC proceeded to take evidence, summoning and hearing <u>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></u> the chairmen of the boards of inspectors in the
questioned precincts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, it
rendered a unanimous Resolution finding the factual claims of terrorism made by
petitioners (respondents herein) <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> and <span class="SpellE">Agudo</span> to have been substantiated by proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Overruling Antonio's special defenses, the
COMELEC voided the returns of the questioned precincts and set aside his
proclamation based thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The majority
of the Commission (Chairman <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> and member <span class="SpellE">Patajo</span>) further resolved to order the Provincial Board of
Canvassers to reconvene and <span class="SpellE">recanvass</span> the uncontested
returns of <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> and Precinct 4 of <span class="SpellE">Sabtang</span>, and proclaim the winner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Miraflor</span>,
however, was, of the opinion that (as contended by candidate <span class="SpellE">Agudo</span>) there was a failure of election that should be
certified to the House of Representatives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> Antonio, Jr.
then resorted to this Court, as stated heretofore, urging practically the same
special defenses pleaded by him before the COMELEC and praying that the COMELEC
resolution be set aside, and that the House Electoral Tribunal be declared with
exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide the issues raised by petitioners
below.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">WE gave the
petition due course and required respondents Commis­sion on Elections, Jorge <span class="SpellE">Abad</span>, Renee <span class="SpellE">Agudo</span> and the
Provincial Board of Canvassers to answer Antonio's petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And upon his motion, a writ of preliminary
injunction was issued to stop the proclamation during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of these proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the
case was heard, argued and submitted for decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The
petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> Antonio, Jr., makes no attempt to
question the findings of the COMELEC to the effect that the returns from the 21
questioned precincts were prepared under systematic threats and intimidation
practiced by heavily armed men upon the members of the respective boards of
inspectors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said the Commission in its
resolution:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It would appear quite clear to the Com­mission that what
transpired inside the polling place in <span class="SpellE">Itbayat</span>, <span class="SpellE">Uyugan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ivana</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mahatao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sabtang</span>, except
Precinct 4 on election day, particularly in regard to the preparation of the
returns in these precincts through the intervention or upon the dictation of
armed goons, was the culmination of an operation which had for Its, objective
the election of one of the congres­sional candidates.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The destruction of the com­munication
facilities of RCPI and of the Bureau of Telecommunication in <span class="SpellE">Basco</span>, as well as of the radio phone of the Weather Bureau
Station; the immobilization of practically all government and private motor
vehicles, including those belonging to the Bureau of Public Highways and Bureau
of Public Works, the Provincial Governor, the Superintendent of Schools and the
Provincial Hospital ambulance; the presence of a private plane squatting across
the runway of the <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> Airport since November 8,
1969; the unexplained presence of unidentified ships in the waters of <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span>; the mysterious trips of a helicopter; the frisking
of all arrivals by PAL in search of arms; the checkpoints manned by PC Special
Forces whose presence in <span class="SpellE">Batanas</span> had not been re­ported
to the Commission on Elections in Manila, and as a matter of fact, the Commis­sion
had grounded the use of these PC Special Forces in <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span> and in all other places where their
presence had been re­ported to the Commission before election and on election
day; checkpoints which prevented the free movement of not only the government
officials including the Governor but also of the Bishop of <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span>
who headed the CNEA in said province; the precision in movements of these armed
goons who swooped down upon the helpless members of the board of inspectors,
and drove away the voters awaiting for their turn to vote, destroying or
burning the ballots validly cast and filling in the unused ballots with the
name of their candidate - all of these occur­rences and happenings formed part
of a common pattern joined together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle which when seen
separately are meaningless and incomprehensible but put together reveal a
picture so awesome and appalling, clearly pointing to the rape of democra­cy in
<span class="SpellE">Batanes</span> on November 11, 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Appendix "Y" of Antonio's
Petition, pp. 31-33)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Petitioner
Antonio actually rests his case on the arguments that all the questioned
returns appear clean and regular on their face; that the Board of Provincial
Canvassers was regularly constituted; that the validity of the questioned
returns was not raised at any time during, the canvass, which resulted in
petitioner's proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From these
premises, he avers first of all that only the House Electoral Tribunal, and not
the COMELEC, can review and set aside such canvass and proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet he admits that under the repeated rulings
of this Court the COMELEC can set aside an illegal proclamation such as one
based on incomplete or tampered returns (Petitioner's memorandum, page 3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over and over, in fact, has this Court held
that it is the duty of canvassers to be satisfied of the genuineness of the
returns, that the papers presented to them are not forged or spurious.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">If the COMELEC in the
exercise of its duties under Section 3 of the Revised Election Code, can
require Boards of Canvassers to consider only <u>genuine</u> and <u>authentic</u>,
not falsified, returns, it can logically require such boards to exclude from
the canvass any returns that were actually the product of coercion, even if
they be clean in their face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Direct
authority to this effect is our decision in Pacts vs. COMELEC, L-29026, </span><st1:date year="1968" day="28" month="9"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">28 September 1968</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, 25 SCRA, page 377, where we specifically ruled as
follows:</span></p>

<blockquote>"We must now say that an election return prepared at the point
of a gun is no return at all; it is not one notch above a falsified or spurious
return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
was correct in ruling that there was no valid return for the office of Mayor at
Precinct 22 and that no vote should be counted for said precinct in the canvass
of votes for Mayor."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On the
strength of <span class="SpellE">Angara</span> vs. Electoral Commission (1936) 63
Phil. 139, petitioner Antonio urges that the Electoral Tribunal of the House
has, under the Constitution, exclusive jurisdiction to pass upon and determine
the election, <u>returns</u> and qualifications of the members of the House of
Representatives, and that such grant of power is intended to be as complete and
unimpaired as if it had remained originally in the legislature; "and this
is as effective a restriction upon the legislative power as an express
prohibition in the Constitution" (<span class="SpellE">cas</span>. cit.,
page 176).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the <span class="SpellE"><u>Angara</u></span>
case did not involve any conflict between the Com­mission on Elections and the
Electoral Tribunals, neither of which existed when that decision was rendered;
and the fact that the powers of the Electoral Commission (now replaced by the
House and Senate Electoral Tribunals) restrict and exclude the <u>legislative
power</u> in matters concerning the election, returns and qualifications of the
members of the House in election contests, does not mean that the COMELEC may
not now exercise its constitutional power to "enforce and administer all
laws relative to the conduct of elections" , and, in the course thereof,
to require that canvassers base their proclamations only on genuine, authentic
and <span class="SpellE">untampered</span> returns, and annul any pro­clamations
departing from this rule.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"'The purpose of the Revised Election Code is to protect the
integrity of the elections and to suppress all evils that may vitiate its
purity and defeat the will of the voters.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The purity of the elections is one of the most fundamental re­quisites

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The true
measure of the jurisdiction of the House and Senate Electoral Tribunals was set
in our decision in Vera vs. <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>, 77 Phil. 192,
200, to the effect that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The Convention, however, bent on circums­cribing the latter's
authority to contest’ relating to the election, etc. altered the draft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Convention did not intend to give it <u>all
the</u> functions of the Assembly on the subject election and qualifica­tions
of its members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The distinction is not
without a difference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'As used in
constitutional provisions', election contest 'relates only to statutory
contests in which the contestant seeks not only to oust the intruder, but also
to have himself inducted into office. ' (Laurel on Elections, Second Edi­tion,
p. 250; 20 C.J., 58.) "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In
harmony with this principle, Section 182 of the Election Code provides that
"in contests under their respective jurisdictions the Electoral tribunals
of the Senate and the House of Representatives shall have and exercise the same
powers which the law confers upon the Courts …”, it being well-known that the
exercise of judicial powers are called for only upon the filing of the
corresponding petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Until a regular
protest or contest is filed, therefore, the jurisdiction of the Electoral
Tribunals does not come into play in order to exclude the authority of the
COMELEC.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thus,
the power of the COMELEC to set aside returns that are falsi­fied or are not
authentic and genuine and to order the same excluded from a canvass is distinct
and separate from the authority inherent in the Electoral Tribunals of the
House or the Senate, in the course of an electoral protest, to set aside such
returns whenever the statements of votes cast contained therein do not tally
with the valid votes enclosed within the ballot boxes themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No conflict of jurisdiction can arise since
the powers of the COMELEC and the Electoral Tribunals are exercised on dif­ferent
occasions and for different purposes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The COMELEC is not concerned with the veracity of the returns, but with
their genuineness and regularity; and it is self-evident that a return
accomplished by the election inspectors under threats and coercion by armed men
is in law no return at all that the canvassers may take into account.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> As a corollary, the COMELEC
can sat aside an improper canvass, as well as the resulting proclamation, and
this Court has repeatedly so ruled</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.</span></p>

<blockquote>"’These cases, however, are not to be read <u>as throwing
overboard <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> authority to inquire into whether
or not a proclamation is null and void</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For, these cases merely emphasize the <u>rule</u> that <u>where a
proclamation is validly made ERRORS in the proclamation main only be raised in
a full-dress election protest.</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>“’ The ratiocination advanced by petitioner fails to take stock of
the fact that <u>where a proclamation is null and void, that proclamation is no
proclama­tion at all</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
axiomatic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be remembered is <span class="SpellE"><u>Mutuc</u></span><u> v. Commission on Elections, supra</u>,
citing <span class="SpellE"><u>Demafiles</u></span><u> vs. Commission on
Elections, supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our ruling there
is this: ' It is indeed true that after proclamation the usual remedy of any
party aggrieved in an election is to be found in an election protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>But that is so only on the assumption that
there has been a valid proclamation</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Where as in this case at bar the <u>proclamation</u> itself is <u>illegal
the assumption of office cannot in any way affect the basic issues.</u> '
(Ibid) "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It may
be that the canvassers were not, at the time of the canvass, aware that the
returns were coerced; that may relieve them from liability but does not
validate such returns, nor prevent the COMELEC from sub­sequently voiding them
and ordering a new canvass whenever said body is satisfied of the compulsive
character of the returns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is
urged that the respondents <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> and <span class="SpellE">Agudo</span> are in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> from
questioning these coerced returns because of their failure to attend the
canvassing and there to object to them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We find this contention untena­ble in view of the circumstances then
prevailing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only was <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> sick at the time, but no adequate term was given for
him to attend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In truth, the canvass was
so precipitately conducted [starting at eight o'clock in the evening of the day
following the election (12 November 1969) and completed at 3 o'clock of the
following afternoon] that three of the <u>de <span class="SpellE">jure</span></u>
members of the Provincial Board of Canvassers had, like­wise, no opportunity to
be present, and their substitutes were appointed without even attempting to
secure from the COMELEC an order for their substitution, as required by section
159 of the Election Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reading of
the minutes of the canvass proceedings leaves no doubt that the short notices (barely
an hour) given to Vice-Governor <span class="SpellE">Gato</span> and two members
of the Provincial Board were expressly designed to prevent their attend­ance,
and this maneuver would suffice to annul the canvass (Pacts vs. COMELEC, <u>ante</u>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In
addition, some of the returns considered by the canvassers were plainly irregular
on their face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, for example, the
returns for Precinct 1 of <span class="SpellE">Sabtang</span> showed only the
signatures of <u>two</u> inspectors (See the photograph, <span class="SpellE">Abad's</span>
Answer, Annex "D"); that of Precinct 2 of <span class="SpellE">Sabtang</span>
(do, Annex "E") showed no count of the valid and spoiled ballots, nor
did it show any votes for Senators; that of Precinct II -A of <span class="SpellE">Itbayat</span> contained an erasure by cancellation and a
correction without initials (Annex "F"), and the same is true of the
return for Precinct 1 of <span class="SpellE">Ivana</span>, where the votes of
Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> for senator (224) appear can­celled
without initials or explanation (Annex "J").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the return for Precinct 2 of <span class="SpellE">Mahatao</span> (<span class="SpellE">Annex"H</span>"), an
equally patent anomaly appears: the votes for candidates <span class="SpellE">Abad</span>
(Jorge), <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> (<span class="SpellE">Senen</span>), <span class="SpellE">Agudo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Villalva</span> are set down
as "One" in letters and eleven (11) in figures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, despite such blatant anomalies, all
these returns were improperly considered regular by the canvassers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hitherto, in <span class="SpellE">Solidum</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Macalalag</span>, L-28666, 20 May 1969, 28 SCRA 200; <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Salanga</span>, L-22335, 31
December 1965, 1965, 15 SCRA 704, and Javier vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
L-22248, 30 January 1965, 13 SCRA 156, we have ruled that failure to
investigate and to disregard patent irregularities, such as these, authorizes
the COMELEC to annul the canvass and resulting proclamation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">To cap
it all, there is the testimony of Governor <span class="SpellE">Agudo</span>,
himself a member of the Board of Canvassers, that in <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span>
"there was terror­ism before, during and after the elections".</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">All these
circumstances, precipitate canvassing, terrorism, lack of sufficient notice to
members of the Board, and disregard of manifest irregularities on the face of
the questioned returns, build up to prove that the alleged canvassing was mere
ceremony that was predetermined and manipulated to result in nothing but the
hurried proclamation of peti­tioner Antonio as Congressman-elect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also establish convincingly that
whatever objections to the returns could have been interposed by the respondent
candidates, had they been given opportunity to do so, would have been useless,
and would not have been considered nor varied the result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wherefore, the failure of respondents to
interpose seasonable objection at the canvassing aforesaid could not have
amounted to either <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> or waiver of their rights
to object to the questioned returns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Finally,
Antonio's argument that <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> waived the remedy sought
from the COMELEC by filing an unconditional protest with the House Electoral
Tribunal on 28 November need not give pause: for the Electoral Tribunal itself
admitted <span class="SpellE">Abad's</span> amended protest, recognized that the
protest was filed <u>ex abundance <span class="SpellE">cautela</span></u> and,
upon <span class="SpellE">Abad's</span> motion, held further proceed­ings in
abeyance "until after the Commission on Elections has resolved the matter
or matters now pending before it".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The House Electoral Tribunal, in other words, recognized the
jurisdiction of the COMELEC, and beyond that this Tribunal is not called upon
to go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, a <span class="SpellE">cautelary</span>
protest does not deprive the COMELEC of its jurisdiction.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Nor is
petitioner's case bolstered by his taking an oath of office on </span><st1:date year="1969" day="30" month="11"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">30 November 1969</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Where
the proclamation itself is illegal, the assump­tion of office can not in any
way affect the basic issues" (<span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> vs. COMELEC,
G. R. L-28517, 21 February 1968, 22 SCRA 662).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In case
G. R. No. L-31609, candidate Renee <span class="SpellE">Agudo</span> appealed
from the COMELEC resolution in so far as the same ordered the Provincial Board
of Canvassers to reconvene and canvass the returns from those precincts not
affected by terrorism and to proclaim the winner on the basis of such
returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Agudo</span>
takes the position that, since the votes recorded (1,363) for all the precincts
of <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> and precinct 4 of <span class="SpellE">Sabtang</span>,
and reported for the only precincts not questioned, represent only 28% of the
total registered voters, the proper course of the COMELEC is to certify to a
failure of election in order that a special election may be called.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Implicit
in the stand taken by respondent <span class="SpellE">Agudo</span> is the
assumption that for a candidate to be elected, he should receive the votes of a
majority of the registered electors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This thesis finds no support in our election laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no provision in our election
statutes declaring that a majority of the registered voters must cast their
votes, or that a winning candidate must receive a majority of the votes of the
registered electors, or a majority of the votes cast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only mention in the Election Code of the
number of votes required of a congressional candidate is in section 165,
providing that if from the canvass "it should appear that 2 or more have
received the <u>largest number of votes</u>", then the canvassers shall
draw lots and "shall proclaim as elected that candidate who may be favored
by luck, and the candidate so proclaimed shall have the right to assume office <u>in
the same manner as if he had been elected by a plurality vote”</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A plurality of valid votes, therefore, is all
that is required in order that a candidate may win the election, even if he
obtains less than an actual majority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is, likewise,
our view that the certification prayed for by res­pondent <span class="SpellE">Agudo</span>
is not within the powers of the COMELEC to make.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well to recall here that the Commission
is constitutionally charged with the "enforcement and administration of
all laws relative to the <u>conduct</u> of the elections" (Article X,
section 2, Constitution).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Cons­titution
also empowers the COMELEC to "decide, save those involving the right to
vote, all administrative questions affecting elections", all with a view
to ensuring "free, orderly and honest elections".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We seriously doubt that a declaration of a
failure to elect, notwithstanding the fact that 1,363 valid votes have been
cast and counted, can be considered an "administrative question" that
the COMELEC has power to decide. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Such a
certification has no bearing on the <u>conduct</u> of the elections or the elec­toral
process, but concerns the <u>results</u> thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would bring about the invalidation or
nullification of the votes validly cast in the uncontested precincts,
effectively disenfranchising the voters who cast them; and this Court has
already ruled that "the power to decide election contests" (which is
avowedly not lodged in the COMELEC)"includes the power to determine the
validity or nullity of the votes questioned by either of the contestants."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Be that
as it may, all doubts on the question can be set at rest by resorting to the
provisions of Section 177 of the Election Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It pres­cribes that it is for the Court taking cognizance of an <u>election
protest</u> to "declare who among the parties had been elected, or, in the
proper case <u>that none of them has been legally elected</u>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the Electoral Tribunals of Congress,
pursuant to Section 182 of the Election Code, "shall have and exercise the
same powers which the law confers upon the Courts, it becomes plain that the
declaration of a failure to elect must, in the case, be sought from the
Electoral Tribunal of the House and in the appropriate election contest,
because such failure can only mean that none of the competing candidates has
been legally elected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To give way to a
protest wherein such declaration can be made, a winner must be proclaimed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The
Justices are unanimous in the conclusion that the procla­mation of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> S. Antonio, Jr. was correctly and properly annulled
and set aside by the Commission on Elections in view of the large scale and
unprecedented terrorism practiced by armed goons in favor of said candidate,
and, therefore, the action of the Commission must be; and is, affirmed in this respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The justices are, however, evenly divided on
the issue whether the COMELEC should have ordered, as it did, a <span class="SpellE">recanvass</span> and proclamation on the basis of the returns for
Precincts 1, 1A, 2, 3, 3A, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> and
No. 4 of <span class="SpellE">Sabtang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Five justices, including the writer of this opinion, believe that such a
proclamation is a necessary precedent to a protest in the Electoral Tribunal of
the House, wherein the question of failure to elect may be resolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Five other Justices dissent, believing that
the proclamation ordered by COMELEC is improper under the circumstances, and
that the COMELEC should confine itself to declaring a failure of election and
to cer­tifying the matter to the House Electoral Tribunal or, as proposed by
Mr. Justice Enrique Fernando, to the House of Representatives direct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the Rules of Court (Section 11, Rule
56), a rehearing on this second point must be had.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, the petition of candidate <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> S. Antonio is hereby dismissed, and the order of
COMELEC invalidating his proclamation is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the petition of candidate <span class="SpellE">Agudo</span> that COMELEC certify a failure of election and
recommend the holding of a special election, as well as the petition of
candidate <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> that a proclamation be ordered made on
the basis of the valid returns, are ordered set for <span class="SpellE">reargument</span>
and new hearing as soon as practicable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FERNANDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">To the
extent that the ably-written opinion of Justice J. B. L. Reyes sustains the
resolution of the respondent Commission on Elections annulling the proclamation
of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> S. Antonio, Jr., I am in full
agreement and vote accordingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
with regret, however, that I find myself unable to agree with its conclusion,
affirming the resolution of a majority of respondent Commission ordering the
Provincial Board of Canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span>, to convene
immediately and <span class="SpellE">recanvass</span> the results of the election
for the lone congressional district of the province of <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span>
on the basis of the returns for precincts 1, 1A, 2, 3, 3A, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> and precinct 4 of <span class="SpellE">Sabtang</span>
and to proclaim the winner as a result of such <span class="SpellE">recanvass</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is to be admitted that there was no
failure to abide by our previous decisions of pertinence and relevance, there
is, to my mind, the unique fact of the mass coercion and terrorism employed
during the day of election on </span><st1:date year="1969" day="11" month="11"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">November 11, 1969</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, so vividly placed on
record in the challenged resolution of the respondent Commission on
Elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That, for me at least, calls
for a departure from our previous decisions cited in support of the opinion of
the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is much in the equally
lucid separate opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> that
calls for approval, but, for reasons hereafter to be set forth, I cannot
likewise yield assent to his conclusion that the ultimate resolution of the
question as to who should be declared the duly elected Congressman for <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span> should be left to the House Electoral
Tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this separate
concurring and dissenting opinion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The opinion of Justice Reyes
quotes from the finding of facts a respondent Commission, which for us is
conclusive, the following: “ 'It would appear quite clear to the Commission
that what transpired inside the polling place in <span class="SpellE">Itbayat</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Uyugan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ivana</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mahatao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sabtang</span>, except
Precinct 4 on election day, particularly in regard to the preparation of the
returns in these precincts through the intervention or upon the dictation of
armed goons, was the culmination of an operation which had for its objective
the election of one of the congressional candidates.' " After particularizing
the destruction of the communication facilities; the immobilization of
practically all government and private motor vehicles; the presence of a
private plane squatting across the runway of the <span class="SpellE">Basco</span>
Airport since November 8, 1969; the unexplained presence of unidentified ships
in the waters of <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span>; the mysterious trips of a
helicopter; the frisking of all arrivals by PAL in search of arms; the
checkpoints manned by PC Special Forces whose presence in <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span>
had not even been reported to it; check­points which prevented the free
movement of government officials including the Governor; "the precision in
movement of such armed goons who swooped down upon the helpless members of the
board of inspectors, and drove away the voters awaiting for their turn to vote,
destroying or burning the ballots validly cast and filling in the unused
ballots with the name of their candidate," respondent Commission, as noted
in the opinion of Justice Reyes, appeared to be more than justified in
concluding, "all of these occurrences and happenings formed part of a
common pattern joined together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle which when seen
separately are meaningless and incomprehensible but put together reveal a
picture so awesome and appalling, clearly pointing to the rape of democracy in <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span> on November 11, 1969." The choice of words
while quite emphatic cannot very well be characterized as an exercise in
hyperbole.</span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">There has been of late on our
part, especially so since <span class="SpellE">Cauton</span> v. Commission on
Elections,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> a
marked recognition of the broad power of respondent Commission to assure that
the canvassing and proclamation reflect with fidelity and accuracy the true
results of an election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereby there
may be an approximation of the constitutional objective of insuring that it would
be "free, orderly, and honest."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The underlying assumption, it would appear to me, is that the electors are able
to cast their votes, thereafter to be counted by the boards of inspectors,
preparatory to their being canvassed so that the proclamation could be
made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the facts contradict such an
assumption as in this case, the term used by respondent Commission, "rape
of democracy" depicting the tragic plight of the voters on election day,
then cannot see my way clear to according the seal of our approval to the
conclusion reached by the majority of respondent Commission that under the
unique circumstances thus disclosed, there could be a valid canvassing and
proclamation.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">3.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Nor is this to lose sight of the
fact that the returns for precincts 1, 1A, 2, 3, 3A, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> as well as precinct 4 of <span class="SpellE">Sabtang</span>
could be utilized for the purpose of the canvass and the subsequent
proclamation of the candidate elected as congressman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What appears for me decisive is that more
than a majority of the electors were prevented from exercising their right to
vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is equivalent to no election
at all having been <span class="SpellE">heId</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it would appear likewise for Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>, in whose separate opinion Justice Castro joins:
"Here, more than two-thirds of the returned votes <span class="SpellE">totalling</span>
4,499 had likewise been rejected for intimidation and coercion of the
inspectors, such that the less than one-third remainder of 1,363 votes did not
constitute a valid constituency for a valid election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
majority admitted as much, recognizing that 'the remaining returns constitute
only 28% of the constituency.' Dissenting Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Miraflor</span>
gave in addition the figures from the 1953 to the 1967 elections showing <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the average percentage of voting in <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span> to be 85% of the registered voters, and remarking
that '(T)he popular will is expressed by such stable and regular percentages of
voting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applying these percentages of
voting in past elections to the 1969 elections, of the 4,866 registered voters
as reported by the election registrars, around 85% or 4),137 would have cast
their votes in the 1969 elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
me, the results of only 10 out of 31 precincts, or of 1,363 votes out of 4,137
possible actual voters, or of 32.94% of the voters voting is not indicative of
the popular will of the people of <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span>.'"</span></p>

as to who their Congressman shall be considering what did transpire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we pointed out in a recent case: "A

consent of the people, consent freely given, intelligently arrived at, honestly
recorded, and thereafter counted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only

authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is their undeniable right

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The
words of Justice Laurel are equally apposite: "As long as popular
government is an end to be achieved and safeguarded, suffrage, whatever may be
the modality and form devised, must continue to be the means by which the great
reservoir of power must be emptied into the <span class="SpellE">receptacular</span>
agencies wrought by the people through their Constitution in the interest of
good government and the common weal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Republicanism, in so far as it implies the adoption of a representative
type of government, necessarily points to the enfranchised citizen as a
particle of popular sovereignty and as the ultimate source of the established
authority."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">If on the undisputed facts,
the wishes of more than a majority of the enfranchised citizens of <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span>, would not even be taken into account, then for me
less than full respect is accorded to one of the most fundamental principles of
our Constitution.</span></p>

<p class="NUM">5. What is to be done then? Considering that under the view I take
of the case, in the light of the incontrovertible facts so meticulously and
vividly spelled out by the respondent Commission, it should certify to Congress
that unfortunately the right to vote was frustrated and nullified so that the
appropriate remedial measure in the form of a new election could be provided
for by appropriate legislation Vast and extensive are indeed the implications
flowing from the generous grant under the Constitution to respondent Commission
to "have exclusive charge of the enforcement and administration of all
laws relative to the conduct of elections" and to "exercise all other
functions which may be conferred upon it by law."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Thereby the totality of the executive power heretofore exercised by the
President insofar as the execution of such statutes is concerned is transferred
to an independent constitutional agency to assure that there be neutrality and
impartiality and thus safeguard the right of suffrage from being reduced to a
farce or mockery.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It could happen though, as it did happen in this instance, that notwithstanding
the firmness and vigor with which respondent Commission pursued measures to
live up to such delicate responsibility, forces, which it could not anticipate
and beyond its control, could impress on its efforts the doom of futility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could very well be of course that natural
or <span class="SpellE">fortuituous</span> causes could have led to a similar
result of no election having taken place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that here the cause for such frustration of the electoral
powers was man-made should not, for me, call for a distinction as to the legal
consequence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">To be
more specific, respondent Commission is required to submit to the President and
the Congress, "following each election, a report on the manner in which
such election was conducted."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> In compliance with such
constitutional duty, all that respondent Commission has to do is to acquaint
the President and the Congress of what did happen in <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span>
on November 11, 1968, as found by it after due hearing and embodied in its
resolution now before us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
indeed, in the vivid language of respondent Commission, "the rape of
democracy."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Such
being the case, Congress can be trusted to act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is the sole agency that under the Constitution can provide for the
holding of an election that would thus give the opportunity for all qualified
electors of <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span> so-minded to make full use of
their basic right to vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power to
call for a special election and when it shall be held is legislative in
character.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> It appears clear to me that
upon Congress being officially informed in accordance with the above
constitutional provision of what occurred in <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span>,
tragic in its implications for the rule of law, it can be expected in turn to
remedy matters in the only way that the situation calls for, the enactment of a
measure as to when the voters of that province will have their right of
suffrage truly respected and given force and <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That, for me at least, is the appropriate
response to the unique situation that, it is to be hoped, will not be repeated.</span></p>

<p class="NUM">6. It is in the light of the above that I find myself unable to go
along with Justices <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> and Castro, with whose
opinion I am in the main in agreement, as to their conclusion that the ultimate
disposition of the matter should be left to the House Electoral Tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While not devoid of merit such an approach
would for me entail further delay, which could be avoided, as it is not
improbable that after due hearing the House Electoral Tribunal would arrive at
a similar conclusion reached by respondent Commission as to no election having
in fact taken place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, I am not
fully convinced that the House Electoral Tribunal could assume jurisdiction in
the absence of a valid proclamation of the winning candidate, a prerequisite
which from the view I have of the case cannot be validly satisfied.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

his proclamation on November 13, 1969, by the Provin­cial Board of Canvassers
as the winning candidate for the lone Congressional district of <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span>, on the ground that such annul­ment was beyond the
jurisdiction and authority of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, contending
that "Where there is no objection during the canvass, which is completed
with due regularity, and the proclamation is made, any action to correct the
canvass and set aside the pro­clamation would fall within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Elec­toral<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tribunal."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The
fallacy of petitioner Antonio's contention lies in his failure to consider one
overriding factor, <span class="SpellE">i</span>. e. the undisputed finding of
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, after the hearings held by it upon com­plaints
of his two principal opponents, Liberal Party official can­didate Jorge <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party
official candidate Renee <span class="SpellE">Agudo</span>, in discharge of its
constitutional duty of enforcing and ad­ministering our laws relative to the
conduct of elections for the Purpose of insuring free, orderly and honest
elections, that the proclamation of petitioner Antonio was based upon
twenty-one (21) void gun-point returns, out of a total of thirty-one (31)
returns of the province.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> finding
was that Election Day in 5 out of 6 towns in <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span>
"involved a wholesale operation to frustrate the popular will through the
use of returns extracted at the point of a gun from helpless boards of
inspectors and that the techniques and methods used by the malefactors to
achieve their ends (were) most sophisticated and devastatingly effective."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">An
illegal proclamation based on spurious or manufactured returns, be they returns
manufactured by criminal collusion of the inspectors or at the point of a gun

</span>Petitioner Antonio himself concedes "that the <span class="SpellE">Corn­elec</span>

or had no quorum or did not meet at all."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> And certainly, as we said

on the assumption that the proclamation is valid petitioner's case still fails.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For procla­mation is in umbilical dependence
upon the returns." Where the canvass and proclamation, otherwise regular
and valid, were based on spurious returns, the canvass and proclamation must
likewise be held to be equally spurious.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This

Antonio's contention that simply because no ob­jection was made by his

this Court up­held the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> resolution (issued on
April 27, 1968) and sus­tained its jurisdiction in giving due course more than
five (5) months after the proclamation (on November 21, 1967) to the
respondent-complainant <span class="SpellE">Balindong's</span> petition filed (on
January 6, 1968) with <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> one and a half (I -1/2)
months after the pro­clamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> had ordered the opening of the ballot box to
determine the genuineness of a decisive election return, a tampered copy of
which was used in the proclamation, not­withstanding that the two-weeks period
from proclamation, allowed for protests, had long elapsed, and therein
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Aguam</span> had assumed (on December 30, 1967)
the questioned office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We reiter­ated
therein the rule that "where, as in the case at bar, the pro­clamation
itself is illegal, the assumption of office cannot in any way affect the basic
issues." With the annulment of the procla­mation, notwithstanding that
respondent <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>, as in this case, had no
material time and opportunity to question the inclusion of the disputed return
during the canvassing, respondent <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span> was
eventually ordered proclaimed by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> and
assumed the office.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">To be
sure, a plurality of valid votes is all that is required in order that a
candidate may win the election, regardless of the actual number of ballots
cast, but this principle is qualified by the important condition that it must
be a plurality of valid votes of <u>a valid constituency</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The House Electoral Tribunal as the
"sole judge" of House election contests, has in <span class="SpellE">Soliman</span>

subject of the protests, adopted the doctrine that at least over half of the
total votes of a district must not have been rejected for intimidation or
similar causes in order that there may remain a valid constituency, citing
Hind's Precedents that “when <u>two-thirds of the returned votes</u> of a
district had been rejected for intimidation, the remainder did not constitute a
valid constituency and (that) there had been no valid election," and that
"the House declared vacant a seat in a case wherein over half of the total
votes of a district had been re­jected for intimidation."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Here,

for intimidation and coercion of the inspectors, such that the less than
one-third remainder of 1,363 votes did not constitute a valid constituency for
a valid elec­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> majority admitted as much, recognizing that
"the remaining returns . . . constitute only 28% of the
constituency." Dissenting Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Miraflor</span>
gave in addition the figures from the 1953 to the 1967 elections showing <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the average per­centage of voting in <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span> to be 85% of the registered voters, and remarking
that "(T)he popular will is expressed by such stable and regular
percentages of voting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applying these
percentages of voting in past elections to the 1969 elections, of the 4,866
registered voters as reported by the election registrars, around 85% or 4,137

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Abad</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> would claim that there was a valid constituency claim­ing that
"there were 946 registered voters who actually voted freely in 19 of the
21 questioned precincts before the armed goons arrived and disrupted the
electoral processes" and "adding 1363 and 946 gives a total of 2,309
qualified electors who were able to validly vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is 55.8% or a clear majority of 4,137,

this contention: (a) 826 out of these 946 votes cast before the dis­ruption of
the electoral processes by the armed goons were cast in three (3) precincts of <span class="SpellE">Ivana</span> and three (3) precincts of <span class="SpellE">Mahatao</span>
or a total of 6 precincts out of twenty-one (21) precincts where the re -turns
were falsified; in the other fifteen (15) precincts, only 8 to 10 votes were
cast, and the voting was then stopped; (b) all these 946 votes were destroyed
or burned by the armed goons, and it is now impossible to determine for whom
they were cast; they cer­tainly represent a sizeable black more than sufficient
to overcome the-306-vote margin of <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> over his
nearest rival, <span class="SpellE">Agudo</span>, (709 against 403) from the
remaining 1,363 valid votes; and (c) more than two-thirds of the expected 85%
or 4,137 probable voters were prevented from casting their votes or had their
votes nullified (4,137 less 1,363 - 2, 774).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even if all these 2,774 voters, and not only 946 voters were able to
cast their votes before the forcible disruption of the proceedings and the
taking over of the precincts by the armed goons, <span class="SpellE">Abad's</span>
contention would be untenable, for it is precisely the blocking and destruction
of the valid votes of said 2,774 voters that nullified the election and left it
impossible to determine the popular will and vote from the remaining less than
one-third 1,363 votes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

close its eyes to the hard facts and to require the canvassing board
nevertheless to canvass the remaining ten precincts and <u>fictionally</u>
proclaim respondent <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> with 709 votes as having

itself confessed that this was revolting to the very essence of our system of

majority in their Resolution urges the House Electoral Tribunal to annul the
election, stating expressly that "(P)<span class="SpellE">erhaps</span> a
proclama­tion of the Board of Canvassers of the winning candidate, which shows

the Constitution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> lapse is caused by its thinking that it has no

election in <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span> in the sense that the popular
will of the electo­rate could not be determined and is not reflected in the
valid votes remaining." This is one step short of <span class="SpellE">annuling</span>
the election and is the logical consequence of the development of our
jurisprudence since <span class="SpellE"><u>Lagumbay</u></span>, based on <span class="SpellE"><u>Nacionalista</u></span><u> Party</u>, decreeing the re­jection
of "obviously manufactured returns,' down to <span class="SpellE"><u>Pacis</u></span>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Comelec</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> has properly resolved the matter of the nullity of the proclamation of

election in the province as the less than one-third of the electorate that was
able to record its votes per the remaining valid returns in the lone town of <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> did not constitute a valid constituency, it should
refrain from any resolution of the equally important matter of non-election
through the sham proclamation ordered by it from the votes of the admittedly
non-valid constituency, but certify the plain fact of failure of elec­tion and
forward its records to the House Electoral Tribunal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of course be asked: with the annulment of Antonio's proclamation, the <span class="SpellE">cautelary</span> protest of <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> against
him has become moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
presents no legal obstacle to the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> certifying
the plain fact of failure of election and forwarding its records to the House
Electoral Tribunal, in the docketed case of <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> or

candidates, parti­cularly, Antonio, <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> and <span class="SpellE">Agudo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect,
the Electoral Tribunal will have before it a three-pronged contest, with
Antonio claiming that there was a valid election in the entire province and he
was the winner, <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> claiming in turn there was a
valid election only in the town of <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> and one
precinct in the town of <span class="SpellE">Sabtang</span> and that the
remaining votes recorded therein constituted a valid constituency with himself

there was no winner clue to the failure of the election.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the formal declaration of nullity of the election per the sufficient cue"
given by the <span class="SpellE">Com­elec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or it may choose to disregard its doctrine
that where more than half of the votes cast in an election has been annulled,
the remainder does not constitute a valid constituency and proclaim <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> nevertheless as the winner by a plurality of the
remaining votes, insignificant though they may be and non-expressive of the
will of the electorate of the entire province.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Or it may check the veracity of all the returns themselves in accordance
with its exclusive prerogative by going into the primary evidence of the ballot
boxes and examining the ballots themselves, and verifying whether it could
retrieve a sufficient number of valid ballots to constitute a valid
constituency.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I vote,

basis of the remaining returns for nine precincts of <span class="SpellE">Basco</span>
