the Workmen's Compensation Commission, hereinafter referred to as respondent

Regional Office No. IV, Department of Labor, in R04-WCC Case No. 139123,
granting disability compensation <span class="GramE">benefits</span> to claimant <span class="SpellE">Dionisia</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span>

<st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>, was employed by San Miguel
Corporation, hereinafter referred to as respondent employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He started in 1940 as a laborer and
subsequently became a forklift operator, which position he held up to <st1:date year="1970" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1970</st1:date> when his services were
terminated by respondent employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was then only over 50 years old.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1973</st1:date>,
he filed a claim for disability benefits with the Workmen's Compensation Unit
of the Department of Labor, Regional Office No. IV, claiming in substance that
he suffered hypertension and other illnesses in December, 1964, which illnesses
continued even until the filing of the compensation claim; and that he gave
notice thereof to his manager, orally and in writing, also in December, 1964
(p. 65, WCC rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His SSS medical
certificate dated December 18, 1972, which was made part of his compensation
claim, revealed a final diagnostic finding of hypertensive cardiovascular
disease, congestive heart failure, prognosis - poor, and nature of disability
as permanent total; and exact date of disability as July 9, 1970 (<u>id</u>.,
pp. 66-67).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The physician who prepared
the aforesaid certificate described claimant's condition as "from bad to
worse and needs complete rest and supplementary treatment" (<u>id</u>., p.

laid down by the Court in <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span>
<span class="SpellE">Calado</span> vs. WCC (38 SCRA 567 [1971]) to the effect
that sickness and death benefits are "distinct, separate and apart from
each other" (WCC rec. p. 37).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Acting Referee allowed the amendment and accordingly ordered on <st1:date year="1974" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1974</st1:date> the corresponding
change in the title of the claim to read as "<span class="SpellE">Dionisia</span>

of her minor children, claimants, vs. San Miguel Corporation, respondent"

<p class="BODY">On October 23, 1974, the Acting Referee, finding the claim not
only <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>, but also sufficiently
established and substantiated by the evidence on record, ordered respondent
employer to pay, among others, disability compensation benefits, but without
death benefits, in the amount of Six Thousand (P6,000.00) Pesos to claimant's
surviving spouse and minor children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Acting Referee did not order the payment of death benefits for the reason that
the death of <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
<st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> on <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1974</st1:date> was already more than two years after
his disability on <st1:date year="1970" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In so deciding, the Acting Referee declared:</p>

<blockquote>"The records show that the respondent was notified by
registered mail on <st1:date year="1973" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1973</st1:date>
of the present claim, but has not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To expedite this case, the parties
were given the opportunity to settle and the respondent offered the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as settlement which was refused by the claimant,
hence, this Decision.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering that there is no <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
in this case, an outright award may be given because the failure of the
respondent to controvert the present claim resulted in the 'loss of all its
non-jurisdictional defenses which include the admission of the compensability
of the present claim, its reasonableness and validity' (NDC vs. Esteban <span class="SpellE">Galamgam</span>, L-29634, April 29, 1971, citing numerous cases
earlier decided), and as such, claimant is entitled to 'disability benefits
from date of sickness or forced resignation to the time of his death, where
death took place after two years from date of sickness' (<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.

<blockquote>"An examination of the records of this case and the evidence
presented by claimant shows that even without lack of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
in this case, the present claim is sufficiently proved, based on the following:</blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p class="2Q">"' <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Santos worked with the SMC since 1940 as a laborer and on the date of his
separation on July 9, 1970 due to his advanced sickness of hypertension and
congestive heart disease, after a series of hospitalization at the company's
hospitals at <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> Medical Hospital, <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> Clinic and St. Joseph's Clinic, he was a forklift
operator earning P15.50 a day working six days a week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent was required to produce the
medical record of claimant but failed to do so.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In any event, claimant's medical evidence (Exhibits B, C, D, D-1 &amp;
D-2) show that claimant is a 'known case of hypertension' (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

heart failure manifested as <span class="SpellE">dyspsea</span> and leg

cases where illness supervened during the course of employment, the claimant is
relieved of the burden of proving causation, which is legally presumed and
cannot be overcome by testimony of doctors to the contrary, to wit:</blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p class="2Q">"'It is now well-settled that once it is established that the
illness supervened during employment, as in this case, there is a <span class="SpellE">rebuttable</span> presumption that such illness arose out of the
employment or was at least aggravated by it; and the employer has the burden of
proving the contrary by substantial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The mere opinion of its (employer) plant physician that there is no
causal connection cannot prevail over said presumption' (Maria Cristina
Fertilizer Corp. v. WCC, L-29998, Oct. 21, 1974; <span class="SpellE">Abana</span>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1975</st1:date>,
respondent employer filed a motion for reconsideration, claiming that the claim
was properly <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> and that there was lack of
causal connection between the illness that caused claimant's death and his
employment (pp. 7-21, WCC rec.).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner filed her opposition to the aforesaid motion maintaining that
the claim was compensable and <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> (pp.

<p class="BODY">Finding the motion without merit, the Acting Referee on <st1:date year="1975" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1975</st1:date> denied the motion

issue of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>, reversed the aforesaid <st1:date year="1975" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1975</st1:date> award and thereby
absolved respondent employer from liability <span style="">on the second issue raised - lack of causal connection between injury
that caused claimant's death and his employment with respondent employer, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Records show that the instant claim is anchored on the
deceased's alleged sickness of hypertension and other illnesses allegedly
acquired and/or either aggravated by or the result of the nature of the
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The illness of hypertension
is the transient elevation of blood pressure reading which is controllable by
proper food and medication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the
result of arteriosclerosis or the hardening of the blood vessel attributable to
hereditary and ageing process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to his
sickness of heart disease, there is no competent medical evidence to show that
an ECG examination was conducted on him prior to his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no competent medical evidence to
show that the deceased was suffering from any disabling illness which is
traceable to his employment, this Commission, believes that this claim is not
compensable under the law" (pp. 4-5, WCC rec.).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The records patently show, and WE so rule, that the respondent

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;" align="center">I</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In proceeding to reverse
the October 23, 1975 Award of the Acting Referee, without passing upon the
decisive issue of whether or not the finding of non-<span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
is factually and/or legally supported, the respondent Commission gravely abused
its discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the Acting
Referee's finding of non-<span class="SpellE">controversion</span> undisturbed,
respondent Commission was without jurisdiction to look into the substantial
merits of the claim, especially its compensability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is basic that the decisive point of
every compensation claim is its <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> or lack
of it as the issues and defenses that can be raised or availed of by the
employer in the proceedings are dependent on said <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
or non-<span class="SpellE">controversion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In a case of a <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> claim, the
employer is entitled to raise and present evidence on the issue of compensability;
while in a non-<span class="SpellE">controverted</span> claim, the employer,
unless its right to controvert is successfully reinstated, is barred from
raising that issue as the same is deemed waived or renounced by its <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> failure to controvert.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the respondent Commission had
no authority and therefore exceeded its jurisdiction <span style="">when </span>it proceeded to <span style="">favorably
</span>consider respondent employer's defense of non-compensability of the
illness of claimant without <u>a</u> <u><span style="">priori</span></u><span style=""> </span>finding of a valid <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records reveal that the respondent employer failed to timely,
properly and effectively controvert claimant's right to compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the Acting Referee made an express
finding on this matter, which on review by the respondent Commission was not
disturbed, as it passed upon it <u>sub</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>silentio</u></span>
despite the fact that the respondent employer squarely raised said question as
it claimed that it had <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> the claimant's
right to compensation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its comment before this Court, the respondent employer had
reiterated its claim that it <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> the
claimant's right to compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its
memorandum submitted pursuant to the resolution of this Court, however, it did
not pursue the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, it
posited the ingenious theory that since the respondent Commission had found
that the claimant did not suffer from any compensable illness or disease while
in the course of his employment with respondent employer, it was obvious that
the Workmen's Compensation Commission felt it unnecessary to discuss whether
the claim has been duly <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> or not since in
any compensation claim, the decisive factor is the existence of some illness or
disability on the part of the employee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Reduced simply, what respondent employer's counsel is saying is that <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> or lack of it is material or important only
when there is some compensable illness or disability. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Respondent employer's counsel is patently
wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For precisely, that <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> is the medium by which the employer must make
known its position on the claim -- whether it admits liability or disclaims
any.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It thus serves to join the issue of
the compensation case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>, to be exact, stands as the answer of the
employer to a compensation claim filed by an employee, which corresponds to the
complaint in an ordinary civil case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, it has been said that the language of Section 45 of the Workmen's
Compensation Act, as amended, on <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>, may
appear very sweeping and perhaps arbitrary to those who do not get the idea
behind it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The provision proceeds from
the assumption that as the employer has all the facilities which enable him, better
than the injured, to determine whether a claim against him would lie under the
circumstances attending any accident or ailment befalling the <span style="">worker, it is his </span>obligation to
apprise the Commission of his determination whether to contest or not the injured
worker's right to receive the benefits of the Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he sleeps on his right, he cannot
subsequently be heard to complain that the law is hard against him (<span class="SpellE">Morable</span> and <span class="SpellE">Inton</span>, The Workmen's
Compensation Act, p. 194).</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the argument of counsel for respondent employer
smacks of absurdity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For to follow his
theory is to permit an incongruous situation whereby an employer, suffering
from the predicament of non-<span class="SpellE">controversion</span>, is allowed
to cleanse himself thereof, by the simple expedient of permitting him to prove
a defense which in the first place had been foreclosed by his failure to
controvert.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">As </span>previously stated, the failure to
controvert results in the renunciation of defenses available to the employer,
including the defense that the illness subject matter of the claim is not
compensable.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the theory posed by counsel for respondent employer
will have the effect of relieving the defaulting employer of the effects and
consequences of non-<span class="SpellE">controversion</span> without complying
with the strict requirements of the Act on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the law, the employer's right <span style="">to controvert, lost by </span>non-compliance,
can be reinstated only upon a verified petition to that effect, specifying
therein the reason for its failure to controvert the right to compensation and
the grounds relied upon to defeat the claim if its right is restored (Sec. 45,
Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended; Sec. 3, Rule 10, 1973 Rules of the
WCC).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records of the instant case do
not show any petition to that effect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither does the respondent Commission refer to any; nor does the
respondent employer claim that it had successfully filed one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the respondent employer's right
of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> cannot be <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">motu</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> </span>reinstated or assumed
by the respondent Commission absent any motion for reinstatement; nor can it
look into the question of compensability of the illness of claimant without <u>a</u>
<u><span style="">priori</span></u><span style=""> </span>determination that the Acting Hearing
Officer's finding that the claim for compensation was <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>
is erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As long as the claim is <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>, the <span style="">issue
of </span>compensability is barred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
issue of compensability cannot be revived unless and until the right to
controvert is reinstated and exercised.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2. <span style=""> </span>Likewise on claimant's
side is the presumption of compensability which verily obtains in his favor as
it is undisputed that his illness supervened in the course of his employment
with respondent employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The </span>award of the Acting Referee has
adverted to this, laying as well the applicable law and jurisprudence on the
matter which, however, was conveniently overlooked by the respondent
Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this presumption,
respondent is burdened with the duty to overcome the same by substantial
evidence which it failed to do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
failure of respondent employer rendered the presumption of compensability, <span class="SpellE">rebuttable</span> <span style="">at its
inception, </span>conclusive (<span class="SpellE">Parian</span> vs. WCC, G.R.

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Verily, the nature of <span class="SpellE">Aniceto's</span> work as well as the pressure and the
environmental circumstances of his work caused the weakening of his body until
he developed hypertension and cardio-vascular disease that led to his
separation from the service by reason of disability and ultimately to his
death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not true as
declared by the respondent Commission that there was no competent medical
evidence to show that the deceased was suffering from any disabling illness
which is traceable to his employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Claimant's medical evidence was even mentioned by the Acting Referee in
his award as Exhibits B, C, D, C-1 &amp; D-2 (pp. 23, 24, 42-47, WCC rec.),
upon which he relied as respondent employer failed to produce claimant's<span style=""> </span>medical record in the possession of
the company's hospitals.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Parenthetically, this
Court hereby expresses its displeasure over the unexplained failure of
respondent employer to produce the medical record of the late <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Santos</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, despite the request of the Acting Referee
(Decision of the Acting Referee, p. 23, WCC rec.; pp. 12, 24 and 61,

his pleadings before the respondent Commission that <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span>

<span class="SpellE">x</span>." <span class="GramE">(p. 31, rec.; p. 40, WCC
rec.).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>No denial of this charge
came from respondent employer and its counsel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While this matter was not brought out squarely before US, WE noted it in
passing to impress upon employers and their lawyers that such actuations, if
true, serve to aggravate the sad plight of the lowly workers as well as to
hamper the prompt disposition of compensation claims, demanded by the social
justice guarantee enjoined by the supreme law of the land.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Acting Referee denied
the additional claim for death benefits for the reason that the death of the

on <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="6"><u>June 1, 1974</u></st1:date> took <span style="">place more than two years after his
disability on </span><st1:date year="1970" day="9" month="6"><span style="">June 9, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under Section 8 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, death
benefits may be awarded if the disease contracted or injury received by the
employee as provided by Section 2 causes his death within two years from the
date of such injury or sickness (disability).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His heirs, herein petitioners, were however granted disability benefits
from his disability on June 9, 1970 up to the time of his death on June 1,
1974.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner did not dispute the
award as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
