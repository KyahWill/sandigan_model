				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><h3></h3><p>This is a petition by certiorari for the review of the decision of the Court 
of Appeals affirming that of the Court of First Instance of Bulacan holding that 
the probate court in Special Proceeding 1101 had jurisdiction to determine the 
validity of the deed of donation in question and to pass upon the question of 
title or ownership of the properties mentioned therein. </p>
<p>The facts are briefly stated in the appealed decision of the Court of Appeals 
as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Eusebio Capili and Hermogena Reyes were husband and wife. The first died on 
July 27, 1958 and a testate proceeding for the settlement of his estate was 
instituted in the Court of First Instance of Bulacan. His will was admitted to 
probate on October 9, 1958, disposing of his properties in favor of his widow; 
his cousins Armando, Ursula, and Buenaventura, all surnamed Capili; and Arturo 
Deogracias and Eduardo, all sumamed Bernardo. Hermogena Reyes herself died on 
April 24, 1959. Upon petition of Deogracias Bernardo executor of the estate of 
the deceased Eusebio Capili, she was substituted by her collateral relatives and 
intestate heirs, namely, Marcos, Vicente, Francisco and Dominga, all surnamed 
Reyes; and Jose, Constancia Raymunda and Elena, all surnamed Isidoro. </p>
<p>"On June 12, 1959, the executor, filed a project partition in the testate 
proceeding in accordance with the terms of the will, adjudicating the estate of 
Eusebio Capili among the testamentary heirs with the exception of Hermogena 
Reyes, whose share was alloted to her collateral relatives aforementioned. On 
June 16, 1959 these relatives filed an opposition to the executor's project of 
partition and submitted a counter project of partition of their own, claiming 
1/2 of the properties mentioned in the will of the deceased Eusebio Capili on 
the theory that they belonged not to the latter alone but to the conjugal 
partnership of the spouses. </p>
<p>"The probate court, in two orders dated June 24,1959 and February 10, 1960, 
respectively, set the two projects of partition for hearing, at which evidence 
was presented by the parties, followed by the submission of memoranda 
discussing certain legal issues. In the memorandum for the executor and the 
instituted heirs it was contended: (1) that the properties disposed of in the 
will of the deceased Eusebio Capili belonged to him exclusively and not to the 
conjugal partnership, because Hermogena Reyes had donated to him her half share 
of such partnership; (2) that the collateral heirs of Hermogena Reyes had no 
'lawful standing or grounds' to question the validity of the donation; and (3) 
that even assuming that they could question the validity of the donation, the 
same must be litigated not in the testate proceeding but in a separate civil 
action. </p>
<p>"The oppositors and heirs of Hermogena Reyes, on their part, argued that the 
deed of donation itself was determinative of the original conjugal character of 
the properties, aside from the legal presumption laid down in Article 180 of the 
Civil Code, and that since the donation was null and void the deceased Eusebio 
Capili did not become owner of the share of his wife and therefore could not 
validly dispose of it in his will. </p>
<p>"On September 14, 1960, the probate court, the Honorable M. Mejia presiding, 
issued an order declaring the donation void without making any specifis finding 
as to its juridical nature, thai is, whether it was inter vivos or mortis causa, 
for the reason that, considered under the first category, it falls under Article 
133 or the Civil Code, which probihits donations between spouses during the 
marriage; and considered under the second category, it does not comply with the 
formalities of a will as required by Article 728 in relation to Article 805 of 
the same Code, there being no attestation clause. In the same order the court 
disapproved both projects of partition and directed the executor to file 
another, dividing the property mentioned in the last will and testament of the 
deceased Eusebio Capili and the properties mentioned in the deed of donation 
Exhibit B between the instituted heirs of the deceased Eusebio Capili and the 
legal heirs of the deceased Hermogena Reyes, upon the basis that the said 
properties were conjugal properties of the deceased spouses.' On September 27, 
1960, the executor filed a motion for new trial, reiterating and emphasizing the 
contention previously raised in their memorandum that the probate court had no 
juusdiction to take cognizance of the claim pf the legal hears of Hermogena 
Reyes involving title to the properties mentioned in the will of Eusebio Capili 
and taking exception to the Court's declaration of the nullity of the donation 
'without stating facts or provisions of law on which it was based.' The motion 
for new trial was denied in an order dated October 3, 1960."</p></blockquote>
<p>On appeal to the Court of Appeals the order appealed from being affirmed, 
petitioners filed this present petition for review by cetiorari. </p>
<p>The petitioners-appellants contend that the appellate court erred in not 
declaring that the probate court, having limited and special jurisdiction, had 
generally no power to adjudicate title and erred in applying the exception to 
the rule.</p>
<p>In a line of decisions, this Court has consistently held that as a general 
rule, question as to title to property cannot be passed upon in testate or 
intestate proeeadings,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> except where 
one of the parties prays merely for the inclusion or exclusion from the 
inventory of the property, in which case the probate court may pass 
provisionally upon the question without prejudice to its final determination in 
a separate action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> However, we.have 
also held that when the parties interested are all heirs of the deceased, it is 
optional to them to submit to the probate court a question as to title to 
property, and when so submitted, said probate court may definitely pass judgment 
thereon (Pascual vs. Pascual, 73 Phil. 561; Ma√±alac <span style="font-style: italic;">vs. </span>Ocampo, et al., 73 Phil. 
661); and that with the consent of the parties, matters affecting property 
under judicial administration may be taken cognizance of by the court in the 
course of intestate proceeding provided interests of third persons are not 
prejudiced (Cunanan vs. Amparo, 80 Phil. 229, 232).</p>
<p>In the light of this doctrine, may it be said correctly that the trial court 
as well as the Court of Appeals erred in upholding the power of the probate 
court in this case to adjudicate in the testate proceedings, the question as to 
whether the properties herein involved belong to the conjugal partnership of 
Eusebio Capili and Hermogena Reyes, or to the deceased husband exclusively? </p>
<p>At the outset, let it be clarified that the matter at issue is not a question 
of jurisdiction, in the sense advanced by appellants that the trial court had 
completely no authority to pass upon the title to the lands in dispute, and that 
its decision on the subject is null and void and does not bind even those who had invoked its authority and submitted to its decision, because, it is 
contended, jurisdiction is a creature of law and parties to an action can not 
vest, extend or broaden it. If appellants' contention is correct, then there can 
be no exception to the no-jurisdiction theory. But as has been stated in the 
case of Cunanan <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Amparo (supra) the Supreme Court speaking through Mr. 
Justice Pedro Tuason: "Determination of title to property is within the 
jurisdiction of Courts of First Instance. The respondent Soriano's objection 
(that the probate court lacked jurisdiction to order the delivery of the 
possession of the lots to the estate) relates exclusively to the procedure, 
which is distinct from jurisdiction. It affects only personal rights to a mode 
of practice (the filing of an independent ordinary action) which may be waived." 
Strictly speaking, it is more a question of jurisdiction over the person, not 
over the subject matter, for the jurisdiction to try controversies between heirs 
of a deceased person regarding the ownership of properties alleged to belong to 
his estate has been recognized to be vested in probate courts. This is so 
because the purpose of an administration proceeding is the liquidation of the 
estate and distribution of the residue among the heirs and legatees. Liquidation 
means determination of all the assets of the estate and payment of all the debts 
and expenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Thereafter, distribution 
is made of the decedent's liquidated estate among the persons entitled to 
succeed him. The proceeding is in the nature of an action of partition in which 
each party is required to bring into the mass whatever community property he has 
in his possession. To this end and as a necessary corollary, the interested 
parties may introduce proofs relative to the ownership of the properties in 
dispute. All the heirs who take part in the distribution of the decendent's 
estate are before the court, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, in all 
matters and incidents necessary to the complete settlement of such estate, so 
long as no interests of third parties are affected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p>
<p>In the case now before us, the matter in controversy is the question of 
ownership of certain of the properties involved‚Äîwhether they belong to the 
conjugal partnership or to the husband exclusively. This is a matter properly 
within the jurisdiction of the probate court which necessarily has to liquidate 
the conjugal partnership in order to determine the estate of the decedent which 
is to be distributed among his heirs who are all parties to the proceedings, 
including, of course, the widow, now represented, because of her death, by her 
heirs who have been substituted upon petition of the executor himself and who 
have appeared voluntarily. There are no third parties whose rights may be 
affected. It is true that the heirs of the deceased widow are not heirs of the 
testator-husband, but the widow is, in addition to her own right to the conjugal 
property. And it is this right that is being sought to be enforced by her 
substitutes. Therefore, the claim that is being asserted is one belonging to an 
heir to the testator and, consequently, it complies with the requirement of the 
exception that the parties interested (the petitioners and the widow, 
represented by respondents) are all heirs claiming title under the testator. 
</p>
<p>Petitioners contend additionally that they have never submitted themselves to 
the jurisdiction of the probate court, for the purpose of the determination of 
the question of ownership of the disputed properties. This is not borne by the 
admitted facts. On the contrary, it is undisputed that they were the ones who 
presented the project of partition claiming the questioned properties as patt of 
the testator's asset. The respondents, as representatives or substitutes of the 
deceased widow opposed the project of partition and submitted another. As 
the Court of Appeals said,. "In doing so all of them must be deemed to have 
submitted the issue for resolution in the same proceeding. Certainly, the 
petitioners can not be heard to insist, as they do, on the approval of their 
project of partition and, thus, have the court take it for granted that their 
theory as to the character of the properties is. correct, entirely without 
regard to the opposition of the respondents". In other words, by presenting 
their project of partition including therein the disputed lands (upon the claim 
that they were donated by the wife to her husband), petitioners themselves put 
in issue the question of ownership of the properties which is well within the 
competence of the probate court and just because of an opposition. thereto, they 
can not thereafter withdraw either their appearance or the issue from the 
jurisdiction of the court. Certainly there is here a waiver where the parties 
who raise the objection are the ones who set the court in motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> They can not be permitted to complain if 
the court, after due hearing, adjudges the question against them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p>
<p>Finally, petitioners-appellants claim that appellees are estopped to raise 
the question of ownership of the properties involved because the widow herself, 
during her lifetime, not only did not object to the inclusion of these 
properties in the inventory of the assets of her deceased husband, but also 
signed an extra-judicial partition of those inventoried properties. But the very 
authorities cited by appellants require that to constitute estoppel, the actor 
must have knowledge of the facts and be appraised of his rights at.the time he 
performs the act constituting estoppel, because silence without knowledge works 
no estoppel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> In the present case, the 
deceased widow acted as she did because of the deed of donation she executed in 
favor of her husband not knowing that such deed was illegal, if inter-vivos, and 
ineffectual if mortis-causa, as it has not been executed with the required 
formalities similar to a will. </p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision of the Court of Appeals being in accordance with law, 
the same is hereby affirmed with costs against appellants. So ordered. </p>
