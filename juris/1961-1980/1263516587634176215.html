				[ G. R. No. L-21303, September 23, 1968</h4>
				<H3>REPUBLIC BANK, PETITIONER, VS. THE HONORABLE
COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND NARCISO MACARAEG, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MAKALINTAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The first action for recovery of overtime pay was Case No. 1104-V
of the Court of Industrial Relations entitled "<span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>, complainant, vs. Republic Savings Bank,
respondent."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint, on
motion of the respondent Bank, was dismissed by the trial Judge for lack of
jurisdiction, but the order of dismissal was set aside by a resolution of the
court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case
was elevated to this Court in a petition for certiorari (G. R. No. L-16637) on
the sole issue of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1961</st1:date> this Court held that
the respondent court was without jurisdiction, considering that the action was
purely a money claim cognizable by the ordinary courts, and set aside the
appealed resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> "without prejudice to the filing
of the claim of <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span> in any competent
court."</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that in another case filed in the Court of Industrial
Relations on September 15, 1958, entitled ­"<span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span>
T. <span class="SpellE">Resuello</span>, et al., complainants, vs. Republic
Savings Bank, respondent" (Case No. 1751-ULP)<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> - for unfair labor practice with
demand for reinstatement and back-wages - <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>
(respondent herein) was one of the com­plainants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While that case was pending <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span> filed with the same court, purportedly in
accordance with the decision of this Court in G. R. No. L-16637, a complaint
for over­time pay (Case <span style="">No. 1</span>538-V),
this time including a demand for reinstatement, which was already the subject
of Case No. 1751-ULP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent
Bank (petitioner herein) pleaded <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <u>adjudicate</u>
in its answer and moved to dismiss the com­plaint, alleging that the question
of jurisdiction had already been settled by this Court in G. R. No.
L-16637.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial Judge sustained the
plea and dismissed the <span style="">case in </span>an
order dated <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon motion for reconsideration, the court <u>en</u>
<u>banc</u>, in a resolution dated February <span style="">8, </span>1963, set aside the order of dismissal and gave due course to
the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said the court:</p>

<blockquote>"The doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">judicata</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>invoked by the Trial Court in
justifying the dis­missal of this case is not applicable, be­cause the prior
dismissal before the Supreme Court in G. R. No. L-16637 was not a con­clusive
adjudication of the controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
not a prior judgment on the merits, since the Supreme Court, in dismissing a
complaint without a claim for reinstate­ment, ruled 'without prejudice to the
filing of the claim of <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span> in any competent
court'.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>We vote that the order of <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1962</st1:date>, be set aside, and the
<span style="">case </span>be given due course."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied, the Republic Bank filed the instant petition for
review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents here maintain that
the doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>
<span style="">does </span>not apply because the deci­sion
of this Court in G. R. No. L-16637 was without pre­judice to the riling of the
claim with any competent court and, therefore, not a judgment on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be stated that during the pendency here of G. R. NO.
L-16637, respondent Macaraeg filed a supplementary answer, alleging that he had
a pending claim with the Court of Industrial Relations for reinstatement and
backwages in Case No. 1751-ULP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court
deferred action thereon "until the case <span style="">is </span>considered on the merits." Obviously the purpose of the
supplementary answer was to manifest to this Court that respondent <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg’s</span> claim for overtime pay was coupled with a demand
for reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was, a
manifestation which, if intended as an amendment to the complaint below, could
not be entertained because it would change substantially the cause of
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, the manifestation
proved futile when this Court rendered its decision in the afore­said case, G.
R. No. L-16637, wherein it was stated:</p>

<blockquote>"No claim is made that his separa­tion is illegal or that he
still has the right to continue in the service or to be reinstated, by virtue
of a contract or otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under this
circumstance, the action is purely a money claim cog­nizable by the ordinary
courts of justice in accordance with the provi­sions of Republic Act No.
602."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing decision was on the merits insofar as <span style="">the issue of jurisdiction was concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That issue was settled with finality in
connection with the claim for overtime pay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint in the present action (Case No. 1538-V) is a
reiteration of the same claim, although it contains in addition a prayer for
reinstatement, obviously to circumvent our denial of jurisdiction to the Court
of Industrial Rela­tions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attempt
must be thwarted not only on that ground but also because the question of
reinstatement was already the subject of another action in the Court of
Industrial Relations (Case No. 1751-ULP) which in fact was decided by said
Court on September 27, 1967.</p>
