				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In Civil Case No. 51272 of the Court of First Instance of Manila
Judge <span class="SpellE">Carmelino</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Alvendia</span>
rendered a decision dated <st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1963</st1:date>,
ordering the spouses Carlos Alfaro and Maggie <span class="SpellE">Capen</span>
to pay <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span> &amp; Company the sum of P16<span class="GramE">,778.94</span> plus six percent interest from <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court directed that, if the said amount was not paid within
ninety days from notice, the mortgaged property described in the complaint
should be sold at public auction to satisfy the mortgage obligation (See <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span> &amp; Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Bocar</span>,
L-26992, February 12, 1976, 69 SCRA 318).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Alfaro spouses did not appeal from that decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mortgaged property was sold at public
auction on <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="10">October 25, 1963</st1:date>
for P18<span class="GramE">,950</span> to the judgment creditor, <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span> &amp; Company.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court confirmed the sale in its order of <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Later, the Alfaro spouses
filed in this Court a <i>certiorari</i> petition wherein they claimed that the
lower court acted without jurisdiction in ordering the foreclosure of the
mortgage to satisfy their obligation of P16<span class="GramE">,778.94</span>,
considering that the mortgage was executed as security for their obligation up
to the amount of ten thousand pesos only.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That petition was
dismissed for lack of merit in this Court's minute resolution of </span><st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="1"><span style="">January
 5, 1965</span></st1:date><span style=""> (L-23962,
Alfaro vs. <span class="SpellE">Alvendia</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thwarted in their effort
to nullify the foreclosure proceeding by means of <i>certiorari</i>, the Alfaro
spouses resorted to <span class="GramE">another recourse</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="3"><span style="">March 1, 1965</span></st1:date><span style=""> they sued <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span>
&amp; Company and the sheriff of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> in the Court of First Instance of Manila
again for the purpose of setting aside the foreclosure sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They resuscitated their theory in the <i>certiorari</i>
case (L-23962) that the foreclosure was void because the mortgage was given as
security only for the sum of P10<span class="GramE">,000</span> and,
notwithstanding that contractual stipulation, the property was sold to the
mortgagee for P18,950, thus making it difficult for them to redeem the property
(Civil Case No. 60036).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Alfaro spouses also
assailed the foreclosure on the ground of inadequacy of price.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They pointed out that at the foreclosure sale
only the land, </span><st1:place><span style="">Lot</span></st1:place><span style=""> 26, with an area of 168 square meters, was
sold but not the improvements, and that, in spite of that fact, <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span> &amp; Company wanted to assert dominical rights over
the residential house erected on that lot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Alfaro spouses also claimed damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Llanes</span></span><span style=""> &amp; Company filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, lack of cause of action and <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The lower court in its
order of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="4"><span style="">April 21, 1966</span></st1:date><span style=""> dismissed the complaint because it was
barred </span>by <span style="">the prior judgment in
Civil Case No. 51272.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From the order of
dismissal, the Alfaro spouses appealed to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal involves only a question of law
(Sec. 2, Rule 42, <span class="GramE">Rules</span> of Court).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Alfaro spouses in
this appeal contend that the lower court erred in dismissing their complaint,
in holding that their complaint in Civil Case No. 60036 is merely an action for
damages arising from the proceedings in the foreclosure suit, Civil Case No.
51272, and in holding that their claims in Civil Case No. 60036 are barred by <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> or by
the judgment in Civil Case No. 51272.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Considering the
antecedents related above, we find the appeal to be devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matters raised by the Alfaro spouses
should have been ventilated in the foreclosure proceeding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The fact that the
mortgage was a security for the obligation of the Alfaro spouses to <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span> &amp; Company up to ten thousand pesos only and that
the trial court did not take that into account in the order of foreclosure did
not render void the foreclosure sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
the Alfaro spouses wanted to stop the foreclosure, they should have paid the
P10<span class="GramE">,000</span> to the mortgagee before the auction sale was
held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They failed to do so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">They did not appeal from
the judgment ordering the foreclosure of the mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That judgment became final and
conclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It operated as a bar to any
subsequent action between the same parties involving issues which could </span><span style="">have been litigated in </span><span style="">that first case (Sec. 49[b], Rule 39, <span class="GramE">Rules</span> of Court).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The judgment in the foreclosure
suit was fortified by this Court's decision in <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span>
&amp; Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Bocar</span>, <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span><span style="">was held </span><span style="">in that case that
the lower court's 1963 decision in the foreclosure suit, insofar as it was
construed as referring only to the mortgaged lot, could not be amended so as to
include the house in the foreclosure sale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the lower courtâ€™s order is affirmed with
costs against the appellants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
