<blockquote>"It appears that on <st1:date year="1929" day="31" month="12">December
 31, 1929</st1:date>, Decree No. 440157 was issued by the Court of First
Instance of Occidental <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> in favor of <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span>, married to <span class="SpellE">Graciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span>, decreeing that
he is the owner of a certain parcel of land (Lot No. 3770 of the Cad. Survey of
<span class="SpellE">Cauayan</span>) described therein, and ordering that the
same be registered in the name of said <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span> in accordance with the provision of Land Registration
Act (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 3 also <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
4).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, Original Certificate
of Title No. 29257 covering said Lot No. 3770 of the <span class="SpellE">Cauayan</span>
Cadastre was issued in favor of <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the
certificate of title (O.C.T. No. 29257) was either lost or destroyed during the
last world war, <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span>
filed a verified petition for reconstitution, dated December 28, 1953, praying
that after due publication thereof in the Official Gazette, as provided for by
law, an order be issued setting the petition for hearing (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
A)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter</span>
an order was issued on <st1:date year="1957" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1957</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which is as follows -</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'WHEREFORE, the Court, pursuant to section 13 of Republic Act No.
26, hereby orders the Register of Deeds of this province to reconstitute the
original as well as the owner's duplicate <span style="">of
Original Certificate of Title No. 29257, covering Lot No. 3770 of <span class="SpellE">Cauayan</span> Cadastre, this province, on the basis of the

p. 125, Rec.).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>On March 5, 1958, <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span>, filed a 'Motion Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span>'
alleging that Lot No. 3770 of the <span class="SpellE">Cauayan</span> Cadastre
having been acquired by him by way of inheritance prior to his marriage to his
first wife, <span class="SpellE">Graciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span>,
the Cadastral court ordered that said land be registered in the name of <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span>, married to <span class="SpellE">Graciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span>; that his first
wife died many years ago; and that he is married by second nuptial to <span class="SpellE">Marciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Gepanago</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, therefore, prayed that the court order
the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental to change
his (<span class="SpellE">movant's</span>) civil status, appearing on the face of
the original certificate of title, 'from <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span>, married to <span class="SpellE">Graciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span> to <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span>, married to <span class="SpellE">Marciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Gepanago</span>' (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting</span> upon the
Motion Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span>, the court, finding no opposition
thereto and with the conformity of Clara <span class="SpellE">Torela</span>,
daughter of <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span>
by first marriage, granted the motion and ordered the R<span style="">egister </span>of Deeds to change the civil status of the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> from '<span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span>, married to <span class="SpellE">Graciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span>' to '<span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span>, married to <span class="SpellE">Marciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Gepanago</span>', which is the actual civil status of the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>, upon payment of the required fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Order of <st1:date year="1958" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1958</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. F.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1958" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1958</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span> executed a
definite deed of sale (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1), whereby, for and in
consideration of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, he sold Lot No. 3770 of
the Cadastral Survey of <span class="SpellE">Cauayan</span> to Marcos P. <span class="SpellE">Mahilum</span> and Maria Luna <span class="SpellE">Mahilum</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also stated in the deed of sale that he
was a widower by <span style="">first </span>marriage
to <span class="SpellE">Graciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span>, and
now married to <span class="SpellE">Marciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Gepanago</span>;
that he is the registered owner of said Lot No. 3770, having acquired it by
inheritance from his parents before his marriage to <span class="SpellE">Graciana</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gallego</span>, deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The document (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1) was acknowledged before
Notary Public Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Tabuga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Upon registration of <span style="">Exhibit 1, Transfer Certificate of Title No.</span></span><span style=""> T-23078 was issued to <span class="GramE">said</span>
spouses (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>According, however, to the plaintiffs while in their youth they had
seen their father <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> and their mother <span class="SpellE">Graciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span> clean the lot in
question, as it was then forested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
when their mother died, their father married <span class="SpellE">Marciana</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gepanago</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, the plaintiffs want us to believe that the parcel of land is a
conjugal property of their father and mother (<span class="SpellE">Felimon</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Graciana</span>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And since their father succeeded in changing his status and in conveying
the land to another, they now assert their right to the estate appertaining to
their mother, alleging that they were deprived of their corresponding share
from the property thus sold.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Under the conflicting claims of the plaintiffs and their father,
defendant <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span>,
the decisive question is whether or not the parcel of land herein involved is a
conjugal property of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span> and <span class="SpellE">Graciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span> (plaintiffs' mother).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span>
declared that he and his first wife <span class="SpellE">Graciana</span> were
married in 1915 (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 18).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the land in question was decreed in the
name of <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span>,
married to <span class="SpellE">Graciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">B, which is also <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> 4)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According</span> to Article 1401 of the Old

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span>
testified that he inherited the contested property from his parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Pedro <span class="SpellE">Torela</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Soperiana</span> <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>True enough that plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Silveriana</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span> and Miguel <span class="SpellE">Pedrosa</span> declared that the land in question was jointly cleared
by <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span> and his
first wife <span class="SpellE">Graciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span>,
but the trial court did not give credence to their testimonies for the simple
reason that <span class="SpellE">Silveriana</span> was not yet born at the time
when said <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span>, together with his father, started
living in the land in 1905 (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 18); while
Miguel <span class="SpellE">Pedrosa</span> was only one year old then,
considering that he was 55 years of age when he testified on February 10,
1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus plainly obvious that <span class="SpellE">Silveriana</span> and Miguel could not have known when defendant <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> and his father moved to the land in 1905.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span>
was 81 years old when he testified on February 10, 1959, he was already 27
years in 1905, in which case he must have already helped his father in cleaning
and tilling that land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of
fact at the time of his marriage with his first wife, <span class="SpellE">Graciana</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gallego</span>, a portion of said land had already been
cultivated by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Asked what <span class="GramE">was the condition of the land</span> in 1915 (the date of his first
marriage), he answered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Only a portion of
the lot was plowed by me.' <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
p. 18.)</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>In the light of the foregoing, the property in question is not one
of those enumerated in Article 1401 of the Old Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, as it was inherited by <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> from his parents and brought to the marriage with
his first wife, the same is deemed his separate property (Art. 1396, Old Civil
Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, defendant <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span> had lawfully
disposed of his property to the exclusion of his children by his first
marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, plaintiffs'
complaint was correctly dismissed by the court below."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners allege that the Court of Appeals failed to take into
account Article 1407 of the Spanish Civil Code, which now corresponds to
Article 160 of the New Civil Code, and which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1407<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All</span> property of the spouses shall be deemed partnership property
in the absence of proof that it belongs exclusively to the husband or to the
wife."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners claim that since the lot in question was registered
in the name of <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span>,
married to <span class="SpellE">Graciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span>,
it must be presumed to be the conjugal property of <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Graciana</span> so that one-half thereof should be
adjudicated to them as their inheritance from their mother.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that all property of the marriage is presumed to
be conjugal, as above stated, nonetheless the party who invokes the presumption
must first prove that the property was acquired during the marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This proof is a condition <u>sine</u> <u>qua</u>
<u>non</u> for the application of the presumption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Cobb-Perez vs. <span class="SpellE">Lantin</span>, L-22320, May 22, 1968, 23 SCRA 637; Ponce de Leon
vs. RFC, L-24571, Dec. 18, 1970; 36 SCRA 289.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case there is nothing in the record to show that
the lot in question was acquired during the marriage of <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span>
<span class="SpellE">Torela</span> and <span class="SpellE">Graciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
contrary, the factual finding of the Court of Appeals is to the effect that <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> acquired the land through inheritance and this
conclusion is bolstered by that fact that one of the petitioners herein, Clara <span class="SpellE">Torela</span>, gave her conformity to her father's Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span> Motion of March 5, 1958, wherein it was recited, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span> had acquired the property by way of inheritance
prior to his marriage to his first wife, <span class="SpellE">Graciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The circumstance that Decree No. 440157 of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental which confirmed the
ownership of <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span>
over the land in question described him as married to <span class="SpellE">Graciana</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gallego</span> was merely descriptive of his civil status at
that time and cannot be taken as proof that the land was acquired during their <span class="SpellE">coverture</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
further circumstance that the land was registered during their marriage cannot
in itself constitute proof that it was acquired during their marriage for land
registration under Act No. 496, as amended, does not confer title; it merely
confirms a title already existing and which is <span class="SpellE">registerable</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding no reversible error in the decision of
the Court of Appeals, the same is hereby affirmed without any special pronouncement
as to costs.</p>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, (Chairman), J., <span style="font-style: normal;">concurs. Putting it otherwise, what appears in </span><st1:place><span style="font-style: normal;">Torrens</span></st1:place><span style="font-style: normal;"> title is a presumption that can be rebutted by contrary proof which exerts
in this case.</span></span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, J.,<span style="font-style: normal;"> concurs. If the land in question was conjugal property of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Graciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span> and <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span>, who were married
in 1915, it should have been indicated in the Original Certificate of Title No.
2957, issued to <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Torela</span>,
as well as in the decree of registration issued in 1929, that it was the said
spouses conjugal property and it should have been registered in their names.
The fact that it was registered during the marriage in the husband’s name alone
was an indication that it was the husband’s separate property (Stuart vs. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>, 114 Phil. 1083).<o:p></o:p></span></span><br>

<p class="BODY">I concur.  If the land in
question was conjugal property of the spouses Graciana Gallego and Felimon
Torela, who were mar­ried in 1915, it should have been indicated in the
Original Certifi­cate of Title No. 29257, issued to Felimon Torela, as well as
in the decree of registration issued in 1929, that it was the said spouses'
conjugal property and it should have been registered in their names.  The fact that it was registered during the
mar­riage in the <u>husband's name alone</u> was an indication that it was the
husband's separate property (Stuart vs. Yatco, 114 Phil. 1083).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
