				<H3>FINDLAY MILLAR TIMBER COMPANY, PETITIONER, VS. PLASLU AND COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, ETC., RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Two cases for unfair labor practice were filed before the Court of Industrial 
Relations by some employees and laborers of Findlay Millar Timber Company which 
were affiliated with the Philippine Land-Air-Sea Labor Union, referred to herein 
as PLASLU, for short, against said company and some of its principal officials. 
One was filed on August 15, 1955, docketed as Case No. 41-ULP-Cebu, relating to 
the alleged dismissal of 60 employees as a result of some discriminatory acts, 
and another was filed on June 28, 1956, docketed as Case No. 6-ULP-MIN, covering 
alleged dismissal of 29 employees named in the complaint. The theory of both 
complaints is that the company and its corespondent officials, individually or 
collectively, interfered with, restrained, or coerced the PLASLU's affiliates or 
members who complained in the exercise of their right to self-organization by 
inquiring into their union affiliation and activities, by convincing them to 
withdraw from their union or join another as a condition for continued 
employment with the company, by threatening them with dismissal if they did not 
resign from their union, by discriminating against them through the application 
of the rotation system, and reducing them to part-time work as compared to those 
who resigned their union affiliation and joined another who were continued on 
full-time basis.
<p>The company and its co-respondents denied the commission of unfair labor 
practices. Among other things, they emphasized that many of the complainants 
were in fact no longer working in the company in March and August, 1955; that 
the complainants ceased to work of their own choice or desire because of the 
inadequacy of working days assigned to them by reason of the operation of the 
rotation system which made the complainants prefer not to work any more, or make 
living elsewhere, or devote their time to their own farms. In other words, the 
respondents indicated that the dismissal, lay-off, and rotation complained of, 
were justified by the circumstances then prevailing, to wit: the burning of the 
sawmill of the company, inadequate work business reverses and financial 
difficulties, and the labor-saving devices that were resorted to in order to 
lower the cost of production and continue uninterruptedly the work of the 
company. They also called attention to the closed shop agreement entered into 
between the company and the Western Lanao Labor Union (WELLU) in order to 
apprise the industrial court of the latter's activities relative thereto.</p>
<p>The two cases were assigned to Judge Jose S. Bautista for the reception of 
evidence, who thereafter rendered decision dismissing the charges. His Honor 
found that the lay-off or separation of complainants was justified under the 
closed shop agreement entered into between the company and the Western Lanao 
Labor Union (WELLU) even if some of them voluntarily abandoned their employment 
in view of the rotation system adopted by the company because of financial 
difficulties.</p>
<p>The complainants filed a motion for reconsideration, which was vigorously 
opposed by respondents, in support of which both submitted lengthy and 
well-reasoned arguments, and on January 6, 1961, the industrial court <i>en 
banc</i> reversed the decision of the trial judge stating in its dispositive 
part: "the decision of the Trial Court is set aside, and those who were 
dismissed through the alleged closed-shop be reinstated and paid their back 
wages accordingly, it being apparent that it was the Company that dismissed them 
and not prompted by, or the blame traced to, the union."</p>
<p>The company interposed the present petition for review.</p>
<p>The questions which in our opinion need to be discussed in this instance 
which are decisive of the issues raised in the petition for review may be boiled 
down to the following: whether respondent court erred (1) in incorrectly 
assuming that the complainants were dismissed by reason of the closed shop 
provision contained in the collective bargaining agreement entered into between 
the company and the WELLU; (2) in overruling the trial judge's views on the 
legal effects of said closed shop agreement; (3) in disregarding the finding of 
the trial judge that the PLASLU was organized for the purpose of defeating the 
closed shop provision agreed upon and in not finding that complainants took 
advantage of the activities of the WELLU to build up their cases of unfair labor 
practice against the company and its co-respondents; and (4) in not holding that 
only the grievances of complainants who testified should be determined and 
failure of those who failed to appear constitute an abandonment of their own 
grievances. </p>
<p>The contention that respondent court erred in incorrectly assuming without 
foundation in fact that the complainants were dismissed by reason of the closed 
shop provision contained in the collective bargaining agreement entered into 
between the company and the WELLU is untenable, for the trial judge has 
precisely predicated his ruling on dismissal on the finding that the 
complainants were separated on the strength of said closed shop provision by 
making it applicable not only to those to be employed in the future but also to 
those who are already in the service of the company. This can clearly be gleaned 
from the decision of the trial judge. In fact the main issue considered by the 
trial judge in connection with the charges filed by complainants was whether the 
closed shop agreement which was entered into between the parties was valid and, 
if so, whether its effects should be made applicable to both old and new 
employees. The judge then went on to discuss the different elements that must 
concur for the establishment of a valid collective bargaining agreement as to 
which, after considering that all the requisite elements were present, reached 
the conclusion that the collective bargaining agreement in question was valid, 
it appearing that the WELLU had in its membership the greatest number of 
laborers and employees in the company, and that there was no proof that it was a 
company-dominated union, while on the other hand, the WELLU was the one selected 
to be their bargaining unit representative by the majority of the laborers and 
employees as required by law. The trial judge then proceeded to make an analysis 
of the provisions of the closed shop and from their tenor as well as from 
precedents obtaining in the United States on the matter, he held that said 
closed shop clause is not only legal but applicable to old and new employees. 
And, among the many authorities he has cited, he quoted the following from 
Rothenberg: "A 'closed shop' may be defined as an enterprise in which, by 
agreement between the employer and his employees or their representatives, no 
person may be employed in any or certain agreed departments of the enterprise 
<em>unless he or she is, becomes, and for the duration of the agreement, remains 
a member in good standing </em>of a union entirely comprised of or of which the 
employees in interest are a part" (Rothenberg on Labor Relations, p. 48; italics 
supplied).</p>
<p>Indeed, according to the trial judge, this is what can be inferred from the 
clause on the closed shop appearing in the collective bargaining agreement, for, 
among other things, said clause says, "The Employer agrees to employ none but 
members in good standings of the Union * * * and to hire and order any or all 
regular and extra employees who shall be needed * * *." Clearly, these terms, 
liberally interpreted, cover both employees who are actually in the service as 
well as those that may be hired in the future. And this liberal interpretation, 
in the light of American precedents, led the trial judge to conclude: "With 
this, therefore, as the facts that actually transpired and the wordings in the 
closed-shop contract between the management and the contracting union, WELLU, it 
is clear that the contract is valid and that if affects both new and old 
employees." He consequently held that the separation of the complainants was 
justified and dismissed the charges.</p>
<p>It is true that the trial judge, in passing, also mentioned the fact that as 
a consequence of the retrenchment policy adopted by the company as a result of 
the burning of its sawmill on May 22, 1953, it was compelled to adopt a rotation 
system in the employment of its laborers in an effort to continue all of them in 
the service even at a reduced work which eventually led some to abandon their 
job in order to find employment elsewhere; but the trial judge only considered 
such circumstance as an additional ground for dismissal of the charges, the main 
ground being the operation and effect of the closed Shop clause contained in the 
bargaining agreement. The respondent court, therefore, was justified in 
concentrating its discussion on the validity, scope and extent of the closed 
shop provision in disregard of other factual evidence extent in the 
record.</p>We see no error in the action of respondent court in may be in accord 
with American law and jurisprudence, as the time they were expresed, no longer 
hold water today for jurisdiction. It may be true that the trial judge's views 
they run counter to decisions recently rendered by this Court. Thus, in the case 
of Freeman Shirt Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. vs. Court of Industrial 
Relations, et al., 110 Phil., 963, this Court said:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
<blockquote>
<p>"The closed-shop agreement authorized under sec. 4 subsec. a (4) of the 
Industrial Peace Act above quoted should however, apply only to persons to be 
hired or to employees who are not yet members of any labor organization. It is 
inapplicable to those already in the service who are members of another union. 
To hold otherwise, i.e., that the employees in a company who are members of a 
minority union may be compelled to disaffiliate from their union and join the 
majority or contracting union, would render nugatory the right of all employees 
to self-organization and to form, join or assist labor organization of their own 
choosing, a right guaranteed by the Industrial Peace Act (sec. 3, Rep. Act No. 
875) as well as by the Constitution (Art. III, sec. 1[6]."</p></blockquote>
<p>Considering that the views expressed by respondent court on the legal effect 
of a closed shop clause are in line with the view expressed by this Court in the 
Freeman case, <i>supra</i>, we cannot but conclude that the trial judge erred in 
his interpretation of the closed shop in question which served as a 
justification for the separation of the complainants herein. This justifies the 
action taken by respondent court in overruling the trial judge's views on the 
matter.</p>
<p>It should, however, be observed that the employer, petitioner herein, cannot 
be blamed if in its interpretation of the closed shop provision was led to apply 
its effects not only to future employees but also to those who were already in 
the service considering not only the ambiguous terms into which the same is 
couched but also the meaning of a closed shop as understood in American 
jurisdiction, and, therefore, it is fair to presume that before the promulgation 
of our decision in the Freeman case the employer acted having in mind the closed 
shop as construed in the United States after whose statutes our Republic Act No. 
875 was patterned, for authorities abound insinuating that in the application of 
law of American origin the rulings of the Supreme Court of the United States 
construing similar provisions are considered of persuasive effect and may be 
followed as authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2] </sup>So, it is fair 
to presume, we repeat, that when petitioner separated the complainants because 
of their refusal to disaffiliate themselves from the PLASLU and join the WELLU 
which has a collective bargaining agreement with the employer, it merely acted 
in pursuance of the terms of the closed shop clause in the light of American 
jurisprudence thereby justifying its claim that it has acted on the matter not 
without justification. It is, therefore, fair to conclude that the employer had 
acted in good faith. In reaching this view, this Court holds the opinion that 
while complainants are entitled to reinstatement on the theory that their 
separation was based upon a mistaken interpretation of the closed shop 
provision, they are not however entitled to back wages because their separation 
was effected in good faith.</p>
<p>Having reached the foregoing conclusion, we do not deem it necessary to 
discuss the other issues raised by petitioner in its brief.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision of respondent court which is in the form of 
resolution issued on January 6, 1961 is modified in the sense that those who 
were dismissed improperly as foresaid should be reinstated but without back 
wages. No pronouncement as to costs.</p> <em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Paredes,
