				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">From a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Occidental <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>, in its Case No. 7843, convicting two brothers,
Nelson and Norman <span class="SpellE">Viñas</span>, of the crime of murder for
the killing of one Jesus Varela, and sentencing both to life imprisonment,
Norman <span class="SpellE">Viñas</span> appealed directly to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is uncontested that in the evening of <st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="4">10 April 1962</st1:date>, in the premises of the <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> Murcia Sugar Central, Jesus Varela was stabbed from
behind, while urinating beside a tree.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Autopsy revealed a stab wound four inches from the spine, at the level
of the second lumbar <span class="GramE">vertebra, that</span> entered from
behind, slightly downward, penetrating the peritoneal region and lacerating the
vena cava.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His death was attributed to
the ensuing severe hemorrhage and shock (Exhibit "B").</p>

<p class="BODY">Inquiries led to the arrest and prosecution for murder of the
brothers, Nelson and Norman <span class="SpellE">Viñas</span>, and of one Rodolfo
<span class="SpellE">Sumpay</span>, who had been living on the bounty of his
co-accused for over two months before the killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On motion of the fiscal in charge, the court
dismissed the charge against <span class="SpellE">Sumpay</span>, and he was
utilized as a witness for the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court, in due course, rendered judgment
convicting both brothers and sentencing them to undergo <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased,
Jesus Varela, in the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, and to pay the
costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only Norman <span class="SpellE">Viñas</span>
appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nelson <span class="SpellE">Viñas</span>
did not.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant assigns the following errors as committed by the Court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Honorable Trial Court erred in giving
credence and weight to the testimonies of the witnesses for the prosecution and
in not considering the testimonies of the witnesses for the accused-appellant
which are natural, believable and spontaneous.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Honorable Trial Court erred in finding
that the accused-appellant is guilty of the crime of murder as charged.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution presented two eyewitnesses to the crime, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Sumpay</span> and Mario <span class="SpellE">Derla</span>, both of
whom were closely acquainted with the accused brothers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sumpay</span> was, at the
time living with said accused at the house of the latter for over two
months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Derla</span>
had been their friend for ten years.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Sumpay</span> testified that upon returning to
the house of <span class="SpellE">th</span> <span class="SpellE">Viñas</span> in
the <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> Murcia Central's compound, after a vain
try at attending the radio program of station CBN in <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>
City, he met on the night of 10 April 1962, at around 8 <span style="">o' </span>clock P.M., both the <span class="SpellE">Viñas</span> brothers
conversing with <span class="SpellE">Marlo</span> <span class="SpellE">Derla</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nelson drew him aside and said, "It is
(a) good thing that you are here, because we are planning an idea (sic) to kill
Varela" (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pages 8-9); while Norman said,
“let us stab (<span class="SpellE"><u>buno</u></span>) Jesus Varela"(t. s.
n., page 10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sumpay</span>
protested:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Why should we stab him
when I do not even know him and he has no fault?" and <st1:city><st1:place>Norman</st1:place></st1:city>
(now appellant) retorted:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Just go
with me because he has committed a fault against me" (transcript, page
10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four continued conversing and,
at that juncture, Varela emerged from the nearby house of one <span class="SpellE">Bauzon</span>, where he had been drinking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All five went toward the plaza of the central
and Varela separated from the others and leaned on a tree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sumpay</span> and Mario walked
on ahead because they wanted to avoid trouble, and from some 40 meters away <span class="SpellE">Sumpay</span> saw Nelson <span class="SpellE">Viñas</span> approach
Jesus Varela and immediately, without uttering a word, stab the latter with a
curved knife (<span class="SpellE">bulang</span>) (Exhibit "A").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Varela rolled down an embankment and <span class="SpellE">Sumpay</span> and Mario ran away with Nelson <span class="SpellE">Viñas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first two stayed some time in the house
of Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Doraquez</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sumpay's</span>
girl friend, and then went home.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second witness, Mario <span class="SpellE">Derla</span>, who
had known the accused for over ten years, deposed in court that at <st1:time minute="30" hour="21">9:30 P.M.</st1:time> on <st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="4">10 April 1962</st1:date> he and <span class="SpellE">Sumpay</span> were
ordered by the accused brothers to watch and fallow Jesus Varela, who had been
drinking with some companions at the house of one <span class="SpellE">Bauzon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While Varela <span style="">was </span>urinating and holding a branch of a tree (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
page 14, II <span class="SpellE">pieza</span>), Nelson <span class="SpellE">Viñas</span>
stabbed him from behind with the knife, Exhibit <span style="">"A".<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="SpellE">Sumpay</span> was with the witness at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the stabbing, Nelson rushed to them and
told them to run away.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Varela' s</span> widow testified that she had
been informed that her husband had a fight with Norman <span class="SpellE">Viñas</span>
the previous December and, as a result, the latter had been demoted in rank at
the Central where he was a watchman, although the case had been settled by the
police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some time later, <st1:city><st1:place>Norman</st1:place></st1:city>
mauled Varela, but the incident was again settled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Varela made a sort of shield for
his body, and was cautious when leaving the Central compound.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The defense set up by the
accused was that the late Varela chanced to meet <span class="SpellE">Derla</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Sumpay</span> and Nelson <span class="SpellE">Viñas</span> on
the fatal night, and that Varela challenged <span class="SpellE">Sumpay</span> to
"draw" and attacked him with the knife, exhibit "A", but
only hit the jacket that <span class="SpellE">Sumpay</span> was carrying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nelson testified that he wanted </span>to run
away, but <span class="SpellE">Derla</span> handed him a knife, and Nelson lunged
then at Varela with intent to stab his hand and make him release <span class="SpellE">Sumpay</span>, "but I do not know where he was hit" (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., page 5, Hearing of 27 March 1963).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The artificiality of the defense version
flies in the teeth of physical facts, let alone the version of both <span class="SpellE">Derla</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sumpay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not explain (and the defense did not
attempt to do so) how in a frontal encounter Varela could be stabbed from
behind, as revealed by the autopsy, or why Varela, being alone, should attack
three men without any provocation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway,
since Nelson <span class="SpellE">Viñas</span> did not appeal, his explanation
need not be delved into any further.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both Nelson <span class="SpellE">Viñas</span> and witness Oscar <span class="SpellE">Parcon</span> told the court that Norman <span class="SpellE">Viñas</span>
was not in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:place></st1:city>
but went to <span class="SpellE">Hinigaran</span> on <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="4">the <u>8th</u> of April 1962</st1:date> to attend <span class="SpellE">Parcon's</span>
birthday party on 9 April, and did not return to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:place></st1:city> until the <u>11th</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alibi is plainly insufficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No explanation is given why Norman <span class="SpellE">Viñas</span> had to stay at <span class="SpellE">Parcon's</span>
home until 11 April, when the celebration was on the <u>9th</u>, <span class="GramE">nor</span> why no other witness was produced to support the
alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, since <span class="SpellE">Minigaran</span> is barely 50 kilometers, an hour and a half by <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, it was not physically impossible for Norman <span class="SpellE">Viñas</span> to proceed from <span class="SpellE">Hinigaran</span>
to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:place></st1:city>
and back on the night of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's brief assails the veracity of the prosecution
eyewitnesses on the basis of contradictions as to some details in their
narration, but without referring to any specific pages of the transcript, as
expressly required by the Rules of Court (Section 16(f), Rule 46).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such contradictions are to be expected, both
in the observation of a startling occurrence and in recalling the same at the
trial two years afterward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They indicate
veracity rather than prevarication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much
more significant it is that both witnesses had been very close to the accused
and, hence, expectably biased in their favor; and neither one of the <span class="SpellE">Viñas</span> brothers could indicate any reason why <span class="SpellE">Sumpay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Derla</span> should testify
against them, save vague unsupported hints at their being employed by the
Central since the slaying of Varela.</p>

<p class="BODY">The presence of both brothers at the place and time of the attack
on Varela; their remarks to <span class="SpellE">Sumpay</span> just before the
crime was committed; the assault on the deceased by Nelson Viñas, who had no
personal reason to bear any grudge against said Varela, were circumstances that
led the trial court to find that both brothers<span style=""> had conspired to carry out the killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no </span><span style="">adequate </span><span style="">reason to
overturn the conclusion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the decision appealed from is
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs
against appellant.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
