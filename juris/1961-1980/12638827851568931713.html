dated <st1:date year="1975" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1975</st1:date>,
denying petitioners' motion to inhibit respondent Judge from further hearing
Criminal Cases Nos. CCC-XIII-12 and 13-L s. '75 and his order dated <st1:date year="1975" day="12" month="8">August 12, 1975</st1:date>, in the same criminal
cases, declaring petitioner Atty. <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> N. Oriel in
contempt of court, and sentencing him to pay a fine of Two Hundred Pesos
(P200.00) and an imprisonment of twenty (20) days.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a temporary restraining order was issued by this Court's
(2nd Division) resolution of September 3, 1975, and after respondent Judge has
filed his comment on the petition, this case was referred to the First Division
(resolution of October 24, 1975), and was given due course on March 29,
1976.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both parties submitted the case
for decision without briefs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Delima</span> is the incumbent Barrio Treasurer of Zone I, <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Capoocan</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>; petitioner <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1973, Barrio Council of Zone I, <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Capoocan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>,
promulgated Resolution No. 6, requiring District Supervisor <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span>
<span class="SpellE">Madriaga</span> and his wife, Elementary School Principal
Angeles <span class="SpellE">Madriaga</span>, both of the <span class="SpellE">Capoocan</span>
Elementary School, to deposit all collections and funds pertaining to the <span class="SpellE">Capoocan</span> Community High School, and to render an accounting
of all collections, funds and expenditures, purchases and disbursements made by
said spouses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of the failure of
the <span class="SpellE">Madriaga</span> couple to comply with Resolution No. 6,
the Barrio Council of Zone I, through its Barrio Captain, Jesus Near, filed
with the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> a complaint
against them for <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> of public funds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Delima</span> testified against them.</p>

<p class="BODY">After conducting the necessary preliminary investigation, the
Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> filed a complaint for <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> of public funds against the <span class="SpellE">Madriaga</span> couple and against petitioners <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Delima</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> <span class="SpellE">Dacillo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Criminal
Cases Nos. 500 and <span class="GramE">501,</span> originally filed with the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, Branch VI, <span class="SpellE">Carigara</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 4, 1975, Executive Judge Jesus N. <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>
issued an order transferring said Criminal Cases Nos. 500 and 501 to the
Circuit Criminal Court of the 13th Judicial District (<span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>), presided by respondent Judge Pedro P.
Gallardo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Criminal Case No. 500 was
designated CCC-XIII-12-L s. '75 and Criminal Case No. 501 as CCC-XIII-13-L s.
'75.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused spouses <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Madriaga</span> and Angeles <span class="SpellE">Madriaga</span>
were arraigned on <st1:date year="1975" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1975</st1:date>,
while petitioners, <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Delima</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> <span class="SpellE">Dacillo</span> were
arraigned on <st1:date year="1975" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the accused pleaded not guilty to the
charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without much ado, the respondent Judge dismissed the criminal
cases for <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> of public funds against <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Madriaga</span> and Angeles <span class="SpellE">Madriaga</span> but not against petitioners <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Delima</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> <span class="SpellE">Dacillo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the
cases against the <span class="SpellE">Madriaga</span> couple were dismissed
Barrio Captain Jesus Near, upon being assured by the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> that the two criminal cases against the <span class="SpellE">Madriaga</span> couple could no longer be revived because of
double jeopardy, filed a complaint action against respondent Judge for
knowingly rendering an unjust decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said complaint was given due course by the Chief Prosecutor of the
Department of Justice (1st <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>, dated <st1:date year="1975" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1975</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>
was instructed by the Chief Prosecutor to endorse the case to the Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> City who has jurisdiction over the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Barrio Captain Jesus Near also filed an
administrative complaint for "partiality" against respondent Judge
before this Court on July 7, 1975, which complaint was given due course.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the criminal
complaint and the administrative complaint against respondent Judge, he called
for hearing Criminal Cases Nos. CCC-XIII-12 and 13-L s. '75 with respect to
petitioners <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Delima</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> <span class="SpellE">Dacillo</span>, whose
charge for <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> of funds remained
pending.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was during said hearing when
petitioners <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Delima</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> <span class="SpellE">Dacillo</span>, thru
their counsel, petitioner Atty. <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> N. Oriel,
filed a motion to inhibit respondent Judge from further hearing the two
criminal cases against them on the ground that:</p>

<blockquote>"the accused <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Delima</span> being principal witness of a complaint of
Jesus Near in a criminal case now pending for appropriate action by the City
Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> against the Honorable Presiding
Judge of this Honorable Court, and having executed supporting affidavit in the
same case, it is honestly believed that prejudice against him has already been
developed in the mind of the Honorable Presiding Judge and hence he cannot be
expected to decide this case with strictest objectivity and with dispassion."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">After reading the verified motion for
inhibition, the respondent Judge issued in open court an order dated <st1:date year="1975" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1975</st1:date>, denying the same and
ordering petitioner Atty. <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> N. Oriel to submit
a written explanation within a period of three days from <st1:date year="1975" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1975</st1:date>, why he should not be dealt with
for direct contempt of court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1975</st1:date>,
petitioner Atty. <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> N. Oriel filed an urgent
motion for the respondent Judge to reconsider his order of <st1:date year="1975" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1975</st1:date>, so that the 3-day period given to
him to submit his written explanation would commence from the day he received
said order, that is, from <st1:date year="1975" day="11" month="8">August 11,
 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, said motion
was summarily denied on the very day it was filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 11, 1975, petitioner Atty. <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>
N. Oriel filed a manifestation stating that the contents of his motion for
inhibition are not contumacious and therefore he cannot be held liable for
direct contempt but respondent Judge, in his order dated August 12, 1975,
declared Atty. <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> N. Oriel guilty of direct
contempt and sentenced him to pay a fine of P200.00 and an imprisonment of 20
days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said order was, however, modified
later by reducing the imprisonment to 10 days, instead of 20 days.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are two (2) main issues to be resolved in this
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first refers to the
question of whether respondent Judge should inhibit himself from continuing to
try the aforementioned criminal cases against petitioners <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Delima</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> <span class="SpellE">Dacillo</span> and the second to the question as to whether the
motion to inhibit respondent Judge filed by petitioner Atty. <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> N. Oriel is contumacious as to make him liable for
direct contempt.</p>

<p class="BODY">As far as the first issue is concerned, the question is now moot
and academic because respondent Judge has ceased to be a judge of the Criminal
Circuit Judge of the 13th Judicial District with office at <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place> when his resignation was
accepted by the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on <st1:date year="1975" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the second issue there is nothing in the motion for inhibition
of the respondent Judge that will cast disrepute, disrespect or contempt
against the respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> N. Oriel in a respectful manner, simply
stated in his motion for inhibition that the accused <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Delima</span> being a principal witness of Jesus Near in the
criminal case filed against respondent Judge pending appropriate action by the
City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> he honestly believed that
respondent Judge would be prejudiced against him and therefore cannot be
expected to decide the case with "objectivity and dispassion."
Contempt of court may be either direct or constructive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is direct when committed in the presence
of or so near a court or judge as to obstruct or interrupt proceedings before
the same (Section 1, Rule 71, Rules of Court) and constructive or indirect
contempt is one committed out or not in the presence of court (<span class="SpellE">Narcida</span> vs. Bowen, 22 Phil. 365).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an act done in a distance which tends
to belittle, degrade, obstruct, interrupt or embarrass the court and justice
(70 C.J.S. 6).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is tantamount to <span class="GramE">a misbehavior</span> in the presence of or so near a court or judge
as to interrupt the administration of justice (De <span class="SpellE">Joya</span>
vs. CFI, 52 O.G. 6150).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the motion
for inhibition filed by petitioner Atty. <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> N. Oriel,
We find no disrespectful language or phrase containing offensive personalities
against the respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is
stated in the motion is simply a motion of the petitioner for the judge to
inhibit himself from further trying the aforementioned criminal cases because
he believed that the judge could no longer decide the case with impartiality
because of a criminal complaint Jesus Near filed against respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In the case of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE"><u>Austria</u></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE"><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Masaquel</span>, G.R. No.</u></span><u>
L-22536, August 31, 1967</u>, the Supreme Court ruled that when a person
impelled by justifiable apprehension and acting in a respectful manner, asks a
judge to inhibit himself from hearing his case, is not guilty of contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Atty. <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>
N. Oriel is similarly situated.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the order of respondent Judge
finding petitioner Atty. <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> N. Oriel guilty of
direct contempt and sentencing him to pay a fine of P200.00 and to imprisonment
of ten (10) days, is hereby set aside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The restraining order issued by this Court to restrain respondent Judge
from trying Criminal Cases CCC-XIII-12 and 13-L s. '75 being no longer
necessary, is hereby lifted.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
