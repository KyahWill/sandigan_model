<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that, while James L. Gordon, the City Mayor of
<span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>, was at the ground floor of its city hall,
conversing with a woman, on February 20, 1967, at about 9:30 a.m., appellant <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span> shot him on the
right-hand side of the occipital region, thereby inflicting therein a fatal
bullet wound that pierced the skull through and through.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the ensuing commotion, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>
managed to run away, board a jeep whose driver brought him, at the point of his
(<span class="SpellE">Nenito's</span>) gun, to the public market, where <span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span> <span class="SpellE">Layao</span>, Gordon's
bodyguard, who pursued <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>, lost track of him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>
pro­ceeded, aboard a tricycle, to the house of appellant Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, at No. 19, <st1:street><st1:address>20th Street,
  East</st1:address></st1:street> <span class="SpellE">Bajac-bajac</span>, not
far away from the city hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon after,
peace officers arrested <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> inside a dug-out under
said house of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, in one of the rooms of
which they, also, found him and appellant Rogelio Lorenzo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A search, made that noon by Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Relator</span>, of the local police force, yielded, in said
dug-out, the .32 caliber revolver, Exhibit M - used by <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>
in killing Mayor Gordon - containing five (5) live bullets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon investigation, immediately after their
appre­hension, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>, Pablo and Rogelio made sworn
statements im­plicating each other as well as appellant <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>
Lorenzo, father of Rogelio and former chief of police of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>,
who had been relieved of said office by James L. Gordon, when he became the
city mayor.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1967</st1:date>,
a complaint for murder was filed against <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span>, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>,
Rogelio Lorenzo, <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> Lorenzo, John Doe, Peter Doe
and Richard Doe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the case was
called, before the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>, on <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1967</st1:date>, for the second stage
of the preliminary investigation, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> stated that
he was going to plead guilty to the charge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sub­sequently, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Lorenzos</span> (Rogelio and <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>)
refused to introduce any evidence, which the City Judge construed as an implied
waiver of their right to a preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record of the case was, thereafter,
forwarded to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>,
where the corresponding information, charging <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span>, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>,
Rogelio Lorenzo and <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> Lorenzo with murder, was
filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon arraignment before the
latter court, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span>,
assisted by his <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> counsel, entered
a plea of guilty, with the request that he be allowed to prove the surrounding
circumstances, insofar as he is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The other defendants later refused to plead, where­upon the trial Judge
ordered that a plea of not guilty be entered for them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court, subsequently, proceeded to hear
the case on the merits, and took the evidence for the prosecution, as well as
that of the defense - which did <u>not</u> include the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alin­castre</span> - after which
the prosecution introduced its rebuttal evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then His Honor, the trial Judge, announced
that, by agreement of the parties, the case would be deemed submitted for
decision upon the submission of their respective memoranda, on or before <st1:date year="1968" day="15" month="10">Octo­ber 15, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the accused appeared before the court, on November 4, 1968,
for the promulgation of its decision, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span> asked ? without the benefit of counsel,
who did not show up then - that he be allowed to state what he knew about the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On motion of the prosecution, the
court, accordingly, deferred the reading of the sentence, reopened the case and
set it for continuation of the trial on <st1:date year="1968" day="5" month="11">November
 5, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that date, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span> testified that
he had killed the mayor in pursuance of a plan concocted by <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>
Lorenzo, with the assistance and cooperation of his son, Rogelio Lorenzo, of
appellant Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, and one <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>
Cruz, as well as other prominent politicians in the locality and
elsewhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, the case was
declared submitted for deci­sion, which was promulgated on <st1:date year="1968" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">All four (4) defendants appealed from said decision, but <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span> died in the New
<span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span> Prison on <st1:date year="1970" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1970</st1:date>, in view of which the case should be
dismissed, insofar as he is concerned, with the proportional part of the costs <u>de</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the present decision refers only to defendants Pablo <span class="SpellE">Sal­cedo</span>, Rogelio Lorenzo and <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>
Lorenzo - hereinafter referred to collectively as the appellants - who maintain
that the trial court erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) in
"reopening the trial of the case x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
allow­ing x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span> to testify against himself and the other
accused"; 2) in considering the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span> in convicting them; 3) in not acquitting
the appellants; 4) in considering, inso­far as they are concerned, that the
crime had been committed with treachery; 5) in considering, against <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> Lorenzo, the aggra­vating circumstance of price or
reward; and 6) in not considering in his favor the mitigating circumstance of
voluntary surrender to the authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under their first assignment of error, appellants maintain that
the trial court had abused its discretion in ordering a reopen­ing of the
trial, their substantive rights having allegedly been injured thereby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This pretense is manifestly untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants had no procedural or substantive
right to prevent <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span> from taking the witness
stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, in entering his plea of
guilty, upon arraignment, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span>
had already announced his intention to introduce evidence to mitigate his
liability, and the trial court had, in effect, agreed thereto when it stated,
in its order of July 18, 1967, that "the presentation of the evidence on
the matter be made when the case is heard on the merits." It so happened,
however, that counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> for <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span> was Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> Navarro, who, likewise, represented appellants
herein, as their counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>, and
that Atty. Navarro did not place <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span> on the witness stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, when he appeared before the lower
court, without counsel, on <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="11">November 4,
 1968</st1:date>, for the reading of the sentence, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span> ex­pressed the conviction that his
"wishes" had been completely ignored by counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> and that the latter had taken into account
only those of appellant <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> Lorenzo.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, too, well-settled is the rule that, even when the defen­dant
pleads guilty to a capital offense, the court must assure itself that he is
fully aware of the implications of said plea and that, to this end, it may or
should take some evidence to be reasonably certain that no injustice is done to
him.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a>
Since the trial court had discretion to take said evidence and to assume the
initiative in doing so, it obviously did not err in granting <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span> the opportunity
he sought - even prior to the commencement of the trial - to give his side of
the case, before judgment was passed upon him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The propriety of the action taken by the lower court becomes more
apparent when we consider that the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alin­castre</span> was, from the very beginning, part of his
plan to avoid the imposition of the death penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span> took the witness stand, with the assistance, no
longer, of his <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> counsel - who
was, also, counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> for
appellants herein - but of his own counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>,
who, in his brief, maintains that the testimony voluntarily given by <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>, without being discharged from the prosecution and
without any promise of reward or leniency, should be considered as a mitigating
circumstance analogous to those specified in the first nine (9) subdivisions of
Art. 13 of the Revised Penal Code - although deserving <u>greater</u> weight,
because of the attending circumstances - and that, together with his plea of
guilty, said mitigating circumstance should suffice to offset the aggravating
circumstances present in the commission of the offense and prevent the
application of the extreme penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY">Worthy of notice, also, is a factor that deterred <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alin­castre</span> from
testifying before <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1968</st1:date>,
namely, the fear that his safety and that of his family might thereby be
jeopardized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regardless of whether or
not it was justified, the record shows that <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>,
in fact, entertained such fear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
soon after the institution of this case, he asked the court to have him transferred
from the custody of the police department of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>,
in whose office he was being investigated, to that of the Constabulary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> even dreaded
detention in the provincial jail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
afraid of liquidation in the latter, as well as in the city jail, because of
his belief that appellants - particularly <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>
Lorenzo - had the backing of influential politicians in the city and the
provincial government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had been told
that members of his family would be killed, should he reveal what he knew about
the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accord­ingly, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> delayed, until the last moment, the introduction of
his testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He evidently anticipated
it would provoke appellants' animosity; but, he apparently felt that the
duration of the danger, arising <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, to himself
and his family had thereby been shortened materially.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the trial ended with the recep­tion
of his testimony, so that, thereafter, he no longer had to meet the appellants,
as he used to, from his arraignment on <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="7">July
 18, 1967</st1:date>, to <st1:date year="1968" day="5" month="11">November 5,
 1968</st1:date>, when the case was submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, appellants did not seek to postpone the taking of <span class="SpellE">Nenito's</span> testimony or ask for time to prepare for his
cross-examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, <u>their
counsel cross-examined him</u>, thereby waiving impliedly whatever objection
they had to the taking of his testimony.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> Said counsel did not even try to
rebut it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first assignment of error
is thus clearly devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">So is the second.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
the defendants in this case were jointly tried.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is more, appellants' counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
was the same counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> for <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence for the prosecution was intended
against each and every one of the defendants, in much the same way that the
evidence for the defense was meant to be for all of the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although prompted by a statement of <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span>, conveying his
wish to reveal in open court what he knew about the case, the trial court's
order reopening the trial, on motion of the prosecution, was neither qualified
nor limited to him, to the exclusion of his co-defendants, the appellants
herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this is confirmed by the
latter's claim that the lower court had erred in "allowing x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span>
to testify against himself <u>and the other accused</u>." Since the four
(4) defendants were tried jointly, every piece of evidence introduced at the
trial - regardless of who had offered it or on whose behalf it had been
submitted - could affect the whole case and every one of said defendants,
insofar as relevant to them.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The third assignment of error is predicated upon the premise that
the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span>
cannot be considered in determining the innocence or guilt of appellants
herein, which is not true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants'
criminal liability for the assassination of Mayor Gordon by <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span> is dependent upon the exis­tence of
conspiracy between the latter and appellants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> had no personal motive to kill
Mayor Gordon, who was absolutely unknown to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> saw the
mayor for the <u>first</u> time a few seconds only before he was shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>
Cruz had to signal <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> in order to assure him of
the mayor's identity.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that, up to <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1967</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alin­castre</span> was confined in the New <span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span>
Prison in <span class="SpellE">Muntinglupa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
serving a sentence for robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that
time, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> must have been barely 20 years of age,
for he was only 21 years old when he took the witness stand, on <st1:date year="1968" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was one of eight (8) children of a poor
family, whose head was para­lytic and had been bedridden for five (5)
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only bread-earner was the
mother, whose small store was not sufficiently lucrative to provide <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> with education beyond the fifth grade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He spent around six (6) months in military
training at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Aquino</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, San Miguel, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The family
resided at San Agustin, <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
near the house of <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> Lorenzo, who was well known
for his reputed involvement in the assassination of several persons.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution is to the effect that prior to
February 7, 1967, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, Rogelio Lorenzo, and
one <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Cruz had twice visited <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span>, in said
prison, and persuaded him to escape <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
because "the old man" needed him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Nenito's</span> testimony on said visit was
corroborated by that of Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> and Jesus <span class="SpellE">Aniciete</span>, who were, also, serving sentence in said penal
institution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The visitors of <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> gave him a sum of money and promised a bigger amount
later, in addition to a house and a jeep, and to being included in the payroll
of the city government of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>, as well as
becoming the col­lector of "tongs" from gambling dens and night clubs
in that city, once Mayor Gordon had been eliminated and his successor in office
had reinstated <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> Lorenzo as chief of police,
apart from a commitment to seek his (<span class="SpellE">Nenito's</span>)
pardon.</p>

<p class="BODY">As agreed upon, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> escaped from the
penitentiary in the afternoon of February 6 or 7, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the rotunda, near said institution, he
boarded a car, brought by Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Cruz, who were waiting for him and then took him to
the house of <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> Lorenzo, in <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
seeing Cruz therein, <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> inquired whether or not <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> was with him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Inasmuch as several other persons were then gathered in that place, <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> bade <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> to, meanwhile,
go elsewhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>
went to the house of his friend, Adriano <span class="SpellE">Espenida</span> -
in the same locality - who, upon his request, furnished him a polo shirt, and,
later, accompanied him to <span class="SpellE">Mamerto's</span> residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being still many people there, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> left once more.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When he returned, later that evening, <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>
was already dressed up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the arrival
of the car bearing <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>
boarded it and said "Let us go," whereupon they proceeded to the
house of Rogelio Lorenzo in <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next morning, <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Cruz, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, Rogelio Lorenzo, <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>
Lorenzo, his "<span class="SpellE">compadre</span>," Jaime Guevara -
then vice-mayor of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>, who <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>
found to be "the old man" alluded to before by Rogelio Lorenzo - and
two (2) high ranking officials of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, whose names
<span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> did not give, discussed with him the plan to

picture of the mayor and described his physical appear­ance, as well as
explained that the mayor used to go to church.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>, also, made several sketches:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>one, of the layout of the church, another, of
that of Gordon's residence, and a third one, of the city hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="2">February
 13, 1967</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> made a more detailed
sketch of said church, indicating its side entrance, the place where the
mayor's car used to park and the spot where <span class="SpellE">Nar­ciso</span>
Cruz would post himself, so that he could point the mayor to <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> when he (the mayor) arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next morning, however, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> and <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> vainly waited

<p class="BODY">On February 17 or 18, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span>, <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Cruz, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, Rogelio Lorenzo, <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>
Lorenzo, Jaime Guevara and two (2) other persons - whose names were not dis­closed
- met, once more, in Rogelio's house and discussed the assassination of Mayor
Gordon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of said unidentified persons
- believed to be a ranking officer of the Government - inquired whether <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> was "the boy" they had in mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> answered in
the affirmative, adding that "he is good." Before leaving, said
official admonished:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"take care of

<p class="BODY">In the evening of <st1:date year="1967" day="19" month="2">February
 19, 1967</st1:date>, the plan to kill the mayor was finalized with <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> Lorenzo, who commented that much time had already
been wasted, and reiterated the promises made to <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> said, moreover, that, upon the elimination of Mayor
Gordon, his successor would be his (<span class="SpellE">Mamerto's</span>) <span class="SpellE">compadre</span>, vice-mayor Jaime Guevara, under whose incumbency
he (<span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>) would be the chief of police, and, as
such, would investigate the mayor's liquidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, that evening, <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>
took the bus for <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, so that he may not be in <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> at the time of the occurrence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rogelio Lorenzo woke up <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span>, early the next morning, stating that <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> would otherwise get mad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Somewhat fidgety, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>
did not feel like taking any food or even a cup of coffee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he and Rogelio thereafter left the house, <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Cruz beckoned them to come back, which they
did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They checked the details of their
plan of action, after which <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>, Rogelio, <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Cruz and Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>
headed for the city hall, which they reached at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 a.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> then carried the revolver, Exhibit M, and a hand
grenade, both given by Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rogelio posted himself outside the city hall,
near a grandstand, from which he was to signal Cruz - at or near the door of
the city hall - when the mayor's car showed up, so that Cruz could relay the
signal to <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> inside the building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>
departed, stating that his assignment was merely to hide <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>
in the dug-out, under his (<span class="SpellE">Salcedo's</span>) house.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="30" hour="9">9:30 a.m.</st1:time>, a
Volkswagen car arrived at the city hall, whereupon <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>
Cruz gave the agreed signal to <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>, who noticed
that a man, resembling that in the picture of Mayor Gordon, shown to him by <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>, and fitting the description given by the latter,
alighted from said vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Gordon
entered the building, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> turned his back at him
and resolved to do his job regardless of its consequences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> turned
to face Gordon, the latter was talking to a woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Approaching Gordon, on his right side, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> whipped out his gun.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The mayor noticed this, and turned to the left, but, too late, for <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> had pressed the trigger and fatally wounded him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The mayor's bodyguard, policeman <span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Layao</span>, was then about two meters away, looking in
another direction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the sound of
gunfire, he turned and saw <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span>,
still hold­ing the gun, run away, although, in his haste, the paper bag con­taining
the hand grenade fell down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Layao's</span> attempt to pursue him was, however, thwarted,
momentarily, by the falling body of Mayor Gordon, which <span class="SpellE">Layao</span>
held and then placed on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, he went after <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>, who had
stopped a passing jeep which took him to the public market.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>
boarded a tricycle that brought him to the house of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>,
whom he (<span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>) informed that he had already shot
the mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon <span class="SpellE">Nenito's</span>
request, Pablo paid the fare due to the tricycle driver, and then hid <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> in the dug-out under said house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, that morning, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>
was apprehended in said dug-out by peace officers, who, also, found Rogelio
Lorenzo and Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, intensive interrogatories and
investigations were conducted by officers and members of the police force of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>, the National Bureau of Investigation and the
Philippine Constabulary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course
thereof, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span>,
Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> and Rogelio Lorenzo subscribed to
several affidavits implicating each other, as well as <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>

<p class="BODY">Testifying in their own defense, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>,
Rogelio Lorenzo and <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> Lorenzo disclaimed any
part whatsoever in the mayor's assassination.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The defense would, also, have Us believe that Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>
was, on February 20, 1967, asleep in his house, up to 10:00 a.m., when Rogelio
Lorenzo awakened him and demanded payment of his share in the earnings for
bringing, the pre­vious evening, a man and a woman who used the place as a <span class="SpellE">skibby</span> house, and that their aforementioned affidavits had
been made under duress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the
defense introduced the testimony of:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a)
City Judge Jose L. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>,
who declared that <span class="SpellE">Salcedo's</span> head was bandaged when he
subscribed and swore to the truth of his statement <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
I before him (the Judge); b) Sergeant Orlando <span class="SpellE">Acierto</span>
of the Constabulary, who testified that he was in the pre­mises of the police
department in <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City, on February 20, 1967,
between 4 and 5 p.m. and that he there saw Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>
with injuries in his head and face and Rogelio Lorenzo with burns in his neck;
and c) Dr. Geronimo <span class="SpellE">Lipumano</span>, of the <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City General Hospital, who examined <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> and Rogelio Lorenzo, on February 25, 1967, and
found in the former:</p>

<p class="BODY">Needless to say, the prosecution sought to offset the evi­dence
for the defense on the duress allegedly availed of to obtain the incriminatory
admissions contained in the affidavits of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>
and Rogelio Lorenzo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this purpose,
it introduced, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, the
testimony of:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) said City Judge <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> concerning the circumstances under which said affidavits
were subscribed and sworn to before him and ranking police officers, and
officers of the Constabulary and the NBI; 2) Vicente C. <span class="SpellE">Bacay</span>,
Rural Health Officer of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City, who asserted
that the aforemen­tioned injuries of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>
and Rogelio Lorenzo were of a minor nature; 3) Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>,
an officer of the police force of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>, who
stated, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that when <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alin­castre</span>, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> and Rogelio Lorenzo were arrested in Pablo's house
on February 20, 1967, the people in the vicinity mobbed said defendants, and
threw stones and bottles at them; and 4) Mariano <span class="SpellE">Mision</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> <span class="SpellE">Realubin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span> L. Rocha, all of the NBI, and Colonel <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> C. Perez and agent Reynaldo Cruz of the Philippine
Constabulary, who testified about the circumstances under which the
aforementioned affidavits were made.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">In the final analysis, the issue before
Us boils down to one of balancing the credibility and weight of the opposing
testimonial evidence, His Honor, the trial Judge having - independently of the
extra-judicial statements made by appellants herein - accepted the version of
the prosecution and found the evidence for the de­fense unworthy of
credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the theory of the
prosecution was fully corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span>, whose testimony bears all the earmarks of
truthfulness and who had no possible reason to falsely incriminate the
appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, the evidence
for the prosecution has been borne out by the following circumstances, among
others, that have been duly established, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span> did not know Mayor Gordon and had no personal
motive to kill him; 2) <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span>
and the <span class="SpellE">Lorenzos</span> knew each other well, for they were
neighbors and the <span class="SpellE">Lorenzos</span> were aware that <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> was serving sentence in prison; 3) accompanied by <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Cruz, Rogelio Lorenzo had visited <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> at the New <span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span> Prison,
in <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span>, and given him money sometime before
February 6, 1967; 4) having escaped from said prison, in the afternoon of
February 7, 1967, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> went with Adriano <span class="SpellE">Espenida</span> - as testified to by the latter - to the house of <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> Lorenzo, in <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, that evening; 5) <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span> corroborated the testimony of Adriano <span class="SpellE">Es­penida</span> to the effect that he (<span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>)
was then on board a car with <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Cruz; 6) the
affidavit of <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
N - concededly made voluntarily - confirmed the fact that he had been with <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span> in the house of
Rogelio Lorenzo in <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>, on February 17 or 18,
1967, and that he (<span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>) left <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>,
on February 19, 1967 - on the eve of the liquidation of Mayor Gordon - at about
10:30 p.m.; 7) <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> was apprehended in the dug-out
under the house of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>; 8) the latter and
Ro­gelio Lorenzo were then in said house; 9) the obvious artificial­ity of the
story given by Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> and Rogelio Lorenzo to
explain their presence therein; 10) said house of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>
was used for purposes of prostitution; 11) the revolver <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
M, with which <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> had killed Mayor Gordon, was
stolen from a naval officer of the U.S., late in 1966, while he was in a house
of prostitution, in <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>; 12) <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>
Lorenzo had the mo­tive to commit the offense charged, for Mayor Gordon had re­lieved
him of his office as Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>,
thereby leaving him jobless and in a precarious financial condition and the
vice-mayor - who would become mayor, in case of death of Mayor Gordon - was the
"<span class="SpellE">compadre</span>" of <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>,
who, in such event, expected to be made, once more, the chief of police; and
13) Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, whose house was used for purposes
of prosti­tution, and Rogelio Lorenzo, who supplied customers <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, would gain materially in these activities should <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> Lorenzo become the chief of police.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing, We are fully satisfied that the
conspiracy between <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span>
and appellants herein, as well as their guilt, have been duly established.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants argue, under their fourth and fifth assignments of
error, that the element of treachery should not be considered against them,
because they allegedly had no previous knowledge of the manner in which the
mayor would be killed by <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alin­castre</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This pretense is, however, refuted by the
conspiracy they had with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides,
they, particularly <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> Lorenzo, planned, in the
presence of Rogelio Lorenzo and Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, the
conditions or circumstances under which the mayor would be liquidated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is, more, <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>
told them to map out what should be done and that he would merely <u>carry out</u>
the plan thus made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, before
leaving for the city hall, in the morning of <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1967</st1:date>, Rogelio Lorenzo, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span> checked the
details of the plan, as devised by and agreed upon with <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>
Lorenzo.</p>

<p class="BODY">Citing People v. <span class="SpellE">Talledo</span> (L-1778, Feb.
23, 1950), it is surged - under appellants' sixth assignment of error - that
the ag­gravating circumstance of price or reward should not be consi­dered
against <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> Lorenzo, inasmuch as it was not he,
but <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span>, who
committed the crime in consideration of a price or reward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no merit in this pretense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Talledo</span> case is
not authority on this question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
relevant passage in the decision therein was part of the reasons given to
explain why <u>some</u> members of the court - not the majority - believed that
the evidence was not sufficiently strong to warrant the imposition of the death
penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, in <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. Maharaja Alim,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a>
it was held:</p>

<blockquote>"As a price and reward were offered by Maha­raja <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> to the other defendants, this circumstance classifies
the crime as murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <u>all</u> the
defendants contributed towards the attendance of this circumstance, it should
affect each and <u>all</u> of them."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Indeed, the established
rule in the Spanish jurisprudence is to the effect that the aggravating
circumstance of price, reward or promise thereof affects <u>equally</u> the <span class="SpellE">offeror</span> and the acceptor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was so consistently held by the Supreme Court of Spain in its
decisions of, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, <st1:date year="1888" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1888</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1892" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1892</st1:date>, June 26 and 30, 1894, <st1:date year="1903" day="8" month="6">June 8, 1903</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1909" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1909</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1917" day="23" month="8">August 23, 1917</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1923" day="30" month="11">November

and Manuel de la Plaza<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a> unanimously support the foregoing
view.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, under certain conditions - such as those obtaining in
the case at bar - the circumstance under consideration may evince even <u>greater</u>
moral depravity in the <span class="SpellE">offeror</span> than in the
acceptor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> Lorenzo made the offer or pro­mise of reward to <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span> in
consideration of a price or reward for <u>himself</u> - the office of chief of
police of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> and the "tongs" that
were expected to go with it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although, as contended under the seventh assignment of error, <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> Lorenzo had voluntarily surrendered to the
authorities, this mitigating circumstance is not sufficient to offset the
aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation, price or reward, and
disregard of the respect due to the offended party on account of his office or
rank.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court erred, however, in finding that Rogelio Lorenzo
was merely an accomplice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that he had actively
participated in persuading <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span>
to escape from <span class="SpellE">Muntinglupa</span>, as well as in the
conspiratorial meetings held in his (Rogelio's) house, where <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alincastre</span> stayed in <span class="SpellE">Olon­gapo</span>, in urging him, early in the morning of February
20, 1967, to prepare himself for the job he had to perform on that date, and in
the checking of their respective assignments, before leaving the house, that
morning; that he went to the city hall with <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span>,
Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>
Cruz and posted himself near the grand­stand in order to signal <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Cruz when the mayor showed up, so that Cruz could,
in turn, transmit the signal to <span class="SpellE">Nenito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alin­castre</span>, inside the city hall; that, thereafter, he
(Rogelio) went to and stayed in the house of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>,
evidently to see to it that he did his (Pablo's) own part of the agreed plan;
and that he was a party to the conspiracy to liquidate the mayor, Rogelio
Lorenzo is clearly guilty of the crime charged, not merely as an accomplice,
but, as a principal, and, should, accordingly, be sentenced to the extreme penalty,
and to indemnify the heirs of Mayor Gordon, jointly and severally with <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> Lorenzo and Pablo <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>,
in the sum of P12,000.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his brief, the Solicitor General says:</p>

<blockquote>"In view of the evidence positively indicating their
participation in the criminal conspiracy, Jaime Guevara and <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>
Cruz should likewise be prose­cuted for the murder of Mayor James Gordon of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
so that the ends of justice will be fully served.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two other 'ranking officials of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>' should also be prosecuted after their identity
shall have been ascertained."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, the Government should take appropriate measures in
connection with the participation of Jaime Guevara, <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>
Cruz and said ranking officials of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, in the
assassination of Mayor Gordon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Modified as above stated, as regards Rogelio Lorenzo, apart from
