Milling Co., Inc., from an order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental dismissing its peti­tion for prohibition
and, preliminary injunction to restrain <span class="SpellE">Bertito</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Dadivas</span>, as Acting Referee of the <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>
Sub-Regional Office, Region­al Office No.</span> <span class="GramE">VII of the
Department of Labor, from further proceeding with the hearing of Workmen's
Compensation.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Commission
Case No. 6385, involving a claim for compensation of <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
Pineda, as petitioner's former laborer.</span> </p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that Pineda's claim was filed, with the afore­mentioned
Sub-Regional Office, on <st1:date year="1961" day="18" month="10">October 18,
 1961</st1:date>; that it is alleged in said claim that Pineda was petitioner's
piece worker, with a daily wage of P4.00; and that he was discharged from the
service in Novem­ber, 1952, because of pulmonary tuberculosis contracted in the
course of his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
moved to dismiss the claim, upon the ground that it had been filed long after
the expiration of the period of two (2) months prescribed <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
in Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, or about nine years from the
date of Pineda's al­leged sickness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
motion having been denied by respondent <span class="SpellE">Dadivas</span>, as
Acting Referee of said office, petitioner instituted the present action, for
prohibition and preliminary injunction, in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, to restrain <span class="SpellE">Dadivas</span>
from pro­ceeding with the hearing of said claim of Pineda for lack of juris­diction
to hear and decide the same, on account of its aforesaid late filing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dadivas</span>, in turn,
moved to dismiss the action, alleging that appeal, not prohibition, is the
proper remedy to review his order complained of and that the alleged late
filing of Pineda's claim did not affect the jurisdiction to hear and decide the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Allowed by the lower court to
intervene as respondent, Pineda filed an ans­wer in intervention, alleging
therein, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that the Workmen's
Compensation Commission has exclusive jurisdiction over his claim and that
petitioner had failed to seasonably controvert the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due course, thereafter, the lower court <span class="GramE">issued</span> an order, dated <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1965</st1:date>, sustaining the contention of <span class="SpellE">Dadivas</span> and dismissing the case without costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this appeal.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The main question for determination in this case is whether or
not the Workmen's Compensation Commission has jurisdiction to hear and decide
Pineda's claim for compensation, despite the fact that it had been filed more
than two (2) months after the date of the illness on which it is based. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>In this connection, Section 24 of the
Workmen's Compensation Act provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"<u>Notice of the injury and claim for
compensation</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- No
compensation proceeding under this Act shall prosper unless the employer has
been given notice of the injury or sickness as soon as possible after the same
was re­ceived or contracted, and unless a claim for compensa­tion was made not
later than two months after the date of the injury or sickness, or in case of
death, not later than three months after death, regardless of whether or not
compensation was claimed by the employee himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such notice may be given and such claim made
by any person considering himself entitled to the compensation or by any other
person in his behalf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case medical,
surgical, and hospital services and supplies have been furnished voluntarily by
the employer, notice of the in­jury or sickness within the time limit above
mentioned shall not be necessary, and if the employer has volun­tarily made the
compensation payments, the claim for compensation to be made within the time
limits above established shall no longer be necessary."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as the filing of a claim for compensation within said
period of two (2) months is essential for it to "prosper", it is
clear that compliance with said requirement is essential to the success of the
claimant, or to the rendition of a decision favorable to him, not to the
jurisdiction to entertain his claim, for there could be no pos­sibility of
passing upon the merits thereof in the absence of authority, to hear and decide
the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a long list of cases,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
we have ad­hered to the view that the late filing of a claim for compensation
is not jurisdictional, but, merely, a matter of defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice for us to quote from Manila Railroad
v. <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> petitioner would argue that the
present claim is barred by Section 24 of the statute, since it was filed later
than two months after the date of sickness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anent this point, we agree with respondent Commission that the failure
of the company to file a <span class="SpellE">contraversion</span> of a claim
that may be filed, within the time fixed by Section 45 of the statute, is a bar
to question­ing the late filing of the claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said provision states in pertinent part:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'In case the employer decides to controvert the right to
compensation, he shall, either on or before the fourteenth day of disability or
within ten days after he has knowledge of the alleged accident, file a notice
with the Commissioner, on a form prescribed by him, that compensation is not
being paid, giving the name of the claimant, name of the employer, date of the
acci­dent, and the reason why compensation is not being paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure on the part of the em­ployer or 'the
insurance carrier to comply with this requirement shall constitute a re­nunciation
of his right to controvert the claim unless he submits reasonable grounds for
the failure to make the necessary reports, on the basis of which grounds the
Commissioner may reinstate his right to controvert the claim.'</p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner maintains that the filing of the claim within the
aforesaid period of two months is a condition precedent, of jurisdictional
import, and, hence, cannot be waived.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such a view is no longer prevailing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"According to <span class="SpellE">Horovitz</span>:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The defense of notice and claim may be <u>waived</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both claim and notice, while originally
considered conditions precedent to an award, have yielded to a more reasonable
interpretation, and are now considered defenses by employers or insurers or
state funds and subject to the same infirmities as other defenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If not seasonably raised by the payer of
compensation they are deemed waived, or, what amounts to the same thing, the
court will consider that the excuses or substitutes for late claim and notice
have been complied with, and hence the employer's or insurer's or state fund's
defense of claim and notice fails completely.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"So, also, Larson states that: 'The majority rule is that
strict compliance with notice and claim require­ments may be waived by the
employer or insurer'.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Conformably to the recent trend of jurisprudence, this Court
has in fact ruled that timeliness of notice or claim under Section 24 of the
Act is not jurisdictional.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a> Failure of the employer, as in this
case, to file a timely <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> under Section 45
of the law, bars all defenses available to the employer, including the defense
based on the employee's failure to file the claim in due time.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a>”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, it is alleged in Pineda's claim, that petitioner had been
notified of his illness; that he was hospitalized for 16 days; and that he had
been given medical attention by petitioner herein, through one Dr. Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Jara</span>, thereby suggesting that petitioner knew of Pineda's
illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, in his
answer, as <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> in this case, Pineda affirms
that petitioner's report or notice indicating its intent to controvert said
claim was filed on <st1:date year="1960" day="24" month="6">June 24, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the records of the present
case indicate that petitioner had filed neither the report of in­jury nor the
notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> within the periods prescribed
in sections 37 and 45 of Act No. 3428.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pursuant to said section 45, peti­tioner may be deemed, therefore, to
have renounced the right to con­trovert the claim in question, if the
aforementioned allegations are duly proven.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, petitioner's right to a dismissal of said claim is not
indubitable, so that no error was committed, either by respondent <span class="SpellE">Dadivas</span>, in denying petitioner's motion to dismiss, or by
the lower court, in dismissing the present action.</p>

hereby affirmed, with costs against petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span>
