<p class="BODY">A recital of the family history found in the exhaustive decision
of Judge Jose N. <span class="SpellE">Leuterio</span>, then of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>,
goes far to clarify matters and put things in their proper perspective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"To determine the real intention and purpose of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> in executing the
deed of extra­judicial partition of the San Mariano property, * * *, and
donating it to his son and to his grandchildren Benjamin, Raul and Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span>, * * *, we must have to go into the family
history.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The San Mariano property is
part of the conjugal partnership properties of the spouses Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> and Juana
Mendoza.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vicente <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span>
was the only son of the spouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
what the defense says, '<span class="SpellE">hijo</span> de <span class="SpellE">familia</span>'
and has not been trusted with the management and custody of the family
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vicente <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span>,
even during his marriage with the mother of now defendants Benjamin, Raul and
Miguel, lived in the house of his parents in San Miguel, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
until the death of his mother Juana Mendoza in April, 1928.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benjamin, Raul and Miguel also lived with
their grandfather.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mother of these
three children wife of Vicente <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Tecson</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> died when the oldest son Benjamin was only four years
old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The father and his children, now
grandchildren of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span>, lived with Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> and Juana
Mendoza.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Juana Mendoza took care of
these three children until her death in 1928.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>
and his wife Juana Mendoza took care of the education of these three children
sending them to exclusive schools, including the <span class="SpellE">Ateneo</span>,
De la Salle College and <st1:place><st1:placename>Jose</st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype></st1:place>."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Likewise, according to the appealed
decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Even, however, during
the lifetime of the wife of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, he had illicit relations with <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bulos</span>, whom he married later.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had three spurious children Lorenzo,
Josefina and Isabel whom they later adopted in 1936.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the death of Juana Mendoza, the amorous
relations between Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulos</span> continued, only with
more intensity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> transferred his
residence to San Mariano, <st1:city><st1:place>San Antonio</st1:place></st1:city>,
to be near <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulos</span> who
was living in <span class="SpellE">Tikiw</span> of the same municipality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No partition, however, or liquidation of the
conjugal partnership of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> and Juana Mendoza had been made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, in December 1929, for this reason and
partly perhaps because the business of the <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ricemill</span> was going down, they liquidated the conjugal
partnership, with the execution of the deed of <span class="SpellE">cesion</span>,
* * *, and the deed of renunciation, * * *, by Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span>,
respectively."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was then noted in the appealed decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"With the execution of these two
documents, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>
killed, as it were two birds with one shot, he liquidated the conjugal
partnership and he freed himself from being pursued by the creditors of the <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ricemill</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be observed that in the deed of <span class="SpellE">cesion</span>, * * * and in the deed of renunciation, * * * Vicente
<span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> did not receive any real property acquired
during the marriage of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> and Juana Mendoza.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All that he had acquired under the two documents were the interest and
participation of Vicente <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>
in the <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ricemill</span> but
subject to its obligation, then of unknown quantity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in the deed of renunciation, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> acknowledged having received only <span class="SpellE">palay</span>, money and credits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It may be asked why Vicente <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> had acceded
to this arrangement?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer lies in
the fact that he had always been under the support of his father and had lived
with him from the time of his marriage up to the year 1928.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when we consider that Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> had a domineering
character, and had absolute control over his son and grandchildren, such that
these descendants could not approach him and had to resort to their uncle
Mariano, it is easy to understand why Vicente <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span>
had acted and agreed to the deed of <span class="SpellE">cesion</span> and the
deed of renunciation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1932 Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, whether of his
free will or whether at the instigation of or thru the insistence or
supplication of <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulos</span>,
finally decided to crown his amorous relations with <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bulos</span> with marriage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, it would appear that his ties with his late wife Juana Mendoza
and with his son and grandchildren were still strong, and he did not want to
enter into the marriage relation without at least giving his son and
grandchildren the protection they were entitled to in view of his affection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so he thought of dividing the San Mariano
property between himself and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span>, and he
and Vicente donated the whole property to his grandchildren Benjamin, Raul and
Miguel."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What did transpire next, according to the decision now on appeal:
"Effectively, on <st1:date month="9" day="1" year="1932">September 1, 1932</st1:date>,
Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> and
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> executed the deed of extrajudicial
partition, * * * and on <st1:date month="9" day="27" year="1932">September 27,
 1932</st1:date> the deed of donation * * *.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But he did not entirely relinquish all the benefits in the San Mariano
property in donating the same to Raul, Benjamin and Miguel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Together with Vicente <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span>,
Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> borrowed the amount of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> from the Philippine National Bank, giving as
security the San Mariano property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
money, except for what was used for the payment of the obligation of the <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ricemill</span>, went to Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this debt was finally paid by the
donors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having done what he could for
the protection of his son and grandchildren, and perhaps with a feeling of
relief, a little over one month after the execution of the deed of donation, *
* *, or on November 3, 1932, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> married his paramour, <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bulos</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Further clarification was supplied by the lower court decision
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Things passed quietly for a
sometime until the <span class="SpellE">donees</span> made mention of this
donation to Atty. Juan T. David who found that the title to the property
donated still remained in the name of the donors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so the arrangement as outlined by Atty.
Juan T. David was made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over three years
had passed since the donation had been executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In those three years, a slight change in the
heart and affection of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> had taken place. Whether this change of heart was
voluntary or thru the supplication and importu­nities of the second wife, <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulos</span>, need not here be
discussed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to say that Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> made it hard for
the <span class="SpellE">donees</span> to effect the transfer of the donated
property; and not until the <span class="SpellE">donees</span> consented to the
leasing of this property to <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulos</span> for a period of five years, at a nominal rental of
over P2<span class="GramE">,400.00</span>, did Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> agree to the registration of the donation and
the transfer of the title to the <span class="SpellE">donees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court says the rental nominal as it was
only for the amount of P2,400.00, when, according to the plaintiff herself, the
annual share of the owner in the San Mariano property was about 5,000 <span class="SpellE">cavanes</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contract of lease was executed and <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulos</span> entered into the
possession of the property as lessee in the year 1936.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like the proverbial Camel, who, once having
placed his head inside the tent wanted to occupy the whole tent for himself,
Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> and his
wife <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulos</span> wanted to
have one half of the San Mariano property for them­selves; they were no longer
content with the possession and enjoyment of the property as lessee for five
years on a rental sufficient only to pay the annual amortization of the
indebtedness of the <span class="SpellE">donees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">And so efforts were made by
the donor Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>
to secure one half of the San Mariano property for his children with <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulos</span>."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Things were placed even more in their true perspective by this
portion of the decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The <span class="SpellE">donees</span>, however, refused to give any further concession to
their grandfather Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>,
perhaps because they believe that if they returned one half of the property
their grandfather would not benefit <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, but
only his children, by the second marriage with <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bulos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">donees</span> Benjamin, Raul and Miguel refused to meet their
grandfather Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>
as requested by him in the letters Exhibits M, N and O.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And four days after the appointed time for
their meeting on November 25, at San Miguel in the house of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span>, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> filed civil case 8304 for the annulment of the
donation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[Thus] it can be clearly seen
that Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>
wanted to make some arrange­ments with the <span class="SpellE">donees</span>
Benjamin, Raul and Miguel with respect to the San Mariano property, not because
his consent thereto had been obtained thru fraud and misrepresentation but
because of his small children whom he believed he had deprived of their
inheritance and to whom he wanted to leave a part of his property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in his letter, which had expressed
the true sentiment and feeling of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, was said of any misrepresentation or any deceit
either on the part of his son Vicente or on the part of the other
defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, a donation
inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span> is irrevo­cable except for the causes
which are provided by law, none of which presently appears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> would want to modify the donation, an intention
manifest in his letter to Benjamin, Raul and Miguel, * * *, in which he
expressed his desire to meet them on Nov. 25, 1939 in the house of his brother
Mariano so that he could make known his last final decision, as if a donation
which had been perfected was still subject to his change of heart and
mind."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">For an accurate appraisal of Judge <span class="SpellE">Leuterio's</span>
decision, the discussion of the legal questions raised must be taken into
account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"But even it be conceded that the
donation * * * and the extra­judicial partition, * * * had been fraudulently
obtained by Vicente <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span>, still plaintiff's claim
must fail. According to the plaintiff, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> discovered for the first time that Exhibits C and E
were not in fact mere documents to enable Vicente <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span>
to borrow money from the Bank, but were in fact an extrajudicial partition and
donation, in the latter part of February, 1936.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulos</span>
got a copy, * * * of the deed of donation on <st1:date month="3" day="3" year="1936">March 3, 1936</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In<span style="">&nbsp; </span>her
brief, plaintiff-appellant <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulos</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span> de <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span>
alleged that two errors were committed by the lower court, namely, its failure
to appreciate certain evidence of relevant and material importance,
disregarding their true import, weight and stark effect, with the result that
it failed to conclude that the preponderance of evidence was clearly in her
favor and its finding as valid and as the free and voluntary act of the
deceased, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>,
the deed of extrajudicial partition as well as the deed of donation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither assignment of error carries enough weight to call for a
reversal of the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An objective
analysis of the evidence, free from the compulsion of partisan bias, yields no
other conclusion except the correctness of the lower court's appraisal of the
facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily then, it is not to
accord deference to reason to allege, as plaintiff-appellant does in this
appeal, that the preponderance of evidence was clearly in her favor and that
the deed of extrajudicial partition as well as the deed of donation could not
be considered as the free and voluntary act of the deceased, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the brief of
plaintiff-appellant, even if minutely considered, that would sustain the above
assignments of error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To repeat, the
line of argument pursued by her is far from persuasive.</p>

<p class="BODY">For one thing, what is objected to <span class="GramE">is</span>
not any alleged failure to apply the law that is controlling but the lower
court's appraisal of the decisive facts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such an appreciation is primarily for the trial judge, who heard the
witnesses testify and who was thus in a much better position to gauge their
credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not that the conclusion
thus arrived at is to be considered binding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We would be <span class="GramE">recreant</span> to our appellate task if
such be our attitude.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are called
upon, however, in the absence of any taint of arbitrariness or bias, to yield
to its findings the presumption that they were arrived at with due care and
deliberation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A heavy burden is thus
placed on the party who would have us disregard them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must do so in a clear and convincing
fashion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is not the case here.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is said in the recent case of <span class="SpellE">Corliss</span>
v. Manila Railroad Company<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
finds relevance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In the more traditional terminology,
the lower court judgment has in its favor the presump­tion of correctness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is entitled to great respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, the lower court had the
opportunity of weighing carefully what was testified to and apparently did not
neglect it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no affront to
justice then if its finding be accorded acceptance, subject of course to the
contingency of ultimate reversal if error or errors, sub­stantial in character,
be shown in the conclusion thus arrived at.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a fair statement of the governing principle to say that the
appellate function is exhausted when there is found to be a rational basis for
the result reached by the trial court."</p>

<p class="BODY">In this particular case, the rational basis for the almost
fifty-page decision, as reproduced in the record of appeal, of Judge <span class="SpellE">Leuterio</span> cannot escape attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presence of a careful and painstaking
effort to appraise the true worth of what was testified to cannot be
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After setting forth the issues,
reproduced in this opinion, fully ten pages were devoted to a recital of the
evidence for plaintiff-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Equally so, the evidence for defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
received the same careful treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
rest of the decision was taken up with a thorough and exhaustive analysis of
the facts which have been duly proven and the principles of law that should
govern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would thus appear that no
effort was spared by Judge <span class="SpellE">Leuterio</span> to arrive at a
correct and dispassionate conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">If after such meticulous study, distinguished likewise by a more
than adequate grasp of the intricate legal questions presented, the lower court
decision is to be subjected to the stigma sought to be fastened upon it by
plaintiff appellant, then the commendable efforts of lower court judges to
maintain a high standard of the ad­ministration of justice would go for
naught.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Far be it from us to contribute
to such a deplorable result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal must
fail.</p>
