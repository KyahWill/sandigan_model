  <span class="SpellE">Manapla</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Manapla</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Romeo <span class="SpellE">Bacobo</span> and
two others - Ruben <span class="SpellE">Miñosa</span> and Leonardo Garcia -
approached them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All <span style="">of them were close </span>and old friends.</p>

<p class="BODY">Romeo <span class="SpellE">Bacobo</span> then asked <span class="SpellE">Sabio</span> where he spent the holy week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same <span style="">time, </span>he gave <span class="SpellE">Sabio</span> <span style="">a "foot-kick </span>greeting",
touching <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sabio's</span></span><span style=""> foot with his own left foot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="SpellE">Sabio</span>
thereupon stood up and dealt Romeo <span class="SpellE">Bacobo</span> a fist
blow, inflicting upon him <span style="">a </span>lacerated
<span style="">wound, 3/4 inch </span>long, at the
upper lid of the left eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It took </span>from <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11</st1:time> to 12 <span style="">days to
heal and prevented Romeo <span class="SpellE">Bacobo</span> from working during
said period as employee of <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling </span>Co.,
Inc. </p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Sabio</span> was thereafter prosecuted for <span style="">less </span>serious physical injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the municipal court he was found guilty
and sentenced to imprisonment of 5 months and 10 days plus costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the Court of First Instance, however, to
which he <span style="">appealed, he was found guilty
but with the mitigating circumstance of provocation, so that the penalty </span>imposed
was one (1) month and five (5) days of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span>
<u>mayor</u> plus indemnity of P100 and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant appealed from this judgment to <span class="GramE">Us</span>
to raise as a pure question of law the <span style="">sole
issue of </span>whether, under the facts as determined below, a fist blow
delivered <span style="">in retaliation to a
"foot-kick greeting" is an act of self-defense and/or justifying
circumstance entitling </span>the accused to acquittal and relief from all <span style="">liabilities, </span>civil and criminal.</p>

<p class="BODY">A primordial requisite for self-defense is unlawful aggression
(Art. 11, Rev. Penal Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And for
unlawful aggression to be <span class="GramE">present,</span> there must be real
danger to life or personal safety (People v. Beatriz <span class="SpellE">Yuman</span>,
61 Phil. 786).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, a mere
push or a shove, not followed by other acts, has been held insufficient to cons­titute
unlawful aggression (People v. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Yuman</span></span><span style="">, </span>supra).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A playful kick - the lower court rejected
defendant's claim that it was a "vicious kick" - <u>at the foot</u>
by way of greeting between friends may be a practical joke, and may even hurt;
but it is not a serious or real attack on a person's safety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's submission that it amounts to
unlawful aggression cannot therefore be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As rightly found by the Court of First
Instance, such kick was only a mere slight provocation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Reference is made to a
decision of the Supreme Court of Spain (prom. </span><st1:date year="1904" day="20" month="1"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Jan.
 20, 1904</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="">, 72 <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>.</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. 123-124),
considering a slap on the face an unlawful aggression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No parity lies between said case and the
present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the face represents a
person and his <span style="">dignity, slapping it is </span>a
serious personal attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is </span></span><span style="">a </span><span style="">physical assault cou</span><span style="">pled with a <span style="">willful </span>disregard,
nay, <span class="GramE">a <span style="">defiance</span></span><span style="">, of an in</span>dividual's personality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It
may </span>therefore be <span style="">frequently </span>regarded
as placing in real danger a person's dignity, rights and safety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A friendly kick delivered on </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">person's foot obviously falls short of such personal aggression.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b><span style="">,</span>
the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed <u><span style="">in</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against appellant.</span></p>
