Upon arrival at the house of the accused Santiago Ong, the latter's wife and accused Tony Chua were present.&nbsp; Complainant Mrs. Buyco was introduced to accused Santiago Ong by her sister Mrs. Asteria Bocaling (tsn, Buyco, pp. 30-31 and 34-35, March 31, 1971).&nbsp; In turn, accuse Santiago Ong introduced her (referring to Mrs. Buyco) to accused Tony Chua as his relative, his uncle and the one whom he could trust in his business.&nbsp; (<i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 35-36).&nbsp; Likewise, accused Santiago Ong introduced her (referring to Mrs. Buyco) to his wife Elisa Yu Ong (<i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 37-38).<br><br>"After the introduction and social amenities, Mrs. Buyco, Mrs. Bocaling and her son Dominador, talked in the sala with accused Tony Chua (<i>Ibid.,</i> p. 38).&nbsp; Then Mrs. Bocaling told accused Santiago Ong that her sister Mrs. Ortaliz has a note for him and handed the short letter now marked Exhibit 'C' in the folder of Exhibits for the prosecution.&nbsp; After reading the letter, accused Santiago Ong returned the note to Mrs. Bocaling and at the same time asked, 'where are the jewelries mentioned in this note.' (<i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 38-39).&nbsp; After said inquiry, Mrs. Bocaling answered that the jewelries are with her sister, Mrs. Buyco (<i>Ibid.,</i> p. 40).&nbsp; At this precise moment, complainant Florentina Buyco opened her bag, took out from it a tin can which contained the jewelries.&nbsp; (<i>Ibid.,</i> p. 41).&nbsp; Accused Santiago Ong, his wife Elisa Ong and accused Tony Chua looked at the jewelries and they talked in Chinese which they could not understand.&nbsp; After sometime, accused Santiago Ong told accused Tony Chua to select, and accused Tony Chua chose seven (7) pieces of jewelries.&nbsp; Complainant Mrs. Buyco was requested to list down the selected seven (7) pieces of jewelries and she obliged (<i>Ibid.,</i> p. 42).&nbsp; After Mrs. Buyco listed down the seven (7) pieces of jewelries in her receipt to the total amount of P123,500.00 she gave it to the accused Santiago Ong for signature.&nbsp; Mrs. Buyco explained to accused Santiago Ong and Tony Chua that as stated in the receipt, the jewelries will be sold in cash and their commission is the over-price they might make and if they cannot sell them, they will return to her the jewelries within one hour (<i>Ibid.,</i> p. 43).&nbsp; After accused received the receipt for his signature, he in turn handed it to accused Tony Chua and told him 'You sign the receipt' (<i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 44-45).&nbsp; Her sister Mrs. Bocaling protested that accused Santiago Ong should be the one to sign that receipt, but accused Ong assured them that the transaction is for both of them (referring to Ong and Chua) and that he will be responsible for it (pp. 45-46, Ibid.).&nbsp; Mrs. Buyco likewise told accused Ong, that he should be the one to sign the receipt since her sister Mrs. Ortaliz told her that it should be accused Ong who will sign the receipt, but accused assured her that Tony Chua is his relative and that he will be responsible for it (pp. 40-47, Ibid.).&nbsp; So, it was accused Tony Chua who signed the receipt (<i>Ibid.,</i> p. 56).<br><br>"After accused Tony Chua signed the receipt, he kept and wrapped the seven pieces of jewelries with his handkerchief.&nbsp; Accused Santiago Ong and Tony Chua went to the dining room and they talked in Chinese (<i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 36-37) while they stayed in the sala.&nbsp; Later, accused Tony Chua left the house of accused Santiago Ong while they waited for his return (<i>Ibid.,</i> p. 59).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>From a careful review of the facts of record, it is clear that the petitioner is not guilty of the crime charged.<br><br>It is an essential element of estafa that the goods misappropriated or converted by the accused to the prejudice of another were received by him "in trust or on commission, or for administration, or under any obligation involving the duty to make delivery of or to return the same."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Absent a showing by proof beyond reasonable doubt that the accused received such goods, he cannot be convicted thereunder of the crime of estafa.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In the receipt, Exhibit "A",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> reproduced as follows:<br><br><center>"<i>R E C E I P T</i><br></center><br>"THIS IS TO CERTIFY, that, I received from MRS.
