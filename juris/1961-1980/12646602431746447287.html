				<BR><BR><div align=""><div><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <o:p></o:p></span>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Accused of robbery in band with 
homicide and serious physical injuries, defendants <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Maranan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Galario</span> and <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> <span class="SpellE">Torano</span> were, after due 
trial under a plea of not guilty, convicted as charged, but sentenced, for the 
crime of robbery in band with homicide, to the extreme penalty, and to indemnify 
the heirs of Tan Gnat in the sum of P6,000.00, and, for the crime of physical 
injuries, to an indeterminate penalty ranging from six (6) years, eight (8) 
months and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><i>prision</i></span><i> mayor</i> 
to twelve (12) years and one (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, with the 
corresponding accessory penalties and to jointly and severally indemnify Tan Hoc 
in the sum of P5,656.70, with costs. <span class="GramE">Hence, this appeal by 
said defendants.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is not disputed that, while 
Tan Hoc was in his Bakery and Grocery Store, in San Vicente, <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span>, Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, 
together with Tan <span class="SpellE">Guat</span>, on </span><st1:date month="12" day="5" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 5, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, at 
about </span><st1:time hour="20" minute="0"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">8:00 p.m.</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, somebody knocked at the door. 
As Tan Hoc opened it, a man handed him P0.20, stating that he wanted to buy 
cigarettes with it. When, after picking up the cigarettes, Tan Hoc tried to 
deliver the same, he found the supposed buyer of cigarettes pointing at him an 
open "<span class="SpellE">balisong</span>" knife, accompanied by three (3) 
persons, later identified as defendants <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Maranan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Galario</span> and <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> <span class="SpellE">Torano</span>, one of whom had a knife, whereas the others had a 
pistol each. Thereupon, the malefactors entered the store tied the hands of Tan 
Hoc and Tan <span class="SpellE">Guat</span> in their back. Soon later, they were 
tied to the legs of a table. After ransacking in the premises in search for 
money, the malefactors later blindfolded and gagged the Chinese of the 
malefactors then said "Let us finish them because they know us", whereupon, Ton 
Hoc heard Tan <span class="SpellE">Guat</span> moaning. Soon thereafter, Tan Hoc 
became unconscious in consequence of several blows in his head. When he came to, 
Tan <span class="SpellE">Guat</span> was dead with eight (8) incise stab wounds, a 
lacerated wound, a fracture and a contusion. Tan Hoc, in turn, had multiple 
injuries on the head, aside from a <span class="SpellE">blackeye</span>, and 
several contusions, which required hospitalization for about forty-five (45) 
days. Moreover, four (4) watches, worth about P400, and the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,260.70</span>, in addition to a ring and fountain pen worth P25.00 
and P11.00 respectively, were found missing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Tan Hoc testified that appellants 
<span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Maranan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Galario</span> and <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> <span class="SpellE">Torano</span> are the persons who 
accompanied the malefactors who pretended to buy cigarettes; that <span class="SpellE">Maranan</span> had a pistol and it was he who inquired from Tan Hoc 
about the place where money was kept; that <span class="SpellE">Torano</span> was 
the malefactor who accompanied Tan Hoc to the place indicated by the latter; 
that <span class="SpellE">Galario</span> was one of those who tied Tan <span class="SpellE">Guat</span>; and that Tan Hoc was tied by <span class="SpellE">Torano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maranan</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Moreover, according to <span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span> <span class="SpellE">Macatangay</span>, a bus 
dispatcher of the <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> Transportation Co., the 
office of which is adjacent to Tan Hoc's store, on </span><st1:date month="12" day="5" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 5, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
between 5 and </span><st1:time hour="18" minute="0"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">6 p.m.</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, appellant <span class="SpellE">Galario</span> had been in said office, sometimes sitting on one of 
the benches therein reading newspaper, and when he (<span class="SpellE">Macatangay</span>) left his office, at about </span><st1:time hour="19" minute="30"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">7:30 
p.m.</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, he 
saw four men, including appellants <span class="SpellE">Galario</span>, <span class="SpellE">Torano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maranan</span> conversing at 
the sidewalk in front of said office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="12" day="9" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 9, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
<span class="SpellE">Maranan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Torano</span> executed 
before the Clerk of Court of Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> their 
respective affidavits, Exhibits B and E, admitting their Participation in the 
commission of the crime, charged. Two (2) days later, <span class="SpellE">Galario</span> made before the same officer, a similar sworn 
statement (Exhibit C). In addition to revealing that he had stabbed Tan <span class="SpellE">Guat</span> with the "<span class="SpellE">balisong</span>" <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. L, <span class="SpellE">Galario</span> indicated to the 
peace officers who investigated him, the place where he had hidden his share of 
the loot (at the foot of the ladder of his house), where the sum of P54.00, 
wrapped in a piece of paper, was found.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Prior thereto, or on December 8, 
or 9, at about 10 a.m., appellants had reenacted, in the presence of the 
Provincial Fiscal, the Assistant Provincial Fiscal, an officer of the 
Constabulary, a photographer - who took several pictures (Exhibits G, G-l to 
G-5, H, H-l to H-4, I, I-1, J, J-l, K, K-l and K-2) of the proceedings and many 
other persons, the commission of the crimes, at the very scene 
thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">A complaint was, accordingly, 
filed with the then Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> Oriental, 
charging appellants and one Esteban <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>, alias 
Esteban Hernandez, with said crime, but eventually, Esteban <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span> was not included in the information, he being still 
at large.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The main question raised in this 
appeal is whether or not the lower court has erred in not sustaining the 
respective alibis of herein appellants. In this connection, <span class="SpellE">Torano</span> would have us believe that on December 5, 1959 he was 
in the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Baco</span>, Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> he having been arrested for alleged disorderly 
conduct, owing to drunkenness, and detained in the municipal jail of that 
locality, from 6:30 p.m., to midnight Although the testimony of policemen <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> and Silvestre 
Corrales, as well as that of one <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Amorado</span>, were introduced by the defense in support of this 
pretense, the lower court gave no credence thereto, and we think correctly, for 
it is not borne out by the blotter of <span class="SpellE">Baco</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">So too, <span class="SpellE">Galario</span> and his alleged mistress, one Maria Mendoza, 
testified that he left their home in Baba, <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span>, 
Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, on December 3, 1959 and proceeded to 
<span class="SpellE">Taysan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, from 
whence he did not return until December 6. It should be noted, however, that, 
upon investigation by the authorities, Galario admitted having participated in 
the commission of the crime charged and even led them to the place where he had 
buried his share of tile loot. Indeed, <span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span> <span class="SpellE">Macatan</span>, gay, a bus dispatcher of the <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> Transportation Co., the office of which is adjacent 
to the store of Tan Hoc, testified that he saw the appellants loitering in the 
vicinity thereof in the evening of the occurrence, thus corroborating Tan Hoe's 
testimony about <span class="SpellE">Galario's</span> presence therein at that 
time. <span class="SpellE">Galario's</span> alibi is thus obviously 
untenable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">So is that of appellant <span class="SpellE">Maranan</span>, who claimed to have spent the evening of 
</span><st1:date month="12" day="5" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 5, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
with his wife, in their house, in New <span class="SpellE">Baco</span>, Oriental 
<span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, making lanterns up to </span><st1:time hour="0" minute="0"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">midnight</span></span></st1:time><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> Although one <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> Andrade sought to corroborate this alibi, the lower 
court found the evidence for the defense in support thereof unworthy of credence 
and the record before us does not warrant interference with the conclusion thus 
reached in the decision appealed from, not only because of the aforementioned 
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Macatangay</span>, but also, because His Honor, 
the trial Judge, has had better opportunity, than that afforded us, to observe 
the behavior of the witnesses during the trial and hence, to gauge their 
veracity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We agree, however, with 
appellants <span class="SpellE">Maranan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Galario</span>, that they and appellant <span class="SpellE">Torano</span> have committed, not two (2) crimes as held by the 
lower, but only one (l) crime, namely, that provided for in Art. <span class="GramE">294, subdivision (1) of the Revised Penal Code.</span> In view of 
the Presence of the aggravating circumstances of nighttime, dwelling and aid of 
armed men, aside from, as regards appellant <span class="SpellE">Maranan</span>, 
that of recidivism, he having been previously convicted by final judgment of the 
crime of homicide no other penalty than the maximum of that prescribed in said 
Art 294 (1), or death, should be imposed upon the appellants. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, with the elimination of the 
indeterminate sentence imposed in the decision appealed from, the same is hereby 
affirmed in all other respects, with costs against appellants herein. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">SO 
ORDERED</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Bengzon</span></i></span><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, J.P., C.J., Bautista Angelo,
