<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="22" month="8">August 22, 1962</st1:date>,
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it
stated no cause of action and to discharge the preliminary attach­ment for
having been improperly and irregularly issued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The plaintiff opposed the motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 10, 1962, after <span style="">a </span>hearing on the motion and opposition, the court issued an
order dismissing the <span style="">amended complaint
without costs and discharging the writ of preliminary attachment, but allowing
the plaintiff to withdraw the amount of P20<span class="GramE">,400.00</span>
which the defendants have deposited in court, "representing the amount <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>of money invested by the plaintiff plus the
corresponding interests thereon."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In due time, the plaintiff perfected an appeal to the Supreme
Court, the only issue involved in the appeal being one of law, where the case
was docketed as G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L­-20333.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Prior to the approval of the record on appeal, how­ever, or on <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1962</st1:date>, the defendants
filed <span style="">a </span>"MOTION FOR
EXECUTION PENDING APPEAL ", alleging as special reasons that -</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the
farmer-members of the <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> <span class="SpellE">Procoma</span>

be held up, by vir­tue of the preliminary writ of attach­ment of the plaintiff,
while they await the result of the appeal of the plaintiff to the Supreme
Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE"><span style="">and</span></span><span style=""> contending
that since the complaint has been dismissed, there is no longer any reason why
the writ of preliminary injunction should not be ordered discharged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On September 21, 1962, pending consideration by the court of the
approval of the record on appeal and the mo­tion for execution, the sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City sent <span style="">a
let­ter </span>to the <span class="SpellE">PTFCRCo</span>, enclosing therewith a
true copy of the order dated September 10, 1962, and inviting its attention to
the last paragraph of the said order which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Consequently, the writ of preli­minary attachment issued
therein is ordered discharged."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing on September 22, 1962, on the motion for immediate
execution and for the approval of the record on appeal, the court was informed
"that the sheriff had already implemented the order of the court of
September <span style="">10, 1962" (paragraph
XII, Petition) in the manner as stated </span>in his letter to the <span class="SpellE">PTFCRCo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of
this informa­tion, counsel for the defendants withdrew the motion for
execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1962</st1:date>,
the court issued an order approving the record on appeal in civil case Q-6547
and directing the clerk of court to certify the case to the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order further states:</p>

<blockquote>"Upon petition of counsel for the de­fendants for the
withdrawal of the here­in motion for execution pending appeal filed by counsel
for the defendants dated September 19, 1962, for the reason that the sheriff of
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City has al­ready implemented the order of
this court of September 10, 1962, which the court finds to be well founded, the
said petition of counsel is hereby granted and the aforesaid motion for
execution pending appeal is, therefore, considered withdrawn."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On November 23, 1962, defendants through counsel filed an
"Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span> and urgent motion for the release of
funds held by Philippine Tobacco Flue-Curing and <span class="SpellE">Redrying</span>
Corpo­ration under preliminary writ of attachment already dis­charged by this
court", alleging amongst others:</p>

<blockquote>"5. That upon the promulgation of the decision in this case on
September 10, 1962, dismissing the amended com­plaint of the plaintiff and
discharg­ing the writ of preliminary attachment, the defendants asked the
Philippine To­bacco Flue-Curing and <span class="SpellE">Redrying</span> Corpora­tion
to deliver over all the moneys, checks and other properties that may be held
upon the order of the Honorable Court and under the writ of preliminary
attachment as above-described; the re­presentatives of the Philippine Tobacco
Flue-Curing and <span class="SpellE">Redrying</span> Corporation offered to
deliver to the Sheriff all the said properties originally under attachment;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"6. However, the sheriff for the pro­vince of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City refused to
receive said properties and has con­tinued to refuse to receive such proper­ties
for delivery to the defendants on the ground that there is no specific order of
the court addressed to him directly requiring him to so receive such properties
and to deliver them to the defendants."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">As

Motion for Reconsideration", alleging amongst others:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"That considering that the imple­mentation of this Court's
order of November 24th, practically renders moot one of the precise questions
raised in the appeal and would ren­der ineffective any decision which might
eventually be made by the Sup<span style="">reme

answer that it had received a notice of garnishment from the sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City (served on it on August 15, 1962, <u>supra</u>);
that aside from the letter-notification from the sheriff, it also re­ceived a
letter of similar import from the attorneys of th<span style="">e </span><span class="SpellE">Batac</span> <span class="SpellE">Procoma</span>,
informing it that the court had discharged the writ of preliminary attachment;
that the <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> <span class="SpellE">Procoma</span>, on
the one hand, demanded the release to it of the "then available and
collectible amount" in the custody of the <span class="SpellE">PTFCRCo</span>,
while the attorney for the petitioner, on the other, threatened to hold the <span class="SpellE">PTFCRCo</span> liable for failing to deliver the amount of
P356,000.00 to the clerk of court, sheriff or other judicial officer; that to
avoid being in­volved in the case, it "forwarded and delivered to the re­spondent
sheriff (on November 27, 1962), specifically in accordance with the provisions
of the notice of garnish­ment dated August 15, 1962, the checks issued in the
name of the respondent <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> <span class="SpellE">Procoma</span>,
Inc., aggregating to P132,150.19 which was the amount then available and col­lectible";
that the delivery of the checks to the sheriff was precisely in accordance with
the provisions of Section <span style="">8, </span>Rule
59 of the Rules of Court, hence, the <span class="SpellE">PTFCRCo</span> has no
liability to the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-align: center;" align="center">ANSWER OF BATAC PROCOMA,

<p class="BODY">These respondents aver in their answer that the re­lease by the
sheriff of all the monies and checks in his possession to the <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> <span class="SpellE">Procoma</span>, Inc. was preceded
by the dismissal of the complaint and discharge of the writ of preliminary
attachment and by the sheriff's notification to that effect to the <span class="SpellE">PTFCRCo</span>, with an advice to be guided accordingly; that
"the counsel for the petitioner was in the sheriff's office before the
delivery of the checks, and was informed of the order of November 24, 1962,
direct­ing the <span class="SpellE">PTFCRCo</span> to deliver to the sheriff all
properties, moneys and checks of the <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> <span class="SpellE">Procoma</span>, garnished under the writ of attachment, and the
sheriff was, in turn, to deliver to <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> <span class="SpellE">Procoma</span> the said checks and properties", nevertheless
the said counsel "did not take steps to in­form the respondent trial court
of any supposed errors committed by it in relation to the order before said pro­perties
were actually transferred to the <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> <span class="SpellE">Procoma</span>"; that the monies and properties attached do
not belong to the <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> <span class="SpellE">Procoma</span>,
Inc. but to the members-stockholders thereof; and that the petitioner's failure
to file a mo­tion for reconsideration of the order dated November 24, 1962, constitutes
a fatal defect warranting dismissal of the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated hereinabove, from the lower court's order of <st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1962</st1:date>, dismissing the

<p class="BODY">The question posed in this petition for certiorari with

jurisdiction, or with gross abuse of discretion, in issuing its order dated <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1962</st1:date>, by which it
directed the release of the properties, monies and checks held by the <span class="SpellE">PTFCRCo</span> unto defendants in civil case Q­-6547.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The authority of a court to dissolve a writ of
preli­minary attachment, either upon <span style="">a </span><span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> or on the ground that it was improperly or
irregularly issued, can hardly be debated.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, the dissolution of the
writ of preliminary attachment was based on the court's finding of a lack of a
cause of action, and the fact that the order of dismissal of the complaint was
set aside by this Court on appeal does not imply that the dissolution of the
writ was done without or in excess of the respondent court's jurisdiction or
with grave abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
contrary, from the statement in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision in G. R. No. L-20333 - that the disposition of the
appeal is without prejudice to the right of plaintiff-appellant "to ask
for another writ of preliminary attachment in said court" - the logical
inference is that the dissolution of the writ of preliminary attachment was
within the respondent court's jurisdiction to order.</p>

<p class="BODY">The legal effect of the discharge of the writ of pre­liminary
attachment as directed in the order of <st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="9">September
 10, 1962</st1:date> is the extinguishment of the lien on the attached
properties, rendering them free of such encumbrance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Hi <span class="SpellE">Caifi</span> vs. Phil.
Sugar Development Co., 50 Phil. 592) Petitioner contends, however, that the
respondent court acted without jurisdiction in ordering on <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1962</st1:date>, the release of the attached
properties to the defendants in civil case Q-6547, claiming that said court
lost jurisdiction over the case after the approval of the record on appeal on <st1:date year="1962" day="22" month="9"><span style="">Sep</span>tember
 22, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The error in
petitioner's contention lies in the assumption that the order of <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1962</st1:date> is disparate from
the order of <st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1962</st1:date>
by which the writ of preliminary attachment was discharged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The directive of November 24 "is but <span style="">a </span>part, a
continuation, and an implementation" of the order of September 10, to
paraphrase the ruling of this Court in National City Bank of New York vs. Jose
M. <span class="SpellE">Tiaoqui</span>, et al., G. R. No. L-9770, <st1:date year="1957" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To change the expression, the order of
November 24 was practically a ministerial <u>auto</u>, intended to carry out
the pre-existing order of September 10.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a settled rule that trial courts have jurisdic­tion to issue
orders of this nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Naredo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>, 80 Phil. 220;
Alliance Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc., vs. Tan, 52 O. G. No. 18, p. 7634)
As the order of September 10 was issued within the respondent court's
jurisdiction, petitioner cannot validly complain that the order of No­vember 24
was issued outside or in excess of the court's jurisdiction.</p>
