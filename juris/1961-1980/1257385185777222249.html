				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Sulu, Hon.
Geronimo R. Marave, presiding, finding accused-appellant guilty of the
murder of Amilhamja Asaali, and sentencing him to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, to indemnify the heirs of his victim in the sum of P6,000, with the accessories provided by law, and to pay the costs.</p>
<p>It appears that in the afternoon of February 16, 1958 a group of
seven Moros, namely, Amilhamja Asaali, Ibboh Asiddin, Adjalawi Isnani,
Salip Jalani, Janjani Sadda, Tarang Ahamil and Asnawi Langhob left the
market of Siasi, Sulu, bound for Pagatpat and Tulling. The road passed
through swampy and muddy places, so upon reaching a dug well on their
way, they stopped, drew water from the well and washed the mud off
their feet. While washing their feet another group composed of Esmael
Susukan, Jumah Alian, Talib Madisa and Ahamad Moro came to the well.
These four also washed their feet at the well. After washing their feet
the first group of seven went ahead on a narrow path to Pagatpat and
Tulling. At a coconut grove on the way, where a path branches out to
the right past the house of Tuan Barok in sitio Sondo, Siasi, Sulu, an
encounter took place between Amilhamja and Esmael Susukan during which
Amilhamja received the following principal wounds: one on the right
side of the head, another on the top of the head, and a third at the
back of the neck. Those at the head exposed the brain and were fatal.
There were wounds also at the back, to the left side, one near the nose
and mouth, another on the left thigh and another at the right arm.</p>
<p>The evidence also shows that Amilhamja was a public school teacher, five feet, two inches tall and had a <em>barong</em> some 21-1/2 inches long. Esmael was bigger, being five feet, nine inches tall and carried a longer <em>Barong</em>, about 24-1/2 inches long. When the authorities went to the scene where the body of Amilhamja was found they found his <em>barong</em> near him, the scabbard tied to his waist.</p>
<p>The theory of the prosecution is that as Amilhamja and his
companions were walking along the path in the direction of their
destination, in a single file with Amilhamja leading the way, upon
reaching the coconut grove of Hadji Bulla, Esmael suddenly ran from
behind with <em>barong</em> unsheated, and upon reaching Amilhamja Esmael immediately hacked him with his <em>barong</em>
on the right side of the head. Amilhamja turned around and tried to
parry a second blow but was hit again on the back of the head. Upon
receiving this second blow Amilhamja fell down.</p>
<p>The accused claims that when the party of Amilhamja and his party
reached the house of Hadji Bulla and Tuan Barok, Amilhamja unsheated
his bolo and hacked the trunk of a coconut tree three times, then said,
"My <em>barong</em> is sharp and it wants to eat a person" and then,
directing himself to accused, said that the latter is the one he had
been looking for. Then Amilhamja tola accused to prepare, unsheated his
<em>barong</em> and walked towards the accused with his <em>barong</em>
unsheathed and made ready to hack the accused; that accused tried to
escape but Amilhamja blocked his way, and so they started fighting;
that the deceased was first hit in the upper left forehead above the
eyebrow, then in the mouth, etc. Accused also claims to have received
also six wounds. But the certificate he showed is dated March 14 (about
a month after the supposed fight).</p>
<p>The judge below assessed the value of the conflicting evidence and
arrived at the conclusion that the theory of the prosecution is nearer
the truth, thus:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Which of the two versions represents the truth?</p>
  <p>"The
Court has carefully examined the evidence adduced, and is satisfied
that Amilhamja met his death in the manner testified to by the
Government witnesses. The Court had observed these witnesses to be
candid and sincere. Their testimonies ring with truth.</p>
  <p>"The
accused does not deny having killed Amilhamja. The victim was then a
public school teacher. He was on his way to his station, Tulling. He
was not a native of the place, but of Parang, Island of Jolo. He was
walking ahead of the group while the accused was following behind.
Amilhamja was much smaller than the accused. His bladed weapon was
inferior to that of the accused. The probability that the victim was
the aggressor under the circumstances is remote.</p>
  <p>"The
incident took place right on the trail leading to Tulling. The accused,
a native thereof, was returning home to Tulling. The trail leading to
the interior does not go to Tulling. The accused left his companions,
Talib and Abdurasid sixteen feet behind him on the same Tulling trail
when the accused rushed from behind and slashed the victim. Amilhamja
sustained eight injuries, most of which were fatal while the accused
sustained just a few excoriations and two slight ones at the knee and
on the leg. These latter injuries must have been sustained by the
accused while Amilhamja was already down, parrying the blows of the
accused. Thus, the version of the prosecution that it was the accused
who rushed from behind and slashed Amilhamja many times until he died,
is more in agreement with the truth. Had the theory of the defense been
true, the incident would have taken place at the trail leading to the
interior and not at the trail leading to Tulling. The accused would
have suffered the eight serious physical injuries while the victim
would have suffered the excoriations and slight ones. It is however,
the other way around, a result which even extreme proficiency in
fencing would not be able to explain had the victim been the aggressor.
The offer of self-defense must fail."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our study of the evidence leads us to the same conclusion. In the
first place, if the deceased made the attack, it is very improbable
that he would have received the fatal wounds on the neck and head as he
did, and the accused-appellant would have certainly received more
serious injuries as were the skin deep wounds he showed a physician a
month later. In the second place the testimony of the two prosecution
witnesses to the effect that the accused suddenly ran from behind and
hacked the deceased on the right side of the head is confirmed both by
their (witnesses') position as they walked behind the deceased and by
the mortal wound found on the right side of the head of the deceased.</p>
<p>In the third place, it is improbable that the deceased would have
attacked, as accused-appellant and his witnesses pretend, a much bigger
adversary who was, besides, armed with a bigger weapon than that he was
carrying. With his position also as public school teacher, it is
difficult to believe that, without provocation, he would have been the
one to start the fight.</p>
<p>For all the foregoing, we agree with the findings of the court below
that the accused-appellant suddenly attacked the deceased from behind
and that the injuries were not caused to the deceased in a face to face
fight provoked by the deceased as claimed by the accused-appellant.</p>
<p>We, therefore, find no error in the findings of the court below and the sentence it imposed, and, therefore, affirm it <em>in toto</em> with costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala</em> and <em>Makalintal, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
