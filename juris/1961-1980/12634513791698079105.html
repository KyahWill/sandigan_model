				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Somodio</span>
seemingly seeks the review by certiorari of an order of Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Rufo</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Sucaldito</span>, of the Eighth
Regional District of the Court of Agrarian Relations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Somodio</span> is admittedly the
owner of a small tract of land of about two (2) "<span class="SpellE">fanegas</span>",
located in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Bita-og-Taytay</span>, municipality
of <span class="SpellE">Zarraga</span>, province of Iloilo, which had been
cultivated by Isidro <span class="SpellE">Sotelo</span>, as her tenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On June <span style="">8,
</span>1962, the latter filed with said Regional District a complaint -
docketed as CAR Case No. 1284 - alleging that he had been cultivating said
land, as Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Somodio’s</span> tenant, since 1952; that, on
or about May 29, 1962, after he had prepared the seedbed and plowed half of the
land, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Somodio</span> - who had, prior thereto,
threatened to eject him <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> - caused the
remaining portion of the land to be plowed by her agents; that she had, for
several years, given him less than the share due him under the law; and that,
despite his demands, she had refused to give him the balance of the share to
which he was legally entitled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sotelo</span> prayed, therefore, that a writ of preliminary
injunction be is­sued restraining Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Somodio</span> or her
agents from threatening to dispossess, or committing acts tending to dispossess
him of said land and that, after due hearing, said injunction be made permanent
and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Somodio</span> ordered to deliver to him the afore­mentioned
balance of his share, as well as to pay attorney's fees and other expenses of
litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon denial of a motion to dismiss of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Somodio</span>,
she filed her answer denying some allegations of the complaint and admitting
other allegations thereof, and affirming, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>a</u><u><span style="">lia</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>that <span class="SpellE">Sotelo</span> had been her tenant, but
only from 1959 to 1961; and that, in the latter year, he voluntarily returned
the land to Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Somodio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She, likewise, set up a counterclaim for
moral damages and attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, or on <st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="7">July
 16, 1962</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Sotelo</span> filed an urgent motion
for a preliminary injunction, which was not objected to <span style="">by </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Somodio</span>, despite the fact that
her counsel had seasonably received copy thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before passing upon the merits of said
motion, Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Sucaldito</span> of the aforementioned
Re­gional District, issued an order authorizing Atty. Salvador <span class="SpellE">Baylen</span>, a Legal Aide of the CAR, to conduct an ocular
inspection, on July 22, 1962, at 9:00 a.m., in the presence of the parties or
their authorized representatives, and find out who among the parties is in
actual, physical possession of the land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Immediately after making said ocular inspection, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Baylen</span> submitted his report stating that the land is in the
material possession of <span class="SpellE">Sotelo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day, or on July 23, 1962,
Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Sucaldito</span> issued the order complained
of, directing Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Somodio</span> "to desist from
disturbing, harassing <span style="">or </span>threatening"
<span class="SpellE">Sotelo</span>; "to refrain from working" on said
land; and "to maintain petitioner peacefully thereon until final
determination of this case."</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 31, 1962, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Somodio</span> moved
for the reconside­ration of said order and filed an <u><span style="">ex</span></u><span style="">-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> </span>urgent motion to stay the execution
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But both were denied on <span style="">August 1, </span>1962. On August 22, 1962,
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Somodio</span> filed with this Court the herein
petition for review by certiorari, praying, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>,
that said petition be given due course, pursuant to Republic Act No. 1267,
Section 13; that the order of respondent <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sucaldito</span></span><span style=""> dated August 1, 1962 be declared null and
void; and that, pending decision by this Court, a writ be issued suspending the
execution of the order of July 23, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On October 10, 1962, this Court issued said writ.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The present proceedings
should be dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To begin with, it
purports to be an appeal under Section, 13, of Republic Act No. 1267, which is
quoted on the margin.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Said provision refers, however, to <u>final</u>
orders or decisions of the Court of Agrarian Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is inapplicable to the orders complained
of, the same being interlocutory.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In fact, no decision or final order </span><span style="">has </span>as yet <span style="">been rendered, either by the Court of Agrarian Relations or by
Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Sucaldito</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">If Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Somodio</span> did not agree with the orders of July 23 and </span><st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="8"><span style="">August 1,
 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, her remedy was
to appeal to the Associate Judge assigned to the Eighth Regional District of
the CAR, but Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Somodio</span> has not done so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thirdly, the records do not show that Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Sucaldito</span> had abused his discretion in issuing said
orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted, in this
connection, that one of the main issues - <span style="">if
</span>not the most important issue - raised in the pleadings is whether or not
<span class="SpellE">Sotelo</span> was actually in possession of the landholding
in question, and that, before passing upon the merits of <span class="SpellE">Sotelo's</span>
urgent motion for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction,
Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Sucaldito</span> caused an ocular inspection to
be made in the presence of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Somodio</span> and her
counsel and that the ocular inspection revealed that the party in possession of
the litigated land is <span class="SpellE">Sotelo</span>, <u>not</u> Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Somodio</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fourthly, although a bond had not been filed by <span class="SpellE">Sotelo</span> before the issuance of said writ, this appears to be
justified by the language of Rule 11 <span style="">of
</span>the Rules of the CAR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
Section 3 of said Rule11<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
(explicitly authorizes <span style="">CAR </span>Commissioners
to "issue interlocutory orders in <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
cases directing the landholder to desist from ejecting the tenant from the
landholding pending the final determina­tion of the case on its merits," <u>without</u>
requiring a bond. Upon the other hand, Section 2 of the same Rule <u>expressly</u>
provides that the Court may <span class="GramE">require,</span> not only a bond,
but "a <u>cash</u> bond" to stay the execution of the aforementioned
interlocutory orders.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, the intent to permit the issuance thereof, without requiring a bond <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, is manifest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is more, it is easily understandable, <span class="GramE">for,</span>
otherwise, the order of desistance would, in many, if not most, cases, be
useless, since tenants generally have no property that could serve as security
for a bond.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition herein should be, as it is here­by
dismissed, and the writ of preliminary injunction issued <span style="">by </span>this Court on October 10, 1962,
dissolved, with costs against petitioner <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Somodio</span>.</p>
