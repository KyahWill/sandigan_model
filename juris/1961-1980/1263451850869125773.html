SAMAR, BRANCH III, AND IGNACIA MUNCADA, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In the general elections held on November 12, 1963, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Deananeas</span> and
respondent <span class="SpellE">Ignacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Muncada</span>
were candidates for the office of vice-mayor in the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Laoang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 27, 1963, petitioner was
proclaimed elected vice-mayor of <span class="SpellE">Laoang</span> by the
municipal board of canvassers of said <span class="GramE">municipality</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due time, or on November 29, 1963, respondent <span class="SpellE">Ignacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Muncada</span> filed a motion of
protest in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>,
presided by respondent Judge Ig­nacio <span class="SpellE">Mangosing</span>,
contesting the election of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The election protest was docketed as Election Case No. 332 of said
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due hearing the respondent
Judge rendered a decision, dated March 2, 1967, finding that respondent <span class="SpellE">Ignacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Muncada</span> had obtained 2,688
votes as a­gainst the petitioner who had obtained 2,673 votes, there­by
declaring said respondent the duly elected vice-mayor <span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Laoang</span> with a plurality of 15 votes over
the peti­tioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of respondent Judge dwelt only on the appreciation
of ballots.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 6, 1967, counsel for the petitioner, hav­ing learned
about the decision of respondent Judge and even before he received <span style="">a </span>formal notice of the decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
filed an urgent motion for leave to examine certain bal­lots preparatory to the
filing of his motion for recon­sideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said motion to examine the ballots was grant­ed by respondent Judge on
March 7, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 10, 1967,
counsel for the petitioner filed a motion to set aside the judgment upon two
grounds, namely, (1) that no sufficient basis had been furnished by protestant
(now respondent <span class="SpellE">Muncada</span>) for the determination of the
outcome of the election contest in view of her failure to intro­duce in
evidence the election returns from 14 precincts; and (2) that some 58 ballots
were improperly counted by respondent Judge as valid votes for herein
respondent, consisting of 41 ballots where only the word "<span class="SpellE">Asyang</span>" (admittedly the nickname of respondent <span class="SpellE">Ignacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Muncada</span>), not accompanied
by either the Christian name or the sur­name of said respondent, was written in
the space for vice-mayor;<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and 17 ballots where the <span style="">name </span>voted
for vice-mayor is "A. <span class="SpellE">Muncada</span>", which <span style="">was </span>not the name of the respondent <span class="SpellE">Ignacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Muncada</span> because there was
a candidate for munici­pal councilor by the name of Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Muncada</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On April 20, 1967, the
respondent Judge denied pe­titioner's motion to set aside the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><span style="">that </span>same day, April 20, 1967, counsel for petitioner filed <span style="">a notice of appeal, stating that the
petitioner "makes it known that he appeals <u>to the Supreme Court on
questions of law alone</u> from the decision rendered against him by the
Honorable Court dated March 2, 1967."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Likewise, on that same day<span style="">,</span> <span style="">April 20, 1967, counsel for the peti­</span>tioner <span style="">filed </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">motion to fix the
appeal bond.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On April 22, 1967, the respondent
Judge issued an order denying the motion to fix the appeal bond </span>and de­claring
<span style="">that the appeal filed by the petitioner
could not be given due course, upon the ground that Section 178 of the Revised
Election Code does not provide for an appeal in </span><span style="">an </span><span style="">election contest
involving the office of vice-mayor, </span>and that the decision had already
become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respond<span style="">ent Judge further declared that the appeal to
the Supreme Court was not in order because it would involve questions of law
and fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the issuance of this
order, res</span>pondent <span class="SpellE">Ignacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Muncada</span>
assumed office as vice-mayor of <span class="SpellE">Laoang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On May 16, 1967,
petitioner filed before this Court a petition for mandamus with preliminary
injunction, pray</span>ing that respondent Judge Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Mangosing</span>
be ordered to give due course to the appeal from the decision of March 2, 1967
in Election Case No. 332 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>
to the Supreme Court on questions of law and to fix the appeal bond, and that a
writ of preliminary injunction be issued stopping and preventing respondent <span class="SpellE">Ignacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Muncada</span> from assuming and
exercising the functions of the office of vice-mayor of <span class="SpellE">Laoang</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court <span style="">gave </span>due course to the petition for
mandamus, but deferred action on the prayer for preliminary injunction until
the case <span style="">is </span>decided
on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal issue to be resolved in the present case is
whether, or not, petitioner has a right to appeal to <span style="">the Supreme Court from the </span>decision of respondent <span style="">Judge </span>in Election Case No. 332 of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>; <span style="">and, if petitioner has such right, whether,
or </span>not, respondent Judge had unlawfully excluded petitioner <span style="">from the use and enjoyment of said right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find that respondent
Judge is in error when he denied to fix the appeal bond and refused to give due
course to the appeal filed by the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">true that under Section 178 of the Revised
Election </span>Code, which provides for appeal from the decision in election
contests, there <span style="">is </span>no mention about appeal from a decision rendered by the court
of first instance in an election contest involving the office of vice-mayor, it
is now <span style="">a </span>settled
rule that the decision of the court of first instance in election contests
involving the office of vice-mayor (and also of municipal councilor) can be
appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of law (Mar­quez v. <span class="SpellE">Prodigalidad</span>, 83 Phil., 813; <span class="SpellE">Calano</span>
v. Cruz, 94 Phil., 231; <span class="SpellE">Tumakay</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Orbiso</span>, 97 Phil., 431; and <span class="SpellE">Sarmien­<span style="">to</span></span><span style=""> </span>v. <span class="SpellE">Quemado</span>, L-18027, June 29, 1962).</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that petitioner filed his notice of appeal in
due time, <span style="">and </span>he made it clear
in his notice of appeal that he was appealing from the decision of the
respondent Judge <u><span style="">to the Supreme
Court </span>on questions of law alone</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is also shown that petitioner wanted to file the appeal bond <span style="">as </span>required
by law, because on the same day that he filed his notice of appeal he asked the
res­pondent Judge to fix the appeal bond.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the circumstances, <span class="GramE">We</span> believe that
respondent Judge had no discre­tion whether to give, or not <span style="">to </span>give, due course to the appeal of
petitioner to the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
reason of respondent Judge in denying the motion to fix the appeal bond and in
refusing to give due course to the appeal was that the appeal would involve
both questions of fact and of law, and <span style="">as
</span>such the appeal to the Supreme Court was not in order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact, however, as We have adverted to,
was that petitioner had clearly stated in his notice of appeal that he was
appealing to the Supreme Court on pure­ly questions of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That statement of petitioner in his notice of
appeal - which was filed on time - serves as the basis of his right to have his
appeal to the Supreme Court given due course by the respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not for the trial judge to determine
the nature of the issues that would be raised by the appealing party in his
appeal to the appellate court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is </span>not for
the trial judge to control the issues that would be raised, or could be raised,
by the appellant in his appeal before the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, it is the Supreme Court, and the
Supreme Court alone, that will determine whether, or not, the appeal brought
before it involves purely questions of law, as announced in the notice of
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once this Court finds that the issue
in­volved in the appeal before it, coming directly from the trial court,
relates to questions of fact, or to mixed questions of fact and law, this Court
will necessarily dis­miss the appeal or remand the appeal to the Court of
Appeals as the case may be.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the fore going, We declare that it was incumbent upon
the respondent Judge to give due course to the appeal filed by petitioner from
his decision of March 2, 1967 in Election Case No. 332 of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We find, however, that the circumstances of the present case, as shown
in the record, do not fully warrant the issuance of the writ of preli­minary
injunction prayed for by the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ of mandamus prayed for by the
petitioner should be, as it is hereby granted; and respondent Judge Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Mangosing</span>, or whoever is the Judge presiding the branch of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> where Election
Case No. 332 is assigned, is hereby ordered to give due course to the appeal
filed by peti­tioner <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Deananeas</span>
from the decision in said Election Case No. 332, and to fix the appeal bond <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Without costs.</span></p>
