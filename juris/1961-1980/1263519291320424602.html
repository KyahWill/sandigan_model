dismissing - on the ground that the "complaint states no cause of
action" - its Civil Case No. C-628, an action for damages based upon an
alleged malicious prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the record on appeal, for the crime of falsification
of a private document allegedly committed against <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>, <span style="">appellant <span class="SpellE">Joaquina</span>
Ventura stood trial in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
upon the following complaint filed with the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span>
office:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The undersigned accuses JOAQUINA DE VENTURA of the crime of
'Falsification of Private Document' under Art. 172 <span class="SpellE">subpar</span>.
(2) of the Revised Penal Code, committed as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That on or about October 4, 1958, in the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused,
did then and there willfully and feloniously commit falsification in a private
document, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the said accused WILLFULLY,
UNLAWFULLY and FELONIOUSLY presented to Mr. <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>
B. <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> a supposed letter of Cmdr. <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span> Jr. of the Presidential
Fact Finding Committee addressed to Mr. <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> asking
for a loan of P350.00 and the accused further stating that Cmdr. <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span> was then in her residence waiting for the money
and with the instruction to hand to her the money for delivery to Cmdr. <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span> which Mr. <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> did
by issuing a Bank of America Check No. 703659 dated October 5, 1958 for P350.00
and handing the same to the accused; that upon verification, it has been found
out that the letter above referred to was never and has never been made by
Cmdr. <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span> and that the signature appearing on
the same is not the signature of Cmdr. <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span>;
that the said Check has already been cash(ed) on or about October 7, 1958 to
the damage and prejudice of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> in the sum of P350.00 Philippine Currency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"CONTRARY TO LAW"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and was ultimately acquitted in a
decision of said court as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"During the trial of this case, <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> pointed at the accused and told the Court
that he had known her and her husband as early as 1958; that he and <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> husband, are <span class="SpellE">compadres</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> testified
that Maj. Ventura, <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> husband, in the year
1958, was one of the members of the Presidential Fact Finding Committee, which
was under the chairmanship of Commander <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that he was an agent of Ventura and
as such he had some dealings with Commander <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span>,
thru Ventura; that during the year 1958, <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span> on five occasions asked him for sums of money
thru Maj. Ventura, which sums all amounted to P2,000.00; that he gave all this
money to <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span>
thru Ventura <span class="SpellE">altho</span> he admitted that he does not know
and has not yet met the said Commander <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 4, 1958, <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>
said, the accused went to his house and showed to him a letter purporting to be
signed by Commander <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span>, asking for the sum of
P350.00; that on the strength of this letter and the representation of the
accused that <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span> was in her house waiting for
the money, he right away made a check, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B, and
delivered it to the said accused, <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> further
testified that later on he went to see Commander <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span>
and inquired whether he received the money and the latter replied that he never
re<span style="">ceived any; that he showed </span><span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span> the letter, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A, and
the latter denied that he wrote the said <span style="">letter.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In her defense, the accused vigorously denied that she went
to the house of <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>
and gave the letter, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also denied having received the check on <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said that <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="10"><span style="">October 4, 1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> she did not go </span>out of her house
because she has just delivered and was still weak.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused further testified that the
complainant in filing this case against her must have been motivated because of
a series of misunderstandings he had with her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused claims that she does not know
Commander <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After hearing the evidence of the prosecution and that of the
accused, the Court finds the following as established facts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> was an agent of Maj. Ventura.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Major Ventura in turn was an agent of
Commander <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span> who was at that time the Chairman
of the Presidential Fact Finding Committee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> does not know <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span>
and has no direct contact with him, and that as an agent of Maj. Ventura <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> has been giving money to <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span>
which <span class="SpellE">totalled</span> all in all P2,000.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Now, on these facts, several questions puzzled the
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why was <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>
giving money to <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span> when according to his own
testimony he does not know the said <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Why
did <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> go to <span class="SpellE">Ca<span style="">linawan</span></span></span> in order to
verify about the letter, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A, and also to find out
whether he has received the money that he <span style="">gave
to </span>the accused when he did not do so when he gave <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span>
<span style="">the sums of money that <span class="SpellE">totalled</span> all </span>in all P2,000.00?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The failure of <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>
to explain these circumstances has made the evidence of the prosecution
incoherent and vague and, eventually, affected the credibility of the said <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, the Court finds that the testimony of the accused is more
credible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused said that <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> filed the instant case because of a series of
misunderstandings that the said <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> had with her
husband, Maj. Ventura.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was not even
rebutted by the prosecution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Court finds the accused NOT
GUILTY of the crime charged, and, therefore, ACQUITS her, with costs <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Subsequent to this
acquittal, appellant, with the assistance of her husband, her co-appellant, filed
the above-mentioned civil case against <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> praying "that judgment be rendered in favor of
the plaintiff and against the defendant:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

plaintiff's bail bond for 4 years in connection with the Criminal Case No. 9003

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">upon
the allegation that said "defendant formulated against the plaintiff (the
above) criminal charge before the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office, with
malicious intent and/or malice aforethought, and without justifiable cause or
motive whatsoever, other than to wreck vengeance on the plaintiff and her
husband (against) whom defendant had an axe to grind, and for the purpose of
smearing the honor, reputation and prestige of the plaintiff and her family and
to embarrass and expose her to public ridicule and contempt, which led to the </span><span style="">filing be</span><span style="">fore the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> of

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In due time, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed a motion to dismiss grounded thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"As gleaned from the above-named

</span>A careful perusal of the decision at bar, will show that the same does
not contain such declaration or order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Honorable Judge Andres Reyes simply absolved the accused or the
herein plaintiff of the offense charged without, however, making any
pronouncement or explicit statements that the accusation is false and libelous;
neither did he order that the complaining witness or the herein defendant be
proceeded against through an information by the prosecuting officer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, after examining the findings of the Court in the
instant case, it is safe to conclude that the herein plaintiff was acquitted
not because the accusation against him is fabricated but on the ground of insufficiency

doubt."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and over the vigorous objection of the
appellant, the trial court issued the appealed order of dismissal, pertinent
portions of which read:</p>

<blockquote>"Acting now on said motion and upon careful consideration and
study of the case at bar, as well as the arguments adduced for and against said
motion, the Court is of the opinion that the complaint states no cause of
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This conclusion is buttressed by
the doctrine enunciated in the case of <span class="SpellE">Grattage</span> vs.

<p class="2Q">â€˜Malicious Prosecution:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Declaration
by the Trial Judge; Action for Damages.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- In order that an action for damages may lie upon a false charge or accusation
of a crime of a public nature, it is indispensable that the final decree of
acquittal or dismissal in such case should declare that it is false and
slanderous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of such
declaration, the false accuser can not be prosecuted upon a claim for indemnity
under article 326 of the Penal Code.</p>

<p class="2Q">'Id; Id; Id; - When in proceedings had in the investigation of a
crime falsely charged, the judgment or order of dismissal does not expressly
declare that the denunciation or accusation is false and libelous, there is no
basis upon which to rest a claim of civil liability, which is merely a
consequence of the criminal responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Gonzales <span class="SpellE">Quiros</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>
Tan <span class="SpellE">Guinlay</span>, 5 Phil. Rep. 675)â€™"</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this appeal, appellants'
brief, which, incidentally, leaves much room for improvement, assigns three
errors allegedly committed by the court below but centers its discussion only
on the point that His Honor has erroneously relied on old decisions of this
Court applying Article 326 of the Spanish Penal Code of </span>1887 <span style="">which required as a condition precedent for
the filing of a suit for malicious prosecution (<span class="SpellE">acusacion</span>
o <span class="SpellE">denuncia</span> <span class="SpellE">falsa</span>) a
previous court finding specifically to the effect that the previous accusation
was false, inasmuch as, according to appellants, said Article 326 has not been
carried over in the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While it is obvious that the argument that the stated requirement of the
old penal code Article 326 no longer holds under the present laws under which
appellants' complaint was filed is well taken, appellants' brief has left it to
this Court to note by itself what in fact</span><span style=""> is the more serious and fatal error committed by the trial </span><span style="">court, namely, that it dismissed appellant's
complaint </span><span style="">notwithstanding that
it sufficiently states in form and in substance a cause of action for malicious
prosecut</span><span style="">ion under Article 2219
and related provisions of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Exercising Our discretion as authorized by Section 7 of Rule 51 of the
Rules of </span><span style="">Court, We opt to </span><span style="">consider said plain error on Our own
initiative and, in </span><span style="">consequence,
We reverse the </span><span style="">appealed order of
dismissal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The sole point raised by
appellants regarding Ar</span><span style="">ticle 326
of the </span><span style="">Spanish Penal Code and
the decisions applying the same, <span class="SpellE">Grattage</span> v. Standard

definitely that Article 326 of the Spanish Penal Code "does not appear in
the Revised Penal Code, which contains no offense denominated '<span class="SpellE">acusacion</span> o <span class="SpellE">denuncia</span> <span class="SpellE">falsa</span>' or its equivalent." The only provision of the
Revised Penal Code which may be said to refer to the </span><span style="">same subject is Article 363 on </span><span style="">Incriminatory Machination providing thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"ART. 363.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incriminating </span>innocent <span style="">person.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- Any person who, by any act </span>not constituting perjury, shall directly
incriminate <span style="">or impute to an </span>innocent
person the commission of a crime shall be punished by <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span><u>
mayor</u>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As has already been held
in Rivera, this article does not contemplate the idea of malicious prosecution
in the sense of someone prosecution or instigating a criminal charge in court:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"Comparing now article
363 </span>of the Revised Penal Code with article 326 <span style="">of the old </span>Penal Code, it will be ob<span style="">served that under </span>article 326 of the former Penal Code, the <span class="SpellE">gravamen</span> of the offense is the imputation itself <span style="">when made before </span>an administrative<span style=""> </span>or judicial officer, whereas in article
363 of the Revised Penal Code the <span class="SpellE">gravamen</span> of the
offense is performing an act which 'tends directlyâ€™ to such an imputation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 326 of the old Penal Code punishes
false prosecutions whereas article 363 of the Revised Penal Code punishes any
act which may tend directly to cause a false prosecution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is well settled law that where the text of a statute is
clear, it is improper to resort to a caption or title to make it obscure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such secondary sources may be resorted to in
order to remove, not to create doubt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Cf. People vs. <span class="SpellE">Yabut</span>, 58 Phil, 499.) In the
present case we think it proper to call attention to the title immediately
preceding article 363 of the Revised Penal Code which is as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'<span class="SpellE">Asechanzas</span> <span class="SpellE">Inculpatorias</span>â€™, as throwing some light on the classes of

<span class="SpellE">sino</span> en <span class="SpellE">virtud</span> de <span class="SpellE">sentencia</span> <span class="SpellE">firme</span> o auto, <span class="SpellE">tambien</span> <span class="SpellE">firme</span>, de <span class="SpellE">sobreseimiento</span> del tribunal <span class="SpellE">que</span> <span class="SpellE">hubiere</span> <span class="SpellE">conocido</span> del <span class="SpellE">delito</span> <span class="SpellE">imputado</span>", whether it
referred to a subsequent civil or criminal proceeding, has no counter-part in
the articles of the Civil Code just mentioned nor in any other law or rule of
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, all that the aggrieved
party in a case of malicious prosecution has to prove to merit the award of
damages is that he has been denounced or charged falsely of an offense by the
defendant, that the latter knows that the charge was false, that the said
defendant acted with malice and, of course, the damages he has suffered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Martinez</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> v. United Finance Corporation, G. R. No.
L-24017, </span><st1:date year="1970" day="31" month="8"><span style="">August 31, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">, 34 SCRA 524, Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, speaking for the Court, held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Malicious prosecution, to be the basis of a suit, requires
the elements of malice and want of probable cause in the prosecution of an
action against the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A third
element is that the defendant must himself be the prosecutor or the instigator
of the prosecution, which ended in acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These elements are discussed in the case of Buchanan vs. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Esteban, (32 Phil. 363.) thus:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'To support an action for malicious prosecution under American law
the plaintiff must prove, in the first place, the fact of the prosecution and
the fact that the defendant was himself the prosecutor, or that he instigated
its commencement, and that it finally terminated in his acquittal, that, in
bringing it, the prosecutor had acted without probable cause, and that he was
actuated by legal malice, <span class="SpellE">i</span>. e., by improper or sinister
motives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These three elements must
concur; and there is no distinction between actions for criminal prosecution,
and civil suits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both classes require
substantially the same essentials.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Malice is essential to the maintenance of an action for malicious
prosecution and not merely to the recovery of exemplary damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But malice alone does not make one liable for
malicious prosecution, where probable cause is shown, even where it appears
that the suit was brought for the mere purpose of vexing, harassing and
injuring his adversary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words,
malice and want off probable cause must both exist in order to justify the
action.' (Quoted in Rehabilitation Finance Corp. v. <span class="SpellE">Koh</span>,
L-15512, Feb. 28, 1962, 4 SCRA 535, 540.)"</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is true that in that
case of Martinez, this Court sustained the order of dismissal of the complaint
for malicious prosecution partly because a preliminary in</span><span style="">vestigation had been conducted by the fiscal
had found probable cause for the filing of a <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
case against Martinez, but the main consideration for such action of this Court
was the fact that from the recitals in the judgment acquitting the plaintiff,
it appeared that although the court found that said plaintiff had been guilty
of deceit, the issue resolved by the court was that in law such deceit did not
constitute <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>, a matter which had been passed
upon by the fiscal in a different way, naturally, without any fault on the part
of the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Martinez</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> case, the findings of the criminal court in
the decision of acquittal <span class="SpellE">negatived</span> the imputation of
malice on the part of the defendant in charging plaintiff with <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> before the fiscal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case at bar, the
complaint alleges, as earlier stated, that "defendant formulated against
the plaintiff (the above) criminal charge before the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>
Office, with malicious intent and/or malice aforethought, and without
justifiable cause or motive whatsoever, other than to wreck vengeance on the
plaintiff and her husband (against) whom defendant had an axe to grind, and for
the purpose of smearing the honor, reputation and prestige of the plaintiff and
her family and to embarrass and expose her to public ridicule and contempt,
which led to the filing before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> of a criminal case docketed as No. 9003 for <span class="SpellE">Estafa</span> thru Falsification of Private Document; copy of the
information (criminal complaint above-quoted) is hereto attached and marked
Annex A of this complaint" and "by reason of defendant's malicious
and unjustifiable filing of the criminal action", she suffered the damages
claimed in the above-quoted prayer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unlike in the </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Martinez</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> case, We cannot </span><span style="">say </span><span style="">that the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
decision that </span><span style="">acquitted </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bernabe</span></span><span style=""> suggests clearly that said respondent had
good reasons to accuse <span class="SpellE">appelant</span> <span class="SpellE">Juaquina</span>
Ventura as he did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quite on the
contrary, the findings of the court that the "testimony of the accused is
more credible" and that the testimony of said accused that "<span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> filed the instant case because of a series of
misunderstandings that the said <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> had with her
husband, Maj. Ventura - was not even rebutted by the prosecution", would
seem to indicate otherwise, that is, that the exculpatory version of the
accused was the true one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In any event, whether or
not all the circumstances would show actual or legal malice is a matter of
proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this juncture, the only
question before Us is whether or not the complaint of appellants make out a
case of damages for malicious prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Palma</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> vs. <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span>, 99
Phil. 72, penned by no less than our present Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
it was pertinently pointed out:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The
order of dismissal complained of is predicated upon the theory that the filing
of the information above referred to, is 'presumed' to have been made 'in good
faith' and that, in fact, the proper court had found the existence of probable
cause against plaintiff herein, <u>contrary</u> to the allegations in the
complaint, which specifically charges 'bad faith', lack of 'any probable
cause', desire to give vent to 'personal hatred and vengeance,' and intent to
harass and embarrass the plaintiff and to besmirch his honor and
reputation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only question for
determination by the court, at the time of the issuance of said order, was
whether or not <u>the</u> <u>complaint</u> states a cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This implied that said issue was to be passed
upon on the basis of allegations of the complaint, <u>assuming them to be true</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, his honor, the trial judge <u>inquired</u>
into the truth of said allegations and, in effect, <u>found them to be false</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this it did without giving the plaintiff
an opportunity to prove his aforesaid allegations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the lower court had, not only exceeded
its jurisdiction, by going beyond the purview of the issue posed by defendants'
motion to dismiss, but, also, denied due process of law to plaintiff herein,
by, in effect deciding the case on the merits, before it had been submitted for
decision and before plaintiff had had a chance to introduce evidence in support
of the allegations of his complaint."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As may be noted, the
phraseology of the material allegations of the complaint in this case and those
in the above case of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Palma</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> are practically identical, for which reason, a similar result is
called for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, what could be a
safe test as to whether or not there is malicious prosecution is indicated in
Buenaventura et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo and Ignacio, 103
Phil. 239, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is true that the present action is not criminal but civil
in nature, but the provisions of the Civil Code in making reference to malicious
prosecution must necessarily imply that the person to be held liable to pay
moral damages should have acted <span style="">deliberately
and with knowledge that his accusation of the person subject to such <u>malicious</u>
<u>prosecution</u>, was false and groundless.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The same thing is true as regards the demand for attorney's fees and
expenses of litigation, authorized under Article 2208, No. 3 of the Civil
Code."'<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Substantially,
if not literally, and on the whole, this is what the complaint here in question
alleges, hence Our conclusion that the same states a cause of action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For the rest, it might
just as well be clarified here, lest some statements in Martinez and
Buenaventura relative to the materiality of the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span>
having filed an information on the question of malice of the accuser may be
misunderstood, that such participation of the fiscal is not decisive and that
malice may still be shown, the holding of a preliminary investigation and the
finding of probable cause by the fiscal notwithstanding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same may be said of cases where preliminary
investigations are conducted by judges. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The determination of the issue of malice must
always be made to rest on all the attendant circumstances, including the
possibility of the fiscal or judge being somehow misled by the accuser's
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No doubt, the very purpose of
preliminary investigations is to avoid baseless and malicious prosecutions, still,
whether or not in a particular case such an objective has been duly pursued is
a matter of proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just as it is bad to
encourage the indiscriminate filing of actions for damages by accused persons
after they have been acquitted, whether correctly or incorrectly, a blanket
clearance of all who may be minded to charge others with offenses, fancied or
otherwise, without any chance of the aggrieved parties in the appropriate cases
of false accusation to obtain relief, is in Our opinion short of being good
law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this connection, it
may be mentioned that in the original draft of the Civil Code prepared by the
Code Commission, the present provisions on human relations, evidencing concern
so that offended parties in criminal cases may have redress in civil actions
independently of the fate of the corresponding criminal case or even without
this, were in a sense counterbalanced by a proposal to make the state itself
liable in damages to anyone who might, on the other </span><span style="">hand, </span><span style="">be erroneously or falsely charged with an offense by the government
prosecutor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As has happened, however,
such an idea did not gain legislative approval.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This accounts for the absence of any specific provision on malicious
prosecution in the chapter on human relations, but it also indicates that in
the mind of the legislators the primary responsibility for a false charge is
with the person who initiates or instigates the criminal prosecution and
Articles 2219, 21 and 2176 may be availed of in particular instances where such
person is actuated instances by malice or other evil motive.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
