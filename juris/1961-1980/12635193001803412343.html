<p class="2Q">'Contrary to and in violation of Article 315 2(a) and (d) of the

<blockquote>"The arraignment having been set on December 6, 1967, the
petitioner, under date of December 4, 1967, filed a motion to quash the
information on the ground that the said information charges more than one
offense, because it clearly and expressly accused petitioner of two distinct
offenses of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> under
paragraph 2(a) of Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code which punishes the act
of defrauding a person by using a fictitious name, or falsely pretending to
possess power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or
imaginary transactions, or by means of other similar deceits’, i.e., <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> through false pretenses; and (b) <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
under paragraph 2 (d) of Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code which penalizes
the act of 'postdating a check in payment of an obligation when the offender
had no funds in the bank, or his funds deposited therein were not sufficient to
cover the amount of the check'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1967" day="15" month="12">December 15,
 1967</st1:date>, the respondent fiscal filed his answer to the motion to
quash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his said answer, Annex C, the
respondent fiscal alleged that the information he filed charges only one
offense because only the offense of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> is charged
and even if the information enumerates one or more means enumerated in
paragraph 2 of Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code, still the crime charged
in the information is only one offense and that is <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>,
or swindling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, said respondent
alleged that although the body of the information contains a recital of the
means resorted to and availed of by the accused in the perpetration or
commission of the offense, the same charges only one offense -- <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="12">December 27,
 1967</st1:date>, the respondent Judge issued an order denying petitioner's
motion to quash (Annex D).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On February 3, 1968, herein petitioner filed a motion for
reconsideration of the order denying his motion to quash (Annex E); and in his
order dated February 17, 1968, the respondent Judge denied the petitioner's
motion for reconsideration (Annex "F”).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"While the motion for reconsideration filed by the petitioner
was pending consideration, the respondent judge set the hearing of the case for
one whole week, on March 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, on <st1:date year="1968" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1968</st1:date>, petitioner prayed the respondent
judge to cancel the hearing and to reset the same to another date after the
motion for reconsideration shall have been resolved (Annex G).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1968" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1968</st1:date>,
the respondent judge issued an order (Annex H) denying ‘the motion to cancel
the trial of this case on <st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="3">March 22 to
 29, 1968</st1:date> xx <span class="SpellE">xx</span> unless the accused could
secure an injunctive order from the proper higher court restraining this court
to continue trying this case, as scheduled'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, this petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>,
prohibition and <i style="">mandamus</i> with
preliminary injunction on the grounds (a) that the respondent judge has acted
without or in excess of jurisdiction or with such grave abuse of discretion as
to amount to lack or excess of jurisdiction, correctible by the present
petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>, prohibition
and <i style="">mandamus</i>; (b) that the petitioner
has no remedy of appeal (the order denying the motion to quash being
interlocutory) or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary
course of law than the present petition." (pp. 60-64, rec.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In its decision of September 28, 1968, the Division of Three of
the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition, holding that after his motion to
quash is denied, the accused <span class="SpellE">Suy</span> <span class="SpellE">Yan's</span>
remedy was not to file <i style="">certiorari</i>,
prohibition and <i style="">mandamus</i> with
preliminary injunction, but to go to trial, without prejudice to reiterating
his special defenses that he had invoked in his motion to quash, and, if after
trial on the merits, an adverse decision is rendered, to appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> in the manner authorized by law, since the trial
court has jurisdiction over the offense charged, citing Arches vs. <span class="SpellE">Beldia</span>, et. al.,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Acharon</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>, et. al.,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Chuatoco</span> vs. Aragon, et. al.,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">On October 17, 1968, counsel for the accused <span class="SpellE">Suy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Yan</span> filed a motion for reconsideration (pp. 76-82,

order of the court granting or denying a motion to quash in a criminal case is
no longer the hard and fast rule, citing Lopez vs. <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>

and that the lower court acted in excess of jurisdiction and with grave abuse
of discretion in denying his motion to quash and thereby denying his
constitutional rights to be informed of the nature of the accusation against
him and to prepare adequately for his defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City filed
his opposition dated <st1:date year="1968" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1968</st1:date>
to the motion for reconsideration (pp. 83-87, rec.), to which <span class="SpellE">Suy</span> <span class="SpellE">Yan</span> filed his reply dated <st1:date year="1969" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1969</st1:date> (pp. 89-98, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 24, 1969, three members of the Special Division of Five
promulgated the aforementioned resolution reconsidering the decision of
September 28, 1968 and ordering the respondent fiscal to elect and amend the
information by charging the accused <span class="SpellE">Suy</span> <span class="SpellE">Yan</span> and his co-accused with only one offense under paragraph
2 (a) or 2 (d) of Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code and eliminating the
other (pp. 99-103, rec.), with Justices <span class="SpellE">Mojica</span> and <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, Jr. dissenting (pp. 104-110, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">The City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City filed a
motion for reconsideration dated April 23, 1969 (pp. 112-116, rec.) of the said
resolution of March 24, 1969 and for the re-instatement of the decision of
September 28, 1968, to which the accused <span class="SpellE">Suy</span> <span class="SpellE">Yan</span> filed his opposition dated May 19, 1969 (pp. 117-118,
rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated <st1:date year="1969" day="2" month="6">June
 2, 1969</st1:date>, the same three members of the Special Division of Five denied
the motion for reconsideration of the City Fiscal, while the two dissenting
Justices voted to grant the same (p. 119, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition for review filed by the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner should have been the People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the real party in interest, and not the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span>
City, who is merely the counsel of the People.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, this formal error does not affect the resolution of the
petition on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">As correctly ruled by Mr. Justice Angel H. <span class="SpellE">Mojica</span>,
speaking for the Division of Three Justices of the Court of Appeals in their
decision dated <st1:date year="1968" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1968</st1:date>,
the petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>, <i style="">mandamus</i> and prohibition with
preliminary injunction filed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Suy</span> <span class="SpellE">Yan</span> before the Court of Appeals is without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Supreme Court with marked consistency has ruled that neither <i style="">certiorari</i> nor prohibition lies against
an order of the court denying the motion to quash the complaint or information
in a criminal case, because such an order is interlocutory and therefore not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> as it is not a decision on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused after such denial of his motion
to quash must proceed to trial without prejudice on his part to reiterate his
special defenses he invoked in his motion and if, after trial on the merits, an
adverse decision is rendered, his remedy is to appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The allegations in the information are clear and do not charge
the accused with two offenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
contended by the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City, the
information accuses the defendant of only one <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
committed by false pretenses under paragraph 2 of Article 315 of the Revised
Penal Code, but specifically describes the false pretenses or deceitful acts
employed by the accused in perpetrating the offense, namely, his falsely
pretending to possess property, credit or business under sub-paragraph (a) of
the aforesaid paragraph 2 of Article 315 and by postdating a check or issuing
such check in payment of an obligation knowing that he had no sufficient funds
in the bank to cover the amount of the check, without informing the payee of
such circumstances, under sub-paragraph (d) of the same paragraph 2 of Article
315.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is emphasized herein that
sub-paragraphs (a) and (d) of Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code are two of
the five false pretenses or fraudulent acts that can be employed and were
actually employed in this case by the accused to commit the one crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> charged against him in the information.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Camerino</span>, et.
al., this High Tribunal quoted with approval the commentary of Professor <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> Padilla to the effect that the "charge is not
defective for duplicity when one single crime is set forth in the different
modes prescribed by law for its commission, or the felony is set forth under
different counts specifying the way of its perpetration, or the acts resulted
from a single criminal impulse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither
is there duplicity when the other offense described is but an essential element
of the real offense charged nor when several acts are related describing the
offense".<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As heretofore stated, the allegations in the information falling
under sub-paragraphs (a) and (d) of paragraph 2 of Article 315 of the Revised
Penal Code, merely specify two of the various modes of committing the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> thru deceit, the only offense with which the accused
<span class="SpellE">Suy</span> <span class="SpellE">Yan</span> is charged under
the questioned information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then again,
the said two modes or ways of perpetrating the offense of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
refer to only one transaction with one and the same offended party, viz., the
purchase of 25,000 bags of cement under his fraudulent representation or false
pretense that he has property or business or credit, which deceit was made more
persuasive by another deceit -- his issuing three checks of P30,000, P20,000
and P57,668.90 respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two
fraudulent acts or false pretenses were part of only one single criminal
impulse.</p>

<p class="BODY">We reiterate the earlier jurisprudence that where an offense may
be committed in any of the different modes and the offense is alleged to have
been committed in two or more modes specified, the indictment is sufficient,
notwithstanding the fact that the different means of committing the same
offense are prohibited by separate sections of the statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The allegation in the information of the various
ways of committing the offense should be regarded as a description of only one
offense<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
and the information is not thereby rendered defective on the ground of <span class="SpellE">multifariousness</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been held that the allegation of the falsification of two
documents at the same time and between the same parties resulting in the
offense of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> is but a recital of the facts that
concur in the commission of the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The case of Lopez vs. <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
where We held that the general rule that the Court will not issue a writ of <i style="">certiorari</i> to restrain an order of the
lower court denying a motion to quash and upon such denial defendant should
enter his plea of not guilty and, if convicted, raise an appeal on the same
legal questions covered by his motion to quash, is no longer the hard and fast
rule; because <i style="">certiorari</i> and
prohibition were issued to restrain the court from further proceedings in a
criminal case where it appears that the offense charged in the information is
not within its jurisdiction, does not apply to the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the Lopez case, the crime of falsification
of a private document charged in the information was not within the
jurisdiction of the city court of Angeles City as the two private documents
allegedly falsified by the accused therein were signed by the accused in <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> and in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, both
within the province of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and therefore outside
the territorial jurisdiction of the city court of Angeles City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, there is no dispute as
to the fact that on the face of the information the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> with which the accused <span class="SpellE">Suy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Yan</span> is charged, was committed within the territorial
jurisdiction of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Iligan</span></st1:placename>

opinion of Justices Angel <span class="SpellE">Mojica</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hermogenes</span> <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, Jr. in

<span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> had <span class="SpellE">copras</span> ready
for delivery, would seem to imply that the estafa charge is that defined and
penalized under paragraph 2 (a) -- by falsely pretending to possess xx xx property
xx <span class="SpellE">xx</span> business, etc.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The succeeding portion, however, of the same information which alleges
failure to deliver the copra or return the money on the dates agreed, charges
the accused of misappropriation and conversion under paragraph 1 (b) of the
same Article 315.' In view of such ambiguity in the information, a motion to
quash was filed by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
hearing of the motion, 'the fiscal and the private prosecutor both manifested
that there was a clerical error in the first paragraph of the information and
stated and assured that the accused was being charged under paragraph 1 (b) of
Article 315.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court admitted
the correction and the accused went to trial with that understanding and
assurance.' After trial, the court <u>a quo</u> found the accused guilty as
charged under Article 315, paragraph 1 (b) and sentenced him accordingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on appeal to the Court of Appeals
where the accused 'questioned the correctness of the judgment of conviction
under the information as corrected and on the facts proven', the Court of
Appeals held the appellant <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> guilty of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> <u>not under Article 315, paragraph 1 (b) but under
paragraph 3(2-a) of Article 315</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
issue in the <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> case was 'whether after denial
of a motion to quash, precisely on the vagueness of the information, upon
assurance by the fiscal and the private prosecutor and accepted by the court
that the offense for which the accused was being prosecuted is that of
misappropriation defined in paragraph 1 (b) of Article 315, involving
unfaithfulness or abuse of confidence and under which the accused entered
trial, the latter could, on appeal, be convicted of an entirely different
offense with different elements, that of false pretenses of possessing property
or business made prior to or simultaneous with the commission of the fraud.'
The Supreme Court held that <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> could not be
held guilty of an entirely different offense with different elements when such
offense is not adequately alleged in the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to state that the <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> case is not in point and on all fours with the
case under consideration." (pp. 107-109, rec.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The allegations in the information are not ambiguous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Couched in a language devoid of any technical
or cryptic jargon, the information particularizes and specifies the false
pretenses employed by the accused in committing the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not
deceive the accused as to the nature of the accusation against him, much less
as to the fact that the same charges him with only one offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the accused can adequately
prepare for his defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The right of the accused to be informed of the nature and cause
of the accusation against him is satisfied as long as the language employed in
the information is sufficiently clear to a person of ordinary intelligence<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
and as long as all the material facts that constitute the offense are alleged
in the information.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
In the instant case, all the essential elements of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
thru deceit are categorically alleged in the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, to repeat, the City Fiscal stressed the
assurance that only one crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> is charged
therein, although perpetrated by two deceitful acts on the part of the accused,
falling under paragraph 2 (a and d) of Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code,
as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because We find that the allegations in the information are clear
and adequately inform the accused of the accusation against him so that he can
properly prepare for his defense, accused <span class="SpellE">Suy</span> <span class="SpellE">Yan</span> is not denied any constitutional right and the remedy
of <i style="">certiorari</i> and prohibition will
not lie, thus precluding the applicability of the ruling in the cases of Yap
vs. the Honorable H. <span class="SpellE">Lutero</span>, etc.,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">It is interesting to note that the other accused <span class="SpellE">Chao</span> <span class="SpellE">Ce</span> alias Co <span class="SpellE">Chiongtai</span> did not join the accused <span class="SpellE">Suy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Yan</span> alias James Yap in his motion to quash nor in his
petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>, prohibition
and <i style="">mandamus</i> with preliminary
injunction before the Court of Appeals, giving the impression that to the
accused <span class="SpellE">Chao</span> <span class="SpellE">Ce</span> alias Co <span class="SpellE">Chiongtai</span> the questioned information charges him with only
one crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> and that the allegations therein
are so sufficiently clear as to inform him of the nature and cause of the
accusation against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have no alternative but to reverse and set aside, as We hereby
reverse and set aside the majority resolution of the Special Division of Five
of the Court of Appeals dated March 24, 1969 and hereby direct that Criminal
