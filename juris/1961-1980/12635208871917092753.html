<p class="BODY">Plaintiff Simeon <span class="SpellE">Patalinghud</span> was one of
the heirs of Jose <span class="SpellE">Patalinghud</span>, the original
homesteader of a parcel of land situated in <span class="SpellE">Dumoy</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
covered by Homestead Patent No. 3887 issued on <st1:date year="1922" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1922</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1959</st1:date>,
plaintiff executed in favor of defendant <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Ballesteros</span> a public instrument entitled "Deed of
Conditional Sale," which provides, among other things, the following:</p>

<blockquote>"The vendor had already agreed to an extra-judicial partition
of the above-described parcel of land with his co-owners thru a public
instrument... whereby the vendor had a definite por­tion segregated in his
favor with an approximate area of one and-a-half (1-1/2) hectares;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Out of the above segregated portion of one and one-half
(1-1/2) hectares, the vendor sells, transfers, cedes and conveys by way of
conditional sale a portion of one half (1/2) hectare to be segregated later on,
located at the nor­thern end of the lot, or the point far­thest from the
national road and by these presents have sold, transferred, ceded and conveyed
unto the vendee, his heirs, assigns and successors-in-interest, the above
portion of a portion subject to the following terms and conditions:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1. That the
consideration for this sale is six hundred pesos (P600.00) for the entire
one-half (1/2) hectare, out of which amount the vendor acknowledges to have
received the sum of three hundred pesos (P300.00) and acknowledges to be
indebted to an uncle of the vendee by the name of Gerardo de Guzman in the
amount of ninety two pesos (P92.00), which amount shall be paid by the vendee
direct to Gerardo de Guzman to be deducted from the balance of three hundred
pesos (P300.00), leaving a net balance of two hundred eight pesos (P208.00);</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. That the balance
of two hundred eight pesos (P208.00) shall be paid in two equal monthly
installments of P104.00 each, on the months of May and June, 1959;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3. That the vendee
assume to pay for the expenses of segregating the above-des­cribed portion of a
portion of one half <span style="">hec­tare, </span>and
which segregation shall be per­formed after the harvest of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>
and corn in order to save from destruction a portion <span style="">of the crop;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>"4.
That all improvements are included in this sale, including the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> and corn now planted in the same; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On November 7, 1960, after the defendant had made full payment of
the price stated in the above-mentioned deed of "conditional sale",
and the lot thus sold had <span style="">been properly
surveyed and identified as lot 344-B-2 B-5 (LRC) Psd-13376, plaintiff executed
another public instrument entitled "Absolute Sale of Land" whereby,
in consideration of P600.00, the receipt of which he acknowledged, he
transferred and conveyed by way or absolute sale to the defendant said Lot
344-B-2-B-5 containing an area of 5,000 square meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This latter </span><span style="">deed was duly registered </span><span style="">with the office of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City, and Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-9409
covering said lot was issued to defendant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On June 23, 1964, plaintiff tendered to defendant the sum of P700
for the repurchase of the lot in question, claiming that the lot being a part <span style="">of </span>a homestead the homesteader or his
heir who sold the land or a por­tion thereof may repurchase the land sold
within five <span style="">years from </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">date of the conveyance, as provided by</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant refused plaintiff's offer to </span><span style="">repur</span><span style="">chase.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">So, on <st1:date year="1964" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1964</st1:date>,
plaintiff filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, praying, that defendant be ordered to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> the lot to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In her answer defendant alleged, among other things, that the five-year
period for the repurchase had already ex­pired when the plaintiff offered to
repurchase on June <span style="">23, 1964, the fact
being that the actual conveyance of the lot was made upon the execution of the
"Deeds of Con­ditional Sale" on April 27, 1959 so that the five-year
period had expired on April 27, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The defendant further alleged that the ownership of the lot </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">duly transferred to her upon the execution of the deed on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="27" month="4"><span style="">April
 27, 1959</span></st1:date><span style=""> and the
conditions contained in the deed refer only to the terms of payment of the
price and do not affect the validity and consummation of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff filed a
reply to defendant's answer and an answer to defendant's counterclaim. The
defendant in turn filed a rejoinder to plaintiff's reply.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">During the trial the parties entered into a par­tial stipulation
of facts, agreeing that the lot in question, which is covered by TCT No. T-9409
in <span style="">the </span>name of the defendant,
once formed part of the share of the plaintiff in the homestead of Jose <span class="SpellE">Patalinghud</span>, plaintiff's father, covered by homestead
patent No. <span style="">3887
which was granted on </span><st1:date year="1922" day="7" month="6"><span style="">June 7, 1922</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After
trial, the Court of First Instance </span>of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
rendered a decision, dismissing plaintiff's complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his decision the trial judge ruled that
the deed of "conditional sale", executed on April 27, 1959, rep­resented
a perfected contract of sale between the parties, and that the conditions
embodied therein simply referred to the manner of payment of the price and the
payment of expenses of survey, so that the period of five years within which to
repurchase should be counted from April 27, 1959, and not from November 7, 1960
when <span style="">the </span>other document -- the
deed of absolute sale -- <span style="">was executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial judge held
that the "deed of absolute sale" was executed on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="7" month="11"><span style="">November </span>7, 1960</st1:date> only to meet the
formal requirements of registration and for the issuance of the corresponding
certificate of title.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration of the
above-mentioned decision, but the trial court denied the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence this appeal by the
plaintiff.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff-appellant makes only one assignment of error, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The trial court erred in fixing the period of repurchase to
be <st1:date year="1959" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1959</st1:date>, and in
holding that the plaintiff's right to repurchase has prescribed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The provision of law invoked by the appellant in claiming the
right to repurchase the lot in question from the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
is Section 119 of Commonwealth Act 141 (The Public Land Law), as amended, which
provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 119 - Every conveyance of land acquired under the free
patent or home­stead provisions, when proper, shall be subject to repurchase by
the applicant, <span style="">his widow, or legal
heirs, within a period of five years from the date of conveyance."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">is </span>the contention of the appellant <span style="">that </span>the lower court erred in reckoning the five-year period, <span style="">within which he may repurchase, from </span><st1:date year="1959" day="27" month="4"><span style="">April
 27, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, the date
when the "deed of conditional sale" (Exhibit 1) was executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the "deed of
conditional sale" did not convey to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
title over the one-half hectare of land mentioned in said instrument, because
the deed did not contain a description of the land that was sold, and that </span>at
<span style="">most the instrument was only an
agreement to buy and sell. The appellant asserts that the five-year period
should be counted from </span><st1:date year="1960" day="7" month="11"><span style="">November 7, 1960</span></st1:date><span style=""> when the "deed </span>of <span style="">ab­solute sale" (Exhibit A) was executed
and registered in the office of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
City.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The stand of the appellant can not be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ruling of this Court in the case of <span class="SpellE">Monge</span>,
et al., vs. Angeles, et al.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
is very pertinent in the resolu­tion of the question before <span class="GramE">Us</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"The question to be determined is whether the period of five
years which Section 119 of Commonwealth Act No. 141 allows a homesteader to
repurchase a home­stead sold by him should be counted from the date of the sale
even if the same is with an option to repurchase or from the date the ownership
of the land has become consolidated in favor of the purchaser because of the
homesteader's failure to repurchase it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Section 119 of Commonwealth Act No. 141 provides: 'Every
conveyance of land acquired under the free patent or homestead provisions, when
proper, shall be subject to repurchase by the applicant, his widow, or legal
heirs, within the period of five years from the <u>date</u> of the
conveyance.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The </span>language of the law is clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It provides that the period of five years
shall be counted from the <u><span style="">date of
conveyance,</span></u><span style=""> </span>regard­less
of its nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The word conveyance is of
American origin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may refer not only
to an absolute sale but also to mortgage <span style="">or
</span>any other transaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has
been de­fined as signifying 'every instrument by which any estate or interest
in real estate is created, alienated, mortgaged, or assigned, (13 C. J., 900;
18 C. J. S., 92).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the law is clear,
it admits of no interpretation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
follows therefore that the pretense of appellants to the ef­fect that the
5-year period should be counted from the date the ownership of <span class="SpellE">ap­pellees</span> over the land had become consolidated is
untenable.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The above interpretation finds sup­port in recent decisions
of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In
Blanco vs. <span class="SpellE">Bailon</span>, G. R. No.</span> L-7342, <st1:date year="1956" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1956</st1:date>, the question raised
was whether the 5-year period of redemption began from the date of the
execution of the contract or from the date of its registration in the office of
the register of deeds, considering that the homestead was registered under the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This court held that it is the former
because in so far as the owner of the homestead is <span class="GramE">concerned,</span>
the conveyance mentioned in Section 119 of the Public Land Law is the <u><span style="">actual date thereof,</span></u><span style=""> </span>and not the date of registration of
the deed of sale. <span class="GramE">(Citing <span class="SpellE">Galasinao</span>

<p class="BODY">The deed of conditional sale (Exhibit 1) that was executed on <st1:date year="1959" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1959</st1:date> is a conveyance
covered by the foregoing ruling of this Court, and the five-year period within
which to repurchase must be reckoned from <st1:date year="1959" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1959</st1:date> when the instrument of conveyance <span style="">was </span>executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deed in question shows that there was an
executed contract of sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It provides
that <span style="">a </span>spe­cific portion of land
was sold, transferred, ceded and conveyed by the appellant to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the
deed recites:</p>

<blockquote>"Out of the above segregated por­tion of one and one half
(1-1/2) hec­tares the vendor sells a portion of one half (1/2) hectare to be
segregated later on, located at the northern end of the lot, or the point
furthest from the national road...."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The "deed of conditional sale" was embodied in a public
instrument, and so it can be considered that there was a constructive delivery
to the vendee of the land upon the execution of the instrument, there being no
stipulation in it from which it may be in­ferred that delivery was not intended<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>.
In fact the deed provides that "all improvements are included in the sale,
including the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> and corn now planted in the
same." The deed also provides that the segregation of the one-half hectare
that <span style="">was </span>sold
"shall be per­formed after the harvest of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>
and corn in order to save from destruction a portion of the crop." There
is no mention at all in the instrument that at the time it <span style="">was </span>executed
that portion of land which was sold was in the possession of a third person,
and so there was no impediment to actual physical delivery of the land thus
sold<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>.
That contract was binding between the parties thereto, even if the subject
matter was <span style="">a </span>por­tion of a
registered land, and even if the deed was not registered as provided in Act
496.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That deed of con­ditional sale has
all the essential elements of <span style="">a </span>con­tract
of sale; there was consent between the parties, there was price certain in
money, and there was deter­minate thing sold.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The contention of appellant that that deed of conditional <span style="">sale </span>should
be considered simply as a mere agreement to buy and sell, because the land that
was the object of the sale was not definitely described and <span style="">its </span>boundaries are not stated, is
untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legal requisite that the
object of the sale must be determinate is satisfied if at the time the contract
is entered into the thing sold is capable of being made determinate without the
necessity of a new or further agreement between the parties.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The deed of <span style="">sale </span>con­tains a
sufficient basis, at the time it was entered into, for determining the one-half
hectare that <span style="">was </span>sold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deed provides that the vendor had a
definite por­tion consisting of one-and-one half hectare out of the homestead
of his late father which <span style="">was </span>segregated from the portions that corresponded to his
co-heirs; and out of the said segregated portion of one-and-one-half hectare
the vendor sold a portion of one-half hectare to be segregated later on,
located at the northern end of the lot, or at the point furthest from the
national road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, the property sold was
determinable because it was part of what was already a segregated portion of a
definite parcel of land, at its northern side and farthest from the national
road.</p>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, agree with the view of the lower court that the
deed of conditional sale (Exhibit 1) shows that it is only the manner of
payment of the price and the payment of expenses of survey that were subject to
a condition, but the passing of title or ownership could be gleaned from the
contract, and that the intention of the parties was manifest at the time of the
execution of the said deed of conditional sale, and so on April 27, 1959 when
that deed of conditional sale was executed there was already a perfected
contract of sale between the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The conditions embodied in the deed re­ferred simply to the manner of
paying the balance of the price.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
agreed that the balance of P300.00 should be paid in this manner: P92.00 to be
delivered to Mr. Gerardo de Guzman, the creditor of the vendor, and the
remaining P208.00 to be paid into two equal monthly installment of P104.00 each
in the months of May and June, 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
conditions regarding the payment of the balance of the price and expenses for
the survey in the segregation of the lot sold were all accomplished, because in
the deed of absolute sale executed on Novem­ber 7, 1960 the vendor acknowledged
that the sum of P600.00 was "paid in full to me"; and the land sold
was already identified as lot 344-B-2-B-5 (LRC) Psd-13372 and technically
described therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if We consider
those conditions regarding the payment of the balance of the price as well as
the payment for expenses in the survey as <span class="SpellE">suspensive</span>
conditions, the fulfillment of the conditions retroacted to April 27, 1959 when
the deed of conditional sale was executed<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>.
We also agree with the conclusion of the trial court that the deed of ab­solute
<span style="">sale </span>(Exhibit B) was executed
on <st1:date year="1960" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1960</st1:date> only to
meet the formal requirements of registration and for the issuance of the
corresponding certificate of title in favor of the vendee, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the deed of conditional sale, executed on <st1:date year="1959" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1959</st1:date>, was not registered
did not have a prejudicial effect upon the rights of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
here­in because that transaction was perfectly binding bet­ween the appellant
and the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> who were the parties therein, and no
right of third person had been affected.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <span class="SpellE">Monge</span>, et al., vs.
Angeles, et al., <u><span style="">supra,</span></u><span style=""> </span>this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"In <span class="SpellE">Galanza</span> <u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE">Nuesa</span>, 95 Phil., 713, 50 <span class="GramE">Off</span>. <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>., 4213, the question that arose was 'whether the period
to repurchase the land in question shall be counted from the execution of the
deed of sale with right to <span style="">repurchase or from the issuance of transfer certificate of title </span>to
the herein defen­dant' and the Court held that appellant's title had already
become absolute because of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> failure to
redeem the land within five years from the date of sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court added: 'Both under Section 50 <span style="">of </span>the Land Registration Law and under
Section 119 of Commonwealth Act 141, the owner of a piece of land is neither
prohibited nor precluded from binding himself to an agreement whereby <span style="">his right of
repurchase is for a certain period starting from the date of the deed of </span>sale.'
In other words, the <u>date</u> of the sale is of paramount consideration.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, hold that the lower court did not err in declaring
that the five-year period within which the appellant could have repurchased the
land in question from the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> begun on April 27,
1959 and ended on April 27, 1964, and that when appellant of­fered to
repurchase the land on June 23, 1964 <span style="">his
</span>right, to repurchase had already prescribed.</p>
