				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class=BODY>Sometime in July 1963 SS &quot;Toreador&quot; delivered into the custody
of the Bureau of Customs one (1) case of compressor parts and two (2) boxes of
diesel engine parts shipped from New York and consigned to <span class=SpellE>Bislig</span>
Bay Lumber Co.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Bureau of Customs
delivered in bad order one (1) box with various items of diesel engine parts
missing, worth P1<span class=GramE>,076.43</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For <span class=GramE>the</span> loss,
American Insurance Co. paid the consignee.</p>

<p class=BODY>On July 20, 1964, a complaint was filed before the City Court of
Manila for the recovery of P1<span class=GramE>,076.43</span> by the American
Insurance Co. as <span class=SpellE>subrogee</span> to consignee, against the
Bureau of Customs and the Republic of the Philippines.</p>

<p class=BODY>The City Court of Manila ordered defendant to pay P1<span
class=GramE>,076.43</span> with legal interest from date of filing of the
case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Appeal was taken to the Court of
First Instance by defendants.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After the
defendants had answered, denying liability by interposing non-suability and
after the parties had partially stipulated on the exhibits covering the lost
parts worth P1<span class=GramE>,076.43</span>, the Court of First Instance, on
January 13, 1966, dismissed the case on the ground that the Republic may not be
sued without its consent and that the Bureau of Customs, as a mere agency of the
government, has no capacity to sue and to be sued.</p>

<p class=BODY>Appeal to this Court was taken by plaintiff.</p>

<p class=BODY>At issue is the purely legal question:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>May the Republic and the Bureau of Customs be
sued herein?</p>

<p class=BODY>As already decided in Mobil Philippines Explorations, Inc. v.
Customs <span class=SpellE>Arrastre</span> Service and Bureau of Customs,
L-23139, December 17, 1966, the <span class=SpellE>arrastre</span> operation by
the Customs <span class=SpellE>Arrastre</span> Service is a necessary incident
of the prime governmental function of taxation and therefore for said operation
no suit can be filed against the Republic or its agencies involved without its
consent.</p>

<p class=BODY><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is affirmed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No costs.</p>

<p class=SOORDERED><span class=GramE>SO ORDERED.</span></p>
