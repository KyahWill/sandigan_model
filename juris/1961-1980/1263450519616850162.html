				<BR><STRONG>BARREDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur, in its Criminal Case No. 2971, finding the accused-appellant Lupo&nbsp; Riduca guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder charged in the information and sentencing him to suffer <i>Reclusion Perpetua,</i> together with all the accessory penalties provided by law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Carlos Rillamas in the amount of P6,000 and to pay one-half of the costs, his co-accused Petronio Rigunay having been acquitted.<br><br>At the trial, appellant admitted having fired the two shots that caused the death of the offended party but tried to prove that he did so in self-defense.<br><br>As related by the trial court in its decision, the theory of the prosecution as to how the incident in question happened is as follows:<br><blockquote>"The prosecution witnesses, namely, Gaspar Advincula, Silvestre Advincula, and Teodulo Riveral, were presented as eye­witnesses to the commission of the offense.<br><br>"In substance they all declared that on the afternoon of March 25, 1957, together with the victim, Carlos Rillamas, Felipe Baltazar and Florencio Rubianes, they passed barrio Bantaoay, San Vicente, while riding in a calesa.&nbsp; Gaspar Advincula seated in front, was the driver, and seated near him on the front at his left was Teodulo Riveral.&nbsp; On the back seat was seated Felipe Baltazar on the eastern part of the calesa, next to him seated also was the victim, Carlos Rillamas; next to the victim was Silvestre Advincula and after him was Florencio Rubianes.&nbsp; Four were on the back seat with all reclining on the back of the seat; except the victim who was stooping a little down, with his body a little away from the back of the seat.&nbsp; In other words, the victim was the only one not reclining on the back of the seat.&nbsp; This was so because not all could take the same reclining position, considering the area of the back seat.&nbsp; While on the road at that barrio, the accused Lupo Riduca stopped the calesa and asked if he could ride in the calesa up to his house.&nbsp; Riduca came from the house of policeman Alejandro Riglos when he stopped the calesa.&nbsp; Upon reaching the calesa, Riduca pointed the gun, Exhibit "C", a Springfield rifle, about a meter long, to the victim, Carlos Rillamas, and fired it after hearing the word "tiraemon" coming from the accused Petronio Rigunay who was about thirty meters away in the tobacco field.&nbsp; This caused the victim to slump inside the calesa, and while in that position, he was again shot by Riduca.&nbsp; All the survivors jumped from the calesa after the last shot was fired by the said accused.&nbsp; Some of them went to the municipal building, while the other passengers went to their respective houses.<br><br>"After the lapse of a few hours, Dr. Catalino Lazo with the Chief of Police arrived at the scene and found the dead body of the victim slumped inside the calesa.&nbsp; Later in the evening after the body was brought to the municipal building, Dr. Catalino Lazo performed the autopsy.<br><br>"The accused did not deny that he shot and killed the victim, Carlos Rillamas.&nbsp; And neither did he deny that he was in police uniform, armed with a rifle, Exhibit "C", when he killed the victim.&nbsp; His justification was self-defense." (Pp. 3-4, Decision).</blockquote>In this appeal, counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span> assigns three errors allegedly committed by the trial court thus:<br><blockquote><center>"ASSIGNMENT OF ERRORS<br></center><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" width="95%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">I. </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">THAT THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN CONSIDERING THAT THE APPELLANT DID NOT ACT IN SELF-DEFENSE;<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">II. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">THAT THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT IT WAS INCREDIBLE FOR THE DECEASED CARLOS RILLAMAS TO MAKE A GRAB FOR THE RIFLE IN THE HANDS OF THE APPELLANT; AND<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">III. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">THAT THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE APPELLANT GUILTY OF MURDER AND NOT ACQUITTING HIM; OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE, OF NOT CONVICTING HIM ONLY TO A PENALTY ONE DEGREE LOWER THAN THE PENALTY FOR HOMICIDE OR <span style="font-style: italic;">PRISION MAYOR, </span>IN THE DEGREE THAT THIS COURT MAY DEEM PROPER."</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>(p. 165, Record)</blockquote>We have carefully reviewed the whole evidence on record, and We are sufficiently convinced that counsel's contentions do not have support in any credible and reliable portion thereof.&nbsp; We find prosecution's theory, insofar as appellant is concerned,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> to be fully supported by the testimonies of the witnesses of the People.&nbsp; On the other hand, it is not difficult to see that appellant has failed to prove his claim of self-defense, which he is supposed to show by clear and convincing evidence, considering he does not deny having caused the death of his victim.&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">Peo. vs. Berio</span>, 59 Phil. 533; <span style="font-style: italic;">Peo. vs. Gimena,</span> 59 Phil. 509; <span style="font-style: italic;">Peo. vs. Cruz,</span> 53 Phil. 635).<br><br>Testifying for the defense, Witness Alejandro Riglos, who at the time of the incident was a policeman, like appellant was, in the town of San Vicente, Ilocos Sur, where it happened, declared:<br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" width="85%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">"Q </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">When you heard that horse drawn bicycle that was approaching, what did Lupo Riduca and you do?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">As the calesa was approaching our yard we went out from the gate and as we step out from our gate the calesa reached opposite our house and Lupo Riduca said to the rig driver, 'Tata, may I ride in your calesa?'

The statement, "So leche, after all you want something from us," is far from being perilously offensive.&nbsp; And if, indeed, Rillamas did take hold of the barrel of appellant's rifle or even tried to grab it, We do not believe it was justified for appellant "to remove the safety lock and fire" his weapon.<br><br>In their relative positions, appellant had more freedom of action than the deceased who was sandwiched among the three other passengers, Felipe Baltazar, Silvestre Advincula and Florencio Rubianes, within the small area of the calesa in which they were apart from the fact that directly between them, sitting beside the driver, Gaspar Advincula, was the fifth passenger, Teodulo Riveral, whose position would have made it difficult for the deceased to try to snatch appellant's rifle.&nbsp; In other words, between the two of them, appellant had the better chance to win in the struggle for the rifle.&nbsp; In fact, Rillamas might have taken hold of its barrel precisely to ward off danger to himself or he could have meant to help appellant go up the calesa by pulling his rifle upward.<br><br>Under these circumstances, it is not legally possible to hold that there was aggression on the part of the deceased, not even any provocation.&nbsp; For self-defense to be appreciated, it must appear very clearly that the accused is so situated that there is reasonable probability of real danger to his life or limb because of the aggressive acts or menacing attitude of the offended party.&nbsp; Here there is insufficient showing of this element.&nbsp; The most liberal view We can take of appellant's case is that he pulled the trigger a little too early or before it was warranted for his protection.<br><br>The trial court dubbed as incredible the version of the defense.&nbsp; We need not go that far, for even conceding already that the incident did happen in the way appellant and his witness had related, We cannot perceive the peril which allegedly impelled appellant to fire his weapon with the intent of hitting the deceased.<br><br>In the premises, We need not perhaps consider anymore the testimony of the widow of Rillamas, Juanita Reclusado, who declared that twice before that fatal day, appellant had told her to warn her husband not to testify in the injunction case against the Vice-Mayor, the other accused here, Petronio Rigunay, who was acquitted, and other officials of the town, which warning the deceased seemingly did not heed, for he and his companions in the calesa had just attended the hearing of said injunction case and were on their way home when the incident in question took place.&nbsp; Nor do We need perchance to take into account the political animosities between those who were riding in the calesa and the faction of the Vice-Mayor, with whom appellant seemed to be identified, and thereby probably see the actual motive of appellant.<br><br>In brief, We are fully satisfied that the guilt of appellant has been shown beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; The trial judge before whom appellant demonstrated how he was holding his rifle as he was allegedly going up the calesa did not believe his theory of self-defense.&nbsp; Understandably, His Honor is in a better position than this Court to appreciate this important point.&nbsp; Withal, the defense has not successfully shown any reason for Us to hold differently from His Honor.&nbsp; And in Our own review of the evidence We have not also found any cause to do so.<br><br>The killing is clearly qualified by alevosia, the attack upon Rillamas having been done suddenly and unexpectedly with a deadly weapon, making it impossible for said victim to flee or to make defense (<span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Pengzon,</span> 44 Phil. 224).&nbsp; Therefore, the offense committed is murder.&nbsp; Since the appellant voluntarily surrendered, the aggravating circumstance of his having taken advantage of his position as a policeman is off-set thereby.<br><br>We find, however, that the indemnity of P6,000 adjudged by the trial court is not in accordance with existing jurisprudence which ordinarily fixes the same to be P12,000 (<span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Pantoja,</span> 25 SCRA 468).<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the modification that the indemnity to the heirs of the deceased is increased to P12,000.&nbsp; Costs against appellant.<br><br><i>Zaldivar, (Chairman), Fernando, Fernandez,</i> and <i>Aquino, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Antonio, J., </i>took no part.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> His co-accused was acquitted.<br></div>
