				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal, taken by defendants Rudy <span class="SpellE">Lacaden</span>,
Vicente Gagarin and <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Capinding</span>,
from a decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, convicting them of two (2) crimes of murder
and sentencing them, for each, to life imprisonment, with the corresponding
accessory penalties, to indemnify the heirs of each of the victims in the sum
of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and to pay three-fifths (3/5) of the
costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that, in the evening of November 11, 1967, <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Madriago</span> and <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Gardose</span> died in the
Barrio of <span class="SpellE">Guiset</span>, Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Guimba</span>,
Province of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, in
consequence of multiple wounds inflicted upon them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In February, 1968, Cri­minal Cases Nos. 403-G
and 404-G of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> were filed against Roman <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span>,
Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Delo</span> and the aforementioned appellants, as
the alleged assassins of <span class="SpellE">Madriago</span>, in case No. 403-G,
and <span class="SpellE">Gardose</span>, in case No. 404-G.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two cases were tried jointly, insofar
only as appellants herein are concerned, defendants <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Delo</span> not having been appre­hended as yet.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution consisted mainly of the
testimony of five (5) witnesses and Exhibits I and I-1, an extra­judicial
statement of appellant Vicente Gagarin.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Juanita <span class="SpellE">Daprisa</span>, widow of <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Madriago</span>, and Rosita Antonio, widow of <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Gardose</span>, limited
themselves to confirming the death of their respective husbands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Felipe <span class="SpellE">Batangan</span>
gave evidence concern­ing the post-mortem examination he made of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Madriago</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gardose</span>, whereas the
municipal judge of <span class="SpellE">Guimba</span>, Hon. Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Guiang</span>, testified with respect to the extrajudicial
statement (Exhi­bits I and I-1) sworn to before him by appellant Vicente
Gagarin.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimonial evidence for the prosecution relative to the
commission of the crimes charged was given by <span class="SpellE">Tirso</span> <span class="SpellE">Rapisora</span> who declared that, in the evening of November 11,
1967, while drinking wine in his store, in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Guiset</span>,
municipality of <span class="SpellE">Guimba</span>, defendant Roman <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span> told his co-defendant Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Delo</span>
that <span class="SpellE">Condring</span> - referring presumably to <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Gardose</span> - and <span class="SpellE">Rufo</span> - referring supposedly to <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Madriago</span> -had stoned him (<span class="SpellE">Gallema</span>);
that, thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Delo</span> proposed to <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span>
that they waylay <span class="SpellE">Condring</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rufo</span>
and kill them; that, as they started to leave the store - after talking and
drinking further - when they were already intoxicated, <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Delo</span> remarked that they were going to call Rudy, <span class="SpellE">Maxy</span> and Vicente -referring seemingly to appellants Rudy <span class="SpellE">Lacaden</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Capin</span>-ding and Vicente Gagarin, respectively - to accompany
them; and that <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span> and <span class="SpellE">Delo</span>
were then armed with scythes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Exhibits I and I-1 are an affidavit of appellant Gagarin before
Judge <span class="SpellE">Guiang</span> of <span class="SpellE">Guimba</span>,
stating that, in the evening of November 11, 1967, defendants <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span> and <span class="SpellE">Delo</span>, as well as
appellants <span class="SpellE">Lacaden</span> and <span class="SpellE">Capinding</span>,
went to his (Gagarin's) house and invited him to a dance at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Tandoc</span>; that he accepted the invitation; that, outside
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Guiset</span>, they saw two (2): persons, one astride
a <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> pulling a sledge, on which <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Madriago</span> was; that,
thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span> overtook them, and, saying
"why did you box me sometime ago," stabbed <span class="SpellE">Madriago</span>;
that, as his companion (who later turned out to be <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gardose</span>) got off the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>,
seemingly to help him (<span class="SpellE">Madriago</span>), defendant <span class="SpellE">Delo</span> met and repeatedly stabbed him (<span class="SpellE">Gardose</span>);
that Gagarin then ran away and went home that, the next morning, <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span> and <span class="SpellE">Delo</span> went to his
house and bade him to keep his mouth shut, for, otherwise, he would have the
same fate as those killed the night before; and that, because of fear, he did
not report the occurrence to the authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the defense consisted of the testimony of
appellants <span class="SpellE">Lacaden</span>, Gagarin and <span class="SpellE">Capinding</span>,
which, apart from reiterating substantially the version given by Gagarin in
said Exhibits I and I-1, disclosed the following details, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that <span class="SpellE">Capinding</span> was
invited by <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span> to attend a party; that, there­after,
<span class="SpellE">Gallema</span>, <span class="SpellE">Delo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Capinding</span> invited <span class="SpellE">Lacaden</span> to go
to a dance; that, subsequently, <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span>, <span class="SpellE">Delo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Capinding</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lacaden</span> extended a similar invitation to Gagarin; that
appellants <span class="SpellE">Lacaden</span>, Gagarin and <span class="SpellE">Capinding</span>
were together with <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span> and <span class="SpellE">Delo</span>
when these two (2) defendants attacked <span class="SpellE">Madriago</span> and
his companion; that <span class="SpellE">Delo</span> used a little bolo in
stabbing <span class="SpellE">Madriago's</span> companion, although <span class="SpellE">Lacaden</span> claimed not to have seen the weapon used by <span class="SpellE">Delo</span>; that appellants did nothing to stop the aggression upon
<span class="SpellE">Madriago</span> and his companion, and, instead, ran away;
and that the morning after the occurrence, <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Delo</span>, likewise, threatened to kill <span class="SpellE">Lacaden</span> should he squeal on them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Despite the absence of direct evidence of any participation in
the killing of <span class="SpellE">Madriago</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gardose</span>,
His Honor, the Trial Judge found appellants herein "<span class="SpellE">equally"liable</span>
<span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, upon the ground that, by overtaking <span class="SpellE">Madriago</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gardose</span>, appellants
showed that they "were really in concert" - presumably with <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span> and <span class="SpellE">Delo</span> - "in pursuing"
said victims; that having gone with <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span> and <span class="SpellE">Delo</span> despite their "evil intention, " manifested
by the fact that they were armed with a scythe and a small bolo, appellants
must have known of their "mission"; that their failure to do any­thing
to prevent the aggression "proves convincingly" that appel­lants had
conspired with <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span> and <span class="SpellE">Delo</span>
in committing the crimes charged; that <span class="SpellE">Madriago</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gardose</span> had altogether sus­tained 49 wounds, which could
not have been inflicted by two (2) persons only - <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Delo</span> - particularly because they used a scythe
and a bolo, which could not have caused 11 lacerated wounds allegedly found in
the body of <span class="SpellE">Madriago</span>; and that appellants did not
immediately report the occurrence to the authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apart from the fact that the conclusion thus drawn by the trial
court does not follow necessarily from the aforementioned premises, some of
these are not borne out by the record.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the same shows that those who overtook <span class="SpellE">Madriago</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Gardose</span> were <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Delo</span>, <u>not</u> appellants herein, although it
is not improbable that the latter may have been near the former (<span class="SpellE">Madriago</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gardose</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span> and <span class="SpellE">Delo</span>) <u>after</u>
the commencement of the aggres­sion, since the same must have prevented <span class="SpellE">Madriago</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gardose</span> from moving
away.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, it does not appear that appellants <span class="GramE">knew,</span>
when they joined <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span> and <span class="SpellE">Delo</span>,
in the evening of the occurrence, that the latter had a scythe and a small bolo
with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the appealed
decision states that <span class="SpellE">Lacaden</span> had not seen <span class="SpellE">Delo's</span> bolo and that, "instantly" - after asking <span class="SpellE">Madriago</span> "why did you box me this after­noon?" -
"Roman <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span> stabbed <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Madriago</span> with a scythe, which he took <u>from under
his cloth</u>." Under the circumstances, <span class="GramE">We</span>
cannot assume that appellants were aware, before the attack upon <span class="SpellE">Madriago</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gardose</span>, that <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span> and <span class="SpellE">Delo</span> were armed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it is not unusual for people in
rural areas to go about carrying a scythe or a bolo, which are generally used
in their ordinary acti­vities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, the presence of said instruments is not necessarily indicative of evil
intent of the person or persons carry­ing them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span> and <span class="SpellE">Delo</span>
carried said scythe and bolo, respectively, when they went to the store of <span class="SpellE">Tirso</span> <span class="SpellE">Rapisora</span>, to engage in a
drinking spree, although they had, as yet, no idea of doing anything wrong.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the lower court indulged in nothing short of
sheer speculation when it surmised that appellants must have inflicted the 11
lacerated wounds - apart from 28 stab wounds - said to have been sustained by <span class="SpellE">Madriago</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Batangan</span>, who made an autopsy of the victims,
merely found 15 stab wounds in <span class="SpellE">Madriago's</span> body and 8
or 9 stab wounds in that of <span class="SpellE">Gardose</span>, and no lacerated
wounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, there is no evidence
whatsoever <span class="GramE">that appellants</span> carried or used any object
with which they could have caused lacerated wounds. Then, too - since the lower
court had resorted to conjectures - there is nothing in the record to indi­cate
that the blades of the scythe and the bolo of <span class="SpellE">Gallema</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Delo</span> were not so dull - as, at times, those
instruments are - as to be incapable of causing lacerated wounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, "although before the threats" - made to him the
next morning - "he was not afraid" - meaning, obviously, for his life
- Gagarin added, "yet he did not report to the police authorities be­cause
he was afraid of what had happened."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We find in this nothing indicative of a common design or complicity with
<span class="SpellE">Gallema</span> and <span class="SpellE">Delo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the fact that, as soon as
the latter's intent to kill <span class="SpellE">Madriago</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gardose</span> became apparent, appellants proceeded to run away,
suggests that they were unaware of said intent until the very moment of the
occurrence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Frankly acknowledging the inadequacy of the evidence for the
prosecution to establish appellants' guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the
Solicitor General recommends their acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the light of the foregoing, <span class="GramE">We</span> find that
such recommendation is well taken.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Accordingly</b>, the decision appealed from should be reversed
and appellants Rudy <span class="SpellE">Lacaden</span>, Vicente Gagarin and <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Capinding</span> are hereby
acquitted for insufficiency of the evidence, with the proportional part of the
costs <u>de</u> <u>officio.<o:p></o:p></u></p>
