				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Antonio <span class="SpellE">Madlangbayan</span> y <span class="SpellE">Bonet</span> was accused of the crime of robbery with homicide,
committed according to the information as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about December 27, 1970 in the City of Manila,
Philippines, the said accused, conspiring and confederating together with three
others whose true names, identities and whereabouts are still unknown, and
helping one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously,
with intent of gain, and by means of violence, take away from the pocket of
Enrique <span class="SpellE">Fallarme</span> one black leather wallet containing
cash in different denominations amounting to P300.00 and one Seiko wrist watch
valued at P300.00, or a total value of P600.00, Philippine currency, to the
damage and prejudice of said Enrique <span class="SpellE">Fallarme</span>, owner
thereof, in the said sum of P600.00; that on the occasion of the said robbery
and for the purpose of enabling them to take, steal and carry away the said
articles and money, the herein accused, in pursuance with his conspiracy with
the others still unknown, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and
feloniously, with intent to kill and taking advantage of their superior
strength, treacherously attack, assault and use personal violence upon the said
Enrique <span class="SpellE">Fallarme</span> by then and there stabbing him
several times with bladed weapons on different parts of body, thereby inflicting
upon him mortal wounds which were the direct and immediate cause of his death
thereafter."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After trial, he was sentenced thus:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, accused is hereby found guilty beyond reasonable
doubt as principal of the crime of robbery with homicide and there being proved
the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength without any
mitigating circumstance to offset the same, the Court sentences him to DEATH;
to indemnify the heirs of the deceased the sum of P12,000.00 for the death of
the latter, the sum of P10,000.00 by way of moral damages, the sum of
P10,000.00 by way of exemplary damages; to return to the heirs of the victim
the articles and cash taken from the latter or to indemnify them the sum of
P600.00 representing the total value thereof if he fails to do so; and to pay
the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the afternoon of <st1:date year="1970" day="27" month="12">December
 27, 1970</st1:date>, Enrique <span class="SpellE">Fallarme</span> and his son, <span class="SpellE">Elywelyn</span> <span class="SpellE">Fallarme</span> went to their
grocery store at <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span> Central Market, where <span class="SpellE">Elywelyn</span> took P300.00 in various denominations and handed
the money to his father who placed it in his leather wallet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Elywelyn</span>
brought his father to <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Canonigo</span>
  St.</st1:address></st1:street> in <span class="SpellE">Paco</span>, where a road
construction was being undertaken.</p>

<p class="BODY">Enrique <span class="SpellE">Fallarme</span>, as a supervising
engineer in the City Engineer's Office of Manila, supervised the road
construction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Between <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="30" hour="19">7:30
 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening, Enrique <span class="SpellE">Fallarme</span>
was stabbed to death by unknown assailants at the corner of San Gregorio and <span class="SpellE">Canonigo</span> streets.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> V. Lucero, Medical Examiner of
the Manila Police Department, who autopsied the body of Enrique <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Fallarme</span></span> testified that there were
five stab wounds on his chest, stomach and at the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Death was attributed to shock and hemorrhage
due to the multiple stab wounds.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Elywelyn</span> <span class="SpellE">Fallarme</span>,
who repaired to the scene, found his father sprawled on the ground, dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He discovered that his father's <span class="GramE">wallet containing the P300.00 as well as his Seiko wrist watch
worth P300.00 were</span> missing.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the wake at <st1:place><st1:placename>Lourdes</st1:placename>

evening, Patrolmen Rafael <span class="SpellE">Carag</span> and <span class="SpellE">Asterio</span> Santos of the Manila Police Department brought the
accused Antonio <span class="SpellE">Madlangbayan</span> to view the cadaver of
Enrique <span class="SpellE">Fallarme</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The accused identified the remains as the person he had stabbed on <st1:date year="1970" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1970</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that Antonio <span class="SpellE">Madlangbayan</span>
was arrested by the police at his house in <span class="SpellE">Kahilom</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span>, by Patrolmen Eduardo Cuevas and Reynaldo Pimentel
both of the MPD on information furnished by a police informer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon investigation, he disclosed his
participation in the hold-up stabbing of the deceased, together with a certain
"Boy Marino", "<span class="SpellE">Imping</span>" and "<span class="SpellE">Rody</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
answer to a question, he stated that he could recognize and identify the man
they stabbed at the corner of San Gregorio and <span class="SpellE">Canonigo</span>
streets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was for this reason that the
police officers brought Antonio to view the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, Patrolman Rafael <span class="SpellE">Carag</span>
embodied Antonio's statement in writing in the usual question and answer form,
in <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>, at the end of which the accused affixed
his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> for he did not know how to read and
write.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statement (Exhibit E) was
then sworn to before <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> inquest Fiscal Mariano
Chavez on <st1:date year="1970" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1970</st1:date>,
at <st1:time minute="50" hour="12">12:50</st1:time> in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It stated in substance that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Late in the afternoon of December 27, 1970,
the accused Antonio <span class="SpellE">Madlangbayan</span> was with a certain
"Boy Marino", "<span class="SpellE">Imping</span>" and "<span class="SpellE">Rody</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four
converged near the Public Highway Barracks near the Manila Railroad Station in <span class="SpellE">Paco</span>, intending to have a drinking spree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They walked along <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Canonigo</span> St.</st1:address></st1:street> towards <st1:place><st1:placename>Manuel</st1:placename>

</span>They stopped at Golden Taxi Restaurant and Antonio <span class="SpellE">Madlangbayan</span>
gave "Boy <span class="SpellE">Mariño</span>" twenty centavos to buy
"Champion" cigarettes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
front of <st1:place><st1:placename>Manuel</st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Roxas</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>High School</st1:placetype></st1:place>,

tree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was past <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What happened next is narrated by the accused
in Exhibit E as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1970</st1:date>,
the crime was re-enacted by the accused and pictures were taken, namely
Exhibits G, G-1 to G-9.</p>

<p class="BODY">The extrajudicial confession served as the principal evidence
linking the accused to the commission of the crime of robbery with homicide,
for which he was convicted and sentenced as above stated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused who admitted to being a member of the <span class="SpellE">Bahala</span> <span style="">Na </span>Gang,
now maintains that his extrajudicial confession was coerced from him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claims that when he refused to affix his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> to Exhibit E, he was boxed by Patrolman Cuevas
and his companions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is to be
noted that while Patrolmen Cuevas and Pimentel were the ones who arrested the
accused in <span class="SpellE">Kahilom</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span>,
at which time the accused gave his name as Rudy only to admit later that he was
Tony because Cuevas noticed a tattoo on his arm reading "Tony", it
was Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Carag</span> who took and witnessed his
extrajudicial confession <span style="">together </span>with Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Asterio</span>
Santos.</p>

<p class="BODY">A confession has a high evidentiary value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For according to the Rules of Court:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The declaration of an accused expressly
acknowledging his guilt of the offense <span class="GramE">charged,</span> may be
given in evidence against him."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Sec. 29, Rule 130.) And a confession is presumed to be voluntary until
the contrary is shown.</p>

<p class="BODY">The presumption has not been overcome in this case where, except
for appellant's testimony repudiating his confession, no other evidence was
adduced to show that the statements in the confession were obtained through
force or intimidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary,
appellant's claim is belied by the abundance of evidence showing that his
confession was voluntarily given.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First,
the confession is replete with details which the accused alone could have known
and which could not have been concocted by the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The movements of the accused prior to the commission
of the crime which <span class="GramE">are</span> narrated above are from his
confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second, Fiscal Mariano
Chavez who administered the oath in the confession of the appellant testified
that he first asked him whether he gave his statement and affixed his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> thereon voluntarily and the appellant answered in
the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fiscal Chavez further
testified that the accused did not complain to him of any maltreatment nor was
the accused maltreated by the police in his presence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Third, the accused re-enacted the commission
of the crime where he reiterated the statements he had made in his
confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The re-enactment, according
to Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Carag</span>, was voluntary and this must be so
because it was made in a public place thus negating any suggestion of violence
employed on the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And fourth, the
accused did not present any medical certificate to show that he suffered injury
at the hands of the police.</p>

<p class="BODY">The more crucial question is whether the extrajudicial confession
is sufficient to sustain the conviction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Rules of Court provide that "An extrajudicial confession made
by an accused shall not be sufficient ground for conviction, unless
corroborated by evidence of corpus <span class="SpellE">delicti</span>."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Sec. 3, Rule 133)</p>

<p class="BODY">Corpus <span class="SpellE">delicti</span> means the substance of
the crime, the fact that a crime has actually been committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence of corpus <span class="SpellE">delicti</span> must be
independent of the extrajudicial confession.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, it does not mean that every element of the crime must be made
out apart from the confession, but merely that there should be some evidence
apart from the confession tending to show that the crime has been
committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See People vs. <span class="SpellE">Batangan</span>, 54 Phil. 834)</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, from the evidence of the prosecution, apart from
the extrajudicial confession of the appellant, the fact of the commission of
the crime of robbery with <span class="GramE">homicide,</span> is well and
sufficiently established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said fact,
which is the corpus <span class="SpellE">delicti</span> of the offense charged
has been proved by the <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Elywelyn</span> <span class="SpellE">Fallarme</span> and the police
officers assigned to this case, as well as by the testimony of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> Lucero, the police medical examiner, as to the
death of Enrique <span class="SpellE">Fallarme</span>, together with the
documentary evidence of the necropsy report stating the post-mortem findings,
including the cause of death.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the presumption that no person of normal mind will
deliberately and knowingly confess himself to be the perpetrator of a crime unless
prompted by truth and conscience, (U.S. vs. de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos,
24 Phil. 329), said extrajudicial confession when considered together with
evidence of the perpetration of the crime, is worthy of belief as proof of
commission by the confessant of the crime to which the confession refers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the trial court committed no error in rejecting the
defense that the accused was at the residence of his uncle Atty. Juan <span class="SpellE">Blancaflor</span> in <span class="SpellE">Kahilom</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span>, between <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00</st1:time>
and <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1970" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1970</st1:date>, which was the
latter's birthday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that the
residence of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Blancaflor</span> was barely 500 to 600
meters away from the scene of the crime, it was not impossible for the accused
to have gone there between the hours mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, as there were some guests at the residence of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Blancaflor</span>, the possibility that he could not have noted
the exact time the accused arrived at his house cannot be discounted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, our painful task of sustaining the conviction of the
accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, it is manifest that the accused together with his
co-assailants who unfortunately have not been apprehended, took advantage of their
superior strength, when the four of them, two of whom were armed with bladed
weapons surrounded and stabbed the unarmed, helpless and unsuspecting
victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aggravating circumstance of
abuse of superior strength was correctly appreciated by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable
doubt of the crime of robbery with homicide, the judgment under review is
hereby affirmed in its entirety.</p>
