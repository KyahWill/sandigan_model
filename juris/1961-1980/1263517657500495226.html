				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The respect to be paid a stipulation in <span style="">a </span>collective bargaining contract,
when apparently it came into collision with a statutory right, lay at the root
of the dispute in this certiorari and prohibition proceeding now before this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congress in 1961 amended the
pertinent provision of the Industrial Peace Act by exempting from the operation
of a closed shop or a union security shop agreement "members of any
religious sects which prohibit affiliation of their members in any such labor
organization."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The above saving clause notwithstanding, petitioner union, Lakas Ng
Manggagawang Makabayan (LMM), was able to prevail on the employer, the
Marinduque Mining and Industrial Corporation, to terminate the services of
private respondents,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
adherents of the Iglesia ni Cristo sect, one of the tenets of which prohibits
membership in any labor organization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
regain their status as such employees, private respondents filed a petition for
mandamus with the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental presided by
respondent Judge, the Honorable Carlos Abiera.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They sought and were able to obtain a writ of preliminary mandatory
injunction, the allegations in their petition having been admitted by
petitioner Union as one of the respondents before the lower court, the sole
defense interposed being raised by it being the alleged lack of
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus unsuccessful,
petitioner Union elevated the matter to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It raised the same fundamental question, the
absence of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find for
petitioner and proceed to explain why.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the petition filed on September 9, 1968, the main reliance is
placed by petitioner Union on <span style="">a </span>collective
bargaining agreement with the employer, the Marinduque Mining and Industrial
Corporation, entered into on November 1, 1967 and effective for three years,
one of the provisions of which required members of such Union and those who
become such thereafter to continue and remain with that status "in good
standing on a condition of continued employment."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Reference is then made to private respondents having been members of petitioner
Union even prior to such collective bargaining agreement.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Subsequently, however, on May 7, 1968, to be more precise, and during the
effectivity of such collective bargaining contract private respondents tendered
their irrevocable resignations as such members and disauthorized the latter to
withdraw the check-off of union dues, private respondents relying on their
being adherents of the Iglesia ni Cristo sect and therefore falling within the
terms of the Republic Act <span style="">earlier
referred to.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
After failing in its attempts to have them resume their membership, petitioner
Union recommended to the <span style="">employer their
dismissal and such recommendation was carried out "by reason, of and
[pursuant] to the particular provisions of the existing collective bargaining
contract * * *."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> As a result, private respondents in turn
filed a petition for mandamus with preliminary mandatory injunction and damages
on July 15, 1968 with the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental presided
by respondent Judge.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> There was a motion to dismiss and opposition
to the issuance of the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction filed by
petitioner Union on July <span style="">22, </span>1968.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Then came on August 5, 1968 an order

such writ but it <span style="">was </span>denied by

<p class="BODY">This Court in a resolution of September 12, 1968 required
respondents to file an answer and at the same time issued a writ of preliminary
injunction restraining the enforcement of the challenged order of August 5,
1968 as well as the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction of August 8, 1968
issued pursuant thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the answer
filed on October 8, 1968, there was an admission of the facts alleged in the
petition except <span style="">as </span>to
allegations "devoid of factual basis'' and such as are "legal
conclusions of petitioner."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The sole question before this Court then is one of
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated at the outset,
petitioner in the light of the <span style="">controlling
statutory provision could </span>validly impugn the jurisdiction of respondent
Judge.</p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not </span>admit of doubt that the collective bargaining <span style="">contract between </span>petitioner and the
Marinduque Mining and <span style="">Industrial
Corporation </span>of 1967 must <span style="">be
deemed </span>to have incorpo­<span style="">rated
within its </span>terms the 1961 amendment <span style="">of the </span>Industrial Peace <span style="">Act
exempting from the </span>operation of a <span style="">closed shop or a union </span><span style="">security
shop agreement "members of any religious sects which prohibit affiliation
of their members in any such labor organization." If it were not so, then
the collective bargaining agreement itself could be properly assailed as the
freedom of contract recognized by the Civil Code while it empowers the parties
to establish such stipulations, clauses, terms and conditions as they may deem
convenient is limited by the requirement that they should not be "contrary
to law".</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The principle is thus well-settled that an
existing law enters into and forms part of a valid contract without the need
for the parties expressly making reference to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only thus could its validity insofar as some
of its provisions are concerned be assured.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the assumption then that private respondents could lay claim to the
protection of the above exemption provision, the fundamental question, the only
one before this Court, is whether such a statutory right could be vindicated in
an ordinary court as was done here or in the Court of Industrial Relations?</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be no dispute
as to the answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the Industrial
Peace Act, it is made an unfair labor practice for a labor organization, such
as petitioner here, "[t]o cause or<span style="">
attempt to cause an employer to discriminate against an employee in violation
of subsection (a) (4) or to discriminate against an employee with respect to
whom membership in such organization has been denied or terminated on some
ground other than the usual terms and conditions under which member­ship or continuation
of membership is made available to other members."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Reference is thus made to an earlier
subsection of <span style="">said </span>act making it
an unfair labor practice for an employer to discriminate in regard to hire or
tenure of employment or any <span style="">term or condition
</span>of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor
organization.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> There is this proviso which </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">originally worded when the measure was enacted in 1953 <span style="">reads </span>thus: "That nothing in this
Act or in any other Act or statute of the Republic of the Philippines shall
preclude an employer from making an agreement with </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">labor organization to require as a condition
of employ­ment membership therein, if such labor organization is the
representative of the employees as provided in section twelve."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Then, as was set forth at the outset of this
opinion, came the 1961 amendment with members of religious sects as
beneficiaries and thus entitled to exemption from a closed shop or a union
security shop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an integral part of
the section on what constitutes an unfair labor practice.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the next section of the Industrial Peace Act, the
jurisdiction over an unfair labor practice case, whether on the part of
management or of a labor union, is vested with the Court of Industrial
Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "The<span style=""> Court shall have jurisdiction over the
prevention of unfair labor practices and is empowered to prevent any person
from engaging in any unfair labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This power shall be exclusive and shall not be affected by any other
means of adjustment or prevention that has been or may be established by an
agreement, code, law or otherwise."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> This Court then ever since the effectivity
of such Act has no choice but to adhere to the view that the Court of
Industrial Relations and not a court of first instance, is vested with juris­diction
over every kind of an unfair labor practice case.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Petitioner must thus be sustained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It only remains to be added that unless the legislative act
granting the above exemption to certain religious sects remains unmodified and
no challenge is hurled against its validity resulting in its nullification, the
parties to any contract must live up faithfully to its terms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a fundamental <span style="">postulate </span>that however broad the freedom of contracting parties
may be, it does not go so far <span style="">as </span>to
countenance disrespect for or failure to observe a legal prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statute takes precedence; a stipulation
in a collective bargaining must yield to it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is to adhere to the rule of law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ of certiorari is granted annulling the
order of respondent Judge of August 5, 1968 granting the prayer of private
respondents for a preliminary mandatory injunction as well as the writ <span style="">of preliminary injunction thereafter issued
on the 8th day of August, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Judge is prohibited from proceeding further with the mandamus
petition filed by private respondents which is ordered dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writ of preliminary injunction issued by
this Court under its resolution of September 12, 1968 is made permanent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
