<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1967</st1:date>,
the Municipal Board of Canvassers headed by An­dres Buenaventura as chairman,
with Patricio <span class="SpellE">Trajano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>

Evangelista, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Llamzon</span>, Alfred <span class="SpellE">Seeckts</span> and Fran­cisco Mariano.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When the Statement of Canvass by Precincts, Exhibit X-1 Court and
Certificate of Canvass of the Votes Cast for Municipal Offices and Proclamation
of the Candidates Elected by the Municipal Board of Canvassers, Exhibit
X-2-Court, were presented to the Board for approval and signature of its
members, the three members of the Board belonging to the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party, name­ly, Ernesto Navarro, <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span> <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Trono</span>, refused
to, sign the documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See
Supplementary Minutes, Exhibit X-10-Court).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Member Ernesto Navarro submitted to the Board a written petition,
Exhibit X-10-B-Court, signed by re-<span class="SpellE">electionist</span> Mayor
Ricardo T. Angeles, objecting to and praying for the suspension of the canvass
in order to enable the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party candidates
to go to Court for a judicial recount on the ground of alleged dis­crepancies
in the entries in the elec­tion returns.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Those members of the Board who voted in favor of the duly elected
candidates as appear in the proclamation form, C.E. Form No. 85, Exhibit
X-2-Court, being majority in number, the Municipal Board of Canvassers
proclaimed the above named candidates as duly elected for the corresponding
municipal offices.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On November 23, 1967, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Bantog</span>,
Municipal Treasurer of Orion, as Deputy of the Commission on Elec­tions,
received from the Commission a telegram, informing him that upon petition of
Ricardo T. Angeles, the Commission on Elections has declared the Municipal
Board of Canvassers of Orion under the chairmanship of Andres Buenaventura as
illegally constituted and nullified and voided the proceeding conducted by said
Board parti­cularly the canvass and proclamation of elected candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission on Elections directed the Muni­cipal
Treasurer as its deputy, to reconstitute a new body of Municipal Board of
Canvassers pursuant to the requirements of Section 167 of the Revised Election
Code, to reconvene and <span class="SpellE">recanvass</span> the election
returns, and' thereafter to proclaim the win­ning candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to this directive of the Commission
on Elec­tions, the Municipal Treasurer reconstituted a Municipal Board of
Canvassers consisting of Ernesto Navarro as Chairman and with Jose <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Trono</span>, Jose del
Rosario, Jose <span class="SpellE">Quicho</span>, <span class="SpellE">Exequiel</span>
<span class="SpellE">Canoy</span>, Ricardo Q. Angeles, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Flordeliz</span>,
Isidro Bautista and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Venegas</span> as members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter the Municipal treasurer sent
notices to the members of the reconstituted Municipal Board of Canvassers, the
candidates and their authorized representatives, advising them that the
Municipal Board of Canvassers as reconstituted will hold its meeting at <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the af­ternoon of <st1:date year="1967" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1967</st1:date>, at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Municipal</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Town Hall</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the meeting was convened councilors
Isidro Bautista and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Venegas</span> were absent, while
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Flordeliz</span> walked out.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After the canvass conducted in the a afternoon of November 25,
1967, the chairman of the Board, Ernesto Navarro, observed, alleged
discrepancies in the various election returns consisting of superimposition,
blurredness of entries and 'other irregularities affecting the votes received
for mayors and councilors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of
this observation the board agreed to suspend the canvass insofar as candidates
for mayor and councilors are concerned and proposed the filing of a petition in
court for a judicial recount in the precincts where alleged discrepancies and
irregularities are found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Municipal
Board of Canvassers, however, proclaimed Ernesto G. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
as duly elected vice-mayor of Orion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On November 29, 1967, Atty. Arturo Lopez, as representative of the
Commis­sion on Elections recommended to the Commission that Ernesto Navarro,
Chair­man of the Municipal Board of Canvassers 'of Orion, be suspended and
replaced by any qualified voter of Orion for failure' to convene the Board of
Canvassers despite his instruction in violation of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
resolution in Case RR-544 and <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> telegram dated
November 27, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, on <st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1967</st1:date>, Atty. Arturo Lopez,
by authority of the Commission on Elections, relieved Ernesto Navarro as
chairman of the Municipal Board of Canvassers of Orion, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>, and replaced by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span> <span class="SpellE">Lacson-Parayno</span>, who is a <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> Regis­trar of Orion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Earlier on the same date of December 1, 1967, the instant petition
signed by Ernesto Navarro as chairman of the Municipal Board of Canvassers, was
filed before this Court for a judicial recount of the votes cast for mayor and
councilors in Precincts Nos. 2, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22,
23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35 and 36 of the Municipality of Orion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1967</st1:date>,
the reconstituted Municipal Board of Canvassers under the chairmanship of Atty.
<span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span> <span class="SpellE">Lacson-Parayno</span> with
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Flordeliz</span>, Isidro Bautista, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Venegas</span>, Jose <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, Jr., Jose
del Rosario, Jose <span class="SpellE">Quicho</span>, <span class="SpellE">Exequiel</span>
<span class="SpellE">Canoy</span>, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Trono</span> and
Ricardo Q. Angeles as members, was convened at <st1:time minute="10" hour="16">4:10
 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The chairman made it understood that the Board will not touch on the
results of the can­vass already made by the Board under the chairmanship of
Ernesto Navarro, but will canvass only the returns of Precincts Nos. 17, 20, 22
and 23 pursuant to the resolution of the Commission on Elections of November
27, 1967, so that the results of the said canvass may be incorporated with
those of the previous canvass as certified and approved for the purpose of
establishing a basis for the proclamation of the winning candidates.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Notwithstanding the instruction of the Commission on Elections for
the con­tinuation of the canvass, member Jose <span class="SpellE">Bal­tazar</span>,
Jr. interpose objection on the grounds that the Municipal Board of Canvassers
formerly headed by Ernesto Navarro had made a report to the Commission recommending
for a judicial recount and the Board had in fact filed the instant peti­tion
for a judicial recount of the votes cast in the questioned precincts. This
objection of member Jose <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, Jr. was overruled
by Chairman <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span> <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>­
<span class="SpellE">Parayno</span> on the ground among others, that there is a
definite order from the Commission on Elections for the immediate completion of
the canvass and the procla­mation of the elected candidates and that the duty
of the Municipal Board of Canvassers is only ministerial insofar as the
canvassing of votes and proclama­tion of the winning candidates on the basis of
the result of such canvass are concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(See Minutes of the Meet­ing of the Municipal Board of Canvassers held
on December 2, 1967, Exhibit Z-1- Court).</blockquote>

<blockquote>As a result of the canvass conducted by the reconstituted Municipal
Board of Canvassers on December 2, 1967, under the Chairmanship of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span> <span class="SpellE">Lacson-Parayno</span>, the Board
declared Gabriel <span class="SpellE">Manrique</span> to have received, 3,150
votes for the office of Mayor and Ernesto C. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
to have received 3,074 votes for the office of Vice-mayor of Orion, as shown in
the Certificate of Canvass and Proclamation of Candidates Elected the C.E. Form
No. 85, Exhibit Z-2-Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When C.E.
Form No. 85, Exhibit Z-2-Court, however, was passed around for the signature of
the members of the Board, recalcitrant members, Jose <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>,
Jr., Jose <span class="SpellE">Quicho</span>, Jose del Ro­sario, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Trono</span>, <span class="SpellE">Exequiel</span> amid Ricardo Q.
Angeles, refused to sign and instead sub­mitted a written manifesto wherein
they stated their refusal to sign the proclamation on the ground that they
object to the continuance of the canvass by virtue of the filing of the instant
petition for a judicial recount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only
the chairman, <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span> <span class="SpellE">Lacson-Paraymo</span>
and members Isidro Bautista, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Venegas</span> and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Flordeliz</span> signed the Certificate of Canvass and
Proclamation, Exhibit Z-2-Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1967</st1:date>,
herein respondents candidates of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party, Ricardo T. Angeles, et al., filed a "Petition for Certiorari with
Preliminary Injunction" before the Supreme Court as G. R. No. L-28365
against the Commission on Elections and re­spondents candidates of the Liberal
Party, Gabriel <span class="SpellE">Manrique</span>, et al., directed at the

the Com­mission on Elections dated December 4, 1967, ordering the Municipal
Board of Orion, <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>, to continue "after
December 6, 1967" its suspended canvass on the basis 'of questioned
election returns, un­less restrained in the meantime by a competent court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, on December 7, 1967, the Supreme
Court required the respondents in that case to file not later than December 16,
1967, their answer the petition for certiorari, and issued a temporary restraining
order "enjoining respond­ents from canvas sing the votes cast in contested
precincts and from pro­claiming 'winners therein."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petition for judicial recount was based on certain alleged
irregularities consisting of "erasures, intercalation, superimpositions

the 35 precincts in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>muni­cipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Orion</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The returns referred to are the copies for
the municipal treasurer which had been used by the municipal board of
canvassers in its task of canvassing the votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision respondent court did not consider and rule upon
the alleged irregularities in each and all of the returns from-the 25
precincts, but only upon those pointed out by petitioners in their

legible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A comparison with the <span class="SpellE">photostatic</span> copy of the original re­turn in the possession

16; 17, 19, 24, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 and 35, it is claimed that the
entries in the carbon copies of the returns intended for the Municipal
Treasurer, or that which was used by the Municipal Board of Can­vassers in the
canvass contain erasures; intercalations, superimpositions and other signs of
falsification; and with respect to six other precincts namely, Precincts Nos.

these two sets of election returns boils down to whether a judicial recount may
be ordered, under Sec. 158 in relation to Sec. 163 of the Revised Election
code, when there arc erasures, intercalations, superimpositions and when the
entries in the carbon copies of the election returns are blurred, or to use the
right case, therefore, calls into question the applicability of Section 168 of
the Re­vised Election Code which reads:</blockquote>

said offices those who have polled the largest number of votes for the
different offices, in the same manner as hereinbefore pro­vided for the provincial

Election Code states:</blockquote>

discrepancies in the number of votes obtained by the candidates, evidently
refer to any of the four (4) copies men­tioned in Sec. 150 of the said code and

discrepancies in the copies of the election returns used by the Municipal Board
of Canvassers complained of by the respondents candidates of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party are nothing but corrections and
superimpositions made by the poll clerks, not to alter or falsify the returns,
but rather to make the light imprint on the carbon copies more heavier and
legible than it would otherwise appear if the names of the candidates and the
number of votes they obtained were not retraced or rewritten.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Right here, the Court finds a forbidding
obstacle- to any other view of the statute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To say otherwise would render nugatory the obvious contents of the <span class="SpellE">abovequoted</span> legal provisions that only "in case of
contradictions or discrepancies between the copies of the same statements"
or when it "appears that another copy or other authentic copies of the
state­ment from an election precinct" will the court "proceed to
recount the votes cast in the precinct."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners assail respondent court's decision on two main
grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) that the existence of
erasures, alterations and superimpositions on the face of each of the election
returns from fourteen precincts (Nos. 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 24, 26, 28, 29, 30,
31, 32, 33 and 35) should not have been "lightly brushed aside" with
the explanation that the same were made so that the entries would be
"heavier and more legible; " and (b) that the comparison made by
respondent court of the returns in question with <span class="SpellE">photostatic</span>
copies of the original returns in the possession of the Commission on Elections
cannot be justified under the law, because <span class="SpellE">photostats</span>
do not afford a fair and permissible basis for determining the existence of
discrepancies, alterations, contradictions and erasures.</p>

<p class="BODY">In considering the foregoing points one basic postulate must be
kept in mind:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the remedy of judicial
recount is a special one, which may be resorted to only "in case of
contradictions or discrepancies between copies of the same statements"
(Sec. 168, Rev. Election Code), or more specifically, "in case it appears
that another copy or authentic Copies of the statement from an election
precinct give to a candidate a <u>different number of votes</u> and the
difference affects the result of the election.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Sec. 163, <st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The authentic copies referred to, as held by
this Court in many decisions, are those' mentioned in Section 150 and intended,
pursuant to Section 152, one each for the ballot box, for the municipal
treasurer, for the provincial treasurer, and for the Commission on Elec­tions.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The existence of erasures
or apparent superimposi­tions or alterations on one of the four copies
abovementioned does not by itself alone justify judicial recount:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If they are susceptible of reasonable
explanation, and do not constitute contradictions or discrepancies with what
appear in the other copies, this remedy is not available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If any­thing they may be evidence of fraud,
which must be ven­tilated in an election protest, not in the summary proceed­ing
envisioned in Section 163 of the Election Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Peti­tioners presented no other copy of the election returns for
purposes of comparison, to determine whether or not discrepancies existed
within the meaning of the said provision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And respondent Court, evidently to satisfy itself as to the nature of
the erasures, superimpositions and alterations alleged by petitioners, did well
to take testi­monial evidence as to how and why they came about,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and even to supply an omission on their part by taking the initiative in
comparing the questioned returns with <span class="SpellE">photostats</span> (sup­plied
by respondents-<span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>) of the copies submitted to
the Commission on Elections.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners question the procedure followed by respondent Court,
but they have adduced no evidence to disprove the correctness or validity of its
conclusions, namely, that the discrepancies complained of in the returns used
by the municipal board of canvassers are nothing but corrections and
superimpositions not to alter or falsify the entries but rather to make the
light imprints of the carbon papers heavier and more legible than they would
otherwise appear if the names of the candidates and the number of votes they
obtained had not been retraced or re-written. This explanation, given in each
instance by the chairman or by the poll clerk or by both, of the correspond­ing
board of inspectors, appeared to the Judge below as entirely satisfactory and
plausible, and we see no reason, as far as the record reveals, to entertain a
different conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the claim that the entries in the returns from
six precincts (Nos. 20, 22, 23, 25, 26 and 30) are illegible, this is a
question of fact an which respondent Court has ruled to the contrary in
categorical terms, having had the opportunity to examine the returns for
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This ruling can hardly be
disputed at the present instance, the said returns not having been submitted to
us for similar examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides,
mere illegibility of the entries in one copy of the election return is not
necessarily a grand for judicial recount, for another copy may be availed of,
such as the one in the hands of the Commission' on Elections.</p>

<p class="BODY">The supplemental petition of <st1:date year="1968" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1968</st1:date> questions the validity of the proceedings
of the municipal board of canvassers of Orion held an <st1:date year="1968" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1968</st1:date> and the consequent proclamation
of the winning candidates made on the same date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The grounds set forth in support of said
supplemental petition will be considered seriatim:</p>

<p class="NUM">(1) It is alleged that the transfer of the <span class="SpellE">situs</span>
of the canvass from the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Orion</st1:placename></st1:place> to the office of
respondent Commission in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> was
without justification.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection the events and circumstances which led to the
transfer may be recalled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four <span class="SpellE">canvassings</span> in all were held, the first of which was in the
<st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Orion</st1:placename></st1:place>
itself, on <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of that canvass, respondent
Gabriel L. <span class="SpellE">Manrique</span> was proclaimed duly elected
Mayor, together with his co-respondents here who ran for the office of
councilor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, that canvass was
nullified by the Commission on Elections on the ground that the board had been
illegally constituted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second canvass was held on <st1:date year="1967" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1967</st1:date> by a reconstituted board under the
chairmanship of Ernesto Navarro, one of petitioners here, and pursuant to the
order of the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was in this
canvass that petitioners alleged the existence of discrepancies,
contradictions, alterations and other irregularities in the election returns
from 25 precincts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The true nature of
these alleged discre­pancies is discussed at length in the decision of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> in the case for
judicial recount, reproduced verbatim hereinbefore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Curiously enough, in spite of such alleged
discrepancies petitioners allowed the proclamation of the Vice-Mayor-elect-in
the person of Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the other municipal positions
the canvass was suspended after thirty-one (31) out of the thirty-five (35)
precincts had been finished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The returns
from four (4) precincts - Nos. 17, 20, 22 and 23 - were not taken up because of
an objection raised on the ground that the entries therein were blurred and
illegible.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1967</st1:date>,
the Commission on Elections sent a telegraphic instruction to the municipal
treasurer of Orion ordering the board of canvassers to include in the canvass
the returns from the four precincts aforesaid "as reflected in returns in
possession of Commission, certified true copies of which to be furnished ...
and proclaim the officials, elect of said municipality." Because Ernesto
Navarro chairman of the board, failed to convene the same so as to carry out
the instruction of the Commission, the latter's-representative relieved him of
his position and designated in his place Attorney <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lacson-Parayno</span>, the election registrar for Orion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The reconstituted board met on <st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1967</st1:date> for the third canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The chairman explained that only the returns
from precincts Nos. 17, 20, 22 and 23 would be taken up and the results thereof
incorporated with those of the previous canvass in order to establish a basis
for the proclamation of the winning candidates. The entries in the returns were
duly read and tallied, using the <span class="SpellE">photostats</span> from the
Commission for reference purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
consolidated tallies were then prepared, including the re­sults of the previous
canvass concerning the 31 other precincts, but when they were passed around for
the signatures of the members six of them (they are among the petitioners here)
refused to sign the same on the ground that a petition for judicial recount had
been filed in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proclamation
was again held up as a consequence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The petition for judicial
recount was dismissed by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>
on <st1:date year="1967" day="22" month="12">December 22,1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitions to suspend the canvass and
proclamation filed in the Court of Appeals (CA G. R. No. 40401-R) and in this
Court (G. R. No. L-28365) were likewise dismissed on January 13 and 12,
respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon the Commission
on Elec­tions, having been informed of the tense situation in Orion and upon
petition of herein respondent Gabriel <span class="SpellE">Manrique</span>, the
winning but still <span class="SpellE">unproclaimed</span> candidate for mayor,
ordered the transfer of the <span class="SpellE">situs</span> of the canvass to
the office of the Commission in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find nothing illegal in this order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was within the authority of the Commission
to issue, and its discretion in this regard, exercised upon consideration of
the attendant circumstances, must be upheld.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is the, body vested by the Constitution with the power and function
to insure free and orderly elections, and in the absence of a clear abuse of
such power no interference with its actuations would be justified.</p>

<p class="NUM">(2) Petitioners say that with reference to the canvass id the
office of the Commission no previous notice was given to the candidates
interested or to the heads of the political parties in Orion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides pointing out that there is no
specific law requiring such notice (the canvass is a function of the board of
canvassers alone, Sec. 168, Rev. Election Code respondent Commission cites the
fact that most of the candidate were <span class="SpellE">reelectionists</span>
who had been duly substituted and <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> were
represented in the canvassing board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
point raised by petitioners is no ground to annul the proceedings in con­nection
with the canvass of <st1:date year="1968" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="NUM">(3) It is next contended that the said canvass was made
notwithstanding the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> in this Court of a
petition for preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
fact, however, is that no such writ was ever issued by this Court, and there
was no reason therefore for respondent Commission to further delay the as­certainment
of the results of the municipal election in Orion.</p>

<p class="NUM">(4) Petitioners aver that no canvass was made on January 17 of the
votes cast, for mayor, notwithstanding which respondent Gabriel <span class="SpellE">Manrique</span> was proclaimed elected for the position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This averment is denied by respondents, and
the records bear them out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The minutes
of the canvass held on December 2, 1967 show that only the returns from four
(4) precincts (Nos. 17, 20, 22 and 23) were taken up and then considered
together wit the statement of the results of the previous canvass of Nov­ember
25 concerning the 31 other precincts. The votes were duly tallied and the
proclamation of the winning candidates was prepared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when the official forms for the purpose
were passed around for the signatures of the members of the board six of them
(all of them petitioners here) refused to sign on the ground that there was a
pending petition for judicial recount it seems, however, that with respect to
some candidates for the office of councilor, the canvass of December 2 was not
complete.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was, however, corrected
in the fourth camas held in the office of the Commission on Elections on <st1:date year="1968" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The minutes of this last canvass show the following:</p>

<blockquote>“. . . The chairwoman reminded the board that, in its meeting held
on Dec­ember 2, 1967, the canvass of votes cast for mayor, vice-mayor and
several councilors was completed and the proclamation of said officials on the
basis of the completed canvass could have been made a reality as early as
December 2, 1967, were it not for' the willful refusal of the recalcitrant
members to sign the tally sheets and the proclamation papers (C.E. Form Nos. 87
and 88 respectively); that the only remaining unfinished business now before
the Board is the completion of the canvass of votes cast for some other
councilors in precincts Nos. 2, 16, 19, 25 and 30, and the proclama­tion of the
elected mayor and councilors." (p. 2)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At this juncture, the Chairwoman requested the Recording
Secretary of the Board of Canvassers to produce all do­cuments in his custody
which have something to do with the previous canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Re­cording Secretary presented a copy of
the Minutes of the meeting held by the Board in Orion, <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>,
on December 2, 1967, and a copy of the Tally Sheet (C.E, Form No. 87) which was
used during the pre­vious canvassing containing the complete number of votes
received by all can­didates in all precincts with the ex­ception of Precinct
Nos. 2, 16, 19, 25 and 30 where no votes were credited to councilor-candidates
Messrs. Pedro Santos, <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> de Jesus, Francis­co
Mariano, Fortunate Rodriguez, Guillermo Sanchez, Alfred T. <span class="SpellE">Seeckts</span>,
Pedro Javier, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Llamzon</span>, Roberto <span class="SpellE">Menardo</span>, Rafael Reyes, and <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>
Rodriguez by the Board of Canvassers then headed by Mr. Ernesto Navarro who was
later replaced by the present chair­woman as chairman of the Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said Tally Sheet (C.E. form No. 87) was
certified correct and signed by the Chairwoman and by the Members of the Board
with the exception of the recal­citrant Members on December 2, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chairwoman then announced that this
particular Tally Sheet (C.E. Form No. 87) will be completed and will be made
the basis of the subsequent proclamation of the winning candidates. Nobody ob­jected,
so the opening and the reading of the election returns in Precinct Nos. 2, 16,
19, 25 and 30 was started and completed in due time."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">(5) The foregoing portion of the minutes belie petitioners next
allegation, namely, that the canvass was made even in the absence of the
minutes of the previous meetings of the board.</p>

<p class="NUM">(6) Petitioners bewail the suspension by the super­visor of the
Commission on Elections of the majority of the members of the board of
canvassers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records,' however, show
that they were trying to delay unnecessarily the proclama­tion of the winning
candidates, and consequently their re­moval from the board was justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The minutes of the meeting on <st1:date year="1968" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1968</st1:date>, speak for
themselves:</p>

<blockquote>"The canvass completed, duly accom­plished C.E. Form Nos. 85
and 87 were passed around for signatures of all the Members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chairwoman and Members V Messrs. Ramon <span class="SpellE">Flordeliz</span>, Isidro Bautista and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Venegas</span>
ratified their s signatures affixed on the Tally Sheet on <st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1967</st1:date>. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Then they all signed the Proclamation Paper
(C.E. Form No. 85).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When their turn for
signatures on C.E. Form Nos. 87 and 85 come, Members Messrs. Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>, Jose <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, Jr. Jose
del Rosario, Jose <span class="SpellE">Quicho</span>, <span class="SpellE">Exequiel</span>
<span class="SpellE">Canoy</span> and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Trono</span>
willfully refused to sign them on the alibi that they were not, since the start
of the meeting of the Board of Canvassers, in conformity with the completion of
the canvass of votes cast for mayor and municipal councilors and the subsequent
proclamation of the winning candidates in the Office of the Commission on
Elections in Manila on January 17, 1968' as ordered by the Commission on
Elections. Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
supervisory staff re­minded the recalcitrant Members that if they so continue
to refuse to sign the Statements of Canvass (C.E. Form No. 87) which they have
just finished and completed as well as the Statements of Proclamation (C.E.
Form No. 85), their actuations will be construed to mean causing unnecessary
delay in the completion of the canvass and subsequent proclamation of the
winning candidates in utter defiance of the order of the Commission on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Elections, which gross violation of the
election law the super­visory staff of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
would not countenance. Willful refusal to sign the election forms indicated
above is a clear manifestation of obstructing the proceedings of the Board of
Canvassers for which said Board is now in session in the Office of the
Commission on Elec­tions here in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If they persist to refuse to sign these
election forms without valid reasons, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
super­visor will be constrained not only to order their suspension and
replacement by adequate substitutes but more so to recommend their prosecution
for viola­tion of the election law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span> gave them a chance to reconsider
their recalcitrant attitudes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a
while, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span> requested the Chairwoman to get
from the recalcitrant Members their categorical answers as to whether or not
they would sign C.E. Form Nos. 87 and 85 by calling their names one by
one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each and everyone of them answered
in belligerent negative."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Faced with such defiance, the supervisor of the Commission on
Elections replaced the members concerned with lawyers of the said office,
pursuant to its resolution of January 15, 1968, which ordered the <u>completion</u>
of the canvass in the office of the Commission and directed "the Law
Department to designate an attorney to supervise said canvass and proclamation
with the authority to suspend and substitute any absent and/or recalcitrant
member of the municipal board of canvassers."</p>

<p class="BODY">On the whole we find nothing irregular or contrary to law in the
procedure adopted by the Commission on Elections and in the actuations of its
representatives.</p>
