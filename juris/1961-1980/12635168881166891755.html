COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL (BRANCH VI), PETITIONERS,
VS. BRAULIO STO. DOMINGO AND THE COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>SANCHEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner Joseph <span class="SpellE">Ejercito</span> Estrada
invokes the authority of this Court to overturn the judgment of the Court of
Appeals - voting three to two - which (1) declared that the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> acted with grave abuse of
discretion for not resolving on the merits respondent <span class="SpellE">Braulio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo's motion for reconsideration of its
decision of <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1968</st1:date>,
and (2) nullified said trial court's order of <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1968</st1:date> which held final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> the decision aforementioned declaring petitioner
the winner in the election contest for the mayoralty of <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Juan</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The controlling facts may be recited as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">In the local elections in San Juan, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
held on November 14, 1967, candidates for Mayor were then incumbent Mayor <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibuna</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party official candidate; respondent <span class="SpellE">Braulio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo, Liberal
Party official candidate; petitioner Joseph <span class="SpellE">Ejercito</span>
Estrada, independent; and Enrique <span class="SpellE">Lenon</span>, also
independent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1967</st1:date>, the municipal board of
canvassers proclaimed <span class="SpellE">Braulio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.
Domingo as elected Mayor with 7,926 votes as against Joseph <span class="SpellE">Ejercito</span>
Estrada with 7,882, or a plurality of 44 votes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibuna</span> ran
third with 6,775 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Enrique <span class="SpellE">Lenon</span> obtained 55 votes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In due course, petitioner Estrada lodged an election protest, and
respondent <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo counter-protested, in the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1968</st1:date>,
judgment was rendered in said election protest, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the Court hereby annuls and
sets aside the proclamation of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Braulio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo and hereby
proclaims and declares the protestant, Joseph <span class="SpellE">Ejercito</span>
Estrada as the Mayor duly elected for the Municipality of San Juan, Province of
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in the elections held on November 14, 1967, with
a plurality of 192 votes, with costs against the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo's counsel was served with
copy of the decision on <st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="10">October 30,
 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">At <st1:time minute="45" hour="13">1:45 p.m.</st1:time> on <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1968</st1:date>, the last day of the
five-day period to appeal statutorily fixed by Section 178, Revised Elec­tion
Code, <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo filed a motion to reconsider the
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copy of the motion was sent to
Estrada's counsel by registered special delivery mail and with notice that the
motion would be heard on the following <st1:date year="1968" day="9" month="11">Saturday,
 November 9, 1968</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30 a.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attached to the motion was registry receipt
17713.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.
Domingo therein averred that the trial judge erred (1) in reviewing and
annulling the decisions of the other branches of the same court on the
exclusion of voters; (2) in rejecting "<span class="SpellE">Boyong</span>"
and "Dr. <span class="SpellE">Boyong</span>" votes; (3) in rejecting <span class="SpellE">protestee's</span> (private respondent's) evidence on the tam­pering
of ballots after revision; and (4) in appreciating certain ballots.</p>

<p class="BODY">Came the morning of <st1:date year="1968" day="9" month="11">November
 9, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.
Domingo and his counsel appeared in court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Absent were Estrada and his counsel, both of whom until then had not
received copy of the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For lack of
proof that Estrada had received notice of the motion for reconsideration of <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1968</st1:date>, the hearing thereof
was reset for <st1:date year="1968" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1968</st1:date>
at <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30 a.m.</st1:time></p>

<p class="BODY">In the afternoon of November 9, 1968 Estrada, who got wind of
what took place in the trial court that morning, filed an "omnibus
motion" alleging that <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo's motion for
reconsideration was not legally sanctioned, flimsy and frivolous, a mere scrap
of paper, and intended for delay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
prayed that that motion be stricken out and that the judgment be immediately
executed as it had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The omnibus motion he set for hearing on <st1:date year="1968" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1968</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30 a.m.</st1:time></p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, Estrada's counsel was personally served a copy
of the motion for reconsideration only on <st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1968</st1:date> upon the court's verbal order given on
the 9th of November.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The copy sent by
registered mail reached his counsel only on <st1:date year="1968" day="13" month="11">November 13, 1968</st1:date>, four days after it was set for hearing
(November 9, 1968, 8:30 a.m.).</p>

<p class="BODY">At the November 12 hearing, the judge advised the parties to
submit memoranda of authorities and reset both the omnibus motion and the
motion to reconsider on <st1:date year="1968" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was on the scheduled hearing of November 16 that <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo completed proof of service by mail of his
motion for reconsideration by the presentation of the registry return card
postmarked November 13, a certification by the Acting Postmaster of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> as to the mailing of registered letter No. 17713 on <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="11">Novem­ber 4, 1968</st1:date>, and the affidavit
of Manuel B. <span class="SpellE">Busico</span> who posted the mail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Estrada's counsel orally moved for the
immediate resolution of the pending incidents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The judge was ready to rule on the motions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo
demurred, pleaded that his memorandum and opposition to the omnibus motion be
first considered; that in the event of an adverse resolution he be allowed at
least five (5) days from receipt to enable him to procure extraordinary relief
from the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge
thereupon declared that he would promulgate the resolution in open court on <st1:date year="1968" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1968</st1:date>, a Saturday.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1968</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo filed a cautionary notice of appeal,
manifesting that he would appeal to the Court of Appeals in the event his
motion for reconsideration be thwarted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Admittedly, however, he withdrew the cautionary notice of appeal
later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This withdrawal was granted by
the court on <st1:date year="1968" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1968</st1:date>,
upon <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo's urgent motion, the judge
calendared the promulgation of the resolution for <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="11">Monday, November 25, 1968</st1:date>, at <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30 a.m.</st1:time></p>

<p class="BODY">Allegedly informed that resolution on his reconsideration motion
would be adverse to him, <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo's counsel
sought the judge in the morning of <st1:date year="1968" day="23" month="11">November
 23, 1968</st1:date>, asked the latter to give him a copy of the order before
the close of office hours on that day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The judge declined, instead stated that the order would be read and
released in open court the following <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="11">Monday,
 November 25, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A hectic day, November 25, began at <st1:time minute="30" hour="7">7:30
 a.m.</st1:time> when <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo's counsel saw the
judge to ask for a copy of the order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The judge told him to wait until the order shall have been read in open
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An hour later, <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30 a.m.</st1:time>, when the case was called, <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo's counsel requested that the case be called
again at <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 a.m.</st1:time> purportedly on
the ground that he would first ask for the postponement of another case in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court granted the request.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 a.m.</st1:time>,
the disputed order was read and promulgated in open court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties secured their copies of the order
at <st1:time minute="15" hour="10">10:15 a.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the order reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"IN
VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING CON­SIDERATIONS, it is the opinion of the Court that
the reconsideration of its decision dated <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1968</st1:date> is not in order as the same had already
become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Then and there, <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo's counsel
orally moved to reconsider.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge
after hearing the arguments of the parties denied the motion.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo's counsel was prepared to meet this
contingency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He drew from his pocket and
exhibited to the judge a copy of the Court of Appeals' restraining order.</p>

<p class="BODY">It developed that some two hours earlier, at <st1:time minute="4" hour="8">8:04 a.m.</st1:time> on November 25, <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.
Domingo's counsel lodged with the Court of Appeals a three-pronged double
spaced 15-page petition with Annexes A to J for certiorari, prohibition and
mandamus with preliminary injunction.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Counsel secured in the appellate court in about an hour's time a full-page
single spaced typewritten summons and a one-and-a-half page single spaced
temporary restraining order enjoining the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> "from executing any order and/or writ of
execution x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> in Election
Case No. 10545" and from declaring the decision in said case "final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, with equal dispatch, Estrada tried to fend
off <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo's move when he filed with the Court
of Appeals, although belatedly, at <st1:time minute="43" hour="10">10:43 a.m.</st1:time>,
a 5-page opposition to the petition for certiorari, prohibition and mandamus
attaching thereto his oath of office.</p>

<p class="BODY">At <st1:time minute="52" hour="10">10:52 a.m.</st1:time> before
the trial court adjourned, a bailiff of the Court of Appeals served on then
Judge Andres Reyes, presiding over the trial court, the summons and restraining
order; and at <st1:time minute="50" hour="11">11:50 a.m.</st1:time> likewise served
the summons and restraining order upon Estrada.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, respondent Court of Appeals rendered the disputed
decision of <st1:date year="1969" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1969</st1:date>,
mentioned at the start of this opinion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Reconsideration thereof was denied by said court, again voting three to
two, on <st1:date year="1969" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1969</st1:date>.</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The forefront
question to draw our attention is the correctness of the temporary restraining
order of <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1968</st1:date>
issued ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> by the Court of Appeals promptly upon
the filing therein of the certiorari, prohibition and mandamus petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The directive in that restraining order is
that respondents before the Court of Appeals refrain "from executing any
order and/or writ of execution issued by respondent Judge declaring the
decision in Election Case No. 10545 of the CFI-<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, from removing petitioner from
his office as municipal mayor of San Juan, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
from installing respondent Joseph <span class="SpellE">Ejercito</span> Estrada in
peti­tioner's place as said mayor, and from otherwise molesting, disturbing
petitioner in, or excluding him from, his lawful exercise and performance of
his duties, rights and prerogatives as municipal mayor, until further orders
from this Court." Well to remember is that the restraining order was
issued even before the trial court could release the very order complained of
in the petition.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The averments in <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo's
petition before the Court of Appeals upon which the restraining order was
issued are:</p>

<blockquote>"17.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- That while
petitioner has been unable to secure an official copy of the resolution of
respondent Judge (for reasons hereinafter stated) he has been reliably informed
(and because of the afore-mentioned circumstances and the persistent reports
circulated by followers of respondent 'Estrada’ that he (Estrada) will 'sit as
Mayor on Monday', has reason to believe) that at the hearing at 8:30 o'clock
this morning (Nov. 25), the respondent Judge will <u>in</u> <u>open</u> <u>court</u>
(1) dis­regard or strike out petitioner's motion for reconsideration as prayed
for by respondent 'Estrada' on the ground that the Election Code does not
provide for a motion for reconsideration but only for appeal and that there was
no proof of service of the motion, both of which are incorrect; (2) declare as
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> his decision ousting petitioner
as Municipal Mayor of San Juan and installing respondent Estrada in
petitioner's stead; (3) order the execution or enforcement of said decision
with the petitioner considered notified of said order in open court (as in a
criminal case) and to abide by the same (while respondent 'Estrada' takes his
'oath' as mayor immediately if not also 'in open court'); and thereby deprive
petitioner of any opportunity to contest the said order and execution in the
appellate courts before they are carried out by the respondents over his objection.</blockquote>

<blockquote>18.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- That the aforesaid
actuations of respondent Judge have given rise to serious anxiety and great
tension among the parties and their followers, as well as among the people of
San Juan, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and, as this petition is being filed
by petitioner, the respondent 'Joseph <span class="SpellE">Ejercito</span>
Estrada' and his men, many of whom are armed, are reported to be poised to
forcibly execute the order to be issued by respondent Judge this morning while
the petitioner's men, despite his instructions and advice to them to keep the
peace and to ignore the taunts and challenges hurled at them by respondent
'Estrada' and his men, may not be able to restrain themselves if unduly
provoked or harmed, and unless a restraining order or writ of preliminary
injunction is issued by this Honorable Court against the respondents, their
employees, agents, men and representatives, violence and disorder, and possibly
bloodshed, are likely to break out in the municipality of San Juan, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> to the consequent injury not only of the parties and
their men, but also of other people, and the petitioner will be forcibly and
unlawfully removed from his office as mayor without due process of law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>19.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- That in spite of
petitioner's efforts to secure a copy of the respondent judge's resolution up
to the close of office hours last Saturday, he has been unable to do so, he
being informed that the said Order would be read in open court this morning and
any written order would be released only thereafter; hence, the inability of
petitioner to attach a copy of said resolution to this Petition which, because
of the extraordinary circumstances above cited, has to be filed even before
receipt of said copy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner,
however, shall file said copy by way of supplemental pleading immediately upon
receipt thereof this morning if the same is reduced to writing by respondent
Judge.</blockquote>

<blockquote>20.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- That by the
foregoing acts the disregard or striking out of petitioner's motion for
reconsideration of his decision without just and legal ground, the denial of
petitioner's remedy of appeal from said decision as provided by law, and the
execution of the said decision although the same is not yet final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> (by reason of petitioner's motion for
reconsideration and also the cautionary notice of appeal), and the opportunity
given to respondent 'Joseph <span class="SpellE">Ejercito</span> Estrada' and his
men to forcibly and unlawfully remove petitioner from his office as mayor
immediately without giving peti­tioner adequate opportunity to seek relief from
the appellate courts -- the respondent Judge has unlawfully neglected the
performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting
from his office as Judge, unlawfully excludes the petitioner from enjoyment or
exercise of his legal right to move for the reconsideration of respondent
Judge's decision and to appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, and
likewise unlawfully sanctions the petitioner's removal from his lawful office
without due process of law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We take a grave view of the averments in <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.
Domingo's petition before the Court of Appeals just transcribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We particularly note his statement that later
on that day, November 25, the judge in open court would disregard or strike out
petitioner's (<span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo's) motion for
reconsideration, declare final his decision, and order the execution or
enforcement thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of these upon
the allegation that <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo had "been
reliably informed" of the contents of the trial court's yet unreleased
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is disturbing is that the
information thus obtained constitutes <u>the</u> <u>substance</u> of the lower
court's resolution eventually promulgated on that day, November 25.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whatever merit may be accorded to the averments in the petition
before the Court of Appeals aforesaid, our deepening concern for public policy
will prevent us from lending support to the appellate court's restraining
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, the information was secured
upon a betrayal of trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not by the
trial judge; he had consistently refused to divulge the contents of the
resolution prior to its promulgation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only logical conclusion is that the information must have been given
by those closely associated with the judge in the discharge of his official
duties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Decisions or orders of courts must be kept inviolate until they
shall have been promulgated or released.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Officials and employees of the courthouse must be strictly enjoined
against giving any information in advance as to what will be done by the
judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No opportunity should be afforded
the unscrupulous litigants, their lawyers, friends, relatives, sympathizers or
those with power or influence to go to court employees and by insidious means
and even bribery acquire advance information on the desired judgment or order
of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Employ­ees should be made
to understand that they are not to succumb to greed, to temptations for
advancement in public service, that cause them to destroy the integrity of
court proceedings or court records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
relaxation of this rule would embolden officials and employees of the courts to
seek out interested parties in a case, give them the so-called "inside
information" on the decision or order, or furnish them with copy of an
unreleased decision or order, or hide, destroy or steal court records, or hold <span class="SpellE">unserved</span> a decision or resolution to promote a party's
cause - thereby to earn a quick peso.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Some such occurrence as has happened in this case should be stamped
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A contrary proposition would breed
graft and corruption and erode confidence in the administration of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the information procured is the "fruit of the
poisonous tree"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the betrayal of trust - private respondent should not be allowed to benefit by
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Information immorally extracted
cannot be dignified with the imprimatur of courts of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason alone, we hold that there was
abuse of discretion on the part of the Court of Appeals in granting the
restraining order on the basis of the allegations rooted on what <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo calls "reliable information".</p>

<p class="BODY">But herein respondent <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo
avers that petitioner Estrada and his men, many of whom were armed, were
reportedly poised to forcibly execute the order enforcing the judgment as yet
to be issued in the morning of November 25.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said respondent told the Court of Appeals that a restraining order was a
necessity to forestall impending bloodshed because his men, in the words of his
petition before the appellate court, "despite his instructions and advice
to them to keep the peace and to ignore the taunts and challenges hurled at
them by respondent 'Estrada' and his men, may not be able to restrain
themselves if unduly provoked or harmed."</p>

<p class="BODY">This is an imagined wrong.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is so easy to conjure some such situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rumors may be blown into hysteria.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, the trial judge is not a party to
this alleged scheme.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor will he consent,
we are sure, to be a party to such dastardly acts.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is because of this that courts should be careful, indeed very
cautious, in giving in to averments such as are heretofore recited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Courts should be on guard against litigants
who swell up a picture into an alarming situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not hesitate to say that <u>at</u> <u>the</u>
<u>time</u> <u>the</u> <u>petition</u> (lodged in the Court of Appeals <u>as</u>
<u>early</u> <u>as</u> <u>8:04</u> <u>a.m</u>.) was being thought of, framed in
the minds of the lawyers and eventually typewritten, there was no such grave
problem of threatening armed clashes or bloodshed as would call for the remedy
of a restraining order from the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If tension such as was depicted by <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo existed, it would not have escaped notice of
the trial judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was at the vortex of
the alleged ominous events.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Representations then could have been made to him in view of the alleged
turbulence of the atmosphere either to do away with the oral promulgation of
the resolution altogether, or <u>after</u> the promulgation thereof, to have
its enforcement delayed so that appropriate relief may be had in the appellate
courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it is, that the averment in
the Court of Appeals' petition that the judge would purportedly refuse to
afford respondent <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo opportunity to seek
aid from the appellate courts is premature and at best pure conjecture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, if it were really true that there was
the gathering momentum leading to violence, we believe that guardians of the
law should likewise have known of the same - <u>which</u> <u>is</u> <u>not</u> <u>even</u>
<u>suggested</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>record</u> - and readied themselves to
forestall armed clashes.</p>

<p class="BODY">It thus results that there is a remedy elsewhere other than in
the form of a premature restraining order from the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, if the judge would declare his decision final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, as he later on did, and the forces of respondent
<span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo would resist petitioner Estrada's
takeover, such a resistance would certainly be patently illegal and indeed even
criminal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, impending bloodshed
can never be a valid ground to restrain a lawful assumption of office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What will happen to the rule of law?</p>

<p class="BODY">It is in the context heretofore recited that we hold that the
Court of Appeals committed a grave abuse of discretion in issuing ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> the restraining order here complained of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, we strike down the said
restraining order.</p>

<p class="BODY">The statutory scheme clearly mapped out in the Revised Election
Code is that proceedings in election protests are special and expeditious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The periods for filing pleadings are
short.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Trials are swift.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Decisions in municipal election contests are
to be handed down in six months after the protest is presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The time to file a notice of appeal is cut
short to five days from notice of the deci­sion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appeal is to be decided within three months
after the case is filed with the clerk of the court to which appeal is
taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Preferential disposition of
election contests except as to habeas corpus proceedings is set forth in the

The proceedings should not be encumbered by delays.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of these are because the term of elective

left long under cloud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Efficiency of
public administration should not be impaired.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is thus understandable that pitfalls which may retard the determination

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The thrust of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo's petition before the Court of Appeals is that
therein respondent Judge Andres Reyes did not resolve his motion for
reconsideration on the merits; that accordingly mandamus should issue to compel
him so to do; and that in the event the resolution be adverse, the judge be
directed to give due course to his cautionary notice of appeal.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The majority decision of the Court of Appeals gave its nod to the
posture so taken and directed the judge "to act upon and resolve
petitioner's [private respondent's] motion for reconsideration of the decision
in said case on the merits."</p>

<p class="BODY">A reading of the November 25 order of Judge Andres Reyes brings
about the salient points thereof, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:</p>

<blockquote>"To begin with, the Court does not believe that the filing of
a motion for reconsideration in an elec­tion case is in order x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>And even granting for the sake of argument that the aggrieved party
can file a motion for reconsideration, the instant motion filed by <span class="SpellE">Braulio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo is <u>pro</u>
<u>forma</u> and therefore, did not suspend the running of the period of
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u>
because the said motion for reconsideration was but a repetition of the
contents of the memorandum filed by the said <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>
and in a small way, a refutation of a portion of the memorandum filed by the
protestant, which the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> could have refuted by
filing a reply memorandum before the case was submitted for decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To make it short, the motion for
reconsideration merely makes reference to the contents of the memorandum filed
by both parties which had already been considered by the Court before rendering
its decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Arnaldo</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>, 87 Phil. 379).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Not only this, even granting for the sake of argument again, that
the instant motion for reconsideration was not <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u>, still
the Court believes that the filing of the said motion was fatally defective,
and such being so, the motion is but a mere scrap of paper which did not stop
the running of the period for appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The motion lacked the required affidavit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The affidavit is a very important requirement
considering the fact that a registry receipt does not show the nature of the
contents of the letter that has been mailed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The deficiency was not cured when the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> <span class="SpellE">Braulio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo submitted
the affidavit of a certain Manuel <span class="SpellE">Busico</span> which is
dated <st1:date year="1968" day="13" month="11">November 13, 1968</st1:date>,
or four (4) days after the date when said motion was set for hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The failure therefore of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> to attach the affidavit to the motion was fatal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>And not only this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
failure of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> to comply with the
requirements of Section 2, Rule 37, Section 4, Rule 15 and Section 8, Rule 13 x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> is like­wise
fatal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A copy of the motion for
reconsideration was not served on the protestant three (3) days before the date
set for hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that
the protestant received the copy of the motion for reconsideration of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> only on <st1:date year="1968" day="13" month="11">November
 13, 1968</st1:date> or four (4) days after the said motion was set for hearing
by the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> on <st1:date year="1968" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1968</st1:date>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nothing more forcefully downgrades the charge that the judge did
not fully resolve the motion for reconsideration than the recitals in the order
just quoted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, Section 12, Article
VIII, Constitution, and Section 1, Rule 36, Rules of Court which require
express findings of fact in a decision, both have no application to the
questioned order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here involved is not a
decision on the merits but a mere order upon a motion to reconsider.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge could simply dish out a routine
capsule-form order "Denied for lack of merit" or "Motion for
reconsideration denied".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet,
that kind of order would serve to immunize the judge against an unlawful
neglect-of-duty charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the judge
did not merely content himself with a perfunctory order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He wrote a reasoned out five-page resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is it correct to tag the judge's order with failure to consider
the motion for reconsideration on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Meaning should be attached to the judge's statement that the motion for
reconsideration is <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u> because the same is "but a
repetition of the con­tents of the memorandum filed by the said <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> and in a small way, a refutation of a portion of
the memorandum filed by the pro­testant, which the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
could have refuted by filing a reply memo­randum before the case was submitted
for decision." The judge added that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"To make it short, the motion for reconsideration merely makes
reference to the contents of the memorandum filed by both parties which had
already been considered by the Court before rendering its decision."
Implicit in these statements is that the judge waded through private
respondent's motion for reconsideration, read and examined the merits of the
arguments therein, compared them with those set forth in private respondent's
memorandum and then came to the conclusion that the arguments advanced would
not change the result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had the judge found
in that motion for reconsideration some argument of weight or substance which
would bring about a conclusion different from that reached in his decision,
surely enough, he would have spelled it out and written it in an amended
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, the presumption is that a
judge performs his duty to the best of his knowledge and ability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the judge did not change his decision,
then under the circumstances his November 25 order amounted to a denial of the
motion for reconsideration on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And this is quite clear from the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part thereof which stated that the order was "IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING
CONSIDERATIONS".</p>

<p class="BODY">We thus find ourselves unable to go along with the Court of
Appeals' insistence that the judge's statement that the motion was <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u>
is not to be taken as a resolution of the motion on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reasons the appellate court gave
are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>first</u>, such <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u>
finding "merely supported [<u>i</u>.<u>e</u>., for the sake of argument]
the main thesis x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> that
the decision 'had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>'";
and <u>second</u>, it is inconsistent for the judge "to say that the
remedy of reconsideration is not available <u>and</u> at the same time pass
upon it [the motion] on the merits." Courts at times do not hesitate to
avail of all grounds to throw out a motion or pleading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not uncommon to read in decisions or
orders some such statement as this:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Viewed from any angle, the petition in this case should be dismissed."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">For these reasons, it is difficult to hew to the Court of
Appeals' view that the judge so unlawfully neglected his duty to rule on the
merits of the motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It bears repeating that the judge did more than what was expected; that
instead of mechanically writing "Denied for lack of merit", he
examined the arguments set forth in said motion and explained as cogently as he
could why it should not be granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
order meets the rigid standards expected of his judicial position.</p>

<p class="BODY">And more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
resolution of a motion for reconsideration, judges wield sound discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> of the Court of Appeals, in his dissent to
the resolution denying reconsideration, aptly observed, "[h]<span class="SpellE">ow</span> he was going to go about it, or upon what ground or
grounds, is of little moment." The fact is that the judge's duty under the
premises is to grant or deny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did
deny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is not remiss in his duty.</p>

<p class="BODY">We, accordingly, hold that the trial court's order of <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1968</st1:date> properly ruled on
private respondent's motion for reconsideration.</p>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The conclusion just
reached brings us to the next question:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Did private respondent's motion for reconsideration arrest the five-day
period for appeal set forth in Section 178 of the Revised Election Code?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To repeat, the motion for reconsideration of the decision was based
on four grounds, namely, the court erred (1) in reviewing and annulling the
decisions of the other branches of the same Court of First instance in
exclusion cases; (2) in rejecting the so-called "<span class="SpellE">Boyong</span>"
and "Dr. <span class="SpellE">Boyong</span>" votes; (3) in rejecting <span class="SpellE">protestee's</span> evidence on the tampering of ballots after
revision; and (4) in appreciating certain ballots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And we have said that the lower court in
rejecting this motion ruled that it was <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u> in that the
matters therein discussed "had already been considered by the Court before
rendering its decision." There is much to the trial judge's statement just
quoted.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the first ground which refers to the decision of the other
branches of the Court of First Instance in exclusion cases, it is clear from
the decision that this matter had already been brought to the attention of the
trial judge before the decision was rendered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said the trial judge:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>According</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>protestee</u></span>,
659 out of 1,508 excluded voters were able to vote, and 285 of them voted for
Estrada, 95 for <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo, and 279 for <span class="SpellE">lbuna</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was
determined by a matching conducted by a witness for the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>
by the name of Major <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> Hernandez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To represent the facts clearer, the results
of this matching are tabulated and appears on page 8 of <span class="SpellE"><u>Protestee's</u></span>
<u>memorandum</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>The</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>protestee</u></span> <u>vigorously</u>
<u>claims</u> that the ballots cast by these excluded voters should be deducted
from the number of votes credited to Estrada, <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.
Domingo, and <span class="SpellE">Ibuna</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the so-called "<span class="SpellE">Boyong</span>" and
"Dr. <span class="SpellE">Boyong</span>" votes, there is the admission
on the part of counsel for <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo (during the
course of oral arguments before the trial judge on November 25, 1968 in support
of his verbal motion to reconsider the denial of his motion for reconsideration
of the decision) that "we raised this question in our memorandum because
of the exception laid down in the case of <span class="SpellE">Abrea</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Lloren</span> but also on the principle of <u>idem</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>sonans</u></span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the alleged tampered ballots, the trial judge, on pages 56 and
57 of the decision, explained quite in detail how, after this case had been
submitted for decision, the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> (respondent <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo), on <st1:date year="1968" day="27" month="8">August
 27, 1968</st1:date>, moved to reopen the case alleging evidence to show that
said ballots were tampered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the 264
ballots, respondent <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo only claims 31 ballots
stating:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"By our count, a total of <u>31</u>
ballots wherein the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> was voted for Mayor
were rejected by the Court as marked ballots because of such 'marks' as '3
stars', swastika figures, drawings of bottles of beer and the word '<span class="SpellE">toma</span>’, likeness of human face, carbon traces, 'Jr. 007',
‘xxx’ below OFFICIAL BALLOT, etc. appearing thereon." On the question of
whether these 31 ballots should be counted for <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.
Domingo, his counsel admitted that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"<u>We</u> <u>cited</u> <u>the</u> <u>arguments</u> <u>and</u> <u>the</u>
<u>law applicable</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We learned this
appreciation only upon receipt of the decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We could not have anticipated it because <u>we</u> <u>have</u> <u>vigorously</u>
<u>maintained</u> that the alleged 'marks' there were not placed by the voters
themselves but by other persons without their consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How then could our motion be pro-forma?"<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo in his motion for
reconsideration would want the trial court to read the memorandum of objections
filed by protestant (petitioner Estrada) to convince said court that its ruling
on this point was wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this
memorandum of objections had already been considered by the trial court when it
said, on page 57 of its decision:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Anyone who tampers these ballots must also be familiar with the
memorandum of objections filed by the protestant as early as May, 1968 in order
to harmonize the written objections with the physical appearance of the 264
ballots."</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor will the appreciation of 56 ballots given as the fourth and
last ground of the motion for reconsideration be of any importance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question of appreciation of ballots in
election protests comes up after those ballots have been challenged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are separated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties are heard on their reasons pro
and con.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only thereafter does the judge
weigh the relative value of the reasons given by one party or the other.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is quite apparent then that the questions raised in the motion
for reconsideration have already been considered by the trial judge before the
decision of the case on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is an election protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Public policy
demands that it be instituted and finished with utmost promptitude.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was indeed an utter waste of time for
private respondent to have sought reconsideration upon questions which, after
all, could have been very well decided by the appellate court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We, accordingly, rule that where in an <u>election</u> <u>protest</u>
a motion for reconsideration of the decision on the merits presents questions
which <u>have</u> <u>already</u> <u>been</u> <u>considered</u> by the court
prior to or upon the promulgation of such decision, said motion for reconsideration
is <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u> and does not suspend the running of the period for
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This rule, we are confident,
helps remove from the reach of proclamation grabbers a dilatory device conveniently
used by them to keep them in office and to frustrate the victors from taking
the seats that are justly theirs.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we look back at the facts, we discern a pattern of delay on
the part of private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Recited
by petitioner Estrada are the following which took place in the trial
court:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) Motion to reduce deposit from
P7,500 to P4,000 dated February 12, 1968;<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>

February 27, 1968;<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
(6) Motion to conduct matching tests with respect to Precinct Nos. 8, 72 and 77
dated June 5, 1968;<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
and (7) Petition to <u>reopen</u> the case to adduce evidence of tampering
dated August 26, 1968.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
This last motion was granted by the judge despite the fact that the tampering,
on which evidence was to be adduced, was already previously brought to his
attention.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, even private respondent's conduct after the trial court's
decision is not arguably insulated from the charge of delaying tactics.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was on the last day of the statutory
period fixed for appealing the main decision - <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1968</st1:date> - that private re­spondent's motion for
reconsideration was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And then,
instead of serving a copy thereof on petitioner personally, as had at times
been done before admittedly with previous pleadings,<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
service on petitioner was made by registered special delivery mail, with notice
that the incident would be heard on the following Saturday, November 9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copy of the motion and the notice of hearing
sent by mail did not reach petitioner on time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner actually received the mailed matter on November 13, four days
after the motion for reconsideration was set for hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was, of course, to be expected from the
experience people have with our postal system.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondent, we are sure, knew this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, service was effected thru the mails,
private respondent won a week's delay - the judge reset the hearing on the
motion for reconsideration on November 16.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 16, when the judge announced his readiness to rule on
the motion, we find private respondent objecting, asking that his memorandum
and opposition to petitioner's omnibus motion be first considered and suing for
time to procure extraordinary relief from the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent won another week's
delay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge declared that he would
promulgate the resolution in open court on November 23, the next Saturday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, however, private respondent
made another move to postpone the promulgation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The judge again reset the same on Monday, November 25.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 25 at <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30 a.m.</st1:time>,
private respondent's counsel successfully obtained a one-and-a-half hour delay
upon the ground that he had to postpone another case in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It turned out that, meanwhile, private
respondent's lawyers were frantically attempting to secure a restraining order
from the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They filed a
special civil action with the said appellate court at <st1:time minute="4" hour="8">8:04 a.m.</st1:time> that same morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When private respondent received a copy of
the judge's order disposing of their motion for reconsideration at <st1:time minute="15" hour="10">10:15 a.m.</st1:time>, and when the judge denied private
re­spondent's oral motion for reconsideration thereof, the latter was
ready.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent's counsel came
out with the restraining order from the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consider also the time consumed by the present proceedings in the
Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent's
petition was filed on <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="11">November 25,
 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was finally
resolved only on <st1:date year="1969" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, upon the excuse that his motion for
reconsideration of the decision was not ruled upon on the merits, private
respondent would want the appellate court to command the trial judge first to
rule on the said motion and thereafter give due course to his appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One may well imagine the baneful effects of
some such procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had his petition
prospered, it is not unlikely that by the time the case is finally decided, the
Pyrrhic victory which courts abhor would again be repeated.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be emphasized that the questions raised in the motion for
reconsideration could very well be disposed of, and with finality, on
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the realities of political
life, it is unreasonable to assume that whatever be the resolution on the
motion for reconsideration, the defeated party would take that resolution hands
down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not to be expected that
respondent <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo, who is presently sitting as
Mayor, would not appeal from the decision adverse to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">If any meaning is to be attached to the events in the lower
courts, it is that private respondent has, in ingeniously chiseled language, so
skillfully taken advantage of judicial procedure to stave off the day of
reckoning when petitioner would replace him as Mayor of San Juan, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pattern
of delay is patent.</p>

<p class="BODY">A principle already forged by this Court is that a motion for
reconsideration which has no other purpose than to gain time is <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u>
and does not stop the period of appeal from slipping away.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
It is in recognition of this doctrine that we hold that where a motion for
reconsideration in an election case is taken advantage of for purposes of delay
to the prejudice of the adverse party or where such motion forms part of a
matrix of delay, that motion does not stop the running of the five-day period
for appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing discussions pave the way for an examination of the
remedies, if any, available to private respondent.</p>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mandamus will not
issue to compel the trial judge to decide private respondent's motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That motion for
reconsideration, we say again, had been decided on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And even on the assumption that the court did
not so decide, mandamus will not issue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For, the court did decide; it denied the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps in a way not satisfactory to private
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But then, mandamus is no
remedy to control the exercise by the court of its discretion.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Nor will it avail to compel him to resolve an incident in a particular way.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Reason for this is that the law concedes to judges the right to decide
questions according to their own judgment and understanding of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the court's resolution is wrong, correctible
it is by <u>appeal</u>, not mandamus.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As unavailing is mandamus to compel the judge to approve his
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent has not
appealed from the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cannot
rely on the cautionary notice of appeal which he has withdrawn.</p>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor will the writs of
certiorari and prohibition issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
function is to keep an inferior court within the bounds of its jurisdiction or
to prevent it from committing such a grave abuse of discretion amounting to
excess of jurisdiction.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
Admittedly, the trial court had jurisdiction over the election case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The questioned order of <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1968</st1:date> was issued in the proper
exercise of such jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Granting
or denying a motion for reconsideration indeed involves an exercise of discretion.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
As was pointed out in <span class="SpellE"><u>Bustos</u></span> <u>vs.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Moir</u></span>, 35 Phil. 415, 417, an election case:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is absurd to claim that a court has
no jurisdiction to do the very thing which the law authorizes it to do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere fact that it decides the question
wrong is x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> utterly
immaterial to the question of its jurisdiction." And, discretion has not
been abused.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo's motion for
reconsideration did not stop the running of the five-day period for
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No appeal has been taken from
the judgment dislodging said respondent from his seat as Mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, that judgment has become final.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, as adverted to earlier in this opinion, the trial court
- upon the allegations set forth in paragraphs 17 to 20 of private respondent's
petition before the Court of Appeals based on alleged "reliable
information" - may not be restrained by the latter court from enforcing
the order of November 25, 1968 denying the motion for the reconsideration of
its main decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have also said
that the trial court has correctly denied said motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It follows then that neither certiorari nor
prohibition will issue against the trial judge to stop him from proceeding with
the execution of his judgment.</p>

<blockquote>7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In fact, no
extraordinary writ may at all issue in the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, a rule that has definitely crystallized
because of frequent reiteration is that extraordinary remedies - such as mandamus,
certiorari and prohibition - may not be sought if there is another remedy as
adequate and speedy.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
We have no doubt that an <u>appeal</u> within the statutory period from the
judgment rendered on <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1968</st1:date>
in this election case is as adequate and as speedy as any special civil
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Faster it could be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, the law commands that election contest
appeals "shall be decided within three months after the filing of the case
in the office of the clerk of the court to which the appeal has been
taken."<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
This is fortified by another statutory precept which directs the trial and
appellate courts to "give preference to election contests over all other
cases, except those of <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>" and to "hear and
decide them without delay, within the time limits fixed by law, whether they
are holding regular sessions or not."<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
But appeal, we have heretofore stated, is lost.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No remedy is left.</blockquote>

<blockquote>8.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a last ditch
attempt to keep this case alive, respondent <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.
Domingo now comes to this Court with the plea "that in the remote
possibility that his petition" in the Court of Appeals "for any
reason be denied, the same be considered or treated as an appeal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Reasons there are why this cannot be done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>First</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the time the petition before the Court of Appeals was filed, the
judgment of the trial court was already final.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Second</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said respondent
cannot now invoke this Court's power to help him retrieve his right to appeal
which he has deliberately discarded in favor of a special civil action - which,
mildly put, has served no purpose other than to delay these proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has already eaten up almost one-half of
the term of office that the electorate, to all appearances, had not entrusted
to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cannot gamble with one court
proceeding, and failing in this, resort to another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, resorting piecemeal to one remedy
after another could be an instrument of oppression against the adversary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Third</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo's petition before the
Court of Appeals is bereft of any allegation indicative of any intention of his
to appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it was meant
to procure a decision remanding the case to the court below for further
proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">These are considerations which deter us from heeding <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo's plea that the special civil action in the
Court of Appeals be treated as an appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In those cases where this Court considered an appeal as a special civil
action or vice-versa, there was reason <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to avoid delay and to thwart the commission
of injustice.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
But for this Court to grant said respondent <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.
Domingo's plea, delay instead of being avoided would be encouraged; justice
instead of being advanced, denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
equitable consideration there is which would give some semblance of authority
to consider the special civil action as an appeal, He lost his remedy of
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not through fraud, accident,
mistake, or excusable negligence,<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
or through the court's own fault.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
If negligence or mistake there was, we are certain it was not excusable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The short of it is that private respondent
opted to travel the road of extraordinary remedies, not with the intention of
having the case brought up for appellate review on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clear was his aim to have the present
questions decided first and, if adversely resolved against him, to appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To legitimize such maneuvers is to run smack
against the letter and spirit of the election law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Temporizing with delay in election cases is
repugnant to our sense of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
our duty to hold that appeal as a remedy has been totally fore­closed to
respondent <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo.</p>

<p class="BODY">The merits of the election protest are not before us in these
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as this decision will
have the effect of affirming the finality of the judgment of the trial court

<p class="2Q">'IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the Court hereby annuls and sets
aside the proclamation of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Braulio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo end hereby

(3) in rejecting <span class="SpellE">protestee's</span> (private respondent's)
evidence on the tam­pering of ballots after revision; and (4) in appreciating

had received notice of the motion for reconsideration of <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1968</st1:date>, the hearing thereof was reset
for <st1:date year="1968" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1968</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30 a.m.</st1:time></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the afternoon of November 9, 1968 Estrada, who got wind of
what took place in the trial court that morning, filed an 'omnibus motion'
alleging that <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo's motion for
reconsideration was not legally sanctioned, flimsy and frivolous, a mere scrap
of paper, and intended for delay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
prayed that that motion be stricken out and that the judgment be immediately
executed as it had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The omnibus motion he set for hearing on <st1:date year="1968" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1968</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30 a.m.</st1:time></blockquote>

opposition to the omnibus motion be first considered; that in the event of an
adverse resolution he, be allow­ed at least five (5) days from receipt to
enable him to procure extraordinary relief from the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge thereupon declared that he would <span style="">promulgate the resolution in open court on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="23" month="11"><span style="">November

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the foregoing, the first question that arises is
whether in election contests a Court of First Instance has the authority to
consider and resolve a motion for reconsideration or new trial,</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Arnedo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Llorente</span>
et al., 18 Phil. 257 this Court an­swered the above question categorically in
the negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After an extensive
discussion of whether, in the light of the spirit <span style="">and purpose of the laws controlling elections at that time, Section 145
<span style="">of the Code of Civil Procedure </span>was
applicable to election contests, this Court finally said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"This line of reasoning might be extended further, but we deem
it unnecessary, <span style="">and </span>think that what has been said justifies us in holding in
favor of <span class="GramE">petitioners</span> contention that Courts of First
Instance have no jurisdiction to vacate <span style="">final
judgments entered by them </span><span style="">determining
</span><span style="">election contests had under the
provisions of section 27 of Act No. 1582."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The following vital pronouncement of the Court in Navarro vs. <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span> (23 Phil. 625) inferentially but nonethe­less
clearly supports its view as set forth in <span class="SpellE">Arnedo-Llorente</span>:</p>

<blockquote>"We have already decided in a cause not yet published that the
Election Law <span style="">is </span>a special law
providing within itself a complete procedure highly special in its nature by
which the protest may be carried on; and that it must be strictly
followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statute requires that a
protest shall be inaugurated by motion upon notice to all of the candidates
receiving votes for that parti­cular office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That requirement must be literally followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was evidently the purpose of the
Legislature to bring into the proceeding <span style="">every
person </span>who was interested in the result of the election and to give him
an opportunity to be present at the hearing of the protest and to be
heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What that purpose was, <span style="">we do not now stop to inquire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is </span>sufficient for us that the
Legislature has so required."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While the fact that the present Revised Election Code expressly
provides for an <u>appeal</u> from the decision of a Court of First Instance in
election cases but is completely silent on the question of whether or not the
defeated party has the right to file a motion for reconsideration or new trial
may indicate, to a certain extent, continued adherence to the doctrine laid
down in <span class="SpellE">Arnedo-Llorente</span>, We have to admit that said
doctrine has been abandoned, for in <span class="SpellE">Calañgi</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Jhocson</span> (G. R. No. 16108, not reported) and in <span class="SpellE">Palomata</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Villa­real</span> (40 Phil.
641) We held that the remedy by motion for reconsideration or new trial
provided for in Section 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure (now Section 3, Rule
37, Rules of Court) is available to the defeated party in election con­tests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it being the rule in this
jurisdiction that the Court of First Instance who, either in an action or a
special proceeding, rendered a decision, may, before said decision has become <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, modify or reverse it <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> if, in its opinion, it had committed
errors of fact or law justifying such modification or reversal, We can think of
no reason sufficiently strong to deny said Court the same authority when a
party to the case calls <span style="">its attention -
by motion - to substantial errors committed by it in rendering its
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This notwithstanding, our
pronouncement in Navarro vs. <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span> (supra)
"that the Election Law is a special law providing within itself a complete
procedure highly special in its nature by which the protest may be carried on,
and <u>that </u></span><u><span style="">it must be strictly followed</span></u><span style="">" </span><span style="">(23 Phil. p. 626, underline supplied) still holds true and as
authoritative as ever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For the purpose of this concurring opinion, there­fore, the
undersigned assumes that respondent <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo had
the right to file, and the Court of First Instance presided by petitioner Judge
Reyes had the right to con­sider and resolve the motion for reconsideration
filed by the former.</p>

<p class="BODY">But was said motion for reconsideration filed in accordance with
the Rules of Court?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pertinent and de­cisive
of this question is Section 10, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court which provides
that if service of a pleading is made by registered mail, proof of service
thereof shall be made by attaching to it the corresponding registry receipt and
by means of an affidavit of the person mailing contain­ing a statement of the
facts showing compliance with Section 5 of the same Rule. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Two different things, therefore, are required
by the Rule:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the registry receipt to
be attached to the original of the motion for reconsideration filed with the
Office of the Clerk of Court, and (2) an affidavit certifying, upon personal
knowledge, that a copy of the motion was sent by registered mail to the adverse
party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not denied is the fact that
respondent <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo's motion for reconsideration
complied only with the first re­quirement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It did not comply with the second.</p>

<p class="BODY">The need for the affidavit of service can not be over­emphasized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The registry receipt proves nothing more than
that a <span class="GramE">letter,</span> document or pleading has been sent
through the mails.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not prove at
all the nature and purpose of its contents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The required affidavit of service is precisely intended to do this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not a mere "technica­lity";
but even if it were, <span class="GramE">We</span> say with Navarro vs. <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span> (supra):<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"That requirement (service of notice to all of the candidates
receiving votes for the particular office under protest) <u>must be literally
followed</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was evidently the
purpose of the Legislature to bring into the proceeding every person who was
interested in the result of the <span style="">election
and to give him an opportunity to be present at the hearing of the protest and
to be heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What that purpose was, we
do not now stop to inquire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It <span style="">is </span>sufficient for us that the
Legislature so required</u>." (23 Phil. 626; Under­lines supplied).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As it has been held that without proof of service, <u>as required
by the Rules</u>, a motion is nothing but a scrap of paper which the Clerk of
Court would even be justified in not receiving for filing (Tan vs. <span class="SpellE">Dimayuga</span>, et al., L-15241, July 31, 1962), the inevitable
conclusion is that, in the eyes, of the law, respondent <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.
Domingo's motion for recon­sideration was of no legal effect, and its filing
did not suspend the running of the period of appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon this ground <span class="GramE">We</span>
agree with petitioner Judge Reyes that said motion was <u>pro-forma</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The motion aforesaid is <u>pro-forma</u> on yet another
ground:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in substance it was but a
reiteration of reasons and arguments previously <span class="SpellE">setforth</span>
in respondent <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo's memorandum submitted to
the trial court and which the latter had already considered, weighed and
resolved adversely to him when it ren­dered its decision on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">We come now to the question of what remedy or remedies could have
been availed of by said respondent after the ren­dition of the final judgment
and after the denial of his motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Admittedly, the decision rendered by the Court of First instance
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> presided by petitioner Judge Reyes declaring
Estrada the mayor-elect of San Juan, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, was <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> either to the Court of Appeals or to the Supreme
Court, as the case may be, within five days from notice thereof (Section 178,
Revised Election Code), said appeal to be taken as in a criminal case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">As said notice was served
on respondent <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.</span> Domingo on <st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1968</st1:date>, the five-day
period of appeal expired on November 4 of the same year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that date, however, he chose to file <u>not</u>
a notice of appeal in accordance with Section 178 of the Revised Election Code,
but a motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
the reasons <span class="SpellE">setforth</span> by petitioner Judge Reyes in the
corresponding resolution - which We need not here reproduce <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>extenso</u></span> - said motion was denied on November 25,
1968, because “the reconsideration of its decision dated October 29, 1968 is
not in order as the same had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>".</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Again,
upon </span>receiving notice of the denial of his motion for reconsideration on
</span><st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="11"><span class="GramE">November 25,
 1968</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, respondent <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.</span>
Do­mingo, instead of taking an appeal from the Court's decision on the merits,
filed with the Court of Appeals a special civil action of certiorari,
prohibition and mandamus praying for judgment as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">this</span>
Petition be given due course;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>upon the filing of
this <span style="">petition, a </span>restraining
order, or writ of preliminary injunction, be issued <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>pa</u><u><span style="">rte</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>by this Honorable Court, or by any
one of its Justices (as provided by Sec. 2 of Rule 58 of the Revised Rules of
Court) <span style="">considering
</span>the urgent and perilous situation created by respondents<span style="">’</span> acts, commanding or enjoining the
respondents, jointly and separately, their agents, representatives and men, from
executing any order and/or writ of execution issued by respondent Judge
declaring the decision in Election Case No. 10545 final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
from removing petitioner from his <span style="">office
as municipal mayor of San Juan, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, from
installing </span>respondent 'Joseph <span class="SpellE">Ejercito</span>
Estrada' in petitioner<span style="">'</span>s place
as said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>mayor, and from otherwise
molesting, disturbing <span style="">petitioner in, or </span>excluding him from, his lawful exercise and
performance of his duties, rights and prerogatives <span style="">as </span>municipal mayor, until further
orders from this Honorable Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">after</span>
hearing, said restraining <span style="">order </span>or
injunction be declared permanent;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(4)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>judgment be rendered
annulling the proceedings and orders of respondent Judge complained of,
commanding the said respondent to desist from continuing with the said
proceedings and likewise commanding the respondent judge to take cognizance of,
and to resolve, the petitioner's motion for reconsideration, Annex 'D' of this
petition and, should said motion be denied, to give due course to petitioner's
appeal, as stated in the cautionary notice of appeal, Annex 'J hereof; with
costs against private respondent;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(5)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">private</span>
respondent’ Joseph <span class="SpellE">Ejercito</span> Estrada', be sentenced to

complained of; and<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(6)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">petitioner</span>
be granted such other relief as the Honorable Court may deem just and equitable
in the premises."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Clear it <span style="">is </span>from
the allegations of respondent <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo's petition
for certiorari etc. that, because of the alleged intention of Judge Reyes to
declare his decision final and order its immediate execution, and protestant
Estrada's alleged threat to take over the functions of the Office of the Mayor
of San Juan, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, by force, the purpose of his
action was to prevent these things from happening by seeking the annulment in
advance of the order he <u>feared</u> Judge Reyes would issue, and by <span style="">compelling the latter, in </span>the
meantime, to decide his motion for reconsideration on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <span style="">special
civil action </span><span style="">was </span>not
addressed at all against the merits of the final judgment disposing of the
election protest, the review of which on errors of fact or of law could be made
only by <u>appeal</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, <span class="GramE">We</span> hold the view
that neither the writ of certiorari nor that of prohibition could lie against
the order of petitioner Judge Reyes denying the aforesaid motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">That
matter was fully within his jurisdiction - jurisdiction that res­pondent <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.</span> Domingo is in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
to deny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the order of denial could
have been assailed as suffering from an error of judgment, <span class="GramE">We</span>
are certain that it did not suffer from lack or excess of jurisdiction, nor
from what in law is considered as <u><span style="">grave
abuse </span>of dis</u><u><span style="">cretion</span></u><span style="">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The question of whether the writ of mandamus should be issued to
compel Judge Reyes to decide respondent <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.
Domingo's motion for reconsideration <u><span style="">on
the merits</span></u><span style=""> </span>must be
answered in the negative, for the simple reason that in his resolution of
November 25 His Honor had already done that.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Suffice it to say, in this connection, that in said resolution, Judge
Reyes said that the reasons and arguments relied upon in the motion for
reconsidera­tion were a mere repetition of those invoked by the same party in
the memorandum submitted to the Court prior to the rendition of judgment and
which His Honor had already considered, weighed and found devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly implied in this <span style="">is </span><span style="">a </span>reiteration of his opinion that said reasons and arguments
were without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed; had <span style="">he found them to be
meritorious in any respect, His Honor would have either reversed or modified
his de­cision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">But
even if this were not the case, respondent <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.</span>
Domingo could have raised all said questions <u>on appeal</u> - unquestionably
a plain, speedy and adequate remedy consistent with the purpose of the law to
avoid </span><span style="">unnecessary
delays in election cases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It
has been </span><span style="">suggested that, </span><span style="">perhaps, construing </span><span style="">the law liberally, the special civil action for
certiorari etc. instituted by respondent <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo
in the Court of </span><span style="">Appeals should be considered as an <u>appeal </u>from the </span><span style="">final judgment
disposing of </span><span style="">the election </span><span style="">protest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
</span><span style="">undersigned
is unable to give </span><span style="">his assent to </span><span style="">this </span><span style="">suggestion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not feasible
under our law and juris­</span><span style="">prudence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, it </span><span style="">would defeat the </span><span style="">"reason of the law" which is "the
life of the law".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The peculiar
features of the law for the disposition of election protests "are
manifestly the result of the demands of public policy </span><span style="">that such contests
should be instituted </span><span style="">with the utmost </span><span style="">promptitude, and dispatched and determined in the most summary manner </span><span style="">consistent with the
right of various con­testants to have an </span><span style="">opportunity to be heard and to submit </span><span style="">evidence in support

stand by </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">result.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The following is a
summary of the views </span><span style="">heretofore </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">setforth</span></span><span style="">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1. After the rendition of a final judgment by a <span style="">Court of First Instance in an </span>election
protest, the prevailing jurisprudence in this jurisdiction is that the Court, <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> or on
motion of the defeated party, may, within the period of appeal provided by law,
re<span style="">consider its decision or grant a new
trial, in </span>spite <span style="">of the fact that
</span>the Revised Election Code does not expressly provide for a motion for
reconsideration or new trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
notwithstanding, however, any law or rule of court <span style="">that may </span>be applied <span style="">to
election protests should be </span>construed <u>strictly</u> to avoid unnecessary
delays <span style="">in the final determination of
the ease;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2. The final judgment of a Court of First Instance in an election
protest is <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> either to the Court of Appeals
or to the Supreme Court, as the case may be, within five days from notice
thereof, for revision, correction, annulment or confirmation, and the appeal
shall proceed as in a criminal case (Section 178, Revised Election Code); but
in the present case, neither the motion for reconsideration nor the petition
for certiorari, prohibition and mandamus mentioned in the <span style="">foregoing </span>discussion suspended the
running of the aforesaid period of appeal, nor were they, separately or
together, equivalent, in law, to the appeal authorized by law; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. Upon the undisputed facts obtaining in 'this case, the final
judgment rendered by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
presided by petitioner Judge Reyes has become <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</blockquote>
