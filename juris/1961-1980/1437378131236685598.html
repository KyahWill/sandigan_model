Escarcha and dismissed the case on the ground that the death of Narciso Lasarte was not connected with his employment as cashier in the Bureau of Public Highways.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p><p>The facts, as found by the Acting Referee of Region Office V. are that Gliceria Lasarte is the widow of Narciso Lasarte and the other petitioners are the children of said Gliceria Lasarte and Narciso Lasarte; that Narciso Lasarte employed with the Bureau of Public Highways sometime in 1959; that the last position of Narciso Lasarte was Cashier II with a salary of P5,725.20; that he was assigned to the Albay II Engineering District with Office at Legazpi City; that in the morning of October 11, 1972, he went to the office later failed to go home at noon and in the nighttime; that on the following day, Gliceria Lasarte received a call from their family physician informing her that Narciso Lasarte was dead; that Narciso Lasarte was shot in the Village Restaurant and Hotel at Legazpi City; that Dr. E. Lorenzo, City Health Officer of Legazpi City, found that Narciso Lasarte sustained a gunshot wound on the head which resulted in his death on October 12, 1972; that the incident was investigated by the Criminal Investigation Service, PC, Legazpi City, which reported that Narciso Lasarte died while serving as Cashier II of the respondent; that the circumstances attendant to the killing led the investigators to consider it as murder; that Narciso Lasarte was survived by his wife, Gliceria Lasarte, and his children, namely. Hector, Myriam, Marilyn. Laurence, Maita and Narciso Jr., and that the late Narciso Lasarte died while in the employ of the respondent, Republic of the Philippines (Bureau of Public Highways) as cashier II.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p><p>The Workmen's Compensation Commission said that Narciso Lasarte, as cashier of the II Engineering District of Albay, had his place of work at Ligao. Albay, a good 30 to 40 kilometers away from the place of his death, Village Restaurant and Hotel. This statement is not correct. The office of the II Engineering District of Albay is in Legazpi City. The Village Restaurant and Hotel is located also in Legaspi City near the Office of Narciso Lasarte. It is the III Engineering District of Albay which has its place of work at Ligao, Albay.</p><p>The Criminal Investigation Service of the Philippine Constabulary found that Narciso Lasarte was murdered at the time of his death, Narciso Lasarte was cashier of the II Engineering District of Albay. Hence his death supervened during his employment. In view thereof, there is a presumption that his claim is compensable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p><p>In <em>Simon vs. Republic of the Philippines </em>(Supreme Court),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> this Court said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"x x x In a very recent case penned by Mr. Justice Claudio Teehankee, this Court held: 'x x x assuming the employee's illness may be ruled out as an occupational disease or that the casual link between the nature of his employment and his ailment has been insufficiently shown, nevertheless, it is to be presumed as mandated by Section 44 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, that the employee's illness which supervened during his employment either arose out of, or at least aggravated by said employment and with this presumption, the burden of proofs shifts to the employer and the employee is relieved of the burden to show causation. In the case before Us, the respondent has failed to discharge that burden, x x x'"</p></blockquote><p>In the present case, the respondent did not adduce any evidence to rebut the presumption that the death of Narciso Lasarte is compensable.</p><p>The Acting Referee of Region Office V at Legazpi City awarded death benefits and burial expenses to the claims based on the following:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Under Section 8-(b), claimants are entitled to death compensation in the sum of P6,240.00 (P110.10 reduced to P50.00 x 60% x 208 weeks) which shall be reduced to P6.000.00 plus the burial expense of P200.00."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p></blockquote><p>This computation is correct.</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission sought to be reviewed is hereby set aside the respondent is ordered:</p><p>1) To pay the claimants, petitioners herein, the sum Six Thousand Pesos (P6.000.00) as death compensation plus expenses of Two Hundred Pesos (P200.00). through the widow-claimant, Gliceria Lasarte; and</p><p>2) To pay the successor of the Workmen's Compensation Commission the sum of Sixty One Pesos (P61.00) as administrative fee.</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>.</p><p><em>Teehankee (Chairman), Makasiar, Guerrero, De Castro. </em>and<em> Melencio Herrera JJ.,</em> concur.</p><p><br>&nbsp; </p><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><em> Rollo</em>, p. 20.&nbsp; <p></p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <em>Rollo</em>, pp. I 7-I<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <em>Rollo</em>, p. 19.</p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Section 44, Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended.<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 71 SCRA 643. 646.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <em>Rollo</em>, p. 20.</p></div>
