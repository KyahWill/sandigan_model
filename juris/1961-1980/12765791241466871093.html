				<H3>FELIZA JOVEN DE JESUS, DULY ASSISTED BY HER HUSBAND GREGORIO B. DE JESUS, PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLEES, VS. PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, DEL CARMEN BRANCH AND THE PAMPANGA SUGAR MILLS, DEFENDANTS; PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.P., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This appeal presents a procedural question on the dismissal of an appeal as 
perfected out of time. Specifically it involves application of Section 13, Rule 
41 of the Rules of Court: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 13. Effect of failure to file notice, bond, or record on appeal. — 
Where the notice of appeal, appeal bond or record on appeal is not filed within 
the period of time herein provided, the appeal shall be dismissed." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>Appellant invokes liberality in the interest of justice. Appellees cite among 
other things our statement in Reyes <i>vs</i>. Court of Appeals, 74 Phil. 235, 
238: "We cannot fix a period with the solemnity of a statute and disregard it 
like a joke. If law is founded on reason whim or fancy should play no part in 
its application." </p>
<p>The controversy originated in Pamganga, in Civil Case No. 1128 of the Court 
of First Instance herein entitled "Feliza Joven de Jesus <i>vs</i>. Philippine 
National Bank et al.,” where judgment was rendered in February 6, 1961 as 
follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"WHEREFORE, finding the averments of the complaint being supported by 
preponderance of evidence, the court hereby renders Judgment in favor of the 
plaintiff Feliza Joven de Jesus and against defendant Philippine National Bank, 
Del Carmen Branch, ordering the latter to pay the former the sum of P3.274.98 
with legal interest thereon at the rate of 6% a year from September 15, 1956, 
date of the filing of the complaint, until the principal shall have been fully 
paid, plus the other sum of P500.00 as the attorney’s fees of the said 
plaintiff, considering that the defendants in refusing to cancel the leasehold 
rights of Jacobo Lampa clearly unjustified, bordering in bad faith, with costs. 
</p>
<p>"The defendant Pampanga Sugar Mills is hereby absolved from the complaint. 
Meanwhile, the third party defendant Jacobo Lampa is hereby ordered to pay the 
defendant Philippine National Bank all sums of money it was ordered to pay the 
plaintiff including legal interest, and costs." (Record on Appeal, pp. 127-128.) 
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of this decision the parties were furnished copies, through counsel, by 
registered mail. </p>
<p>On March 16, 1961 defendant Philippine National Bank filed its notice of 
appeal and a motion for extension of time to file record on appeal. On March 17, 
1961, it filed its record on appeal and appeal bond. However, its appeal was 
dismissed on that day by the court on plaintiffs' motion as filed out of time 
because the registry return card showed receipt by defendant Philippine National 
Bank of its copy of the decision on February 13, 1961. </p>
<p>Defendant bank filed on March 22, 1961 a "motion for reconsideration and 
relief from, and/or to set aside the order of March 17, 1961". It alleged that 
movant's failure to appeal on time was due to "accident, mistake and/ or 
excusable negligence," as supported by affidavits annexed to the motion. The 
court denied the motion on May 18, 1961. Defendant bank has appealed from the 
orders of March 17, 1961 and May 18, 1861. </p>
<p>The record will show that copy of the decision sent to appellant's counsel in 
its legal department was received on February 13, 1961. In its motion of March 
22, 1961 filed before the court <i>a quo</i>, appellant stated that the 
registered mail containing said copy was received from Me Post office on 
February 13, 1961 by Eugenio Magpoc. Although the latter is postal mail and 
delivery clerk of appellant's cashier department, his affidavit states that "as 
such, one of my duties is to get and receive from the Post Office all registered 
mail matters addressed to the Philippine National Bank, <i>its personnel and 
different departtents"</i> (Rec. on App., 151, Italics supplied). </p>
<p>Defendant bank admitted having filed its notice of appeal, record on appeal 
and appeal bond beyond the 30-day period, but contended in its motion of March 
22, 1961, that the delay was due to "accident, mistake and/or excusable 
negligence,” In support of such contention, it is alleged that on February 13, 
1961 the registered letter was given by the bank's postal mail clerk Eugenio 
Magpoc to Feliciano Jimenez, Jr., registered mail clerk of appellant's cashier 
department. Due to volume of work, Feliciano Jimenez, Jr. delivered it to the 
receiving clerk of appellant's legal department only on February 15, 1961 and 
failed to inform the latter that it was received two days before. </p>
<p>Thereupon, it was stamped by said receiving clerk as received on February 15, 
1961. On the basis of this date, appellant's counsel computed the period to 
appeal. </p>
<p>The lower court did not find excusable the negligence recited above. We see 
no compelling reason to disturb this finding. Appellant's counsel carelessly 
took for granted that the date of receipt stamped on the letter by the legal 
department's receiving clerk was the date of receipt from the post office. It 
was known or at least should have been known to him, that letters addressed to 
appellant's legal department were taken from the post office by Eugenio Magpoc 
and sorted out by Feliciano Jimenez, Jr. Thus, from appellant's system of 
handling and receiving correspondence for its legal and all other departments, 
it was clear that the date of receipt by the receiving clerks of its several 
departments could not be relied upon as the very same date of receipt from the 
post office. Counsel for appellant could have easily found out the latter date 
had he inquired from Eugenio Magpoc or Feliciano Jimenez, Jr. and in the 
circumstances, we find no excuse for his having failed to do so. </p>
<p>It should also be stated here that important steps required of litigants by 
the Rules cannot be left «* ht minute action without assuming the risk of losing 
the right to take such steps if, through the fault of the party concerned, the 
period for doing so is miscalculated. Such fatal consequence has often resulted 
as what happened to appellant's right to appeal in the case at bar. Hence, the 
attention and care needed on periods provided by the Rules of Court can never be 
overemphasized. </p>
<p>As we have stated in Bello<i>vs.</i> Fernando1, L-16970, January 30, 1962: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The right to appeal is not a natural right nor a part of due process; it is 
merely a statutory privilege, and may be exercised only in the manner and in 
accordance with the provisions of the law (Aguila <i>vs</i>. Navaro, 55 Phil., 
893; Santiago<i>vs</i>. Valenzuela, 78 Phil., 507). Section 3, Rule 41 of the 
Rules of Court requires that the notice of appeal, the appeal bond, and the 
record on appeal be all filed in court, and served on the adverse party, within 
thirty days from notice of judgment. . . . and compliance with this period for 
appeal is considered absolutely indispensable for the prevention of needless 
delays and to the orderly and speedy discharge of judicial business (Altavas 
Conlu <i>vs</i>. C. A., L-14027, January 29, 1960), so that if said period is 
not complied with, the judgment becomes final and executory. . . (Layda 
<i>vs.</i> Legaspi, 33 Phil. 83; Pampolina <i>vs</i>. Suiza, 12 Phil. 99; Caisip 
<i>vs</i>. Cabangon, L-14684, Aug. 26, 1960)." </p></blockquote>
<p>While the above-stated rule may in special instances be relaxed "in the 
interest of justice", this exception is at most discretionary for the Court to 
apply and can be invoked only when there is "lawful justification" as when 
circumstances of fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence" have 
intervened. (Reyes <i>vs</i>. Court of Appeals, 1 74 Phil. 235). As already 
discussed, such circumstances do not exist in this case. We may also add that 
appellant, while invoking the interest of justice, has not shown how it; would 
stand to be prejudiced from the loss of its right to appeal. From the record no 
such prejudice can be gathered, especially because the judgment provided for 
reimbursement in appellant's favor by third-party defendant Jacobo Lampa and the 
latter has not appealed therefrom.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the orders appealed from are hereby affirmed, with costs. So 
ordered. </p>

Regala, Makalintal</i> and <i>Zaldivar, JJ.</i> concur. </p>
