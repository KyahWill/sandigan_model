passing on the claim of 99 applicants for certificate of public con­venience to
operate and maintain taxicab service within the city of Manila and suburbs and
from there to any point in the Island of Luzon, specifying by name those
granted such certificates of public convenience, sixty in number, but failing
to refer individually to the unsuccessful ones, their fate being indicated by
the curt and summary statement, "the applications not included in the list
of those granted are either [dismissed] for lack of interest or failure to
prosecute or [denied] for failure to qualify," is assailed in this
petition for review by Juan M. Serrano, one of those who failed in his bid to
obtain a certificate of public convenience.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to petitioner, he "filed an application with the
Public Service Commission requesting authority to operate a taxicab automobile
service within the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
and from said city to any place in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Island</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Luzon</st1:placename></st1:place> open to motor vehicle
traffic and vice versa, with the use of fifty (50) units."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">He “alleged </span>in his application
that he is of age, Filipino citizen, married and a resident of 121 Minnesota, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City; that he is a public service bus operator in
the City of Manila and environs being the holder of several certificates of
public convenience embracing different lines; that he desires to operate <span style="">a </span>taxicab service in the City of
Manila and environs and proposes to utilize fifty (50) units of bantam closed
cars of the <span class="SpellE">Toyopet</span> type; that public convenience and
necessity demand the immediate approval of the application; that the applicant
is financially capable to esta­blish and maintain the proposed service; that
the applicant will charge the rates that are at present charged by existing
taxicab operators in the City of Manila and environs; and that the applicant is
ready and willing to comply with the Public Service Act <span style="">as </span>amended and all such rules and regulations of the Public <span style="">Service </span>Commission now existing or
which may be promulgated from time to time."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">His application "was heard by Associate Commissioner <span style="">Gregorio </span>C. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pañganiban</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
record of </span>the case shows that the petitioner completed the presentation
of his evidence, but the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> did not present
any evidence to rebut <span style="">the </span>evidence
of the petitioner as to his qualification and financial capacity."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Nonetheless, "the Public Service Commission denied completely [his]
application * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not known from
the decision appealed from whether the application of the petitioner <span style="">was </span>dismissed for lack of interest or
failure to prosecute or denied for failure to qualify."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration was filed and denied by respon­dent
Public Service Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence the
present petition for review.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his brief, petitioner
alleged as the first error committed by <span style="">the
</span>Public Service Commission its failure to make "a statement of facts
as to each case regarding the qualification and financial <span style="">ability </span>of the applicant and the other
factors constituting the criterion used as basis in granting the application,
in whole or in part, on the one hand, and dismissing or denying the application
on the other."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Petitioner, in support of the above
assignment of error, relies on the constitutional provision that "no
decision shall be rendered by any court of record without expressing therein
clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The above constitutional
mandate does not lend support to petitioner's plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its wording is clear and definite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The obligation <span style="">to state </span>clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which the
decision is based </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">is</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">incumbent on a court of record.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Public </span>Service Commission is not a court of record within the
meaning of the above constitutional provision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So it was held by us in <span class="SpellE">Dagdag</span> v. Public
Service Commission,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
with its categorical pronouncement of the Commission not being "a judicial
tribunal," its functions being "limited and administrative in
nature.” Reference was made in the above decision to the earlier case of Filipino
Bus Co. v. Philippine Railway Co.,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
where not once but twice it was explicitly stated that the Public Service
Commission is "not a court."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It does not mean,
however, that the non-inclusion of the administrative tribunal within the scope
of the above constitutional provision justifies the summary disposition of
petitioner's application in the manner followed by respondent Public Service
Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tibay</span> v. Court,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> speaking of the Court of Industrial
Relations, which is likewise an administrative tribunal possessed of quasi?</span>judicial
powers like the Public Service Commission, we made clear that while it is
"free from the rigidity of certain procedural requirements," it does not
mean "that it can, in <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> <span style="">cases </span>coming <span style="">before it, entirely ignore or disregard the fundamental and essential
requirement of due process * * *." Seven cardinal </span>primary rights,
which, this Court held, must be respected, are enumerated, the last being
"that <span style="">quasi-judicial
tribunals," </span>and the Public Service Commission is one of them,
"should, in all controversial questions, render its decision in such a
manner that the parties to the proceeding can know the various issues involved,
and the reasons for the decisions rendered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The performance of this duty is inseparable from the authority conferred
upon it."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
It does not admit of doubt that when in a decision under review respondent
Public Service Commission did not even bother to refer individually to
petitioner and state why his application is either dismissed or denied, there
was a violation of the above cardinal primary right.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The failure to respect
such cardinal primary right of petitioner to have his application decided in
such a manner as to inform him not only of the issues involved but the reasons
for the decision, which necessarily would likewise require a finding of facts,
cannot receive judicial approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
error of the Public Service Com­mission is thus marked and manifest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The gravity of such a
failing is underscored not only by deprivation of a right to which petitioner
is entitled, but also by the obstacle placed on the responsibility entrusted to
us of review­ing decisions and orders of the Public Service Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only </span>the other month, in Philippine
Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Gabatin</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">a study of our decisions from
Philippine <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span>' Association v. Public Utility
Commissioner,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
to Robles v. Blaylock,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
a period covering more than 45 years, yielded the conclusion that in­variably
this Court accords deference to a finding of facts of respon­dent Commission,
unless it could be shown that evidence in support thereof is lacking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is all the more essential then that each
and every application should be considered strictly on its merits and the
relevant facts in support of an order, ruling or decision be carefully inquired
into and clearly set forth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise,
the exercise of the power of review by this Court might be condemned to
futility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessa<span style="">rily </span>then, such an arbitrary fiat as the denial or dismissal of an
application without any statement as to why under the evidence such a result is
called for is plainly bereft of support in law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even if, as was noted in the joint decision, there was a lack of
interest or failure on the part of an applicant calling for a dis­missal of his
petition, such a conclusion must find support in the competent evidence before
the respondent Commission and must be so indicated in the order.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the second assignment of error, petitioner would have this
Court pass on the sufficiency of his evidence to show that he has all the
qualifications required to entitle him to a certificate of public
convenience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evaluation of the
evidence is primarily for the respondent Public Service Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The summary denial of his petition, as above
noted, was plain and palpable error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is a need then to remand the matter to respondent Public Service Commission so
that it could consider the evidence and discharge the function committed to it
by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only after it has rendered its
decision setting forth the facts on which it is based does the power of review
on the part of this Court come into play.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As of this stage then, it is premature to consider the second assignment
of error.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Public Service Commission
of September 7, 1964 insofar as it dismissed or denied the appli­cation of
petitioner Juan M. Serrano, is set aside and the case remanded to respondent
Public Service Commission to consider the evidence submitted by him and
thereafter to render a decision either approving or denying the same based on the
facts as found which must be set forth therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
