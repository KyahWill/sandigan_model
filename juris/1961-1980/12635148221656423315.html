				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Convicted of murder for the killing of Alexander <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> and sentenced to suffer an indeterminate prison
term of from twelve years and one day of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> as minimum
to twenty years of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> as maximum, to indemnify
the heirs of the offended party in the sum of three thousand pesos (P3,000.00),
and to pay one-sixth of the costs, Elmer Estrada, nicknamed Baby, appealed from
the decision to the Court of Appeals. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Said court, however, found that the trial
court had erroneously applied the provision of the Indeterminate Sentence Law
in the imposition of the penalty which, in its opinion, should be <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, accordingly certified the case to
this Tribunal pursuant to Section 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1948, as
amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this review.</p>

<p class="BODY">A few meters outside the door of the Insular Cafe at the corner
of Juan Luna and <span class="SpellE">Martires</span> Streets, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City, at about 11:00 o'clock on the night of November
27, 1963, a flash of gunfire was seen from the direction of three men standing
in front of Alex­ander <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>, nicknamed
Sonny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>
reeled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More sounds of gunshots
followed; and <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> fell to the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Informed of the shooting, members of the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City Police Department rushed to the scene and when
they arrived at the Insular Cafe some minutes thereafter, they found the fallen
body of the victim being carried by a young man named Jorge Cor­dero who, upon
seeing them spontaneously exclaimed:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Sonny <span class="SpellE">gipusil</span> <span class="SpellE">ni</span>
Baby Estrada, <span class="SpellE">gukda</span> <span class="SpellE">ninyo</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Finding that the victim was already dead, the police officers immediately
pursued the <span class="SpellE">gunwielders</span> who have fled from the
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of them who stayed behind
ordered Cordero to put down the victim back on the pavement, then entered the
Insular Cafe and notified the Homicide Section of their Department by phone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon, the policemen who chased the killers
returned empty-handed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They decided to
proceed to the house of Baby Estrada and keep watch over the place.</p>

<p class="BODY">When members of the Homicide Section of the Police Department
came to the scene still later, they found the lifeless body of Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> into whose left breast a bullet had plowed 21
centimeters deep, still sprawled on the ground, lying on its belly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They took the body thereafter to the Cosmopo­litan
Funeral Parlor at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Junquera</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street> where it was autopsied by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Venerando</span> <span class="SpellE">Pilapil</span>, Medical
Officer of the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City Health Department at about <st1:time minute="45" hour="12">12:45 o'clock</st1:time> that same evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His post-mortem findings described the wound
that snuffed out the life of Alexander <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Chest:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wound, gunshot, entrance, oval in shape,
diameter, widest 0.7 cm. shortest 0.6 cm., with contusion collar more on the
left side of the wound, located 3.5 cm. to the left of the anterior median line
at the level of the 2nd left rib, 5 cm. below the left clavicle, penetrating
the skin, subcutaneous tissue, mus­cles of the chest, 2nd left rib near its <span class="SpellE">sternal</span> attachment, perforating the ascending aorta,
penetrating upper lobe of the right lung, 3rd right <span class="SpellE">intercos­tal</span>
muscles <span class="SpellE">posteriorly</span>, muscles, of the chest, right
scapula up to the muscles <span class="SpellE">posteriorly</span> to the right
scapula where one slug was recovered marked VP at the tip and AA at the bottom,
directed <span class="SpellE">posteriorly</span>, medially to the right
side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">For the death of Alexander <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>,
Elmer Estrada alias Baby and Alberto <span class="SpellE">Tejero</span> were
later appre­hended, and, together with a certain <span class="SpellE">Yuli</span>,
John Doe, Richard Doe, and Thomas Doe who have remained at large, were charged
before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> with the
crime of murder, committed with conspi­racy and the qualifying circumstance of
evident premeditation, and attended by the aggravating circumstances of night
time, grave abuse of superior strength and treachery both Elmer Estrada and
Alberto <span class="SpellE">Tejero</span> pleaded not guilty to the charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They interposed a de­fense of alibi.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the course of the trial, after the prosecution had rested its
case, the defense moved for the dismissal of the case on the ground of
insufficiency of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial
court, after listening to the argument of the defense counsel and the private
prosecutor, denied the motion and ordered the defense to present its evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the trial, the court promulgated its de­cision on <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="2">February 17, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It acquitted Alberto <span class="SpellE">Tejero</span>
on reasonable doubt, and found Elmer Estrada guilty of the offense charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">After serving notice of his intention to appeal from the decision
to the Court of Appeals, Baby Estra­da filed a petition with the trial court
praying that order issue setting the amount of bail for his provisional liberty
pending appeal which the court granted on <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was ordered released on <st1:date year="1964" day="29" month="2">February
 29, 1964</st1:date>, after posting an appeal bond of P20,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But a few days thereafter, Elmer (Baby)
Estrada was rearrested by members of the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City
Police De­partment when he was found illegally possessing a 45-Cal. pistol with
magazine and six rounds of ammunition tucked to his waist, and upon complaint
filed by the Assistant City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, the trial
court ordered Elmer Estrada <span class="SpellE">reincarcerated</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His appeal bond was can­celled by the lower
court on <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Elmer Estrada then prosecuted his appeal to the Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For failure of the Solicitor
General to submit the People's brief after several extensions granted by the
court, the case was ordered submitted for decision solely on appellant's
brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A subsequent motion for bail
Filed by the appellant on <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="2">February 28,
 1966</st1:date>, was denied by the said court on <st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, the Court of Appeals upon
review of the records of the case, was of the opinion that the penalty
imposable is <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> and resolved
to certify the case to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">A reexamination of the evidence revealed the contrast between the
theory of the prosecution and that of the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is the theory of the prosecution as testi­fied to by the
witnesses for the State:</p>

<p class="BODY">Months before <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="11">November
 27, 1963</st1:date>, bad blood al­ready existed between appellant Elmer
Estrada, nick­named Baby, and the deceased Alexander <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>,
nick­named Sonny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="6">June 8, 1963</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="3">3:00 o'clock a.m.</st1:time>, Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>
chased Baby Estrada and stabbed him in the back and stomach at the Elite Res­taurant,
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wound was serious and could have produced
death were it not for the timely medical treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It required an emergency operation and Es­trada
had to be confined at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
for more than a month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in
September of the same year, the same part of his body had to be operated on
again because his abdomen was still weak.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was finally released from the hospital in the latter part of
October.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But for all these sufferings,
Baby Estrada did not file any complaint against Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He showed clear indications that he would
want to even up the score with Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He gave warning to a former friend, Mike
Arriba, to stop going with <span class="SpellE">Almend­ras</span> or he will meet
an accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On another occasion late in
October 1963, Baby Estrada and his companions threatened Sonny with death near
the Center Theatre, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>
ran and sought protection from Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Gingoyon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Baby Estrada and his friends saw <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> coming with the policeman, they hoarded a
taxi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before they left, Alberto <span class="SpellE">Tejero</span> who was with Estrada at the time, said to <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"You
are about to die; you are lucky this evening because <span class="SpellE">Presio</span>,
is with you."</p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time>
on the night of <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1963</st1:date>,
Alexander <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> and his friends, Carding <span class="SpellE">Manceo</span>, Luis <span class="SpellE">Topacio</span>, Fred <span class="SpellE">Sugatan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> Perez
arrived at the Insular Cafe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, they
met Jorge Cordero with two companions, Jesse Navarro and a certain <span class="SpellE">Doy</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the invitation
of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>, the two groups joined and occupied one
table.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They started drinking
liquor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 o'clock</st1:time>, Jorge Cordero received information from <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Malig</span>-on, a security
guard at the Insular Cafe, that the enemies of Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>
had just passed by in a taxi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cordero relayed
the warning to <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> who was then in the comfort
room, but Sonny dismissed the warning, saying that "anyway they will not
come inside the cafe." Cordero returned to the table.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He gave the same information to Luis <span class="SpellE">Topacio</span> who, upon receipt of the news started looking, for <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just then
people standing near the door of the Insular Cafe were running inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Somebody shouted that Baby was there and
Sonny should watch out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Luis <span class="SpellE">Topacio</span> who was looking for <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>
to warn him went outside the door and there he saw Sonny standing before
Alberto <span class="SpellE">Tejero</span>, Elmer (Baby) Estrada and a certain
Fred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He heard <span class="SpellE">Sonay</span>
<span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> remarked:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Let us talk this over, Bert." Gunfire was the immediate ans­wer
from the direction of the three men.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Jorge Cordero who followed <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> was at
the door of the cafe at that precise moment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He also saw the flash and heard the sound of the gunshot from the
persons in front of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>, one of whom he
recognized to be baby Estrada.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
were two other men standing a little farther away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More shots followed from the same direction. <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> reeled, then fell to the ground face
downward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Luis <span class="SpellE">Topacio</span>
hid behind the wall, while Jorge Cordero turned back inside the cafe and sought
shelter behind the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assailants
then fled in a taxi together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
Cordero came out of the door after the <span class="SpellE">gunwielders</span>
were gone, he saw the body of Alexander <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> on
the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He came to his rescue, and
Sonny told him he was hit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He tried to
carry the body of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> with the aid of other
people, with the intention of taking him to a hospital, but before he could do
so, members of the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City Po­lice Department
arrived at the scene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He <span class="SpellE">hied</span> them to pursue Baby Estrada who shot <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> and fled in a taxi, whereupon, the policemen
immediately gave chase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A policeman who
stayed behind examined the body of Son­ny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>,
and seeing him dead, notified the Homicide Section of the Department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They came later with a medical officer who
took the lifeless body of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> to the
Cosmopolitan Funeral Parlor and conducted its autopsy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, the police officers who pursued
the killers soon returned without bagging the object of their man­hunt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Led by Detective Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Ybañez</span>,
they proceeded to the house of Baby Estrada at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Junquera</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, just opposite
the Cosmopolitan Funeral Parlor where the body of Alexander <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>
had been taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Detective Ortiz went up
the Estrada home to see if Baby was there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was met by Emma, <span class="SpellE">Estradats</span> sister, at the
door of the house who told him, that Baby Estrada was not there, al­though she
knew that she had just met him coming up the house just a few minutes before.</p>

<p class="BODY">Earlier that evening, <span class="SpellE">Cresencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Laput</span> was driv­ing his taxi near the waterfront of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A pas­senger hailed him, and four persons
boarded his taxi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of them ordered
him to follow a Snow White taxi a­head of them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Snow White taxi stopped near the <span class="SpellE">Esso</span>
gasoline station at the corner of Juan Luna and <span class="SpellE">Martires</span>
Streets, while the other taxi carrying the four passengers proceeded a little
farther, beyond the Insular Cafe on the other side of the same street and
stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three of the four passengers
got out of the taxi, while the fourth stayed and remained seated beside the
driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In about five minutes, the
driver heard, two shots from the direction of the Insular Cafe, and when he
looked back towards the place, he saw a taxi drove away from the scene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He started his car to leave the place, but
the fellow sitting beside him, held his steering wheel and told him to wait for
his companions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon the three
passengers returned with two others; they boarded the taxi and ordered the
driver to proceed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the corner of <span class="SpellE">Sikatuna</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Streets,
five of the passengers disembarked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
sixth remained inside the taxi and ordered the driver to proceed to <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Sanciangco</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, where the
taxi bumped the car of a certain Mr. <span class="SpellE">Bonpua</span> as the
taxi was going at a high speed from the time it left the Insu­lar Cafe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this moment, the last passenger got out of
the taxi and hurriedly walked away without paying.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the defense of herein appellant, the follow­ing evidence was
presented to establish alibi:</p>

<p class="BODY">As a result of the stab wound Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>
inflicted on Baby Estrada on <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="6">June 8, 1963</st1:date>,
the latter was operated on and confined in the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
for more than a month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The operation had
to be re­peated in September and he was confined again until his final release <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> on <st1:date year="1963" day="21" month="10">October
 21, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even during
his confinement, hospital personnel received phone calls urging them to release
Baby Estrada imme­diately so that Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>
could finish him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be­cause of such
threats, Baby Estrada had since then feared Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, after his discharge from the hospital on
October 21, 1963, Baby stayed in his house and avoided night clubs for fear
that he might meet <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> and be killed by
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But on <st1:date year="1963" day="26" month="11">No­vember 26, 1963</st1:date>, a friend of his informed him
that Sonny was in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was happy because he could go out and enjoy
himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, on the night of the kill­ing
of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> on <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1963</st1:date>, he went out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He tried to borrow money from a friend upon
the security of his Corsican jacket but failed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He tried another place where he met a friend named Claudio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter informed Baby that a certain Cesar
was coming with a bottle of wine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cesar
did come a little while after with the wine, and Baby Estrada and he proceeded
to Emmanuel's Store across the street.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Claudio stayed behind and refused to join them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the place, <span class="SpellE">Cip­riano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gabica</span> saw them and the three of them partook of the
wine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, they transferred to <span class="SpellE">Amado's</span> place nearby where a natural brother of Estrada
also joined in their drinking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The group
dispersed before <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Baby Estrada invited his natural brother to
join him to the Insular Cafe after that, but the lat­ter did not go with
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, Baby Estrada had to go
alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He rode a rig and stopped at the
corner of Juan Luna and <span class="SpellE">Lapulapu</span> Streets, about 30
meters from the Insular Cafe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He walked
towards the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just as he was about
to reach the Insular Cafe across the street, he saw Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>
with Bill <span class="SpellE">Malig</span>-on at the door of, said night
club.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was scared and imme­diately
turned back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He walked some distance
along <span class="SpellE">Lapu</span> <span class="SpellE">lapu</span> Street
before he boarded a taxi which took him back to the place where he and his
friends drank liquor earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
friends were no longer there at the time, so he went straight home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the stairs of the house, he met his
sister, Emma whom he greeted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Baby went
up the house end slept, while Emma went down to buy some typewriting
paper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was about <st1:time minute="30" hour="10">10:30 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About <st1:time minute="35" hour="10">10:35</st1:time>
or <st1:time minute="40" hour="10">10:40</st1:time>, while Emma was still downs
airs talking with the store owner, two men with <span class="SpellE">sidearms</span>
came along.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They spoke to two other
young men standing near the, store - they were looking for Baby Estrada.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The armed men then continued their way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the young men near the store to whom
they spoke commented before they left:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Just slow, Bay, we might be hit." Hearing that the armed men
were looking for her brother, Emma went upstairs and closed the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She looked inside the room and saw her
brother in bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She looked out of the
window and watched. Around 10 minutes later, or at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening, a jeep parked beside their
house and several men jumped out of it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They surrounded their house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One,
of them came up the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She met him
at the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man was looking for her
brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fearing that he may harm Baby
Estrada, she lied, and told the man that Baby was not there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man left after that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>,
she noticed that people were in a sort of commotion in the road gathered at the
Cosmopolitan Funeral Parlor across their house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She knew something was wrong for it was usual that people flock at the
Cosmopolitan Parlor when incidents happen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She did not sleep that evening.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She watched the men who were, around their house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She recognized one of them to be Carding <span class="SpellE">Ybañez</span>, a detective.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="3">3:00 a.m.</st1:time>, the men
around their house left.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the morning, Emma went down to buy bread.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She heard people talking that Alexander <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> was shot the night before and was taken to the
Cosmopolitan Funeral Parlor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She learned
from these people also that it was her brother who shot Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>So, upon
her return to the house, she informed her mother who was in the kitchen, about
the news she heard, and to­gether they entered the room of her brother, Baby Es­trada,
and woke him up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They asked Baby if it
was true that he was the one who shot Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>
at the Insular Cafe the night before, and Baby gave indi­cation of being
surprised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted having been to
the insular Cafe earlier that evening, but went straight home when he saw Sonny
<span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> outside the door of the cafe because he was
afraid of him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, he
was seen by his sister, Emma, at the stairs of the house at about past <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time> that evening when he came
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assurance given by Baby
Estrada that he had nothing to do with the killing of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>
the night before, notwithstanding, the family worried be­cause it had been
broadcasted over the radio and it was already the talk of the town that Baby
Estrada shot Sonny, so they decided to seek protection for Baby from the
Philippine Constabulary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Baby's mother
went to <span class="SpellE">Opon</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>
and sought the help of Estrada’s uncle, and when they returned to the house,
they (mother and uncle of Baby) were already accompanied by two PC
soldiers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Baby Estrada was later taken
to the PC headquarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, Baby Estrada
requested for a paraffin test.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The PC
called the offices of the NBI and the CIS but said agencies answered that their
technicians were not present, so the PC told him that it was not
necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon Estrada was fetched by a
po­lice officer from the PC headquarters.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His lawyer accompanied him there too.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Once again, he requested for a paraffin test, and again he was told that
their technicians were not around.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the incident at the Elite Restaurant on June 8, 1963,
where Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> stabbed Baby Estrada in the
back and in the stomach, end for which Estra­da was operated on and confined in
the hospital for more than a month, it was explained that Estrada tried and
wanted to file a criminal complaint against Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>
but had no witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the
eyewitness­es who saw the attack on Estrada was also later on shot by <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> and hospitalized.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The police also in­formed him that no waitress of the Elite Restaurant
was willing to testify against <span class="SpellE">Almeldras</span>, hence, the
non-filing of any complaint against <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing conflicting theories, the trial court deduced
that Baby Estrada and his compa­nions conspired to kill Alexander <span class="SpellE">Alrendras</span>; that they resolved to kill <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>
on a vendetta - to vindi­cate the wrong committed on Estrada by <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> when the latter stabbed the former at the Elite
Restaurant on June 8, 1963; and that the attending circumstances of the case
convincingly show evident premeditation on the part of the conspirators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It, therefore, convicted herein appellant,
Baby Estrada, of the crime of mur­der for the killing of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant first assails the finding of the lower court that
conspiracy existed between him and his co-accused in the killing of Alexander <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
support of his stand, he argues as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"It was fully established that a certain Fred was the one who
fired the fatal shot (Decision, p. 20; <span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>-La Paz, p.
51) that felled <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That, standing alone makes Fred liable for
his acts, for</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'In the absence of a previous plan or agreement to commit a crime,
the criminal responsibility arising from different acts directed a­gainst one
and the same per­son is individual and not collective, and each of the
participants is liable only for the acts committed by himself.’<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[<st1:country-region><st1:place>U. S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Magcomot</span>, 13 Phil. 386-]</p>

<blockquote>For the killing, only Fred and Fred alone
is solely responsible."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We are more inclined to reject this theory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence, it is true, shows that the first
flash of gunfire was seen in front of Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>,
and the persons standing in front of him at the time were Alberto <span class="SpellE">Tejero</span>, Baby Estrada, and a certain Fred,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
but the evidence is not clear as to who among them fired the fatal shot.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
According to the eyewitnesses, Fred was standing in front of Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> at a point situated in an oblique direction from
Sonny's right, while Alberto <span class="SpellE">Tejero</span> stood in an
oblique direction from Sonny's left with Baby Estrada standing behind Alberto <span class="SpellE">Tejero</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Sonny was heard addressing Alberto <span class="SpellE">Tejero</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Let us talk this over, Bert."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Im­mediately after the remark, Fred fired "Bang <span class="SpellE">Bang</span>,"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> reeled and fell to the ground
after the shot.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
These facts do not justify an inference, however, that the bullet that killed <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> came from the direction of Fred, for according to
the post­mortem findings of the medical officer who autopsied the body of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>, the entrance of the wound in the chest of the
victim was abut <u>3.5 cm. left of the center of the body at the level of the
2nd left rib, penetrating the anterior muscles of the chest and the 2nd left
rib, perforating the ascending aorta of the heart, penetrating the right lung
and the posterior muscles of the chest to the right scapula where the slug was
recovered directed <span class="SpellE">posteriorly</span> to the right side</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
tending to show that the bullet came from an oblique direction towards Sonny's
left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not lose sight of the fact,
also established, that the first shot came soon after the address of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> "Let us talk this over, Bert" to
Alberto <span class="SpellE">Tejero</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
who was standing in front of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> in an oblique
direction from the left of the latter.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The logical conclusion under the circumstances would therefore be this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>either the first shot came from the direction
of Alberto <span class="SpellE">Tejero</span> or Baby Estrada who was behind him
if that first shot was really, the one that felled <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>,
or, it, was one of the other shots that followed the first shot,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
coming from the same direction where Bert <span class="SpellE">Tejero</span> and
Baby Estrada stood, which fatally hit <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The position of the three men in relation to
that of <span class="SpellE">Almen­dras</span>, and the point of entrance of the
wound, detracts from appellant’s theory that it was Fred who fired the, fatal
shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, assuming that it was
really Fred who fired the shot that killed Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>,
and herein appellant did not fire any of the other succeed­ing shots, still he
is liable as a co-conspirator to the killing of Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>
as will be shown hereafter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant would insist that the trial court fell into error when
it held that all the accused had acted "with concert and in unison in
obedience to a plan or prior agreement,"<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
and hence, "Estrada is liable for the killing of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>
to the same extent as Fred,"<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
inspire of its finding that "no witness was presented to establish any
previous agreement between them to commit murder."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
We are not impressed with this argument either.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is competent evidence to the effect that at about 10:00 o'clock on
the night of November 27, 1963, four (4) persons boarded a taxi near the pier
area of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City and directed the driver to follow a
Snow White taxi ahead of them to' the corner of Juan Luna and <span class="SpellE">Martires</span> Streets.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There the Snow White taxi stopped near the <span class="SpellE">Esso</span>
Gasoline Station along <st1:street><st1:address>Juan Luna Street</st1:address></st1:street>,
while the other stopped near the Insular Cafe on the other side of the same
street.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Three of the four passengers of the twit near the Insular Cafe disembarked,
while the fourth stayed inside the car.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At about the same time, inside the Insular Cafe where Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> and his friends were drinking liquor, one of them
named Jorge Cordero, received warning from a security guard that the enemies of
<span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> just pass­ed by in a taxi,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
which warning he relayed to Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> and to
another companion, Luis <span class="SpellE">Topacxio</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
And no sooner had the presence of the feuding protagonists - <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> and his friends on the one hand against Baby
Estrada and his group on the other - mani­fested itself in the excitement of
the people standing near the door of the Insular Cafe at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Knowing that bad blood existed between them,
people at the door of the cafe became apprehensive of the tenseness of the
situation and went inside running, shouting that Baby was there and Sonny
should watch out.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Two among the friends of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> inside the cafe
went outside the door and saw <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> standing at
the time in front of three men near him, one of whom they recognized to be Baby
Estrada.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Two other men were seen standing a little farther away aside from the three in
front of Son­ny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> addressed one of the men in front of him:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Let us talk this over, Bert."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Immediately, gunfire flashed in front of Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>
who, thereafter reeled.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
The driver of the waiting taxi from which the three men previously disembarked,
heard the gunshots from the Insular Cafe,<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
and when he looked at the place, he saw the other taxi scampered away from the
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"He started his car to leave
the place also, but the fourth passenger who remained inside the taxi beside
him, held the steering wheel of the car and told him to wait for his
companions,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
who arrived later with two other men with them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They boarded the taxi and told the driver to go fast, directing him' to
turn left, then right until they reached the corner of <span class="SpellE">Sikatuna</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Streets where five of the pass­engers
disembarked, the sixth ordering the driver to take him to <span class="SpellE">Sanciangco</span>
Street.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Before they reached the place, however, the taxi bumped the car of another,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
during witch distraction, the last passenger hurriedly slipped away without
paying the taxi fare.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
Back at the Insular Cafe, the police soon arrived at the scene of the
shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They found the body of Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> being carried by Jorge Cordero who, upon seeing
them spontaneously exclaimed that Baby Estrada has shot Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> and urged them to pursue him.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
These circumstances, woven together, convincingly show that herein appellant
and his companions had conspired together to attain a common purpose - to kill
Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While admittedly, the driver of the get-away taxi failed to identify
herein appellant to be one of his passengers who disembarked near the Insular
Cafe at the time of the shooting, nor did he see them going to the said night­club,
from the fact that herein appellant was positively identified to be one of the
men standing in front of Son­ny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> when the
latter was fired upon, coupled with the circumstance that people standing near
the door of the cafe became frantic when they saw Estrada and his companions there,
and the further circumstance that Son­ny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>
appears to have gone out of the door of the cafe to see or meet them upon the
information of the security guard who relayed the news that his enemies were
seen in the taxi than passed by shortly before the shooting, it follows that he
was one of the men who alighted from the taxi that stopped near the Insular
Cafe telling the driver to wait and then, barely five minutes thereafter
boarded back the waiting taxi with two other men immediately after the shooting
and hurriedly fled from the scene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
conclusion sustains the holding of the trial court that herein appellant and
his companions that evening, had acted with concert and in unison in obedience
to a plan or prior agreement - to kill Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their agreement or conspiracy is manifested
in their acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To establish conspiracy,
it is not necessary to prove previous agreement to commit a crime if there is
proof that the malefact­ors have acted in consort and in pursuance of the same
objective.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
This Court has repeatedly decided that conspiracy may be inferred from the acts
of the accused themselves when such acts point to a joint purpose and design.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
Their action must be judged by what they do and not altogether by what they
say; for what men do is the best index of their intention.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, this Court has ruled in a similar situation:<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>“Although there is no direct proof of conspiracy between the
appellants, the simultaneous presence of both at the scene of the crime, the
shot fired by appellant <span class="SpellE">Timoteo</span> Cruz, imme­diately
after Valencia had been shot by Felipe de la Cruz, and the circumstance that,
forth with thereafter the latter boarded the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
car, which was there ready for the get away, leave no room for doubt as to the
existence of unity of action and purpose between them."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Further, appellant argues that he was not present at the Insular
Cafe at the precise time the shooting of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> <span class="SpellE">ocurred</span>, pointing out that even the alleged eyewitnesses to
the shooting were not agreed as to his position in relation to <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> when they saw him.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
He vehemently maintains that he could not have been there because at the time
of the shooting he was al­ready at home fast asleep, having left the Insular
cafe earlier in the evening upon seeing <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> there
for he was afraid of him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The suggestion
should be reject­ed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true, as
pointed out by herein appellant, that in the course of his testimony witness
Jorge Cordero had said that he saw him (Baby Estrada) <u>in</u> <u>front</u> of
<span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> at the time of the shooting,<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
which witness Luis <span class="SpellE">Topacio</span> said at one instance in
his testimony that Estrada was behind <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
but such inconsistency may be overlooked.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both witnesses were required during the course of the trial, to re-enact
the position of the assailants and the deceased and to indicate in separate
sketches their relative positions as they saw them, and both illustrations show
that herein appellant was in front of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
This is in addition to their other statements that they saw Baby Estrada
standing in front of Sonny when the latter was shot.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
The alleged inconsistency, therefore, cannot justify an inference that herein
appellant was not at the scene of the crime at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so with the alibi he proffers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No jurisprudence in criminal cases is more
settled than the rule that alibi is the weakest of all defenses and that the
same should be rejected when the identity of the accused has been sufficiently
and positively established by eyewitnesses to the crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
Such should be the rule for as a defense alibi is easy too concoct, and
difficult to disprove.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
And for alibi to prosper, it is not enough to prove that defendant was
somewhere else when the crime was committed, but he must, likewise, demonstrate
that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the
crime at the time.<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a>
Herein appellant's alibi does not meet this standard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, appellant admits having
been to the Insular Cafe on the night of the shooting, although he claims to
have left at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time> upon
seeing that <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> was there,<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>
because he was afraid of him.<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a>
Secondly, appellant's sister, Emma, declared that she met him (appellant
Estrada) coming up the stairs of their house at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="10">10:30</st1:time> or past that night while she was going down the
house to buy writing paper.<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a>
Shortly thereafter, while she was still downstairs at the store, two men
carrying firearms passed by looking for Baby Estrada.<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a>
She then went up the house and closed the door.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was about <st1:time minute="35" hour="10">10:35</st1:time> or <st1:time minute="40" hour="10">10:40</st1:time> at the time.<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a>
She watched out side from the window and according to her, "about 10 or 5
minutes later" a jeep parked near their house; men jumped out of it and
encircled their residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of them
with a firearm came running up their house; she met him at the door; and when
the armed man inquired for her brother (Baby), she lied and told him that Baby
Estrada was not there.<a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a>
Around <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>, she noticed people
flocking at the Cosmopolitan Funeral Parlor just across their house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She stayed awake that whole evening, and noticed
that at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="3">3:00 a.m.</st1:time> the jeep near
their house left although some men con­tinued watching their house.<a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a>
In the morning, she went down the house to buy bread and she heard people
talking that the body of Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>, shot the
night before by her brother, was brought to the Cosmo­politan Funeral Parlor.<a style="" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></span></span></a>
That was the time she in­formed her mother about the news, and together they
entered Baby Estrada’s room and questioned him about the incident, which herein
appellant denied having anything to do with the killing of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the trial court did not believe the
story, and upon the other evidence on record, concluded that Baby Estrada
(appellant) and his gang went to the Insular Cafe that evening on a vendetta.<a style="" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></span></span></a>
And We find no compelling reason to disturb this finding of the lower
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense of alibi is an issue
of fact that hinges on credibility; the credibility of an alibi depends so much
on the credibility of the witnesses who seeks to establish it; and in this
respect, the relative weight which the trial judge assigns to the testimony of
said witnesses must, unless patently and clearly inconsistent with the evidence
on record, be accepted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, as is well
recognized, his proximate contact with those who take to the witness chair places
him, compared to appellate Justices, in the more competent position to
discriminate between the true and the false.<a style="" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></span></span></a>
More­over, from the foregoing narration of events by appellant's sister, We
note that barely some 5 or 10 minutes after Baby Estrada came up their house,
two armed men were already following his trail; and soon after the lapse of
another 5, 10 or 15 minutes, a jeep-load of men were already seen surrounding
their residence, one of whom came running up the house and inquired from her if
herein appellant was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
proximity in time between appellants alleged arrival in the house and the
immediate coming of the police officers pursuing him, belies the claim of
herein appellant that he had left the Insular Cafe earlier that evening and
could not have been there at the time of the shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the Court cannot simply accept
without mental reservation the veracity of here in appellants sister that she
and her mother questioned Baby Estrada if he had anything to do with the
shooting of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> only the following morning
after she heard the news from other people and over the radio that her brother
was the principal suspect in the shooting of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>
the previous night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the tenseness
of the situation - having seen and heard two men carrying firearms inquiring
for her brother barely 5 or 10 minutes after she saw Baby Estrada came up the
house; seeing a group of men among them Detective Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Ybañez</span>
surrounding their house a few minutes thereafter; having met another armed man
(Detective Ortiz) who came running up the stairs of the house and inquired if
her brother was there; and having taken note thereafter of the commotion at the
Cosmopolitan Funeral Parlor across their house which admittedly, she know takes
place only when, incidents happen - it is quite unnatural, may unbelievable, that
she stayed up the whole evening watching the movement of the men who he
surrounded their house without asking her brother then and there where he
really had been before coming home that evening, when the natural thing to do
under the circumstances, would either be to have asked those armed men
inquiring about the whereabouts of her brother why they were looking for him,
why Detective Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Ybañez</span> (their neighbor) and his
men were surrounding their house, or to have informed her mother and ask Baby
Estrada about the situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
highly probable under the circums­tances that Baby Estrada had confessed or
told her sister, Emma of his Involvement in the shooting of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>
before the coming of the police to their house; and in her desire to conceal or
protect herein appellant denied his presence in the house when Detective Ortiz
went up the house that evening and inquired if Baby Estrada was there.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant next assails the holding of the lower court that the
statement of Jorge Cordero to the police immediately after the shooting of
Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></span></span></a>
was admissible as part of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Apparently, the trial court finds to consider that the principle of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span>, being
an exception to the hearsay rule, is not applicable when, as in this case, the
person speaking about a startling event or <span class="SpellE">occurence</span>
testifies in court, for then the truth of his assertions may be tested through
cross-examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, this
holding of the court is a harmless error, since the witness reiterated in his
tes­timony before the court the event that he had witnessed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the trial court correctly considered as
part of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span>
was the warning given by the people present near the door of the Insular Cafe
at the time who, in their excitement, shouted "that Baby was there, and
Sonny should watch out." And although herein appellant would insist that
what was heard was only the word "Baby" and not "Baby
Estrada", the conclusion of herein appellant that it could have been
another "Baby" referred to and not he, fades into insignificance in
the light of the testimony of eyewitnesses that he (Baby Estrada) was seen
standing in front of Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> when the
shooting occurred.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the third assignment of error, appellant
laments the holding of the lower court that he had a powerful motive to commit
the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He contends that motive on
his part should not be considered for the reason that the evidence for the
prosecution points to a certain Fred as the person who mortally shot <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim
is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that motive
is not necessary where there is no doubt that the defendant was the one who
caused the death of the victim.<a style="" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></span></span></a>
But as earlier explained, We are not even convinced that it was Fred who fired
the shot that killed <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> for the reason that
the medical findings tend to show that the bullet that entered the body of the
deceased, came from an oblique direction towards the left chest of the victim,
contrary to the evidence that Fred stood and fixed from an oblique direction
towards the right of <span class="SpellE">Al­mendras</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant herein was convicted on a finding
of conspiracy without defining any act of his that directly contributed to the
ultimate act that killed the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Motive, is here material, for it gives the reason why he participated in
the conspiracy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, the right of the prosecution to call at the trial
witnesses other than those listed in the com­plaint or information may not be
seriously questioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This right is
supported by the rules and jurisprudence on the matter.<a style="" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></span></span></a>
While the accused in a criminal prosecu­tion is entitled to know the nature and
cause of the accusation against him,<a style="" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></span></span></a>
yet it does not mean that he is entitled to know in advance the names of all
the witnesses for the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
success of the prosecution might be endangered if such right be granted to an
accused, for the known witnesses might be subjected to pressure or coerced not
to testify.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The time for the accused to
know all the witnesses against him is when they take the witness stand.<a style="" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></span></span></a>
And from the fact that the witnesses here ob­jected to are members of the
police department of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, it does not necessarily
follow that the danger to the success of the prosecution above-contemplated is
totally obliterated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, appellant contends that the trial court erred in
believing witness for the prosecution, Jorge Cordero, and in not believing
appellant and his witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would
capitalize on the statement made by Cordero to the police immediately after the
shooting urging them to arrest him as an act of vengeance against him because
Cordero was a long time friend of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> and an
enemy of his.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He concludes that as the
facts proven tend to show that it was not herein appellant who shot <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>, Cordero's testimony is suspicious and is not
worthy of belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention is not
well taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cordero appears to have made
the statement to the police immediately after the shooting, the dying victim in
his arms, He urged the police to chase herein appellant spontaneously, without
time to reflect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the fact is, he saw
Baby Estrada with two other men in front of <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>
when the shooting <span class="SpellE">occured</span>, and because he did not
recognize the two other men, he told the police to pursue herein
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His statement grew out of his
nervous excitement, and may not fully be in accord with the facts subsequently
proved, but We cannot subscribe to the sug­gestion of herein appellant that
Cordero, under such a startling <span class="SpellE">occurence</span>, could have
been influenced by any evil motive against herein appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the rule is well settled that where
the issue in a case is the credibility of witnesses, appellate courts do not
generally disturb the findings of the trial court, the judge thereof being in a
much better position to decide the question, having seen and heard the
witnesses himself and observed their deportment and manner of testifying,
unless it is shown that it has overlooked certain facts of substance and value
that, if considered, might affect the result of the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></span></span></a>
This case does not fall under the exception.</p>

<p class="BODY">By and large, therefore, We find the conclusion of the lower
court legally sound - that herein appellant is liable for the killing of
Alexander <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> on the night of <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We also find no justifiable reason to disturb
the holding of the court that the aggra­vating circumstance of night time
cannot be considered for there is authority to the effect that for <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> to be aggravating, it must appear that it has
been pur­posely sought by the offender to facilitate the commis­sion of the
crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></span></span></a>
Nor did the court err in not ap­preciating the aggravating circumstance of
treachery for as correctly observed by the trial judge:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It would appear that the shooting was
preceded by a verbal alter­cation, as shown by the remark of Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> to them, ‘Let us talk this matter over, Bert.’<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he uttered said words, he was facing
Fred, Estrada and others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, he
was observed to insert his hand in his pocket a gesture which might have been
considered as an act of hostility - considering his previous homicidal
proclivities and his being ‘trigger happy’." And so with the aggravating
circumstance of taking advantage of superior strength which was not appreciated
for, mere superiority in number of assailants does not prove it.<a style="" href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the trial court was correct in appreciating the presence
of evident premeditation in the killing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Soon after the appellant had nursed for more than a month the stab wounds
which Sonny <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> inflicted upon him, said
appellant showed clear indications that he would even up the score with
Sonny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He forewarned a friend to stop
going with <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> or he might meet an accident.<a style="" href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></span></span></a>
His resolution to carry a vendetta was known to his friends who fraternized
with his cause, in as much the same way that <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>
knew and felt that the day of reckoning was coming soon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, when by chance they met one evening, <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> frantically ran away and sought protection from a
policeman, on which occasion, one of herein appellant's companions gave stern
warning to Sonny - even in the, presence of the peace officer - that his death
was near.<a style="" href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant and his friends who conspired with him, had more than sufficient time
to reflect upon the consequences of their resolve, but they did not inhibit
themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their determination to kill
is indicated by their simultaneous arrival at the scene of the crime on the
light of the killing, their immediate attack upon the victim, and their departure
together in the same getaway car that was made to wait for them after carrying
out their evil plan.<a style="" href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></span></span></a>
Such evident premeditation qualifies the killing to murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">Murder is punishable by <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> in its
maximum period to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When, as in
this case, no mitigating or aggravating circumstances attended the commission
of the crime, the penalty should be imposed in its medium period which is <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></span></span></a>
Obviously, therefore, the trial court fell into error in sentencing herein
appellant to an indeterminate prison term by applying the provisions of the
Indeterminate Sentence Law which is not applicable when the person convicted of
an offense is punished with death penalty or life imprisonment.<a style="" href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></span></span></a>
Consequently, the said prison sentence should be modified accordingly.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, decision in this case as to the penalty is
modified, setting aside the sentence from twelve years and one day of <u>reclusion</u>
<u>temporal</u> as minimum, to twenty years of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>
as maximum, and in its stead, the accused (appellant) is hereby sentenced to <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> and to indemnify the heirs of
Alexander <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>, the sum of P6,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As thus modified, the judgment is affirmed in
other respects.</p>
