				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
to annul the writ of execution, and the subsequent proceedings which took place
by virtue thereof, in Civil Case No. 2516 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, Branch II (<span class="SpellE">Guagua</span>),
entitled "La <span class="SpellE">Proveedora</span>, Inc., vs. Manuel <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos." None of the respondents filed an answer </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner
waived presentation of a memorandum in lieu of oral argument, and the case was
considered submitted for decision on the basis of the</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">petition
and the supporting copies of the record </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the lower court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appears that in the
aforesaid Civil Case No. 2516 the respondent Court rendered judgment on </span><st1:date year="1969" day="23" month="8"><span style="">August
 23, 1969</span></st1:date><span style="">, as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered in
favor of the plaintiff, LA PROVEEDORA, INC. and against the defendant, MANUEL
ABAD SANTOS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said defendant is
ordered to pay to the plaintiff corporation the sum of P18<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
representing the unpaid difference in the rent of the premises from February,
1957, to January 1965, and an additional amount of P2,000.00 as reasonable
attorney's fees, with legal interest from the date of this judgment and to pay
the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1970</st1:date>
Manuel <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos, the judgment debtor died in the
City of <st1:city><st1:place>Angeles</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, or on September 30, 1970, the
respondent Court issued a writ of execution, pursuant to which respondent Pro­vincial<span style=""> Sheriff levied on a parcel of land and on
the house situated thereon, both owned by the deceased Manuel <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title
No. 22937-M of the land records of the City <span class="GramE">of</span>
Angeles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The auction sale was scheduled
for </span><st1:date year="1970" day="23" month="11"><span style="">November 23, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime an intestate proceeding for the settlement of the
estate of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos was filed in the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, Branch IV (<st1:place><st1:placename>Angeles</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>), docketed as Special
Proceeding No. <span class="GramE">A-40.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1970" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1970</st1:date>
the petitioner herein, <span class="SpellE">Hollanda</span> A.S. Evangelista, was
appointed special <span class="SpellE">adminis­tratrix</span> of the intestate.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 11, 1970, even prior to her appoint­ment, having been
notified of the writ of execution and the scheduled auction sale of the
properties levied upon, the petitioner informed the respondent Provincial <span style="">Sheriff </span>of the death of the judgment
debtor and demanded that <span style="">he </span>desist
from proceeding with the sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was
followed by an urgent motion in court that the writ of execution be recalled,
but the motion was denied and the sale was carried out, wherein respondent La <span class="SpellE">Proveedora</span>, Inc. was the highest bidder.</p>

<p class="BODY">The provisions of the Rules of Court on the matter at hand are
clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 7 of Rule 39 says:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 7.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Execution in case of death
of party.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Where a party dies
after the entry of the judgment or order, execution thereon may issue, or one
already issued may be enforced in the following cases:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of the death of the judgment debtor
after exe­cution is actually levied upon any of his property, the same may be
sold for the satisfaction thereof, and the officer making the sale shall
account to the corresponding executor or administrator for any surplus in his
hands."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Note that the property
levied upon in case the judgment debtor dies <u>after</u> the entry of
judgment, as in this case, may be sold for the satisfaction of the judgment in
case death occurs "after execution is actually levied." On the other
hand, Section 5 of Rule 86 provides that a judgment for money against the
decedent must be filed with the court in the proceeding for the settlement of
the estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the cut-off
date is the date of actual levy of execution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the judgment debtor dies after such levy, the property levied upon
may be sold; if before, the money judgment must be presented as a claim against
the estate, although of course the same need no longer <span class="GramE">be</span>
proved, the judgment itself being conclusive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the judgment creditor will share the estate with other creditors,
sub­ject only to such preferences as are provided by law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Since in this case the
death of the deceased Manuel <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos preceded the
levy of execution on his properties, the judgment against him should be
presented as a claim against his estate, and the sale at auction carried out by
the sheriff is null and void.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the questioned writ of execution and all
proceedings which took place by virtue thereof, including the sale itself and
its registration, if it has been registered, are ordered set aside and
cancelled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs
