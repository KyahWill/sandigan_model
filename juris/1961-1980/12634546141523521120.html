</span>For reasons later to be stated, on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="18" month="8"><span style="">August 18, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, he tendered his resignation from the </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style="">, which accepted it on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="26" month="8"><span style="">August
 26, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, and
transmitted it to the Company on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="8"><span style="">August 29, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, with a request for the immediate implementation
of said section 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Company having
informed him that his aforementioned resignation would result in the

resignation and advising the </span><st1:place>Union</st1:place> <span style="">continue deducting hit monthly union
dues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, moreover furnished </span>a <span style="">copy of communication to the Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter, in turn, notified the </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style=""> of the receipt of said copy and that
"in view thereof, we shall not take any act on this case and shall
consider Mr. Francisco <span class="SpellE">Salunga</span> still a member of your

</span></span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="8" month="9"><span style="">September </span><span style="">8, </span><span style="">1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, the </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style=""> told the Company that petitioner's
membership could not be reinstated and insisted his separation from the
service, conformably with the stipulation above-quoted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One Company replied, on September 12, 1961,
stating:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> We

position in the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he
answered in the negative, we showed him a copy of our Collective Bargaining
Agreement and called his attention to Sec. 3, Art. 11 thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then told us that he did not realize that
he would be losing his job if he were to resign from the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We did not at any time <span style="">ask </span>or urge him to withdraw his
resignation; neither are we now asking or insisting that you readmit him into
your membership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We thought that informing </span>him of the consequences of his
resignation from, the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>, <span style="">was the only humane thing </span>to do under the circumstances.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Nevertheless, if notwithstanding our fore­going clarification
you still consider him as having actually resigned from your organization, and
you insist that we dismiss him from the ser­vice in accordance with Sec. 3,
Article II of our agreement, we will have no alternative but to do so." (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. L).</blockquote>

"we regret we have to terminate your employment for cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You are, therefore, hereby notified of your

</span><span style="">action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">PAFLU gave </span><span style="">due course to petitioner's request for </span><span style="">review and </span><span style="">asked the Company, on September </span><span style="">29, 1961, </span><span style="">to defer </span><span style="">his </span><span style="">dismissal, </span><span style="">for </span><span style="">at </span><span style="">least two (2) </span><span style="">weeks, so
that its </span><span style="">(<span class="SpellE">PAFLU's</span>)
</span><span style="">Executive Board could act on his

</span>Furthermore, he asked the Company to maintain the status quo, in the </span><span style="">meantime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="">This notwithstanding, at

</span><st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="10"><span style="">October 15, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, petitioner was discharged from the </span><span style="">employ­ment of </span><span style="">the

respondent <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> Cid, as PAFLU president, the
Company, and its aforementioned Vice-President, Miguel Noel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due course, thereafter, the trial Judge
rendered a decision the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which
reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the San Miguel Brewery, Inc.
and Miguel Noel and Na­tional Brewery &amp; Allied Industries Labor Union of
the Philippines (PAFLU), John de Castillo, and <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>

said period."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On motion for
reconsideration of the respondents, this decision was reversed by the Court of
Industrial Relations sitting <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> - with two (2) judges
concurring in the re­sult and the trial judge dissenting - which dismissed the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal by the
petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appeal is well taken,
for, although petitioner had resigned from the Union and the latter had
accepted the re­signation, the former had, soon later - upon learning that his
withdrawal </span><span style="">from </span><span style="">the Union would
result in his separa­tion from the Company, owing to the closed-shop provision
above referred to - revoked or withdrawn said resignation, and the Union
refused to consent thereto without any just cause <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Union had not only acted arbitrarily in</span><span style=""> not allowing petitioner to continue his
membership trial Judge found said refusal of the Union officers to be due to
his critical attitude towards certain measures taken or sanctioned by
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As set forth in the decision of
the</span> <span style="">trial Judge:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Prior to August, 1961, he had been criticizing and objecting to what he
believed were illegal or irregular disbursements of union funds, i.e.,<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">allowing
<span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> </span><span class="SpellE">Tirad</span>, a
union official, to receive six months advanced salaries when <span class="SpellE">Tirad</span> went to the United States, which objection he openly
manifested in a meeting of the board of directors and stewards, but instead of
receiving favorable response, he (<span class="SpellE">Salunga</span>) was
twitted and felt insulted by the laughter of those present after Mr. <span class="SpellE">Torio</span> of the Glass Fac­tory remarked that he would be the
next man to be sent to America; second, granting Ricardo Gar­cia, union
secretary, two months advance salaries <span style="">when
preparing for the bar examinations, which objection he broached to union
officer <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> </span><span class="SpellE">Me­neses</span>;
third, the union's additional monthly ex­pense for the salary of a counsel when
the PAFLU, their mother union, is well staffed with <span style="">a </span>number of lawyers who could attend and handle their cases and
other legal matters, and to which mother union the NABAILUP has been paying a
monthly assessment <span style="">of more than
P1,000.00; and </span>fourth, giving salary <span style="">to Charles <span class="SpellE">Mitschek</span> who was dismissed by the
com­</span>pany but denying the same privilege to other simi­larly situated
member-employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Salunga</span>
was later removed by the union from his position as steward without his
knowledge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also appears that the
power of attorney executed in his favor by co-worker Alejandro Miranda for the
collection of Miranda's indebtedness of P60.00 to him (the latter has cer­tain
amount in possession of the Union) was not honored by the union.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The record is<span style=""> </span>clear

knowledge, as well as the fact that the union did not honor the power of
attorney executed in his favor by Alejandro Miranda, a co-worker, for the
collection of Miranda's indebtedness <span style="">of
P60.00 to </span>him, <span style="">he submitted his
letter of </span>re<span style="">signation from the
union on August 18, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It mutt be
stated here that no evidence was adduced by the</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">respondent union to
overcome complainant's testimonies about his objections to the disbursements of
union funds but only tried to elicit from him on cross examination, that the</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">funds
of the union are only disbursed upon authority of the Exec</span><span style="">utive </span><span style="">Board of the union. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that the Court of Industrial Relations <u>en</u>
<u>banc</u> did not reverse these findings of fact or even question the
accuracy thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, the
officers of the Union have, in effect, confirmed the fact th<span style="">a</span>t their refusal to allow the
withdrawal of <span style="">petitioner's resignation
had been due </span>to <span style="">his </span>aforementioned
criticisms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">lndeed</span></span><span style=""> said officers tried to justify themselves by charac­terizing said
criticisms as acts of disloyalty to the Union, which, of course, is not true,
not only because the criticism assailed, not the Union, but certain acts of its
offi­</span><span style="">cers, and, indirectly, the
officers themselves, but, also, because, the constitution and by-laws of the
Union expli</span><span style="">citly recognize the
right of </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">members to give their views on "all
transactions made by the Union." As a consequence, the resolution appealed
from cannot be affirmed without, in effect, nullifying </span><span style="">said </span><span style="">right which, independently of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">constitution and
by-laws of the </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style="">, is part and parcel of the freedom of speech
</span><span style="">guaranteed </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the Constitution of our Republic, as a
condition <u>sine</u> <u>qua</u> <u>non</u> to the sound growth </span><span style="">and development </span><span style="">of labor organizations and democratic
institutions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Although, generally, a
state may not compel ordinary voluntary associations to admit thereto any given
individual, because membership therein may be accorded or withheld </span><span style="">as a </span><span style="">matter if </span><span style="">privilege,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the rule is qualified in respect </span><span style="">of labor unions holding a monopoly </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the supply of labor, either in a given locality, or </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">regards </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">particular employer with which </span><span style="">it has a closed-shop agreement.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The reason </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">that <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The
closed shop and the union shop cause the admission requirements of trade unions
to become <u>affected with the public interest</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like­wise, <span style="">a </span>closed shop, a union shop, or maintenance of membership
clauses <u>cause the administration of discipline by unions to <span style="">be </span>affected with the pu­blic </u><u><span style="">interest</span></u><span style="">."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, it is well settled that such unions are <u>not</u>
entitled to <u>arbitrarily</u> exclude qualified applicants fo<span style="">r </span>membership,
and a closed-shop provision would not jus­tify the employer in discharging, or
a union in insisting upon the discharge of, an employee whom the union thus
refuses to admit to membership, without any reasonable ground therefor.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> Needless to say, if said unions may be compelled to
admit <u>new</u> members, who have the requisite qualifications, with more
reason may the law and the courts exercise the coercive power when the employee
involved is a <u>long stand­ing union member</u>, who, owing to provocations of
union of­ficers, was impelled to tender his resignation, which he forthwith
withdrew or revoked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, he may, at
least, invoke the rights of those who seek admission for the <u>first</u> time,
and can not arbitrarily be denied readmission.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot agree, however, with the finding of the trial Judge to
the effect that the Company was guilty of unfair labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Company was reluctant - if not
unwillingly to discharge the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> first informed the Company of
petitioner's resignation and urged implementa<span style="">tion of section 3 of the bargaining contract, the </span><span style="">Company </span>advised petitioner of the
provisions thereof, <span style="">thereby inti</span>mating
that he had to withdraw his resignation in order to keep his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the Company notified the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
that it (the Company) would <u>not</u> take any action on the case and would
consider the petitioner "still a member" of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the latter, <span style="">thereafter, insisted on </span>petitioner's discharge, the Company
still demurred and explained it was not taking sides and that its stand was
prompted <span style="">merely </span><span style="">by </span>"humane"
considerations, springing from the belief that petitioner had resigned from the
<st1:place>Union</st1:place> without realizing its effect upon his
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, as the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
reiterated its demand, the Company notified petitioner that it <span style="">had </span>no other alternative but to
terminate his employment, and dismissed him from the service, although with
"regret".</p>

<p class="BODY">Under these circumstances, the Company was not "unfair"
to <span style="">the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>On the contrary, it did not merely
show a commendable <span style="">understanding </span>of
and sympathy for his plight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It even
tried to help him, although to such <span style="">extent
</span>only as was consistent with its obligation to refrain from inter­fering
in purely internal affairs of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, the Company could not
safely <span style="">inquire </span>into the motives
of the Union officers, in refusing to allow the petitioner to withdraw his
resignation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as the true
motives were not manifest, without such inquiry, and petitioner had concededly
tendered his resignation of his own <span style="">free </span>will, the arbitrary nature of the
decision of said officers was not such as to be apparent and to justify the
company in regarding said decision unreasonable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, the Company can not be
blamed for assuming the contrary, for petitioner had appealed to the National
Officers of the PAFLU and the latter had sustained the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Company was justified in presuming that
the PAFLU had inquired into all relevant circumstances, including the motives
of the Union Officers.</p>

<p class="BODY">In finding, this notwithstanding, that the Company is guilty of
unfair labor practice, the trial Judge seemed to have been unduly influenced by
the fact that the former <span style="">had </span>dismissed
the petitioner despite his announced intention to Appeal from the decision of
the Union and that of the Officers of the PAFLU to its "supreme
authority", namely, the <span class="SpellE">PAFLU's</span> "National
Convention".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, said
Judge felt that the Company should have waited <span style="">for </span>the action of the national convention before issuing the
notice of dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">no evidence, however, that </span><span style="">petitioner </span><span style="">had </span><u>rea</u><u><span style="">lly</span></u><span style=""> </span>brought this matter to said
"Convention".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much less in
there any proof that the latter had sustained him and reversed the PAFLU
officers <span style="">and </span>the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the record does not show that
petitioner was prejudiced by the Company's failure <span style="">to maintain </span>the status quo, after the
<st1:place>Union</st1:place> had been sustained by said officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="">fact, </span><span style="">petitioner
</span>did not even try to establish <span style="">that </span>he had submitted to the Company – as h<span style="">e has </span><span style="">not </span><span style="">introduced in </span><span style="">the lower court - </span><span style="">satisfactory </span><span style="">proof </span>that an appeal had really been taken by him to the afore<span style="">mentioned Convention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, it was error to hold the Company
guilty of unfair labor practice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Just the same, having
been denied readmission into </span>the Union and <span style="">having been dismissed from </span>the service owing <span style="">to an unfair labor practice on the part of
the Union, peti</span>tioner is entitled to reinstatement <span style="">as </span>member of the Union and to his
former or substantially equivalent position in the Company, without prejudice
to his seniority and/or right and privileges, and with back pay, which back pay
shall be borne exclusively by the Union.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the exercise of its sound judgment and discretion, the lower court
may, however, take such measures as it may deem best, including the power to
authorize the Company to make deductions, for petitioner's benefit, from the
sums due to the Union, by way of check off or otherwise, with a view to
executing this decision, <span style="">and, </span>at the same time, effectuating the purposes of the
Industrial Peace Act.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">With</span></b><span style=""> <b>this</b> <b>modification</b>, the
aforementioned decision of the trial Judge </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">hereby affirmed in all other </span><span style="">respects, </span><span style="">and the appealed resolution of the Court of Industrial </span><span style="">Rela</span><span style="">tions <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> is </span><span style="">reversed, </span><span style="">with costs </span><span style="">against respondents, ex</span>cept the
