				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Sometime on <st1:date year="1959" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1959</st1:date>,
plaintiff-appellant Calo ordered from defendant-appellee Ajax International,
Inc., 1,200 ft. of John Shaw wire rope at P2.85 per foot. The transaction was
evidenced by Charge Order No. 37071, for P3<span class="GramE">,420.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to plaintiff Calo, when the wire rope was delivered to <st1:place><st1:placename>Butuan</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, the same was found short of
300 ft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff then wrote two letters
to defendant asking for either completion of delivery or account ad­justment of
the alleged undelivered 300 ft. of wire rope.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1961</st1:date>,
a complaint docketed as Civil Case No. IV-93062 was filed in the Municipal
Court of Ma­nila by one Adolfo Benavides who claimed to have acquired the
outstanding credit account of Calo from defendant Ajax International, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Charge Order No. 37071 was among those
included in the assigned account. Subsequently, a judgment by default was
entered, and a writ of execution issued, against plaintiff Calo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter resorted to this Court on a
petition for certiorari, prohibition and mandamus.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="">&nbsp;</span>We set aside the judgment of default and writ
of execution issued against plaintiff Calo and remanded the case for further
proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 23, 1962, plaintiff Calo, assisted by her husband,
Marcos Calo, filed in the Court of First Ins­tance of Agusan a complaint
against defendant asking (1) that the latter either effect complete delivery of
Charge Order No. 37071 or that she be relieved from paying P855.00 and (2) that
the latter indemnify her for P12<span class="GramE">,000</span> as attorney's
fees, damages and expenses of litigation.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 860.</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of filing an answer, defendant moved for the dismissal of
Civil Case 860 on the ground, <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u>, that the subject
thereof was involved and intimately rela­ted to that in Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">IV-93062 of the Municipal Court of Manila.</span> The court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> sustained the <span class="GramE">motion</span> and dismissed the
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff-appellant moved for reconsideration and new trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When this failed, she instituted the present
ap­peal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The dismissal of Civil Case No. 860 by the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> because of the pendency of Civil Case No.</span>
IV-93062 in the municipal court of Manila is predicated on the suppo­sition
that plaintiff's claim is a compulsory counter­claim that should be filed in
the latter case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question
that it arises out of the same transaction which is the basis of the complaint
in Civil Case No. IV-93062 and does not require the presence of third parties
over whom the municipal court of Manila could not acquire jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, plaintiff's claim is not a compulsory coun­terclaim in
Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">IV-93062 for the simple reason that the amount
thereof exceeds the jurisdiction of the municipal court.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule that a compulsory counterclaim not
set up is barred, when applied to the municipal court, presupposes that the
amount involved is within the said court's jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, as this Court had alrea­dy noted
in <u>Yu Lay v. Galmes</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
we would come to the absurd situation where a claim must be filed with the
municipal court which it is prohibited from taking cognizance of, being beyond
its jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the reason underlying the rule, which is to settle all
related controversies in one sitting only, does not obtain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, even if the counterclaim in excess of
the amount cognizable by the inferior court is set up, the defendant cannot
obtain positive relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Rules allow
this only for the defendant to prevent plaintiff from re­covering from him.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
This means that should the court find both plaintiff's complaint and
defendant's counterclaim (for an amount exceeding said court's jurisdiction)
meritorious, it will simply dismiss the complaint on the ground that defendant
has a bigger credit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since defen­dant
still has to institute a separate action for the remaining balance of his
counterclaim, the previous li­tigation did not really settle all related
controversies.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff Calo's claim of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> not
being a compulsory counterclaim in Civil Case No. VI-93062, it need not be
filed there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pendency then of said
ci­vil case could not be pleaded in abatement of Civil Case No. 860.
Consequently, the lower court erred in dis­missing plaintiff's complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of dismissal appealed from is hereby
reversed and the case remanded for further pro­ceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against appellee Ajax
