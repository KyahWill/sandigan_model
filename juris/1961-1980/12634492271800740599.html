Title <span style="">16263, 9462 </span>and 1356 in

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
<span class="SpellE">Tiburcios</span>, in </span><span style="">their <span class="SpellE">reamended</span> complaint,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> alleged that they, as heirs of the late <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span>, are the owners
of a parcel of land situated in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City and con­taining
an area of about 430 hectares; that their ownership is evidenced by a Spanish
title in the name of <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tibur­cio</span>
issued by the Spanish government of the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>
on March </span><span style="">25, 1877; </span><span style="">that they (and their predeces­sors-in-interest)
have been in open, peaceful, public, continuous and </span><span style="">exclusive </span><span style="">possession of the said land from prior to
1877 up to the present, have introduced improvements there­on, cultivated it,
and reaped the products thereof; that some­time in </span>1955 <span style="">the U.P., the PHHC and the Varsity Hills,
Inc. intruded upon the land, the first by building houses on the east portion
thereof, the second by bulldozing the rice paddies and cutting down mango
trees, and the third by subdividing portions thereof into subdivision lots;
that because of this trespass upon their land, they made the necessary in­quiries
and discovered that the U.P. and the Varsity Hills, Inc. are holding in their
names <span class="SpellE">TCTs</span> </span>9462 <span style="">and </span><span style="">16263 </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, both derived from OCT 730, and that the PHHC also holds in its name TCT
1356 of the </span><span style="">same </span><span style="">cadastre, derived
from OCT </span>735; <span style="">and that both <span class="SpellE">OCTs</span> 730 and </span>735 <span style="">appear to be registered in the name of the <span class="SpellE">Tuasons</span>,
from whom the U.P., the Varsity Hills, Inc. and the PHHC claim to have acquired
the land covered by their </span><span style="">respective </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">TCTs</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They further alleged, per
paragraphs 13 to 16 of their re-amended complaint, that the land they own was
fraudulently included within the technical boundaries set out </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">OCT </span><span style="">730 </span>by means of detachable sheets of paper incorporated to the
said title "some of which anterior pages appear to have been <u>al­</u><u><span style="">legedly</span></u><span style=""> <u>cancelled</u> </span>before the issuance of the regular form of
said O.C.T. 730, are not in the form prescribed by Act 496", which
"pasted papers <u><span style="">supposedly
containing</span></u><span style=""> </span>the tech­nical
descriptions <u>could</u> <u>not</u> <u>be</u> <u>read</u> <u>with</u> <u>sense</u>
and the lo<span style="">cations, position </span>and
areas of t<span style="">h</span>e properties <span class="SpellE"><u>pretendingly</u></span> <u><span style="">covered</span></u><span style=""> thereby are
unknown", in violation of sections 41, 42 and 112 of Act 496; that </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">OCT 730, the "area of the property
entered in the said regular form is only in the total area of three and a half
hectares (3.542 has.)", and "could not possibly cover" the areas
respectively covered by TCT </span><span style="">9462
</span><span style="">(449 </span><span style="">hectares) and TCT 16263 (100 hectares); </span>that
OCT 735 shows that it is "irregular through and through" in that,
among other things, "Only points 335 and <span style="">393 is (sic) </span>entered in the regular form which points are
floating, the same not being tied to any known fixed point"; that "A
big space on the face of the form and at the back thereof, re­served for
technical description is vacant, <u>obviously</u> to <u>give</u> <u>the</u> <u>perpetrators</u>
<u>the</u> <u>discretion</u> <u>of</u> <u>entering</u> <u>whatever</u> <u>technical</u>
<u>descriptions</u> covering points 1 to 334 <u>they</u> <u>may</u> <u>desire</u>,
and change the location and position of the alleged property <u>supposedly</u> <u>covered</u>
thereby by changing the sheets of detachable papers and changing the original
bear­ing and distances of point 1 in relation to the tie point"; that
"the alleged technical descriptions of points 113 to 217 or 104 points could
not be found and therefore <u>the</u> <u>alleged</u> <u>parcel</u> <u>2 of</u> <u>the</u>
<u>supposed</u> <u>O.C.T.</u> <u>735</u><span style="">
</span><u>is</u> <u>an</u> <u>incomplete title</u> <u>and</u> <u>could</u> <u><span style="">not</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>possibly</u> <u><span style="">cover</span></u><span style=""> <u>any</u> </span><u><span style="">property</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">even </span>if <span style="">we consider </span><span style="">the illegally
pasted</span><span style=""> </span>de<span style="">t</span><span style="">achable
</span>sheets of paper as anterior page"; that OCT 735 could not <u>"possibly</u>
<u>cover</u>" the land embraced within TCT 1356; that <span class="SpellE">OCTs</span>
730 and 735 <span style="">are null </span>and void,
because the records of the General Land Regis­tration Office (now the Land
Registration Commission) do not show any data relative to the issuance of the
supposed dec<span style="">rees </span><span style="">15584 </span>and <span style="">17431, </span><span style="">by </span>virtue of which the said <span class="SpellE">OCTs</span> were issued; and that the said decrees were not
reconstructed <span style="">pur­</span>suant to R.A.
1151, and the period within which reconstitu­tion has to be done has long
expired.</p>

<p class="BODY">The PHHC, on October 2, 1959, filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint on the grounds that (1) the cause of action is barred by prior
judgment; (2) there is another action pend­ing between the same parties and/or
parties representing the same interests, for the same cause of action; (3) the
cause of action has prescribed and/or is barred by <span class="SpellE">laches</span>;
(4) the amended complaint does not state a sufficient cause of action; <span style="">(5) </span>there is <span class="SpellE">misjoinder</span>
of defendants; and <span style="">(6) </span>the court
has no jurisdiction to try the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
U.P. also filed a <span style="">mo­tion </span>to dismiss,
based substantially on grounds (1) to (6) <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>,
and on the additional ground (7) that venue is improperly laid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Tuasons</span> and the
Varsity Hills, Inc. also filed motions to the same effect, based on grounds
(1), (3), (4), <span style="">(6) </span>and (7) aforesaid.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent judge, in an <u>order</u> issued on <st1:date year="1961" day="1" month="6"><u>June</u> <u>1</u>, <u>1961</u></st1:date>,
denied all the motions to <span style="">dismiss with</span> <span style="">respect to
the questions </span>of venue and jurisdiction, holding in abeyance the re­solution
of the other grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The PHHC and the
U.P. there­after filed their answers to the <span class="SpellE">reamended</span>
complaint (the former with a counterclaim for damages), denying the mater­ial
allegations thereof, alleging special and affirmative defenses (the U.P.
reiterating the grounds stated in its motion to dismiss), and praying for the
dismissal of the said <span class="SpellE">reamended</span> complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To these pleadings, the private respondents
filed a reply and an answer, reiterating the prayers in their <span class="SpellE">reamended</span> complaint.</p>

decision of this Court in <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, et al., G.R. L-15644, February 29, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This urgent motion was denied by the court in

all told, the petitioners have come to this Court, on the pre­sent recourse,
contending that these orders were issued by the respondent court without or in
excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion, and that they have no
other adequate and speedy remedy in the ordinary course of law to protect their
interests from further jeopardy and prejudice resulting from the said orders.
They pray (1) that the said orders be annulled and set aside; (2) that the

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1965</st1:date>

July 24, 1967, restraining the private respondents from causing to be made any
further survey or sur­vey plan with respect to <span style="">any </span>portion of the land covered by TCT 9462, from advertising or
offering for sale through <span style="">news­</span>papers,

title, from entering or trespassing upon any portion of the said campus, and
from des­troying, defacing, or injuring the stone posts and fences under
construction along the southwestern boundary of the said campus.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We reserved action,
however, on the prayer of the U.P. </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">its petition for

SWO-40815 and 40888 of the private respondents, to terminate and cancel any

said campus covered by the aforesaid survey plans, and to rescind any contracts
of sale already executed or consummated by them with respect to any portion of
the said campus covered by the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> survey
plans.</p>

<p class="BODY">In our Resolution of July 24, 1967, <span style="">we </span>also denied the application for issuance of a writ of <span style="">preliminary injunction </span>filed by the

denying the petitioners' motions to dismiss the complaint, especially in view

October 31, 1959, involving the same parties or parties representing the same
interests, the same subject-matter, and the same cause of action, this Court
held that since the land involved therein had been registered in the name of
the pre­decessor-in-interest of the U.P. and the PHHC since 1914 <span style="">under </span><span style="">the Torrens system, the claim of the <span class="SpellE">Tiburcios</span>
that the ori­ginal titles lacked the essential requirements prescribed by law
for their validity cannot now be countenanced for, by law, a decree of
registration can only be set aside within one year after entry on the ground of
fraud, provided that no innocent purchaser for value has acquired the property;
that upon the expiration of the period of one year within which a review of the
decree may be had, the decree as well as the title issued pursuant thereto
become incontrovertible; and that the action of the <span class="SpellE">Tiburcios</span>
is barred by <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Felix Bautista An­gelo, made
the following pronouncements:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It appears, however, that the land in ques­tion has been
placed under the operation of the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> system since
1914 when it has been originally registered in the name of defendants' pre­decessor-in-interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It further appears that some­time in <span style="">1955 </span>defendant People's <span class="SpellE">Homesite</span> &amp; Housing Corporation acquired from the
original owner a par­cel of land embracing practically all of plaintiffs'
property for which Transfer Certificate of Title No. 1356 was issued in its
favor, while defendant Uni­versity of the Philippines likewise acquired from
the same owner another portion of land which embraces the remainder of the
property for which Trans­fer Certificate of Title No. <span style="">9462 </span>was issued in its favor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It <span style="">is,
</span>therefore, clear that the land in ques­tion has been registered in the
name of defendants' <span style="">predecessor-in-interest since 1914 under the Torrens </span>system and
that notwithstanding what they now claim that the original title lacked the
essential require­ments prescribed by law for their validity, they have never
taken any step to nullify said title until 1957 when they instituted the
present action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, they
allowed a period of 43 years before they woke up to invoke what they now claim
to be erroneous when the court decreed in 1914 the registration of the land in
the name of defendants' predecessor-in-interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, this cannot be done for under our
law and jurisprudence, a decree of registration can only be set aside within
one year after entry on the ground of fraud provided no innocent purchaser for
value has acquired the property (Section <span style="">38,
</span>Act No. 496; <span class="SpellE">Apurado</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Apurado</span>,
26 Phil. <span style="">581; </span>Salmon v. <span class="SpellE">Bacanda</span>, 40 O.G., 13th Supp. 1607; Rivera vs. Moran, 48
Phil., <span style="">836).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, our law is clear that upon the expiration
of the one-year period within which to <span style="">review </span>the decree of registration, the decree
as well as the title issued in pursuance thereof become incontrovertible
(Section <span style="">38, </span>Act No. 496).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the law <span style="">in </span>limiting
to one year the period within which the decree may be reviewed is to put a
limit to the time within which a claimant may ask for its revocation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If after title to property is decreed an
action may be in­stituted beyond the one-year period to set aside the decree,
the object of the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> system which is to guarantee
the indefeasi<span style="">bility </span>of the <span style="">title would </span>be defeated (<span class="SpellE">Caba­nos</span> v. Register of Deeds, 40 Phil., <span style="">520).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Plaintiffs likewise contend that since the complaint alleges
that defendants acquired their respective titles with full notice of the actual
possession and claim of ownership of plaintiffs with respect to the land in
ques­tion, it is error to dismiss the complaint for such averment is sufficient
to establish a cause of action against defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contention overlooks the fact that the
land in question is covered by <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it appears that defendant People's <span class="SpellE">Homesite</span> &amp; Housing Cor­poration bought the portion of
the property in question from its predecessor-in-interest some­time in 1955 for
which Transfer Certificate of Title No. <span style="">1356
</span>was issued <span style="">in its </span>favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is <span style="">nothing </span>in the complaint to <span style="">show </span>that when it acquired the property said defendant knew of any
defect in the <span style="">title </span>appearing on
its face <span style="">in </span>the form of any lien
or <span class="SpellE">incumbrance</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The same thing is true with regard to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="GramE">defend­ant</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place>
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">like</span>wise
acquired the portion of the property in question sometime <span style="">in </span><span style="">1955 </span>from its predeces­<span style="">sor-in-interest </span><span style="">for which Transfer Certificate </span>of
Title No. <span style="">9462 </span>was issued in its
favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is also nothing in the
complaint to show that when it acquired the property it knew of any defect in
the title appearing on its face in the form of any lien or <span class="SpellE">incumbrance</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said defendants are, therefore, presumed to
be purchasers for value and in good faith and as such are entitled to
protection under the law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The foregoing finds support in the fol­lowing well-settled
principle:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">'A </span>person deal­ing with registered land is not required to go
behind the register to determine the condi­tion of the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is only charged with notice of the burdens

<blockquote>"On October 16, 1958, appellants, as heirs of the late <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span>, commenced the
present ac­tion in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
for the annulment of the technical descriptions appear­ing in the alleged
anterior page of Original Certificate of Title No. 735, but, in reality, for
the recovery of a parcel of land with an area of more than 400 hectares and
damages against Mariano <span class="SpellE">Severo</span>, Maria Teresa, <span class="SpellE">Eriberta</span>, Juan Jose, <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>
Asuncion, <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Huberto</span>,

respective heirs, the Re­gister of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
the UP and the PHHC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their complaint
alleged, in substance, that they and their predecessors-in-interest had been in
actual, adverse, open, public, exclusive and continuous possession as owners of
a parcel of land located in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City containing an
area of about 430 hectares, cultivating and enjoying its fruits; that when the
PHHC and the UP began exercising rights of dominion over the property, they
investigated the records of the Register of Deeds <span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and discovered that their property
was included within the technical boundaries set out in Original Certificate of
Title No. 735 in the name of the defendants <span class="SpellE">Tuasons</span>
by means of de­tachable sheets of paper incorporated to the certificate of
title; that by virtue of a deed of donation executed by the <span class="SpellE">Tuasons</span>
in favor of themselves, said certificate was cancelled and Transfer Certificate
of Title No. </span><span style="">2680 was is­</span><span style="">sued </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">their (<span class="SpellE">Tuasons</span>) names; that, subsequent­ly, the latter sold to <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> UP and PHHC the property covered by T.C.T. No.
2680.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The PHHC filed a motion to dismiss the com­plaint <span style="">on </span>the ground of lack of sufficient
cause of action, while the UP filed <span style="">a </span>similar motion based on the same ground
and several others.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On December 5, <span style="">1958, </span>the
Court issued the appealed order (dismissing the complaint against the UP and
the PHHC for lack of sufficient cause of action, and on the further grounds
that, their cause of action, if any, is barred by prior judgment, and there is
another action <span style="">pending </span>between the same parties for the same cause).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"During the hearing held in <span style="">connection </span>with the motions to
dismiss, the UP presented as Exhi­bit 1 a certified true copy of the

<blockquote>"For its part, the PHHC presented as evi­dence the <span style="">Original
Certificate </span>of Title No. <span style="">735 </span>issued
on July <span style="">6, 1914 </span>in the name of
the <span class="SpellE">Tuasons</span>, its predecessors-in-interest, covering
the proper­ty claimed by appellants (Exhibit 1-PHHC); a certificate <span style="">of </span>the commissioner of Land <span style="">Registration </span>to
the effect that the document thereto attach­ed is a duplicate copy of the
Decree <span style="">No. 17431, </span>on the basis
of which Original Certificate of Title No. 735 was issued (Exhibit 2-PHHC); <span style="">a </span>copy of Decree No. <span style="">17431 </span>showing that the property
claimed by appellants was included in the judgment rendered in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Tuasons</span> (Ex­hibit 2-A-PHHC); and a certificate showing the
technical description of the property covered by Transfer Certificate of Title
No. 1356 <span style="">is­sued in </span>favor of the
PHHC (Exhibit 3-PHHC).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record,
therefore, indubitably discloses that <span class="SpellE">MarceIino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span>, and the other heirs of the late <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span>, had filed an ap­plication
for the registration of the lands allegedly covered by a title granted to the
latter in <span style="">1877 </span>by the Spanish
government, to which the <span class="SpellE">Tuasons</span> interposed the
correspond­ing opposition; that after due hearing, said application was
dismissed and that the order of dismissal became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, the record further discloses that in
1957, <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span>,
for himself and in behalf of the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span>, in­stituted Civil Case No. Q-2663 against
the PHHC and the UP for the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of the same
lands covered by the Spanish title already referred to, and that this case was
dismissed by the court in its order of December 11, <span style="">1957, </span>which order of dismissal <span style="">was affirmed </span>by Us on <u>December 14, 1958</u><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></u></span></a>

compounded when the respondent judge </span>persisted in maintaining his order
