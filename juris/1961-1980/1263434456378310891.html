				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In a letter dated July 15, 1976 addressed to the Supreme Court,
Hon. Remigio E. Zari, Presiding Judge of Branch VI, City Court of Quezon City,
recommended the dismissal from the service of Mr. Diosdado S. Flores, Deputy
Clerk of Court of Branch VI, City Court, on the following grounds:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conviction for libel on April 28, 1967,
(Criminal Case No. Q-7171), Branch IV, Court of First Instance, Quezon City), a
crime involving moral turpitude.  He was
sentenced to <span style="">pay </span>a fine of
P500.00, which he paid on July 18, 1974, under Official Receipt No. 4736418.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Persistent
attempts to unduly influence the undersigned amounting to undue interest in
cases pending before Branch VI as shown by his handwritten notes to the
undersigned and to my present deputy clerk of court, Atty. Reynaldo Elcano.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On March 8, 1976, Mr. Flores was relieved from his position as
Deputy Clerk of Court upon request of the undersigned primarily to dis­sociate
myself from these actuations of Mr. Flores, which I strongly disapproved of,
and to avail my Court of the services of a full-fledged lawyer with unquestionable
integrity.  After his transfer, as can
be seen from his handwritten notes, he per­sisted in taking this unwarranted
course of action in at least three (3) cases of Branch VI.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gross
discourtesy to su­perior officers as manifested by his uncalled for and
unjustified use of strong and contemptuous language in addressing the City
Judges, when he wrote a letter, dated March 11, 1976."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution of this Court dated July 29, 1976, Deputy Clerk
of Court Diosdado S. Flores was required to file his answer to the letter of
Judge Remigio E. Zari and this case was transferred to the First Division.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent filed his answer<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> on
August 12, 1976 wherein he alleged, among others, that his conviction for libel
did not involve moral turpitude; that the then Commissioner Abelardo Subido,
who was also convicted of the crime of libel and was fined P5,000.00, had
approved his appointment as Deputy Clerk of Court of Branch VI of the City
Court of Quezon City; that the respondent never tried to unduly influence the
complainant in the discharge of the latter's duties and responsibilities; that
while respondent's language in his letter dated March 11, 1976 is strong, the
same could not be considered contemptuous either directly or indirectly, in as
much as he was merely expressing the sentiments of an aggrieved employee who
deserves a better treatment from his superior after more than <span style="">six </span>years and nine months of highly
dedicated and very efficient service in the City Court of Quezon City; that if
ever respondent requested favors from his superior, these were all done in the
spirit of friendship which the complainant professed to him before he left
Branch VI of the City Court of Quezon City on March 9, 1976; that from October
15, 1975 up to his illegal transfer on March 8, 1976, the respondent was
practically doing the work of the complainant; that the respondent has tutored
the com­plainant on the fine interpretation and application of the law; that it
was Judge Zari who tried to corrupt him as may be gathered from the following
instances:  On January 8, 1976, after
the trial in Criminal Case No. VI-5783 vs. Juanito Chua and two criminal cases
against Emerito Lim, Judge Zari instructed the respondent to conduct an ocular
inspection on the illegal constructions, subject of the cases; that Judge Zari,
likewise, told the respondent to join him for lunch at Alfredo's Steakhouse in
Quezon City; that after conducting the ocular inspection, the respondent
proceeded to Alfredo's Steakhouse where he joined Judge Zari, Fiscal Loja and
the defense counsel of Chua and Lim; that thereafter, Judge Zari directed the
respondent not to prepare anymore his report on the ocular inspection of the
site; that up to the time of his illegal transfer, the respondent did not <span style="">see </span>the re­cords of said criminal
cases anymore; that in Criminal Case No. VI-166624 vs. Corazon and Macaria
Tolentino, for the crime of estafa, the respondent was instructed to convict
both the accused because the complainant was a relative of a certain Judge
Erochi; and that in Criminal Cases Nos. VI-170682 and VI-170689 versus Gerundio
Villanueva Y Elazo, Dominador Garcia Y Orteza and Balbino Do­mingo Y Ramos, for
the crime of theft, he was instructed by Judge Zari to convict the accused
Dominador Garcia Y Orteza because according to said Judge, the complainant is
AVESCO.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated September 1, 1976,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> this
Court required Judge Zari to file a reply to the answer of the respondent
within ten (10) days from notice thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complainant alleged in his reply to the answer of the
respondent that he had not allowed the respondent to interfere in the
preparation of orders and decisions; that while the complainant is aware of his
limitations, he is certainly not so naive as to allow someone not a member of
the Philippine Bar to "tutor" and give him finer inter­pretation of
the law; that he admits that Criminal Cases Nos. VI-5783 against Juanito Chua
and VI-5788-5789 against Emerito Lim are pending before his court; that he did
not call the respondent to his chamber and instruct him to con­duct an ocular
inspection on the illegal constructions; that he did not invite the respondent
for lunch that day; that the truth was that after the trial, he went to
Alfredo's Steakhouse in the company of his fiscal, Fiscal Guillermo Loja; that
while in the said place, the complainant was surprised to see the respondent in
the company of the ac­cused; that he counseled the respondent to be more circum­spect
as these people had cases before his sala; that it is true that from then on up
to the relief of the respon­dent on March 8, 1976, the records of the aforesaid
case could not be found by the respondent because the complain­ant had the
records brought inside his chamber in order to forestall any attempt on the
part of the respondent to manipulate the records; that he did not instruct the
respondent to convict the accused in Criminal Case No. VI-166624 and in
Criminal Cases Nos. VI-170682 and VI-170689 just because the complainant is a
relative of a certain Judge Erochi and AVESCO, respectively; and that he re­quested
Atty. Reynaldo Elcano to affix his initial in all <span style="">orders, decisions and sentences in order to pinpoint responsibility.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In his reply, the complainant additionally charged that when the
respondent applied for the position of Deputy Clerk of Court, Branch VI, City
Court of Quezon City, he submitted, among others, an affidavit dated June 10,
1969 that contains the following statement "That I am a person of good
moral character and integrity and have no adminis­trative, criminal or police
record"; that the respondent also accomplished Civil Service Form No. 212
(1965) which was subscribed and sworn to before then Judge Oscar A. Inocentes;
that in the aforesaid data sheet, the respondent admits having acted as counsel
for three companies; and that the giving of legal advice by notaries and others
who are not admitted to the practice of law is dangerous to the welfare of the
community, because such persons have not demonstrated their capacity by
submitting to examinations lawfully established in the practice of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">This administrative case was referred to the Executive Judge of
Rizal, Quezon City, for investigation, report and recommendation after City
Judge Minerva Genovea and City Judge Aloysius Alday had been allowed to inhibit
themselves from investigating this case.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">District Judge Sergio A. F. Apostol who conducted the
investigation of this administrative case recommended that the respondent be
separated from the service on the follow­ing findings:</p>

<blockquote>"The first charge is 'conviction for libel which is a crime
allegedly involving moral turpitude'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Presidential Decree No. 807, Sec. 36(b) No. 10 provides that one of
the grounds for disciplinary action is 'conviction of a crime involving moral
turpitude.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>Evidence adduced by the complain­ant which was admitted by the
respon­dent was that on April 28, 1967 res­pondent was convicted of the crime
of Libel in Criminal Case No. Q-7171 of Branch IV of the Court of First In­stance
of Quezon City.  Respondent was <span style="">sentenced to pay a fine of P5,000.00 which </span><span style="">he </span><span style="">paid on July 18, 1974 under Official Receipt No. 276418.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

justification.  It ill behooves an
attorney to justify his disrespectful language with the statement that it was
necessary for the defense of his client.  A client's cause does not per<span style="">ment
an attorney to cross the line between liberty and license.  Lawyers must always keep in perspective the
thought that 'since lawyers are administrators of justice, oathbound servants
of society, their first duty is not to their clients, as many suppose, but to
the administra­tion of justice; to this their client's success is wholly subordinate;
and their conduct ought to and must be scrupulously ob­servant of law and
ethics.' 20/<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence of record supports the findings of the <span style="">inve</span><span style="">s</span><span style="">tigating judge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is a fact that the respondent was convicted of libel in
Criminal Case No. Q-7171 of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Branch IV, at
Quezon City.  While this fact alone is
not sufficient to warrant disciplinary action, the respondent's conviction for
libel shows his propensity to speak ill of others.  His letter dated March 11, 1976 to Judge Minerva C. Genovea, then
Executive Judge of the City Court of Quezon City<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
contains defamatory and uncalled for language.</p>

<p class="BODY">The handwritten notes of the respondent regarding different cases
pending in Branch VI of the City Court of Quezon City, presided by the
complainant, Judge Remigio E. Zari, show that the respondent had exerted undue
influence in the disposition of the cases mentioned therein.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that conviction for libel does not automatically
justify removal of a public officer.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
However, the fact of conviction for libel of the respondent, taken together
with the letter he wrote to then Executive City Judge of the City Court of
Quezon City, Judge Minerva C. Genovea, shows the tendency of the respondent to
malign people.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent's act of interfering in the cases pending before
Branch VI of the City Court of Quezon City presided by the complainant is
inimical to the service.  This alone
warrants severe disciplinary measures.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his affidavit subscribed and sworn to before then City Judge
Oscar A. Inocentes on June 10, 1969, the <span style="">res­</span>pondent stated "That I am a person
of good moral character and integrity and have no administrative, criminal or
police record." This averment is not true because the respondent had been
convicted of libel in Criminal Case No. Q-7171, of the Court of First Instance
of Rizal, Branch IV, in a sentence dated April 28, 1967.  This prevarication in a sworn statement is
another ground for serious disciplinary action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The removal from the service of the respondent is warranted by
the evidence adduced during the investigation conducted by Judge Sergio A. F.
Apostol of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Branch XVI, Quezon City.</p>
