				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case was certified to this Tribunal by the Court of Appeals
in its Resolution of October 4, 1965 on a pure question of law and
"because the issues raised are practically the same <span style="">as those in CA-<span class="SpellE">G.R</span>.
No. 32017-R" between the same parties, which case had been forwarded to us
on April 1, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter case,
"Philippine Phoenix Surety &amp; Insurance Inc. vs. Woodworks, Inc.,"
docketed in this Court as L-22684, was decided on </span><st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="8"><span style="">August 31, 1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> and has been reported in 20 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 1270.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Specifically, this action is for recovery of unpaid premium on a
fire insurance policy issued by plaintiff, Philippine Phoenix Surety &amp;
Insurance Company, in favor of defendant Woodworks, Inc.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following are the established facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1960</st1:date>,
upon defendant's application, plaintiff issued in its favor Fire Insurance
Policy No. 9749 for P500,000.00 whereby plaintiff insured defendant's building,
machinery and equipment for a term of one year from <st1:date year="1960" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1960</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="7">July <span style="">21, 1961</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>against loss by fire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The premium and other charges including the
margin fee surcharge of P590.76 and the documentary stamps in the amount of
P156.60 affixed on the Policy, amounted to P10,593.36.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is undisputed that defendant did not pay the premium stipulated
in the Policy when it was issued nor at any time thereafter.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="19" month="4">April 19, 1961</st1:date>,
or before the expiration of the one-year term, plaintiff notified defendant,
through its <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> No. F-6963/61, of the
cancellation of the Policy allegedly upon request of defendant.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The latter has denied having made such a request.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>,
plaintiff credited defendant with the amount of P3,110.25 for the unexpired
period of 94 days, and claimed the balance of P7,483.11 representing
"earned premium from <st1:date year="1960" day="21" month="7">July 21,
 1960</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1961" day="18" month="4">18th April 1961</st1:date>
or, say 271 days." On <st1:date year="1961" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1961</st1:date>,
plaintiff demanded in writing for the payment of said amount.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Defendant, through counsel, disclaimed any liability in its reply-letter of <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1961</st1:date>, contending, in
essence, that it need not pay premium "because the Insurer did not stand
liable for any indemnity during the period the premiums were not paid."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1962</st1:date>,
plaintiff commenced action in the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch IV
(Civil Case No. 49468), to recover the amount of P7,483.11 as "earned
premium." Defendant <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> basically on
the theory that its failure "to pay the premium after the issuance of the
policy put an end to the insurance contract and rendered the policy
unenforceable."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1962</st1:date>,
judgment was rendered in plaintiff's favor "ordering defendant to pay
plaintiff the sum of P7,483.11, with interest thereon at the rate of 6% per
annum from <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1962</st1:date>,
until the principal shall have been fully paid, plus the sum of P700.00 as
attorney's fees of the plaintiff, and the costs of the suit." From this
adverse Decision, defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals which, as
heretofore stated, certified the case to us on a question of law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The errors assigned read:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1. <span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred in sustaining that Fire
Insurance Policy, Exhibit A, was a binding contract even if the premium stated
in the <span style="">policy has not been paid.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span style="">2. <span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>That
the lower court erred in sustaining that the premium in Insurance Policy,
Exhibit B, became an obligation which was demandable even after the period in
the Policy has expired.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3. <span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred in not deciding that a
premium not paid is not a debt enforceable by action of the insurer."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find the appeal meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">Insurance is "a contract whereby one undertakes for a consideration
to indemnify another against loss, damage or liability arising from an unknown
or contingent event."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The consideration is the "premium".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The premium must be paid at the time and in the way and manner
specified in the policy and, if not so paid, the policy will lapse and be
forfeited by its own terms."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The provisions on premium
in the subject Policy read:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"THIS POLICY OF INSURANCE <span class="SpellE">WITNESSETH</span>,
THAT in consideration of - - - MESSRS. WOODWORKS, INC. - - - hereinafter called
the Insured, <u>paying</u> to the PHILIPPINE PHOENIX SURETY AND INSURANCE,
INC., here­inafter called the Company, the sum of - - - PESOS NINE THOUSAND
EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY SIX ONLY - - - the Premium for the first period here­inafter
mentioned, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"THE COMPANY HEREBY AGREES with the
Insured x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> that if the

Fire or Lightning <u>after payment of Premium</u>, at any time between 4:00
o'clock in the afternoon of the TWENTY FIRST day of JULY One Thousand Nine Hundred

Thousand Nine Hundred <span style="">and SIXTY <span style="">ONE, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> " </span>(Emphasis supplied)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph "2" of the Policy further contained the
following condition:</p>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No payment in respect of any premium shall be
deemed to be payment to the Company unless a printed form of receipt for the
same signed by an Official or duly-appointed Agent of the Company shall have
been given to the Insured."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph "10" of the Policy also provided:</p>

<blockquote>"10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This insurance may be terminated at any time
at the request of the Insured, in which case the Company will retain the
customary short period rate for the time the policy has been in force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This insurance may also at any time be
terminated at the option of the Company, on notice to that effect being given
to the Insured, in which case the Company shall be liable to repay on demand a
ratable proportion of the premium for the unexpired term from the date of the <span class="SpellE">cancelment</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, the <span style="">policy </span>provides
for pre-payment of premium.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
"when the policy is tendered the insured must pay the premium unless
credit is given or there is a waiver, or some agreement obviating the necessity
for prepayment."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
To constitute an extension of credit there must be a clear and express
agreement <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">From the Policy provisions, we fail to find any clear agree­ment
that a credit extension was accorded defendant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And even if it were to be presumed that plaintiff had extended credit
from the <span style="">circumstances of the
unconditional delivery of the Policy without prepayment of the premium, yet it
is obvious that defendant had not accepted the insurer's offer to extend
credit, which is essential for the validity of such agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"An acceptance of an offer to allow credit, if one was made, <span style="">is as </span>essential to make a valid
agreement for credit, to change a conditional delivery of an insurance policy
to an unconditional delivery, as it <span style="">is
to </span>make any other contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
an acceptance could not be merely a mental act or state of mind, but would
require <span style="">a </span>promise to pay made
known <span style="">in </span>some manner to
defendant."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this respect, the instant case differs from that <span style="">involving </span>the
same parties entitled Philippine Phoenix Surety &amp; Insurance Inc. vs.
Woodworks, Inc.,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
where recovery of the balance of the unpaid premium was allowed inasmuch as in
that case "there was not only a perfected contract of insurance but a
partially performed one as far <span style="">as </span>the payment of the agreed premium was con­cerned."
This is not the situation obtaining here where no <span style="">partial </span>payment of premiums has been
made whatsoever.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Since the premium had not
been paid, the policy must be deemed to have lapsed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The non-payment of premiums does not merely suspend but puts
an end to an insurance contract, since the time of the payment is peculiarly of
the essence of <span style="">the contract."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</span><span class="SpellE">x</span> the rule is that under policy provisions
that upon the failure to make a payment of a premium or assessment at the time
provided for, the policy shall become void or forfeited, or the obligation of
the insurer shall cease, or words to like effect, because the contract so
prescribes and because such a stipulation is a material and essential part of
the <span style="">contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is true, for instance, in the case of
life, health and accident, fire and hail insurance policies."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In fact, if the peril insured against had occurred, plaintiff, as
insurer, would have had a valid defense against recovery under the Policy it
had issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Explicit in the Policy
itself is plaintiff's agreement to indemnify defendant for loss by fire only
"<u>after</u> <u>payment</u> <u>of</u> <u>premium</u>," <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Compliance by the insured with the terms of
the contract is a condition precedent to the right of re­covery.</p>

<blockquote>"The burden is on an insured to keep a policy in force by the
payment of premiums, rather than on the insurer to exert every effort to
prevent the<span style=""> insured from allowing a
policy to elapse through a failure to make premium payments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The continuance of the insurer's obligation
is conditional upon the payment of premiums, so that no recovery can be had
upon a lapsed policy, the contractual relation between the parties having
ceased."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, "an insurer cannot treat a contract as valid for
the purpose of collecting premiums and invalid for the purpose of indemnity."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing findings are buttressed by section 77 of the
Insurance Code (Presidential Decree No. 612, promulgated on December 18, 1974),
which now provides that no contract of insurance issued by an insurance company
is valid and binding unless and until the premium thereof has been paid,
notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary.</p>
