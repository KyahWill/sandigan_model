Dominguez, </span>and train No. 5, <span style="">owned
by the North Negros Sugar </span>Company, Inc., in the evening of <span style="">August 31, 1937 in </span>the railroad

Occidental Negros, while the <span style="">car was on
its </span></span><span style="">way </span><span style="">from Bacolod City to
Cadiz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Criminal pro­secution </span>for double homicide and serious physical <span style="">in</span>juries through reckless imprudence

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thereafter,
a civil action based on <u>culpa</u> <u>aqui</u></span><u><span style="">lia</span></u><u><span style="">na</span></u><span style=""> was instituted, on
May 15, 1940, in the Court of First Instance </span><span style="">of Negros Occidental by <span style="">Pedro

death of the <span style="">deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their answer, </span>defendants interposed
as special defense the previous acquittal of defendants <span style="">Primitivo Gustilo and Loreto Perez </span>in the criminal case, and
prayed for <span style="">the dismissal </span>of the
complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At
the pre-trial, </span><span style="">on August 5,
1940, the <span style="">parties agreed to </span>reproduce
in the civil case all the evidence submitted <span style="">in </span>the criminal case, as well </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">the <span style="">decision in and the </span>transcript of the

praying for the <span style="">dismissal </span>of the

submitted, and <span style="">rendered </span></span><span style="">a </span><span style="">decision dismissing the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appeal was taken by the plaintiffs to the Court of Appeals, but the <span style="">appeal </span>was certified to this Court on
the ground that <span style="">the appeal </span>merely
involved questions of <span style="">law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, in G. R. </span>No. L-6790, on
March 28, 1955, <span style="">reversed the de­cision
of </span>the lower court and remanded the <span style="">case </span>for fur­ther proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">During the pendency of
the case in <span style="">the lower court, </span>plaintiff
Rosario V. <span style="">Ybañez died, leaving as her
only heir, </span>co-plaintiff Pedro V. <span style="">Ybañez,
to con</span></span>tinue the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the other hand, the North Negros Sugar Company, Inc. was dissolved and was
accordingly substituted by its receiver Dr. Claudio R. Luzurriaga.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the defendants, Loreto Perez, also
died in the interim and the case against him was dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After having deceived
additional evidence, the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental rendered
judgment, on July 23, 1958, dismissing the case anew.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appeal was taken by plaintiff Pedro V. Ybañez
to this Court, docketed as G. R. No. L-14849, but because questions of fact
were involved, and the amount involved was less than P200,000, the case </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">certified, on August 25, 1960, to the Court of Appeals and docketed in
the latter court as Case No. CA-G.R. N</span>o<span style="">.</span> <span style="">28608-R.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court of Appeals, on
October 14, 1963, reversed the judgment of the lower c</span><span style="">ourt </span><span style="">and held the North Negros Sugar Company, Inc. liable for the death of

damages consisting of P9,600.00 as compensatory damages for <span style="">lost earnings of </span>the deceased;
P6,000.00 <span style="">for death indemnity;

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this </span><span style="">appeal, or petition</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">for
review, </span><span style="">petitioner limits itself
to questioning the correctness of the decision of the Court of Appeals in so
far as it awards moral damages and </span><span style="">attorney’s
fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In </span><span style="">its brief, petitioner contends </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">the Court of
Appeals erred:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1. "in ordering <span style="">petitioner
</span>to pay P5,000 'as <span style="">moral </span>damages
<span style="">for mental anguish </span>suffered’ by
plaintiffs who were brother and sister of the deceased"; and</p>

<p class="NUM">2. "in awarding attorney's fees in the sum of P5,000 to the
heirs of the deceased."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">1. In support of the first assignment of error, petitioner cites
paragraph 3 of Article 2206 of the new Civil Code, which provides that in case
of death caused <span style="">by </span>a crime or
quasi-delict only the spouse, legitimate and illegitimate descendants and
ascendants of the de<span style="">ceased may demand
moral damages for mental anguish by reason of the death of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner urges </span>that in the instant
case the heirs of the deceased Cesar V. Yb<span style="">a</span><span style="">ñez, being his brother, Pedro V. Ybañez, and
his </span>sister, Rosario V. Ybañez (now deceased), are not among those
entitled to moral damages; consequently, the <span style="">award to the</span><span style="">m</span><span style=""> of moral</span><span style=""> damages was not authorized by<span style="">
</span></span><span style="">law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Pedro <span style="">V. </span><span style="">Ybañez, on the contrary, contends that the
law applicable is in the old Civil Code, and not Article 2206 of the new Civil
Code, because the accident that caused the death happened in 1937, and the case
was filed in 1940.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said respondent
maintains that the award of moral damages is authorized particularly under
Articles 1902, 1903, 1103, 1104, 1105 and 1107 of the </span>old Civil Code and
as ruled by this Court in the <span style="">decisions
in Lilius vs. ManiIa Railroad</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">; Gutierrez vs. Gutierrez</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">; and Castro v.

damages, respondent urges, should be paid to the injured person; but if the
injured person died as a consequence of the culpable act and the victim left no
descendants or ascendants, the damages must be paid - taking into consideration
the principles of the general law on damages, of the law on succession, and the
fact that under the old Civil Code no specific persons are indicated to be the
only ones entitled to recover moral <span style="">damages - to </span><span style="">the heirs or next of kin of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent further cites the rulings of this Court in the <span style="">cases o</span>f Bernal <span style="">vs. House, et </span>al.,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">; Astudillo </span><span style="">vs. Manila </span><span style="">Electric Co.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">; and Manzanares vs. Moreta</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">, </span><span style="">wherein the fact of heirship, as viewed from the general principle of
succession of the deceased victim, was taken into consideration in </span><span style="">d</span><span style="">etermining
who would </span><span style="">be paid the </span><span style="">indemnity for damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In reply, petitioner
points out that although the cases cited by respondent show that moral damages
were awarded even before the new</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">Civil
Code took effect, in none of the cases cited, however, were moral damages award­ed
</span><span style="">to </span><span style="">a brother or</span> <span style="">sister of the deceased, but only to either the victim himself, the
surviving spouse, the children or the parents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To resolve the issue, we have to determine what law is applicable
- whether the provisions of the old Civil Code or of the new Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe that the <span style="">old Civil Code is </span>the law applicable <span style="">to the </span>case at bar, subject to such modifications as are
suggested, or are warranted, under the transitional provisions of the new Civil
</span><span style="">Code, as we </span><span style="">may </span><span style="">show at the later part of this opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">so, because the acts </span><span style="">an</span><span style="">d</span><span style="">
events </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">gave rise to the instant action took place in
1937, and </span><span style="">the action was
commenced in 1940.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 2253 of the </span><span style="">new </span><span style="">Civil Code, provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The Civil Code of 1889 and other previous laws shall govern
rights originating, under said laws, from acts done or events which took place
under their regime; even though this Code may regulate them in a different
manner, or <span style="">may
</span>not reco<span style="">g</span>nize them ...."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The pertinent provisions
of the old Civil Code are Articles 1902 and 1903.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first article </span><span style="">provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1902.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any person

liable <span style="">for </span>the
damage so done."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">and the second article in part, provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1903.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
obligation imposed by the next preceding article is enforcible, not only for
personal acts and <span style="">omissions, </span>but also for those of persons for whom another is
responsible.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This

for damage done to another by any </span><span style="">culpable act; </span><span style="">and by culpable act is meant any act which </span><span style="">is blame­</span><span style="">worthy when judged
by accepted legal standards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The </span><span style="">idea </span><span style="">thus expressed is
undoubtedly broad enough to </span><span style="">include </span><span style="">any rational conception of liability for the
tortious acts likely to be developed in any society."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">The word

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
have </span><span style="">not come <span style="">across, </span>and herein respondent has not
cited, any <span style="">case in </span>this
jurisdiction where a brother and/or sister of the victim of <u>culpa</u> <u>aquiliana</u>
was awarded moral damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In our search
for persua­sive authority, <span style="">however, we </span>came
across decisions by the courts of France whose Civil Code, in its article 1383,
provides substantially the same as article 1902 of the Civil Code of Spain, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Cada uno es responsable del daño q<span style="">ue ha causado no soIamente por su hecho, sino tambien por su
negligencia o</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">por </span><span style="">su </span><span style="">imprudencia."
(Ripert and Boulanger, <u>Tratado</u> <u>de</u> <u>Derecho</u> <u>Civil</u>,
Vol. V, 2nd part, p. </span><span style="">50)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the <span style="">basis of the
above-quoted article, in France, moral damages for mental anguish (sentimientos
afectivos) have </span>been <span style="">awarded not
only to parents, children and spouse, of the victim of <u>culpa</u> <u>aquiliana</u>
but also to brothers and sisters, natural grandparents, and godchildren.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We thus see that a
provision in the Civil Code </span>of France which is substantially similar to
the provision of the Civil Code of Spain, relating to <u>culpa</u> <u>aquiliana</u>,
is so applied by the courts of France <span style="">as
</span>to hold a person guilty of <u>culpa</u> <u>aquiliana</u> liable for
moral damages to the person injured, or to his spouse, children, parents,
brothers and sisters, and even to godchildren.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the provision of our old Civil Code - which <span style="">was </span>itself the Civil Code of Spain of 1889 - relating to <u>culpa</u>
<u>aquiliana</u> were to <span style="">be applied as
it had </span><span style="">been applied in France,
then the person guilty of </span><u><span style="">culpa</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">aqui</span></u><u><span style="">l</span></u><u><span style="">ian</span></u><u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">under our old Civil Code would be </span>liable
for moral damages to the person injured, or to his spouse, children, parents,
brothers and sisters and even to his godchildren.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would mean that under our old Civil Code
the liability for moral damages for mental anguish due to <u>culpa</u> <u>aquiliana</u>
was to more persons than what our new Civil Code now provides in its Article <span style="">2206</span><span style=""> which </span><span style="">limits the
liability for moral damages to the spouse and legitimate and illegitimate
descendants and ascendants of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And so, under the new Civil Code, a less severe sanction - at least as
regards the persons entitled to moral damages - is provided for, than u</span>nder
the old Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Article 2257 of the new
Civil Code - one of the transitional provisions - provides as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Art. 2257.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provisions
of this Code which attach a civil sanction or penalty or a deprivation of
rights to acts or ommissions which were not penalized by the former laws, are
not applicable to those who, when said laws were in force, may have <span style="">executed </span><span style="">the act or incurred in the ommission
forbidden or condemned by this Code.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>If the fault is also punished by the previous legislation,
the </u><u><span style="">less severe sanction shall
be applied</span></u><span style="">.</span><span style="">"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It may well be said that <u>culpa</u>
<u>aquiliana</u>, or <u>quasi</u> <u>d</u></span><u><span style="">elict</span></u><span style="">, is punished
both by the old Civil Code - the </span><span style="">previous
legislation - and by the new Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But, as we have pointed out, a less severe sanction, or penalty, for <u>culpa</u>
<u>aquiliana</u> is provided for in the new Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It follows, therefore, that Article 2206 of
the new Civil Code - which provides that only the </span><span style="">spouse, </span><span style="">legitimate and illegitimate descendants and
ascendants may </span><span style="">demand </span><span style="">moral damages for
mental anguish by reason of the death of the deceased caused by <u>quasi</u>-<u>delict</u>
- should be applied in the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, petitioner herein, who claims moral damages for the death of his
brother Cesar V. Ybañez caused by <u>quasi</u>-<u>delict</u>, is not entitled </span><span style="">to, </span><span style="">and should not have been awarded, moral </span><span style="">damages, </span><span style="">by the Court of Appeals.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2. Regarding the second error assigned, petitioner argues that the
Court of Appeals had no special reason for awarding attorney’s fees because the
petitioner had not acted in gross and evident bad faith in resisting
respondent’s claims for damages, and the claims of respondent herein could not
he characterized as "plainly valid, just and demandable" claims as
contemplated under paragraph (5) of Article 2208 of the new Civil Code;
considering that the two employees, for whose alleged negligent acts herein
petitioner is made to answer, were acquitted in the criminal case, and the
civil case for damages was dismissed by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent, on the other
hand, argues that the Court of Appeals gave as reason for the award of
attorney’s fees:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"considering </span><span style="">the years </span><span style="">and extensive work -- </span>the <span style="">protracted litigation had </span>taken."
<span style="">Respondent also maintains that the
award must have been based by the </span><span style="">Court
of Appeals on Article 2208 (11) and Article 2253 of the new Civil Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But petitioner urges that
the issue </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">whether or</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">not
</span><span style="">attorney's
fees </span><span style="">might be recovered, </span><span style="">and not </span><span style="">the amount of attorney's fees in the determination of which the long
years of litigation given as reason </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">the Court of Appeals
would be pertinent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent's argument that the award of attorney's fees was
justified under Article 2208 (11) of the new Civil Code is untenable, because
the instant case was filed on <st1:date year="1940" day="15" month="5">May 15,
 1940</st1:date>, or before the effectivity of the new Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, in the case of Bureau of Lands <span style="">vs. Samia,</span> et al.,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
held:</p>

<blockquote>"That portion of the decision which awards P10,000 to
respondents as attor­ney's fees is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although courts have, under paragraph (11) of Article 2208 of the Civil
Code, authority to <span style="">award </span>attorney's
fees whenever it may be 'just and equitable,' said provision is inappli­cable
to the present case, the same having been instituted before the effectivity of
the said Code."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The refusal of herein petitioner to <span style="">pay </span>the damages asked, although the case was finally decided
against it, cannot be said to have been caused by bad faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of George Edward Koster Inc. vs.
Zulueta,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"At common law, the successful party usually has no right to
have the fees of his attorney, as such, taxed against his opponent (14 L.ed.
181).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court will not ordinarily
allow counsel fees to the successful party.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Each party to the act­ion must pay his own lawyer * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coun­sel fees paid in prior action have been
allowed * * * (where) the conduct of the <span style="">party against whom they were allowed, so directly
and certainly caused the expenditure for this purpose, </span>that the <span style="">loss </span>of the
amount so <span style="">paid
was easily within such causal relations to the </span>defendant's wrong <span style="">as </span>to warrant the <span style="">assessment </span>of
the damages <span style="">in
compensation for it (Sears vs. Inhabi­tants of Nahant, 102 N. E. 491.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our rul­</span>ings before the New <span style="">Civil Code took
effect (the present case having arisen before) have </span>been <span style="">as </span><span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘It is not sound public policy to place a penalty on the right to
litigate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To compel the defeated party
to pay the fees of counsel for his successful opponent would throw wide the
door of temptation to the opposing party and his coun­sel to swell <span style="">the fees </span>to undue proportions, and to
apportion them a<span style="">r­bitrarily </span>between
those pertaining properly to one branch of the case from the other.</p>

<p class="2Q">'This Court has already placed itself on record as favoring the
view taken by those courts which hold that attorney's fees are not a proper
element of damages.' (Tan Ti vs. <span style="">Alvear, 26 Phil. 566; The Borden Co. vs. Doctors
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 90 Phil. 500).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">‘*
</span><span style="">* * </span><span style="">Counsel fees, other
than those fixed in the rules as costs, are not an </span><span style="">element </span><span style="">of recoverable
damages.' (Jesswani vs. Masaran Dialdas, G. R. No. L-4651, May 12, 1952)."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style=""><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the decision of the Court of Appeals sought to be reviewed should be,
as it is hereby, mo­dified by eliminating therefrom the award of P5,000.00 for
