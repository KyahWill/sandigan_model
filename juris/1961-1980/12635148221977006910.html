				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.P., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>
with preliminary injunction has been instituted by the petitioner Domingo Lao
in order to set aside the pre-trial order of the Court of First Instance of
Manila issued on April 13, 1964 and its subsequent orders of January 25, 1965;
April 2, 1965, and May 3, 1965, all of which authorized the sale of the Hacienda
<span class="SpellE">Mapaya</span>, located in Occidental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>
and owned by petitioner, which had been the object of attachment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records disclose that on <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1963</st1:date>, respondent Lao Kang <span class="SpellE">Suy</span>
sued petitioner in the lower court demanding a total sum of P138,000, with a
prayer for preliminary attachment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
the filing of a bond of P140,000, Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Mapaya</span> was
attached.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, petitioner filed his answer and at his instance,
coupled with the filing of the necessary counter-bond, the attachment was
ordered lifted.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1963</st1:date>,
respondent amended his complaint by raising the total sum demanded to
P419,670.81.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court then, by order
dated <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1963</st1:date>,
directed petitioner to post an additional counter-bond of P330,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion to reconsider was filed but
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A second motion to reconsider
followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="12">December 24, 1963</st1:date>, petitioner filed his answer
to the amended complaint with a counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent filed his reply.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="4">April 13, 1964</st1:date>,
a pre-trial was conducted with both parties, assisted by respective counsel,
attending.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pre-trial order reported
the result of the conference as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"At the pre-trial today, the plaintiff assisted by its
counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, and the defendant, assisted by
its counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Alcaraz</span> in collaboration with
Atty. Reyes, agreed:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the defendant will sell the property in <span class="SpellE">Mapaya</span>, San Jose, Occidental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>
covered by TCT 517 in his name within four (4) months from today for not less
than one million pesos.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That out of the proceeds of the sale, the
plaintiff will deposit in this court a sum equal to the amounts claimed in the
amended complaint in addition to the other obligations for which the plaintiff
is liable as surety of the defendant, namely, the defendant’s indebtedness to
the Philippine National Bank, Paramount Insurance, Commercial Insurance
Company, and the Development Bank of the Philippines.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the amount to be deposited in court shall
be applied to the payment of the obligations due the Philippine National Bank,
Development Bank of the Philippines, Paramount Insurance, and Commercial Insurance
Company, and the excess shall be paid to the plaintiff in discharge of what,
after proper accounting may be found due him but nothing herein should be
construed as an admission on his part that the contract between him and the
defendant is one of partnership, the nature of which agreement shall be decided
after the presentation of evidence by both parties.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That should the writ of preliminary attachment
be reinstated the plaintiff will agree to its dissolution and the sale of the
aforementioned property by the plaintiff provided that the sums mentioned in
the preceding paragraph are first deposited in court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That should the defendant fail to sell the
property within the period of four (4) months, the plaintiff may offer it for
sale for at least one million pesos.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the trial be postponed to <st1:date year="1964" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1964</st1:date>, at <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30 a.m.</st1:time></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The parties are enjoined to abide by this order.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At the stated hearing of <st1:date year="1964" day="14" month="8">August
 14, 1964</st1:date>, the court, by order of even date, extended the period
stated in the pre-trial order for petitioner to sell the Hacienda for another
four (4) months upon agreement of respective parties' counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The court also reaffirmed the tenor of the
pre-trial order</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the lapse of the extension given, petitioner allegedly
sought for another extension but respondent objected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of the discussion, respondent
learned of a supposed sale made by petitioner of the Hacienda to the Land
Authority for P3,503,162.57 on <st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="8">August
 2, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court then
ordered the parties to go together to the Land Authority Office to check the
status of the alleged sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">The parties were never able to check the alleged sale together as
directed by the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1964</st1:date>, the first date
set, petitioner failed to show up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
counsel explained that he was sick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the following day set, <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="12">December 28,
 1964</st1:date>, respondent failed to appear due, it is claimed, to a
misunderstanding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both parties rendered
their respective report/manifestations on these incidents to the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1965</st1:date>,
respondent moved for authority to sell the Hacienda pursuant to the pre-trial
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over petitioner's opposition, the
lower court, on <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1965</st1:date>,
granted respondent's petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="2">February 3, 1965</st1:date>, respondent followed
up with a "Petition for Approval of Sale Proposition" wherein
Independent Investment Co., Inc., was offered as prospective buyer of the
Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Mapaya</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner sought a reconsideration of the order of <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1965</st1:date> on <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent countered with a "Petition
for Permission to Enter, Inspect and Determine the Property Offered for <st1:city><st1:place>Sale</st1:place></st1:city>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="2">February
 20, 1965</st1:date>, both motions were withdrawn by the parties respectively
in view of the reattachment of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Mapaya</span> on <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1965</st1:date> when respondent
posted an additional bond of P330,000.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, respondent filed a manifestation asking for the resolution
of his motion dated <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="2">February 3, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner in turn moved for the striking out
of said manifestation and for the dismissal of the case for failure to
prosecute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court, on <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1965</st1:date>, issued an order
authorizing respondent to offer Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Mapaya</span> for
sale to Independent Investment Co., Inc., for at least P1,000,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent then submitted a copy of the document of absolute sale
of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Mapaya</span> to Independent Investment Co.,
Inc., with a request for its approval.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1965</st1:date>,
petitioner moved to set aside the negotiations and order for the sale of the
Hacienda.</p>

<p class="BODY">Resolving the motion, the lower court issued an order dated May
3, 1965, denying the same; requiring petitioner and his counsel to show cause
why they should not be punished for contempt; ordering petitioner to execute a
deed of sale of the Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Mapaya</span> to Independent
Investment Co., Inc., for P1,000,000.00, and providing that if petitioner fails
to do so within 10 days, the Clerk of Court should execute the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner immediately took this recourse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was given due course, respondent
required to answer and preliminary injunction was issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner submits, in support of the petition, that the pre-trial
order is invalid and does not bind him because it did not faithfully and
truthfully reflect what actually transpired in the pre-trial conference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to petitioner, <u>contrary to all
that is stated in the pre-trial order</u>, what he actually did was to disclose
to Judge <span class="SpellE">Moya</span>, the trial judge, <u>in the strictest
confidence</u>, that he had already sold Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Mapaya</span>
to the Land Authority for P3,503,162.57 on <st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1963</st1:date> and was just awaiting payment of said
amount.</p>

<p class="BODY">If this were true, We cannot understand why petitioner did not
complain or question the lack of veracity of the pre-trial order in the
proceedings immediately subsequent thereto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He could not have failed to understand the import of the order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The terms thereof were very clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Instead of complaining, particularly when
the four months' period stated in the order expired, petitioner even asked for
an extension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Implicit herein is acquiescence
to the order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in at least two
subsequent instances, petitioner even expressly manifested his conformity to
said order.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
This belated attack, therefore, leveled against the pre-trial order of <st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="4">April 13, 1964</st1:date>, can no longer be
entertained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, petitioner's factual premise upon which he would have
Us set aside the pre-trial order which contains no patent defect is, at the
very most, disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent insists
that the pre-trial order merely reflected the working amicable settlement
agreed upon by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are more
inclined to accept this stand for petitioner certainly would not have acted the
way he did in the proceedings immediately subsequent to the issuance of the
order unless there was really an understanding between the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial Judge also denied that petitioner
ever told him of a completed sale already.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Under this setting, We cannot see our way clear to granting petitioner the relief
he seeks especially considering that the questioned pre-trial order has the
presumption of veracity in its favor<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
whereas petitioner has nothing but his bare allegations to support his claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, petitioner cannot complain of injustice nor of undue
deprivation of his property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
subsequent orders authorizing the sale of the Hacienda were only pursuant to
the terms of the pre-trial order which was the result of a conference wherein
he and his counsel were present and participated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner has only himself to blame for the
resulting prejudice - if any - to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And contrary to his assertion, there is no final adjudication yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pre-trial order has not, with finality,
determined just how much, if any, petitioner actually owes respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely, paragraph 3 of the pre-trial order
provides for an accounting first of respondent's claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And during the trial petitioner could still
substantiate his counterclaims against respondent and possibly defeat the
latter's right to collect.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition, for lack of merit, is hereby
dismissed and the preliminary injunction heretofore issued is revoked and set
aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against petitioner Domingo
Lao.</p>

in the "Opposition to Petition for Authority to Sell" dated Jan. 14,

the sale of the property and the deposit of the amount sufficient to cover the

Since Sec. 4 of Rule 20 of the Rules of Court requires the trial court, after
the pre-trial, to "make an order which recites the action taken at the
conference, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and the
agreements made by the parties as to any of the matters considered", it is
presumed, pursuant to Sec. 5(m) of Rule 131, that this duty was regularly and
faithfully discharged in the absence of competent proof to the contrary.</p>
