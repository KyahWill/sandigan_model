				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This appeal on a question of law is interposed by Jesus <span class="SpellE">Wylengco</span> from the decision of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> dismissing Civil Case No. 2679 on the
ground that the refusal of the City Fiscal of Angeles City to grant the appellant's
motion to dismiss, or to desist from proceeding with, the prelimi­nary
investigation in Criminal Case I.S. No. 693 amounted to a grave abuse of
discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that due to a typhoon which hit <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
sometime before <st1:date year="1964" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1964</st1:date>,
some of the bamboo trees growing on the residential lot of Jesus <span class="SpellE">Wylengco</span> at <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Entierro</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, <st1:place><st1:placename>Angeles</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, fell or leaned heavily
towards the adjoining lot owned by <span class="SpellE">Epifania</span> <span class="SpellE">Guezon</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cabigting</span>, causing considerable damage to her
concrete fence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter asked her
neighbor for permission to <span style="">cut </span>the
bamboos so she could repair her damaged fence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The permission was granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cabigting</span> spent her own money cutting the bamboo trees but
did not remove the main trunks remaining on the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently her failure to do <span style="">so </span>made <span class="SpellE">Wylengco</span>
angry, for at noontime on <st1:date year="1964" day="22" month="7">July 22,
 1964</st1:date>, he went to <span class="SpellE">Cabingting's</span> yard and
uttered defamatory remarks at her in the <span class="SpellE">Pampango</span>
dialect, as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Obat</span> <span class="SpellE">emo</span> <span class="SpellE">pepaloco</span>
ding pun, et <span class="SpellE">emo</span> <span class="SpellE">pepalinis</span>,
<span class="SpellE">puñieta</span> ca, <span class="SpellE">anac</span> <span class="SpellE">puta</span>, <span class="SpellE">puta</span> <span class="SpellE">nayda</span>
mo, <span class="SpellE">malandi</span>." Translated into English the
remarks were:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Why did you not have
the trunks removed, why didn't you have them cleaned, you daughter of a whore
and woman of loose morals." Many other words of similar import were added,
all in the presence of and within the hearing of many persons, including <span class="SpellE">Cabigting's</span> daughters, one of whom had to be sent to call a
peace officer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two days later, on <st1:date year="1964" day="24" month="7">July
 24, 1964</st1:date>, a complaint for serious oral defamation (I.S. No. 693)
was filed by <span class="SpellE">Epifania</span> <span class="SpellE">Guezon</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabigting</span>
against Jesus <span class="SpellE">Wylengco</span> with the City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office of Angeles City.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the preliminary investigation of the case on <st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="10">October 13, 1964</st1:date> before Special
Counsel <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>, one of the respondents herein, <span class="SpellE">Cabigting</span>
admitted on cross-examination that <span class="SpellE">Wylengco</span> was very
angry when he uttered the defamatory remarks in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was cor­roborated by <span class="SpellE">Pelagia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span>,
the lone witness for the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Fourteen days later, or on October 27, <span class="SpellE">Cabigting</span>
rested her case before the Special Counsel, pre­senting as part of her evidence
the sworn statement she had executed before the police of Angeles City dated
July 24, 1964 (Annex "A" of the petition).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day <span class="SpellE">Wylengco</span>,
through counsel, moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that inasmuch as
according to <span class="SpellE">Cabigting</span> the alleged defamatory
statements were uttered in the heat of <span style="">anger
</span>they would constitute merely the crime of slight oral defa­mation, and
since no information had been filed within two months from July 22, 1964, when
said remarks were uttered, the crime of slight oral defamation as defined in
Article 358 of the Revised Penal Code had already prescribed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="11">November 10, 1964</st1:date>
Special Counsel <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> denied the motion to dismiss
and directed <span class="SpellE">Wylengco</span> to present his evidence on
November 23 and <st1:date year="1964" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Wylengco</span> filed a
motion for reconsideration reiterating the same grounds alleged in his motion
to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This second mo­tion was
likewise denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 25, 1964, <span class="SpellE">Wylengco</span> filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and
prohibition with writ of preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, seeking to restrain the respondents
Special Counsel and the City Fiscal of Angeles City from proceed­ing with the
preliminary investigation of Criminal Case I.S. No. 693, and praying further
that after hearing the resolution of respondent Special Counsel <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> dated Novem­ber 10, 1964 be declared null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1964</st1:date>
<span style="">the trial court </span>issued the writ
of preliminary injunction asked for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">After the respondents filed their answer the trial court, on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="23" month="12"><span class="GramE">December 23, 1964</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, rendered judgment on the pleadings and on the memoranda of the
parties, dismissing the petition and dissolving the writ of preliminary
injunction.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The issue presented in this appeal is whether <span style="">or not the </span>respondent Special Counsel <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> acted with grave
abuse of discretion or in excess of her jurisdiction when she denied <span class="SpellE">Wylengco's</span> motion to dismiss and directed the preliminary
investigation to proceed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that in denying the motion to dismiss and the
motion for reconsideration, the respondent Special Counsel who conducted the
preliminary investigation did not rule squarely on the question of prescription
raised by <span class="SpellE">Wylengco</span>, but directed him to present his
evidence, if he so desired, so as to enable her to appreciate more clearly the
facts of <span style="">the </span>case based on the
testimony of both parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The denial of
the motion to dismiss was in effect a ruling that in the opinion of the
investigating counsel the evidence before her at that stage of the case did not
justify the dis­missal, or at least the grounds relied upon in the motion were
not indubitable, for which <span style="">reason she </span>wanted
to hear the evidence for herein petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such ruling cannot be considered as an abuse of discretion or in excess
of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was neither
arbitrary nor oppressive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out
by the Solicitor General, the doctrine relied upon by the appellant in his brief
<span style="">(People vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Doronila</span>,
40 O.G. 231; People <span style="">vs. </span>Modesto,
40 O.G. 128), to the effect that defamatory words uttered in the heat <span style="">of anger with some provocation </span>on <span style="">the part of the offended party would
constitute only slight oral defamation, would not apply in this case where
there is no evidence that there was such provocation at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In deciding the petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition
the lower court did not have the criminal charge for trial before it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The merits thereof were not in issue,
particularly the question of whether the statements at­tributed to <span class="SpellE">Wylengco</span> constituted serious or slight oral defamation and
whether the case had already prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only issue before the court was whether respondent Special Counsel
had acted with or without jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion in denying
the petitioner's mo­tion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
action taken by the Special Counsel was within her discretion in the
matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, such action did not
deprive <span class="SpellE">Wylengco</span> of his right to raise the defense of
prescription at the trial after the eleva­tion of the case to the court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed
and because the present appeal has merely served to delay final disposition of
the <span style="">case, </span>the appellant is
assessed treble costs.</p>
