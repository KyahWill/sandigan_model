				<H3>LEDESMA DE JESUS-PARAS, PETITIONER VS. QUINCIANO VAILOCES, RESPONDENT.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This concerns the disbarment of Quinciano Vailoces as member of the 
Philippine bar.
<p>It appears that as member of the bar and in his capacity as a notary public, 
Vailoces, on December 14, 1950 , acknowledged the execution of a document 
purporting to be the last will and testament of one Tarcila Visitacion de Jesus. 
Presented for probate before the Court of First Instance of Negros Oriental, the 
will was impugned by her surviving spouse and daughter. Consequently, the 
probate court, finding that the will was a forgery, rendered decision denying 
probate to the will. This decision became final. On the basis of this decision a 
criminal action for falsification of public document was filed against Vailoces 
and the three attesting witnesses to the will before the Court of First Instance 
of Negros Oriental where, after trial, they were found guilty and convicted. On 
appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision with regard to Vailoces but 
modified it with regard to his co-accused. As finally adjudged, Vailoces was 
found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of falsified of public 
document defined and penalized in Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code and was 
sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty ranging from 2 years 4 months and 1 
day of <em>prisión correccional</em>, as minimum, to 8 years 1 day of 
<em>prisión mayor</em>, as maximum, with the accessories of the law, fine and 
costs. This sentence having become final, Vailoces began serving it in the 
insular penitentiary. As a consequence, the offended party instituted the 
present disbarment proceedings.</p>
<p>In his answer, respondent not only disputes the judgment of conviction 
rendered against him in the criminal case but contends that the same is based on 
insufficient and inconclusive evidence, the charge being merely motivated by 
sheer vindictiveness, malice and spite on the part of herein complainant, and 
that to give course to this proceeding would be tantamount to placing him in 
double jeopardy. He pleads that the complaint be dismissed.</p>
<p>Under Section 25, Rule 127, of the Rules of Court, a member of the bar may be 
removed or suspended from his office as attorney if it appears that he has been 
convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. Moral turpitude, as used in this 
section, includes any act deemed contrary to justice, honesty or good 
morals.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> Among the examples given of 
crimes of this nature by former Chief Justice Moran are the crime of seduction 
and the crime of concubinage<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span>. The crime 
of which respondent was convicted is falsification of public document, which is 
indeed of this nature, for the act is clearly contrary to justice, honesty and 
good morals. Hence such crime involves moral turpitude. Indeed it is 
well-settled that "embezzlement, forgery, robbery, swindling are crimes, which 
denote moral turpitude and, as a genera] rule, all crimes of which fraud is an 
element are looked on as involving moral turpitude" (53 C.J.S., 1206).</p>
<p>It appearing that respondent has been found guilty and convicted of a crime 
involving moral turpitude it is clear that he rendered himself amenable to 
disbarment under Section 25, Rule 127, of our Rules of Court. It is futile on 
his part much as we sympathize with him to dispute now the sufficiency of his 
conviction, for this is a matter which we cannot now look into. That is now a 
closed chapter insofar as this proceeding is concerned. The only issue with 
which we are concerned is that he was found guilty and convicted by a final 
judgment of a crime involving moral turpitude. As this Court well said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The review of respondent's conviction no longer rests upon us, The judgment 
not only has become final but has been executed. No elaborate argument is 
necessary to hold the respondent unworthy of the privilege bestowed on him as a 
member of the bar. Suffice it to say that, by his conviction, the respondent has 
proved, himself unfit to protect the administration of justice." (In the Matter 
of Disbarment Proceedings against Narciso N. Jaramillo, Adm. Case No. 229, April 
30, 1957)</p></blockquote>
<p>The plea of respondent that to disbar him now after his conviction of a crime 
which resulted in the deprivation of his liberty and of his office as Justice of 
the Peace of Bais, Negros Oriental would be tantamount to placing him in double 
jeopardy is untenable, for such defense can only be availed of when he is placed 
in the predicament of being prosecuted for the same offense, or for any attempt 
to commit the same or frustration thereof, or for any offense necessarily 
included therein, within the meaning of Section 9, Rule 113. Such is not the 
case here. The disbarment of an attorney does not partake of a criminal 
proceeding. Rather, it is intended "to protect the court and the public from the 
misconduct of officers of the court" (In re Montagne and Dominguez, 3 Phil., 
588), and its purpose is "to protect the administration of justice by requiring 
that those who exercise this important function shall be competent, honorable 
and reliable; men in whom courts and clients may repose confidence" (In re 
McDougall, 3 Phil., 77).</p>
<p>Wherefore, respondent is hereby removed from his office as attorney and, to 
this effect, our Clerk of Court is enjoined to erase his name from the roll of 
attorneys.</p><em>Bengzon, Acting C.J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes,
