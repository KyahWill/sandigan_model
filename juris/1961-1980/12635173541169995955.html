				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by the spouses Lourdes V. <span class="SpellE">Ridad</span>
and Luis <span class="SpellE">Ridad</span> from the decision of the Court of
First Instance of Manila in civil case 64288, a <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>
suit, awarding to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Filipinas Investment
and Finance Corporation the amount of P163.65 repre­senting actual expenses and
<span style="">P</span>300 as attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The spouses <span class="SpellE">Ridad</span> bought from the
Supreme Sales &amp; Development Corporation, the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
assignor-in-interest, a <span style="">Ford Consul </span>sedan
for the total price of <span style="">P </span>13,371.40.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">sum
</span>of P1,160 was paid on delivery, the balance of <span style="">P12,211.50 being payable in </span>twenty-four equal <span style="">monthly installments, with interest at 12%
per annum, secured </span>by a promissory note and a chattel mortgage on the
car executed on <st1:date year="1964" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The spouses thereafter failed to pay five
consecutive installments on a remaining balance of P5,274.53.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="10">October
 13, 1965</st1:date> the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> instituted a <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> suit in the city court of Manila for the seizure
of the car (par. 7 of the complaint alleged "unjustifiable failure and
refusal of the defendants ... to surrender possession of the ... motor-vehicle
for the purpose of foreclosure"), or the recovery of the unpaid balance in
case delivery could not be effected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
car was then seized by the sheriff of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
and possession thereof was awarded to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the progress of the case, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> instituted extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings,
as a result of which, on <st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="12">December 22,
 1965</st1:date>, the car was sold at public auction with the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> as the highest bidder and purchaser.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, in view of the failure of the defendants-spouses to
appear at the scheduled hearing of the case, allegedly due to non-receipt of
the summons, they were declared in default.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The default judgment ordered them to pay to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
the sum of P500 as attorney's fees, and P163.65 representing actual expenses
relative to the seizure of the car, plus costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Their motion to set aside the order of default and the deci­sion
having been denied, they appealed to the Court of First <span style="">Ins­</span>tance of Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the case was called for pre-trial, the CFI advanced the
opinion that there was no need for the parties to adduce evi­dence and that the
case could be decided on the basis of the plead­ings submitted by the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court on <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="9">September
 5, 1966</st1:date>, rendered judgment for the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"As stated in the pre-trial order of this Court dated May 27,
1966, the only issue remaining to be resolved is whether the plaintiff is
entitled to receive P500.00 as attorney's fees and P163.65 for <span style="">expenses </span>incurred by the plaintiff in
the seizure of the car which was the object of the chattel mortgage executed by
the defendants in favor of the plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon consideration of the circumstances of the case, the
court holds that the plaintiff <span style="">is
entitled </span>to recover the amount of P163.65 which represents the expenses
incurred by the plaintiff in the <span style="">seizure
</span>of the car involved in this case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering that the plaintiff had recovered the car involved
in the case while it is still in the low­er court, and considering further that
the defendants did not resist the case and the only question said defendants
raised before this court is the amount of at­torney's fees, the court in the
exercise of its equitable jurisdiction reduces the attorney's fees granted to the
plaintiff by the lower court to P300.00."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the appellants contend that the trial court
erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">(1) </span>in rendering a decision which does not state the facts and
the law on which it is based, (2) in condemning the appellants to pay <span style="">P</span>300 for attorney's fees and <span style="">P163.</span>65 for expenses incurred <span style="">in </span>the seizure of the car which was
the object of the chattel mort­gage executed by them in favor of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, and (3) in not dis­missing the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> complaint.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. We uphold the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> contention
that the disputed decision of the lower court complies substantially with the
require­ments of law because it referred to the pre-trial order it issued on <st1:date year="1966" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1966</st1:date> which contains
substantial findings of facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
although settled is the doctrine that a decree with absolutely no­thing to
support it is a nullity, the law, however, merely requires that a decision
state the "essential ultimate facts upon which the court's conclusion is
drawn."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
There being an express reference to the pre-trial order, the latter must be
considered and taken as forming part of the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim, therefore, that the judg­ment
clearly transgresses the legal precept<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
because it does not state the facts of the case and the law on which it is
based and hence, is a nullity, finds no justification here.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. The appellants theorize that the action of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is for the payment of the unpaid balance of the
purchase price with a prayer for <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When, therefore, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
seized the car, <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span> foreclosed the
mortgage, had the vehicle sold, and bought the same at public auction as the
highest bidder, it thereby renounced any and all rights which it might have
under the promissory note as well as the payment of the unpaid balance, and,
consequently, what it would otherwise be entitled under and by vir­tue of the
present action, including attorney's fees and <span style="">costs of </span>suit, pursuant to article
1484 of the new Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
maintains that it is entitled to an award of attorney's fees and actual
expenses and costs of suit by virtue of the unjustifiable failure and refusal
of the appel­lants to comply with their obligations (one of which is the surren­der
of the chattel to the mortgagee upon the latter's demand), con­tending that
what is prohibited in art. 1484, <span style="">par. </span>3
of the new Ci­vil Code relied upon by the appellants is the recovery of the
unpaid balance of the purchase price by means of an action other than a suit
for <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>; that <span class="SpellE"><u>Luneta</u></span><u>
Motor Co. vs. Salvador, et al.</u> (L­13373, July 26, <span style="">1960) </span>is inapplicable to the present case because the remedy
sought in that case was in the conjunctive and not in the alternative, such
that, necessarily, when the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> therein
foreclosed the mortgage on the motor vehicle during the progress of the action,
the other action for a sum of money had to be dis­missed since the same could
not prosper as it would constitute a separate action for the recovery of the
unpaid balance contempla­ted in article 1484; and that in the present case,
however, the court awarded attorney's fees, costs of suit, and expenses incur­red
in relation to the seizure of the motor vehicle by virtue of the writ of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> in the same action because the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
was com­pelled to institute the same on account of the appellants' unjusti­fiable
failure and refusal to comply with the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
demands.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> further argues that the
award of attorney's fees and the costs of suit together with expenses incurred,
<span style="">was </span>stipulated both in the
promissory note and chattel mortgage con­tract; that even in the absence of
such stipulation, the award of attorney's fees is discretionary on the part of
the court pursuant to par. 2, art. 2208, new Civil Code; and that the said
award could likewise be made by the lower court on the basis of the ge­neral
prayer in the complaint for the award of whatever relief that the lower court
may deem just and equitable in the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the present action is one for <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>,
but because it culminated in the foreclosure of the chattel mortgage and the
sale of the car at public auction, it is our view that the provisions of art.
1484 of the Civil Code (Recto Law) must govern the resolution of the issue here
presented.</p>

<p class="BODY">This article recites that</p>

<blockquote>"In a contract of sale of personal property the price of which
is payable in installments, the vendor may exercise any of the following
remedies:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.35in;">“(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Exact fulfillment of the obliga­tion, should
the vendee fail to pay;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.35in;">“(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cancel the sale, should the ven­dee's failure
to pay cover two or more install­ments;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.35in;">“(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Foreclose the chattel mortgage on the thing
sold, if one has been constituted, should the vendee's failure to pay cover two
or more installments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case, he
shall have no further action against the purchaser to recover any unpaid
balance of the price.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any agreement to
the contrary shall be void."</p>

<p class="BODY">This article was reproduced from the old art. 1454-A, which in
turn was inserted by Act 4122 (Recto Law).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Three re­medies are available to the vendor who has sold personal
pro­perty on the installment plan:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
He may elect to exact the ful­fillment of the obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Bachrach</span> Motor Co.
vs. <span class="SpellE">Milian</span>, 61 Phil. 409) (2) If the vendee shall
have failed to pay two or more installments, the vendor may cancel the
sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(3) If the vendee shall have
failed to pay two or more installments, the vendor may foreclose the mortgage,
if one has been given on the property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The basis of the first option is the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basis of the last two options is Act 4122
(inserted in the Spanish Civil Code as art. 4154-A and now reproduced in arts.
1484 and 1485), amen­datory of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And the proviso to the right to foreclose is that if the vendor has
chosen this remedy, he shall have no fur­ther action against the purchaser for
the recovery of any unpaid balance owing by the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, as we see it, the Act does no
more than qualify the remedy."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The legal issue which is the core of the controversy in the case
at bar was resolved in <span class="SpellE"><u>Macondray</u></span><u> &amp; Co.

as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The plaintiff brought the action against the defendant to
obtain the possession of an automobile mortgaged by the latter, and to recover
the balance owing upon a note executed by him, the interest thereon, attorney's
fees, expenses of collection, and the costs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The defendant was duly summoned, but he fail­ed to appear or file his
answer, wherefore, he was declared in default and the appealed judgment was
rendered accordingly.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The plaintiff sold the defendant a <st1:city><st1:place>De
  Soto</st1:place></st1:city> car, <st1:city><st1:place>Sedan</st1:place></st1:city>,
for the price of which, P595, he exe­cuted in its favor the note of <st1:date year="1934" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1934</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under this note, the defendant undertook to
pay the car in twelve monthly installments, with 12 per cent inte­rest per
annum, and likewise agreed that, should he fail to pay any monthly installment
together with in­terest, the remaining installments would become due and
payable, and the defendant shall pay 20 per cent upon the principal owing as
attorney's fees, expenses of collection which the plaintiff might in­cur, and
the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To guarantee the performance
of his obligations under the note, the defendant on the same date mortgaged the
purchased car in favor of the plaintiff, and bound himself under the same
conditions stipulated in the note relative to the month­ly installments,
interest, attorney's fees, expenses of collection, and costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mortgage deed was <span style="">re</span>gistered on <st1:date year="1934" day="11" month="6">June 11,
 1934</st1:date>, in the office of the regis­ter of deeds of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the 22d of the same month, the defendant
paid P43.75 upon the first installment, and thereafter failed to pay any of the
remaining installments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In accordance
with the terms of the mortgage, the plaintiff called upon the sheriff to take
possession of the car, but the defen­dant refused to yield possession thereof,
whereupon, the plaintiff brought the <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> sought
and thereby succeeded in getting possession of the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The car was sold at public auction to the
plaintiff for <span style="">P250, </span>the latter
incurring legal expenses in the amount of P10.68.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the liquidation filed by the
plaintiff, the defendant was still indebted in the amount of P342.20, interest
at 12 per cent from <st1:date year="1934" day="20" month="11">No­vember 20,
 1934</st1:date>, P110.25 as attorney's fees, and the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In its last assignment of error plaintiff con­tends that even
granting that Act No. 4122 is valid, the court should have ordered the
defendant to pay at least the stipulated interest, attorney's fees and the
costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This question involves the
interpretation of the pertinent portion of the law, reading: 'How­ever, if the
vendor has chosen to foreclose the mort­gage he shall have no further action
against the pur­chaser for the recovery of any unpaid balance owing by the
same, and any agreement to the contrary shall be null and void.' This
paragraph, as its language shows, refers to the mortgage contract executed by
the parties, whereby the purchaser mortgages the chattel sold to him on the
installment basis in order to guarantee the payment of its price, and the words
'any unpaid balance' should be interpreted as having reference to the
deficiency judgment to which the mortgagee may be entitled where, after the
mort­gaged chattel is sold at public auction, the proceeds obtained <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> are insufficient to cover the <u>full </u><u><span style="">amount of the secured obligations which</span></u><span style="">, <u><span style="">in
the </span>case at bar as shown by the note and by the mort­gage deed,</u> <u>include
interest on the principal,</u> <u>at­torney's fees,</u> <u>expenses of
collection,</u> <u>and the costs</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fundamental rule which <span style="">should
govern </span>the interpretation of laws is to ascertain <span style="">the inten­</span>tion and meaning of the
Legislature and <span style="">to give ef</span>fect
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Sec. 288, Code of Civil <span style="">Procedure; </span>U. S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Toribio</span>, 15 Phil. 85; U. S. vs. Navarro, 19 Phil. 134; De

meaning to the unpaid balance of the principal,</u> <u>it would <span style="">have so </span>stated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></u>We hold, therefore, that the assignment
of error is untenable." (emphasis supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In other words, under this amendment as above interpre­ted, <span style="">in </span>all proceedings for the foreclosure
of a chattel <span style="">mortgage, </span>executed
on chattels which have been sold on the installment plan, the mortgagee is
limited to the property mortgaged<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and <span style="">is not </span>entitled to
attorney's fees and costs of suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a subsequent case<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
where the vendor in a sale <span style="">of perso­</span>nal
property in installments, upon failure of the vendee to pay his obligations,
the vendor commenced, through court action, <span style="">to re­</span>cover the unpaid balance of the purchase price, but <span style="">later, during </span>the progress of the
action, foreclosed the chattel <span style="">mortgage
const</span>ituted on the property, attorney's fees and costs of <span style="">suit were de</span>nied to the vendor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There the Supreme Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"Paragraph 3 of the above-quoted provision (article 1484, new
Civil Code) is clear that foreclo­sure of the chattel mortgage and recovery of
the un­paid balance of the price are alternative <span style="">remedies </span>and may not be pursued conjunctively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">appearing,
</span>in the case at bar that the vendor had already fore­closed the chattel
mortgage constituted on the <span style="">pro</span>perty
and had taken possession thereof, the lower court acted rightly in dismissing
the complaint filed for the purpose of recovering the unpaid balance of the
purchase price.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By seizing the truck and
foreclosing the mortgage at the progress of the suit, the <span style="">plaintiff renounced whatever claim it may
have had under the promissory note, and consequently, he has no more cause of
action against the <span class="SpellE">promissor</span> and the guarantor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And he has no more right either to the costs
and the attorney's fees that would go with the suit."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">This
might be considered a reiteration of the ruling in <span class="SpellE"><u>Macondray</u></span><u>.<o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A scrutiny of the doctrine
enunciated in the above-cited ca­ses will reveal that its ultimate and salutary
purpose is to prevent the vendor from circumventing the Recto Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congress sought to protect the buyers on
installment who more often than not have been victimized by sellers who, before
the enactment of this law, succeeded in unjustly enriching themselves at the
expense of the buyers, because aside from recovering the goods sold, upon de­fault
of the buyer in the payment of two installments, still retain­ed for themselves
all amounts already paid, and, in addition, were adjudged entitled to damages,
such as attorney's fees, expenses </span><span style="">a
</span><span style="">litigation and costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congress could not have intended to impair,
much less do away with, the right of the seller to make commer­cial use of his
credit against the buyer the buyer is not burdened beyond what this law allows.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It would appear from the emphasis and precision of the language
employed in the decisions already adverted to that in no instance whatsoever
may the mortgagee recover from the mort­gagor any amount or sum after the
foreclosure of the mortgage, for, as we understand it, the philosophy of the
Recto Law is that the underprivileged mortgagors must be afforded full
protection against the rapacity of the mortgagees.</p>

<p class="BODY">But while we unconditionally concur in, and give our approval to,
the basic philosophy of the Recto Law, we view with no small amount of
circumspection the implication, necessarily drawn from the above discussion,
that the mortgagee is not entitled to protection against perverse
mortgagors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the mortgagor plainly
refuses to deliver the chattel subject of the mortgage upon his failure to pay
two or more installments, or if he conceals the chattel to place it beyond the
reach of the mortgagee, what then is the mortgagee expected to do?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is part of conventional wisdom and the
rule of law that no man can take the law into his own hands; so it is not to be
supposed that the Legislature intended that the mortgagee should wrest or seize
the chattel forcibly from the con­trol and possession of the mortgagor, even to
the extent of using violence which is unwarranted in law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the mortgagee would enforce his rights
through the means and within the <span style="">limits
deli­</span>neated by law, the next step in such situations being the filing of
an action for <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> to the end that he may recover
immediate possession of the chattel and, thereafter, enforce <span style="">his rights in ac­</span>cordance with the
contractual relationship between him and the mortgagor as embodied in their
agreement, then it logically follows as a matter of common sense, that the
necessary expenses incurred in the prosecution by the mortgagee of the action
for <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> so that he can regain possession of the
chattel, should be borne by the mortgagor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Recoverable expenses would, in <span style="">our
view, </span>include expenses properly incurred in effecting seizure of the
chat­tel and reasonable attorney's fees in prosecuting the action for <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And we
declare that in this case before us, the amounts awarded by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
to the mortgagee (<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>) are rea­sonable.</p>

<p class="BODY">To the extent that our pronouncement here conflicts with the
ruling announced and followed in the cases hereinbefore dis­cussed, the latter
must be considered <u>pro</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>tanto</u></span> qualified.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
