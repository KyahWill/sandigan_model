<p class="BODY">On December 12, 1973, a contract was executed between respondent
Filipinas Mills Inc. and petitioner Julio Salacup whereby the former agreed to
sell one rice thresher with complete accessories to petitioner in exchange of
the quantity of palay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the
consideration, respondent claims that the purchase price is to be paid in the
form of 1,500 cavans of palay at 50 kilos per sack at the rate of P1.10 a kilo
or as computed, P82<span class="GramE">,500</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, petitioner asserts that
the prestation as to the price is P45<span class="GramE">,000</span> payable in
palay.</p>

<p class="BODY">The terms of payment as agreed upon by both parties are as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="5" month="4">April 5, 1976</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a complaint against respondent for the recovery of the
overpayment paid by the petitioner for the rice thresher with the Court of
First Instance of Isabela, Branch III, docketed as Civil Case No. III-194,
entitled "Julio Salacup, plaintiff, versus Ben Tan representing Filipinas
Mills Incorporated, defendants." In the complaint, petitioner avers that
he delivered 1,058 cavans valued at P51<span class="GramE">,557</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The price of the rice thresher is only P45<span class="GramE">,000</span> and therefore, there is an overpayment in the amount of
P6,557.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 7, 1978, respondent also filed a complaint for breach of
contract and/or collection of the undelivered 442 cavans of palay or its value,
P24,310 with the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch XXXIV docketed as
Civil Case No. 115997, entitled "Filipinas Mills, Inc. plaintiff, versus
Julio Salacup, defendant." In that com­plaint, respondent asserts that
petitioner delivered only 1,058 cavans out of 1,500 cavans of palay thereby,
leaving a balance of 442 cavans, under the same contract previously adverted
to.</p>

<p class="BODY">A motion to dismiss Civil Case No. 115997 was filed by petitioner
on the ground that there is another action pending between the same parties for
the same cause of action before the Court of First Instance of Isabela, Branch
III.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An opposition to the motion was
filed by re­spondent on <st1:date year="1978" day="28" month="7">July 28, 1978</st1:date>
alleging that the pendency of a case presupposes a valid service of summons and
copy of the complaint upon the defendant, and that no valid service of summons
and copy of the complaint have been served upon it.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1978</st1:date>,
respondent Judge issued an order which reads:</p>

<blockquote>“This is a Motion to Dismiss filed by the defendant thru counsel,
on the ground of <u>lis</u> <u>pendens.</u><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff filed its opposition to said Motion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After a careful consideration of the foregoing, the Court
finds the oppo­sition well taken, and on the grounds stated therein, the Court
hereby denies the Motion to Dismiss filed by the defendant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defendant is hereby required to file his Answer to the
Complaint within fifteen (15) days from receipt hereof."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration was filed by petitioner on <st1:date year="1979" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1979</st1:date> followed by an
opposition to motion for reconsideration filed by respondent on <st1:date year="1979" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1979</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge denied the motion for
reconsider­ation on <st1:date year="1979" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1979</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Unable to obtain <span class="GramE">a reconsideration</span>, the
petitioner filed this instant petition with this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1979</st1:date>,
this Court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining respondent Judge from
proceed­ing with or trying Civil Case No. 115997.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue raised before Us is whether or not there is
another action pending between the same parties for the same cause in the Court
of First Instance of Isabela, Branch III, within the meaning of Section 1,
paragraph (e) of Rule 16 of the Rules of Court enumerating grounds for a motion
to dismiss.</p>

<p class="BODY">The requisites for <u>lis</u><b> </b><u>pendens</u> as a ground
for dis­missal of a complaint are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1)
Identity of parties or at least such as representing the same interests in both
actions; 2) Identity of rights asserted and prayed for, the relief being
founded on the same facts; and 3) The identity in both cases is such that the
judgment that may be rendered in the pending case, regardless of which party is
successful, would amount to <u>res</u> j<u>udicata</u> in the other case.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Clearly, all these requisites are present in the two cases involved herein.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Firstly, in Civil Case No.</span> III-194 and
Civil Case No. 115997, the parties are the same for they are merely suing each
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although in the latter case, Ben
Tan is not a party therein, he was made a party in the first case as a
representative of respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, in the first case, petitioner prays for the collection
of the overpayment paid for the rice thresher to the respondent, while in the
second case, respondent asks for the undelivered cavans of palay as part of the
purchase price of the rice thresher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
identity of rights asserted and prayed for, is thus established, which shows
that the relief is founded on the same facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">And thirdly, with the identity of the cases as shown above, a
judgment that may be rendered in the first case would be determinative of the
rights of the parties concerned and thus, it would be <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u>
to the second case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent contends that <u>lis</u> <u><span style="">pendens</span></u> does not obtain here because pendency of a case
presupposes a valid service of summons and a copy of the complaint upon the
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar,
respondent alleges that no valid ser­vice of summons and copy of the complaint
have been served upon it.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in this contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 6, Rule 2 of the Rules of Court
"a civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court."
And as held by this Court in the case of Pampanga Bus Company, Inc. vs.
Ocfemia:<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"The rule of <u>lis</u> <u>pendens</u> refers to another
pending "action." An action starts only upon the filing of a
complaint in court.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The fact that when appellant brought the present case it did
not know of the filing of a previous case against it by appellees, as it
received the summons and a copy of the complaint only after it had filed its
own action against them, is im­material.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Suffice it to state that the fact is, at the time it brought the present
case, there was already another pending action between the same parties,
seeking to assert identical rights with identical prayers for relief based on
the same facts, the decision in which would be <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u>
herein."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It was also held in the case of Sotelo vs. Dizon, <span class="GramE">et</span>. al.:<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"Under Section 389 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a civil
action is deemed legally commenced from the date of the filing and docketing of
the complaint with the clerk of Court of First Instance, without taking into
account the issuance and service of the summons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 389 of the Code of Civil Procedure is
taken from section 405 of the California Code <span style="">of Civil Procedure, and the Supreme Court of said State has so interpreted
it in Tinn vs. United States District Attorney (148 Cal., 773); Dowling vs.
Comerford (99 Cal., 204); Ex parte Fil Ki (79 Cal., 584); and Nash vs. El
Dorado County (24 Fed. 252; 1 C.J., sec. 403, pp. 1155, 1156)."</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Patently, Civil Case No.</span> III-194 was
filed on <st1:date year="1976" day="5" month="4">April 5, 1976</st1:date>, very
much ahead of the filing of Civil Case No. 115997 on <st1:date year="1978" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the latter case was filed with the Court of First Instance of
Manila, the former filed with the Court of First Instance of Isabela was
already pending.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was an action
between the same parties for the same cause which should bar the later
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court, therefore, erred
in not granting the motion to dismiss.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed orders of <st1:date year="1978" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1978</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1979" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1979</st1:date> are set aside, and it is ordered that Civil
Case No. 115997 be as it is hereby dismissed, without prejudice to such
counterclaim as private respondent may wish to inter­pose in Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">III-194 of the Court of First Instance of Isabela, Branch III.</span></p>
