<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="4" day="25" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 
25, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
<span class="SpellE">Nasipit</span> Lumber Company, Inc. (NALCO) entered into a 
contract with both Young Men Labor Union Stevedores (YMLUS) and Victory 
Stevedoring and Labor Union (VISLU) whereby the two <span class="GramE">union</span> bound themselves to undertake on a 50-50 basis the 
stevedoring or loading jobs of the <span class="SpellE">NALCO's</span> export 
products from the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Port</span></st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Nasipit</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>. Said agreement was concluded in a conference called 
for such purpose in the presence of the Philippine constabulary officials 
stationed at </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Butuan</span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, the Justice of the Peace and Chief of Police of 
<span class="SpellE">Nasipit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, and the 
officials and representatives of NALCO and the two unions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On July 20, 1961, the YMLUS sent 
a letter to NALCO demanding the withdrawal of the loading jobs from the VISLU on 
the ground that the registration permit granted to the latter by the Department 
of Labor had been cancelled, and when VISLU was notified by the NALCO of such 
demand, it refused to abandon the 50% loading job granted to it under the 
agreement on the ground that the order of cancellation had not yet become final. 
On August 2, 1961, the YMLUS sent a notice of picketing to NALCO in which the 
'former threatened to carry out "our picket line beginning August 9, 1961 to 
continue uninterrupted until you make up your mind to stop the loading and 
unloading of cargoes by the defunct VISLU or reassign the same to us, the 
YMLUS."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On August 9, 1961, the NALCO 
filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations which, as amended, 
prayed among others, that pending final determination of the case the court 
issue an order enjoining both unions to observe the <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">status quo</span></em>; and, after due hearing, to 
decide which of the two unions should be given the stevedoring job in 
controversy or whether the 50-50 arrangement which was arrived at on April 25, 
1961 should be followed and complied with by the parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On August 23, 1961, after a 
series of bloody incidents resulting from the picketing by the members of the 
YMLUS and retaliation from the members of the VISLU, the NALCO filed a petition 
before the Court of Industrial Relations praying, among others, (1) to issue a 
temporary Restraining order against the officials, members and agents of the 
YMLUS, ordering them to refrain from blocking, obstructing, stopping, coercing, 
intimidating, or in any banner preventing the loading or unloading operations 
then assigned to the VISLU; (2) issue a similar temporary restraining order to 
the officers, members, and agents of the VISLU ordering them to desist in 
retaliating from the coercive acts of the YMLUS by any violent means; and (3) 
after due hearing, to issue an order making the two abovementioned injunctions 
permanent as to both unions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">At this stage of the proceedings 
both unions filed separate motion to dismiss mainly on the ground of lack of 
jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations to act on the controversy. 
Subsequently, however, both unions withdrew their respective motions to dismiss 
and voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the industrial court. On May 
16, 1962, Judge <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Martinez, to whom the case was 
assigned, rendered a decision enjoining the parties to continue observing the 
50-50 basis agreement entered into between them until it shall have been decided 
in a certification election to be undertaken by the Department of Labor which of 
the two unions should have direct relationship, thru collective bargaining, with 
the NALCO. The YMLUS and the NALCO filed each a motion for reconsideration only 
insofar as the decision ordered the holding of a certification election, and 
when both motions were denied by the court <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">en banc</span></em>, the YMLUS interposed the 
present petition for review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In assailing the jurisdiction of 
the Court of Industrial Relations, petitioner anchors his argument primarily on 
the doctrine enunciated by this Court in the case of <span class="SpellE">Paflu</span> <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. 
Tan, 99 Phil., 854, wherein this Court enumerated the cases over which said 
court can exercise jurisdiction. While said case does not include a controversy 
of this nature among those enumerated therein, it does not follow that the 
industrial court is bereft of jurisdiction over it for the same involves a 
certification election. It is clear from the provisions of Republic Act No. 875 
that <span class="GramE">matters pertaining to certification election involving 
two or more unions is</span> one that is addressed to the jurisdiction of the 
Court of Industrial Relations [Section 12 (<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">b</span></em>), Republic Act 875]. Moreover, 
petitioner is now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> to question the 
jurisdiction of the lower court for it is undisputed that it withdrew its motion 
to dismiss raising that issue and voluntarily submitted to its jurisdiction and 
presented its evidence. And so it has been held that "One who subjects himself 
to the jurisdiction of a court, even where he would not otherwise be subject to 
suit becomes subject to any valid claim asserted against him directly relating 
to the subject matter of his voluntarily initiated proceeding. * * * To permit 
one to invoke the exercise of jurisdiction within the general powers of the 
court and then to reverse its order upon the ground that it had no jurisdiction 
would, be to allow one to trifle with courts. The principle is one of <span class="SpellE">estopple</span> in the interest of a sound administration of the 
laws * * * closes the mouth of the complainant" (Perkins <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> 
Consolidated Mining Company, et al., 93 Phil. 1034).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We find no error in the order 
issued by respondent court requiring the Department of Labor to hold a 
certification election to determine which of the two unions should be the one to 
undertake the stevedoring job of the company. This is sanctioned by Section 12 
(<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">b</span></em>) of Republic Act 875. 
Moreover, this is the only expedient way by which the rivalry between the two 
unions may be solved to avoid friction and other unfortunate incidents. And 
considering that certification proceedings are investigatory in nature which had 
been entrusted exclusively to the Court of Industrial Relations, we do not feel 
justified to interfere, <span class="GramE">Unless</span> a grave abuse of 
discretion is shown. Such is not the case here. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Considering that certification 
proceedings are investigatory in nature, since-<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">'the object of the proceedings is 
not the decision of any alleged commission of wrong nor asserted deprivation of 
rights but is merely that determination of proper bargaining units and the 
ascertainment of the will and choice of the employees in respect of the 
selection of a bargaining representative, determination of the proceedings does 
not entail the entry of remedial orders or redress of rights, but culmination 
solely in an official designation of bargaining units and an affirmation of the 
employees' expressed choice of bargaining agent.' <span class="GramE">(Rothenberg 
on Labor Relations, pp. 514-515; Labor Laws by Francisco, 3rd ed., Vol.</span> 
I, p. 458);<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">taking into account that the 
conduct of such proceedings has been entrusted specifically to the Court of 
Industrial Relations (R. A. 875 sec. 12) and that they should be expedited as 
much as possible, this Court should not interfere with the discretion and 
judgment of that specialized tribunal in connection with such proceedings, at 
least in the absence of clear and patent abuse that in this case has not been 
shown to exist.’ (<span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> Consolidated, Inc., et al. 
vs. <span class="SpellE">Bobok</span> Lumber Jack Association, et al., L-11029 
&amp; L-11065, May 23, 1958)<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The claim that respondent court 
prohibited petitioner from exercising its constitutional right to picket is not 
correct. What the court prohibited was the commission of illegal acts in 
connection with picketing which under our jurisprudence can be lawfully done. As 
a matter of fact, the picketing has resulted in many bloody incidents because of 
the acts of retaliation on the part of the other rival 
union.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Finally, respondent court did not 
hold that petitioner is only entitled to 50% of the stevedoring work. What it 
declared was that the 50-50 arrangement concluded between the parties should 
continue until the result of the certification election shall have become final 
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and a collective bargaining contract 
entered into between the parties. This step is proper considering the situation 
then obtaining.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the order appealed from is 
affirmed. <span class="GramE">Costs against 
petitioner.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
