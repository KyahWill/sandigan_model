				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Original action for certiorari and pro­hibition, with preliminary
injunction, to dissolve a similar writ issued by the Court of Appeals in CA -
G. R. No. 34220-R, entitled "Juan T. David vs. Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Lingad</span>,
et al.," and to restrain the said Court from hearing said case, as well as
from enforcing t h e writ of preliminary injunction therein issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="5">May 28, 1962</st1:date>,
a shipment of thirty-six (36) crates, the contents of which were described in
the corresponding bills of lading as "stone grinders," arrived at <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
aboard the "SS MENTOR." Soon thereafter, that same day, without the
customs permit required <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, the cargo was
unload­ed shipside unto the barge or lighter "M/L <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>"
and then towed by tugboat "DB-18," headed for the <span class="SpellE">Estero</span>-Dead
End of <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before reaching this destination, a combined
team of operatives of the Manila Police Department and the Bureau of Customs
swoop­ed down on the barge and inspected the contents of said cases, which
turned out to be, not "stone grinders," but highly dutiable goods,
such as "<st1:place>Union</st1:place>" and "<st1:city><st1:place>Salem</st1:place></st1:city>"
ciga­rettes, Ban-<span class="SpellE">lon</span> shirts, French veils, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These were ordered seized by the Customs
authorities and held under Seizure Identification No. 6439, for alleged
violation of Central Bank Circular No. 133, in relation to Section 2530 (f) of
the Tariff and Customs Code, and of Section 2530(m)-1 and 5 of the same
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lighter and the tugboat were,
likewise, seized under Seizure Identification No. 6439-A, for alleged violation
of Section 2530(a) of said Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over,
on July 31, 1962, Criminal Case No. 65356 of t h e Court of First Instance of
Manila was filed, against fifteen (15) persons,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
for violation of Section 3602 of Republic Act No. 1937, charging them with surreptitiously
and fraudulently taking the goods aforementioned from the "SS MENTOR"
and bringing said goods into the mainland for the purpose of avoiding the
payment of taxes and duties, in the aggregate sum of P1<span class="GramE">,291,975.61</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 1, 1962, Atty. Juan T. David – herein-after referred to
as David – appeared at one of the hearings in connection with the seizure
proceedings, as counsel for one L. Sino, as alleged shipper of the goods, and
S. Y. Chan, as alleged consignee thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the completion of the evidence for the Government, David moved to
dis­miss the proceedings, but the then Acting Collector of Cus­toms<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> – hereinafter referred to as Collector – deferred
his resolution on the motion, until the rendition of the decision on the
merits, and directed the continuation of the hearing for the presentation of
the claimant's<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon later, David, filed an <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> motion for the release, under bond, of the
shipment in question, upon the ground that the same had been in effect stolen
from the Customs' premises without <span class="GramE">Chan' s</span> consent or
knowledge; that the goods were shipped to Manila for transshipment to him at
Singapore; that the shipment included perishable items; and that Chan could not
transship the cargo unless it was released and re-exported under bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Collector denied this motion upon the
ground, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that Chan's claim
over the shipment in question had not been satisfactorily established and that,
as regards the perishable nature of some of the goods involved, steps had been
taken for the sale thereof at public auction, pursuant to Section 2607 of the
Tariff Customs Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>David protested
against the contemplated sale, but the Collector did not heed the protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the Collector denied David's
motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for
reconsideration of the order to this effect was, likewise, denied on <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="2">February 17, <span style="">1964</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, or on March 16, 1964, David instituted Civil Case
No. 56533 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, against Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Lingad</span> and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>, as Acting
Commissioner of Customs and Acting Collector of Customs, respec­tively, as well
as in their personal capacities, for the pur­pose of securing: (1) a writ of
preliminary injunction to restrain the Collector from hearing Seizure
Identification Proceedings Nos. 643 9 and 6439-A; (2) a writ of mandatory
preliminary injunction, commanding respondents therein to surrender to David
the cargo in question or so much thereof as had not, as yet, been sold, for
transshipment to Singapore or to any foreign port, and to turn over to him the
proceeds of the sale made; and (3) a judgment nullifying the corresponding
warrant of seizure and detention and all other orders issued in connection
therewith, and <span class="GramE">sentencing</span> the respondents to pay
damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Required to answer the petition, respondents therein<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> filed a motion to dismiss and objected to the
issuance of the writs prayed for by David, for the reason that the Court of
First Instance of Manila had no jurisdiction over the case; that he had not
exhausted all administrative remedies before coming to court; and that he was
not the real party in interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting upon this motion, which was opposed by David, said court
of first instance dismissed the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
reconsid­eration of the order to this effect having been denied, David appealed
to the Court of Appeals, in which the appeal was docketed as CA-G. <span class="GramE">R. No. 34220-R.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>He,
also, filed with said Court, on <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="8">August
 31, 1964</st1:date>, a "Motion for Release of the Cargo Involved for
Transshipment without or with Bond; or for the Issuance of a Writ of
Preliminary Mandatory In­junction and Preliminary Injunction." David
prayed therein for the appointment of a qualified surveyor, to determine the
present value of the articles in question, so that it may serve as basis for
fixing the amount of the bond, and requested authority to transship the cargo
to any foreign port (not necessarily Singapore), "as the buyer thereof in
Singapore could not be expected to take delivery thereof due to its present
value which has been substantially reduced by <span style="">the deterioration of </span>some items and the depreciation in value of
others." David further prayed for an injunction to re­strain the Collector
from hearing the seizure cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without hearing the respondents therein<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> a
Division of the Court of Appeals approved, on <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1964</st1:date>, a resolution requiring them to answer
the aforesaid motion and providing that “upon the filing of a bond in the sum
of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> duly approved by the Court, a writ of
preliminary injunction will be issued as prayed for." The writ was issued
on <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Unaware of said resolution, the Solicitor General filed, on <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1964</st1:date>, an opposition to
David's motion of <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, upon receipt of notice of the
aforementioned resolution, the Solicitor General filed<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> an
"Urgent Mo­tion," praying that the enforcement of the writ issued on
"September 8, 1964, be held in abeyance pending resolution of the petition
for certiorari and prohibition to be filed with the Supreme Court" by the
Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Such
petition – for Certiorari and Prohibition with Preliminary Injunction, to
restrain the Court of Appeals, <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span><u>,</u> from hearing CA-G.</span> R. No.
34220-R and from enforcing the writ of preliminary injunction issued by said
Court – which marked the institution of the present case, was filed on
September 15, 1964, by Alberto de <span class="SpellE">Joya</span>, then Acting
Commissioner of Customs, and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>, as Acting
Collector of Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day, this
Court issued a resolution restraining the Court of Appeals from hearing CA-G.
R. No. 34220 -R and from enforcing the writ of preliminary Injunction therein
issued.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Two </span>questions are
submitted for our determination, in the present case, namely: (1) the merits
thereof; and, (2) a charge of contempt filed by respondent David.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the merits of this case, it is obvious that the Court
of First Instance of Manila had no jurisdiction over the subject-matter of
Civil Case No. 56533 thereof, and that neither had the Court of Appeals
jurisdiction over the appeal taken from the decision of said trial Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in said Case No. 56533 David sought
to obtain possession of the goods which were the object of seizure proceedings
before the Collector of Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have
already held that such action is beyond the jurisdiction of courts of first
instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Averia</span>, L-22526, Nov. 29, 1966, the following
language was used:</p>

<blockquote>"At issue is the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> to entertain Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">TM-114, and the existence of therein plaintiff's cause of action.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Petitioners would contend that the jurisdiction of the Bureau
of Customs to conduct seizure and forfeiture proceedings of vessels for
violation of the Tariff and Customs Code is exclusive of the Court of First
Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Tariff and Customs Code, in Section 2530 thereof, lists
the kinds of property subject to forfeiture.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the same time, in Part 2 of Title VI thereof, it provides for the
procedure in seizure and forfeiture cases and vests in the Collector of Customs
the authority to hear and decide said cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Collector's decision is <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the
Commissioner of Customs whose decision is in turn <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
to the Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>This original jurisdiction of the Court of
First Instance, when exer­cised in an action for recovery of personal property
which is a subject of a forfeiture proceeding in the Bureau of Customs, tends
to encroach upon, and to render futile, the jurisdiction of the Collector of
Customs in seizure and forfeiture proceedings</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Should Section 44(c) of the Judiciary Act of 1948 give way to
the provisions of the Tariff and Customs Code, or vice versa?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Our opinion, in this particular case, the <u>Court
of First Instance should yield to the jurisdiction of the Collector of Customs</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jurisdiction of the Collector of Customs
is provided for in Republic Act 1937 which took effect on <st1:date year="1957" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1957</st1:date>, much later than the Judiciary Act of
1948.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is axiomatic that a later law
prevails over a prior statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
<u>on grounds of public policy</u>, it is more reasonable to conclude that the
legislators intended to divest the Court of First Instance of the prerogative
to <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> a property which is a subject of a
seizure and forfeiture proceedings for violation of the Tariff and Customs
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Otherwise, actions for
forfeiture of property for violation of <span class="GramE">Customs<span style="">&nbsp; </span>laws</span> could easily be undermined by the
simple device of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span></u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>"Furthermore Section 2303 of the Tariff and Customs Code
requires the Collector of Customs to give to the owner of the property</u>
sought to be forfeited, <u>written notice of the</u> seizure and to give him
the <u>opportunity to be heard in his defense</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>This provision clearly indicates the
intention of the law to confine in the Bureau of Customs the determination of
all questions affecting the disposal of property proceeded against in a seizure
and forfeiture case</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judicial
recourse of the property owner is <u><span style="">not</span></u><span style=""> in the Court of First Instance <u>but in the
Court of Tax Appeals</u>, and <u>only after exhausting administrative remedies
in the Bureau of Cus­toms.</u> "<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the other hand, the
same result would be achieved if said civil case were regarded as an attempt to
review the acts and/or resolutions of the Collector of Customs and the
Commissioner of Customs in the aforementioned seizure proceedings, inasmuch as
such power of review is vested exclusively in the Court of Tax Appeals.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Again, the Court of
Appeals had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal from the order of dismissal
of the Court of First Instance because the jurisdiction thereof was involved in
the appeal and because the amount in controversy exceeds P200<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to David's petition in the court of
first instance, the value of the cargo, as determined by the Collector was
"<u>P628<span class="GramE">,844.87</span></u> more or less, " although
David alleged that such value "has been reduced to less than two-thirds
thereof or P400,000.00," whereas the taxes due thereon, according to the
information in Criminal Case No. 65356, amounted to P1,291,975.61, or, pursuant
to the decision therein rendered, P1,920,820.48.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is manifest,
therefore, that the writ of preliminary injunction of the Court of Appeals is
null and void, and that the writ </span>issued by this Court, on <st1:date year="1964" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1964</st1:date>, should be, as it
is hereby made permanent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts relevant to the charge of contempt are: On <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1964</st1:date>, David filed with
this Court an "Urgent Motion for Release of Cargo Involved for
Transshipment, without or with Bond; <span class="GramE">Or</span> for the
Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction." Required to
comment thereon, the Solicitor General filed an opposition thereto, dated <st1:date year="1964" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1964</st1:date>, stating, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that the original manifest did not
disclose that the goods in question were in transit to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and that the surrounding circumstances indicated that they were destined for <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="29" month="12">December
 29, 1964</st1:date>, David filed a reply to said opposition and a motion to
cite the Collector of Customs for contempt for twice subscribing, under oath,
to the statement, in the original peti­tion for certiorari in the Supreme
Court, that the cargo was destined for <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
according to the original Manifest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1965</st1:date>, petitioners herein
filed a manifestation attaching thereto a copy of the decision of the Court of
First Instance of Manila in Criminal Case No. 65356, convicting some of the
accused therein, acquitting the others on the ground of reasonable doubt, and
decreeing the forfeiture to the Republic of all the goods in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said manifestation added, however, that:</p>

<p class="NUM">“3. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> upon
verification from the records of Seizure Identification Nos. 6439 and 6439-A,
the original manifest of the <span style="">M. S. </span>Mentor
issued by the De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> Lines, the ship's local
agent, shows that <u><span style="">the ship is 'bound
for <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> to Manila</span></u><span style="">.' </span>Also under the column 'Remarks,'
there appears <u><span style="">in the handwriting of
Atty. Juan T. David, respondent herein</span></u><span style="">, <u>the words 'In transit for Singapore</u>,' </span>which was <u><span style="">placed by him during the hearing of the
motion for reconsideration</span></u><span style=""> </span>of
the order of the Collector of Customs denying the motion to dismiss Seizure
Identification Nos. 6439 and 6439-A entitled 'Republic of the Philippines,
versus 36 Crates various articles, S. Y. Chan, claimant.'</p>

<p class="NUM">“4. That the original manifest mention­ed above was presented in
evidence in said Criminal Case No. 65356 of the Court of First Instance of
Manila."</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 3, 1965, David filed a motion to strike out this
manifestation, as well as a counter-manifestation in defense of his integrity,
in view of the implication adverse thereto resulting from the allegation that
he had inserted, in his own handwriting, on the document introduced by him to
prove the claim of his client, the very words on which the claim was
based.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 8, 1965, David
charged petitioners herein with contempt of court upon the ground that they had
maliciously made the above-quoted statement in their Manifestation of January
25, 1965, as well as statements of similar import in their petition for
certiorari in this case dated September 14, 1964, and in their aforementioned
opposition, dated December 18, 1964, knowing that said statements were not
true.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that the copy of the manifest, presented in
evidence in the seizure identification proceedings, stated that the "SS
MENTOR" is "bound from <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> to
Manila," and that, under the column "Remarks," there appears, in
the handwriting of David, the words "In Transit for Singapore," which
were written by him during the hearing of his motion for reconsideration of the
order of the Collector denying the motion to dismiss said proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears, however, that said insertion was made by David <u>with
the authority of the hearing officer of the Bureau of Customs</u>, so that the
copy of the manifest, covering the shipment in question and therein introduced
in evidence, may <u>conform</u> with the original manifest, which formed part
of the evidence introduced <u>in the criminal case</u>; that the Solicitor
General was <u>not</u> aware of this circumstance when he made the derogatory
averments upon which the charge for contempt is based, because the only records
then available for his examination were those of the Bureau of Customs, which
showed the addition handwritten by David; and that the records of the criminal
case, to which the original manifest had been attached, were <u>not</u>
available for examination at that time, <u>said records being then in the
possession of the Judge a quo, pending preparation of his decision therein.</u></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is, likewise, worthy
of note that the Solicitor General <u>revealed</u> the foregoing circumstance
to this Court, even <u>before</u> the </span>formal <span style="">charge for contempt under consideration had been </span>preferred by
David on February 8, 1965. Indeed, on <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="2">Feb­ruary
 4, 1965</st1:date>, the Solicitor General had filed an amended Manifestation
stating, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,</p>

<blockquote>"That, subject to verification from the records of Criminal
Case No. 65336, respondent Juan T. David, who is a lawyer of S. Y. Chan the
claimant-consignee of the goods in question in the Bureau of Customs Seizure
Identification Case Nos. 6439 and 6439-A, was <u>allowed by the Hearing Officer
to insert the words 'In transit for Singapore'</u> in Exhibit 'A' of said
seizure proceedings, <u>in order to reflect the information stated under the
column remarks</u> in the original copy of the general (original) manifest
submitted in evidence in said criminal case;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That upon examination made of the records of said criminal
case, it was found that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">“(a) Exhibit ‘A' of the criminal case is the original copy of the
general manifest mentioned in paragraph 3 hereof and that Exhibit ‘A' of the
criminal case contains the <u>printed words</u> 'In transit for Singapore'
under the column remarks; consequently, the original manifest stated in
paragraph 3, as corrected by Atty. Juan T. David, <u>accurately reflects the
information stated in Exhibit 'A'</u> of the criminal case; and</p>

<p class="2Q">“(b) Exhibit 'CC' of the criminal case, which is the original copy
of Annex 6 of Respondents' (herein petitioners) Memorandum, Civil Case No.
56533, also contains the printed words 'In transit for Singapore' under the
column remarks; however, the <span class="SpellE">photostat</span> copy of said
Exhibit CC, which is Exhibit J, Seizure Proceedings No. 6439 and 6439-A (Also
Annex 6 of Respondents' Memorandum, Civil Case No. 56533) does <u>not</u> show
such printed words." (Underscoring supplied.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Everything considered, we are of the opinion that the derogatory
statements assailed by David had been made in good faith, and inasmuch as
petitioners herein have seasonably made of record additional facts, formerly
unknown to them, showing that David had acted above board, the explanation
submitted by said petitioners is believed to be satisfactory.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the charge of contempt should be, as it is
hereby, dismissed, the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Court of
Appeals is nullified and the writ of preliminary injunction issued by this
Court made permanent, with costs against respondent Juan T. David. Writ
granted.</p>
