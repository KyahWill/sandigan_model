<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">On <st1:date year="1964" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1964</st1:date>, however, <span class="SpellE">Periquet</span>
filed a motion to set aside the compromise agreement, the decision, and for new
trial,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
on the ground that he had signed the Compromise Agreement on the mistaken
belief that the portion equivalent to 36-2/3% of the properties of the Suarez
Estate, Inc. was being allotted to him in his personal capacity. <span style="">As </span>in the decision, the share was
given to him as representative of his deceased wife, <span class="SpellE">Periquet</span>
claimed that the Compromise Agreement did not reflect the true intention of the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other parties to the
agreement opposed the motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">By order of <st1:date year="1964" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1964</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Periquet</span> motion was denied, the court reasoning,
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering that all the parties agreed on, and signed, the
compromise, that it was the defendant-<span class="SpellE">movant</span> and his
counsel who prepared the document embodying the same and who insisted before
the Court at the hearing on February 20, 1964 that the other parties sign the
same because it embodied their true agreement for which reason the Court denied
the motions of the other parties to defer the signing, and considering further
that after the Court rendered its decision based on, and approving the
compromise, said defendants sought to have said decision im­plemented or
executed, and even asked for a receiver­ship in order that the properties may
be disposed of according to the terms of the compromise, the Court is of the
opinion and so holds that there is no ground for setting aside, or for
reforming or changing, the same and the decision of the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> to claim that
the compromise, as prepared by him and his lawyer, does not express the true
intentions of the parties."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Copy of this order was allegedly received by counsel for the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> on <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="7">July 3,
 1964</st1:date>; and on <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1964</st1:date>,
he filed a notice of appeal and appeal bond.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The record on appeal was filed on <st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
plaintiffs and defendant <span class="SpellE">Flaviana</span> <span class="SpellE">Muli</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Suarez opposed approval of the appeal, on the
grounds that the decision, based on a Compromise Agreement, is not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>, and that the decision had already became
final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, when by order of October 3,
1964, the court disallowed the appeal and disapproved defendant's record on
appeal, and denied <span class="SpellE">Periquet</span> 's motion for
reconsideration of that order, the latter came to this Court charging the Court
below of having abused its discretion in allegedly amending the terms of the
compromise agreement and in depriving him of the right to appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Generally, a judgment on a compromise agreement is not only
without appeal, but is also immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
the reason being that when the parties agree to settle their differences, to
end a pending litigation, and request the court to render judgment based on
their said agreement, there is an implied waiver of their right to appeal from
the decision.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The exception to the rule is provided in case a party to the compromise
agreement moves to set it aside on the ground of fraud, mistake or duress; in
which event, an appeal would exist from the order denying the motion.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The issue here presented, therefore, is whether or not the case
at bar comes within the exception to the general rule, that the denial of
petitioner's appeal by the lower court amounted to grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">To fall within the exception to the general rule, the moving
party must allege vitiated consent to the agreement, by reason of fraud,
mistake or duress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But not every act
that may be considered fraudulent, erroneous or under duress, can be the basis
for annulling a contract. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>A mistake,
specifically, shall invalidate consent only if it refers to the substance of
the thing which is the object of the contract, or to the condition which has
principally moved one or both parties to enter into the contract (Art. 1331,
new Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, the error
must be the causal, not merely incidental, factor that induced the complaining
party to enter into the agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, the mistake alluded to by petitioner as
having vitiated the <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> of his
participation in the compromise agreement consisted in the mistaken belief that
he would receive the allotted portion in his personal capacity; that the
properties would belong to him solely.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This would contradict the explicit terminology of the 5th paragraph of
the agreement, partitioning the remaining unsold lots among the
"incorporators and heirs of the deceased incorporators", and which
was drafted by no <span style="">less </span>than
appellant 's personal counsel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering that from the context of the agreement, it is apparent that it
was entered into to determine the properties of the Suarez Estate, Inc. and to
fix and deliver the respective shares of the incorporators-contributors, and
that it was the wife, Maria Suarez, not the husband Francisco <span class="SpellE">Periquet</span>, who made contribution to the corporation, it
cannot really be claimed that the lower court made an alteration of the
compromise agreement when it adjudged the 5 lots enumerated in paragraph 6
"as the share of the co-incorporator­-contributor Maria Suarez as such
incorporator-contributor, represented in the compromise agreement by her
surviving spouse Francisco <span class="SpellE">Periquet</span>." That <span class="SpellE">Periquet</span> originally considered this order as in accord with
the agreement of the parties is evidenced by the fact that after the judgment
was rendered, he filed two motions seeking for its enforcement or
execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently realizing much
later the implication of the phraseology of the agreement, as carried out in
the decision of the lower court, he belatedly contested the validity and due
execution of said compromise agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">But assuming that the effect of the wording of paragraph 5 of the
agreement was not anticipated by petitioner when he and his counsel prepared
the instrument and prevailed on the other parties to sign it, this is not the
kind of mistake that would justify nullification thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Miscalculation or <span class="SpellE">misappreciation</span>
of its legal import, where the party as in this case is assisted by counsel,
will not provide basis for setting aside of a compromise agreement on the
ground of mistake of error. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>A
compromise, entered into and carried out in good faith, will not be discarded
even if there was a mistake of law or fact;<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and in this <span style="">case </span>the parties
have gone to the extent of drawing lots as provided in the seventh (7)
paragraph of the compromise agreement (Decision, Court of First Instance, p.
4).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The application of the rule to the
present case becomes all the more imperative when it is borne in mind that <span class="SpellE">Periquet</span> 's proposal would result in depriving his wife's
surviving mother, <span class="SpellE">Flaviana</span> <span class="SpellE">Muli</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Suarez of her hereditary share in this
36-2/3% and vesting all of it upon the husband, contrary to our laws of
succession (Civil Code, Art. 997).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Periquet</span> adverts to the
circumstance that in his proposals previous to the final compromise agreement,
he had insisted in being personally assigned a share in the properties equal to
that granted to his mother-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Flaviana</span> <span class="SpellE">Muli</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find little
relevancy in these proposals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
essence of com­promises being mutual concessions by the parties to avoid or end
litigation, it is to be expected that neither will be able to maintain his
initial demands wholly unaltered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Changes are naturally made in the course of bargaining, and the final
agreement rarely coincides with the original terms proposed by either
side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since, as previously remarked, the
purpose of <span style="">the
compromise </span>agreement in question, was in its 4th paragraph, "to <u><span style="">return</span></u><span style=""> </span>to each of the incorporators their respective
contributions" to the capital of Suarez Estate, Inc., (as expressed in its
paragraph 4) and appellant <span class="SpellE">Periquet</span> was concededly
not such an incorporator, while his wife and mother-in-law were, it is
difficult to perceive on what basis <span class="SpellE">Periquet</span> could in
law or justice demand any portion of the distributed properties except as his
wife's representative, nor how he could assert error in his not becoming a <span class="SpellE">distributee</span> in his personal capacity.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Periquet</span> 's argument that <span style="">the Philippine </span>Trust, as administrator
of his late wife's estate did not sign the compromise, is one that is not
available to him for evading the effect of his own consent thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If at all, only the Administrator may raise
the objection, and its prolonged silence is evidentiary of acquiescence to the
compromise.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's contention being plainly untenable, there would be no
point in declaring that the Court below abused its dis­cretion in refusing to
give due course to the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if
appellant were technically entitled to a mandamus, the net result would merely
be further delay in adjudicating that his case is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the conclusion thus reached, there is no need to pass
upon the question of the timeliness or <span class="SpellE">untimeliness</span>
of the appeal filed by petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby dismissed, with costs
against the petitioner.</p>
