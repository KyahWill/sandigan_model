logging operations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 22 <span style="">and </span></span><st1:date year="1957" day="17" month="5"><span style="">May 17, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Marababol</span> advised </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">P</span><span style="">atanao</span></span><span style=""> that, effective

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><span style="">February </span><span style="">6, </span><span style="">1958, Amos notified <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> that, be­fore any action could be taken on his

</span><span style="">was seemingly in favor of a </span>renewal
for a term of one-year only, to expire <span style="">on
June 30, </span>1959; but, before <span style="">he </span>could
forward the<span style=""> </span>pertinent papers to
t<span style="">he</span> Secretary <span style="">of Agriculture and Natural </span>Resources,
for the <span style="">latter's approval, <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span> asked Amos to withhold action upon the ground that <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> was not qualified to engage </span>in logging
operations; that his application for renewal had not complied with some requirements
<span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, and <span style="">that
</span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pat</span>anao</span>
had committed certain specified irregularities.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As </span><span style="">a consequence, Amos informed <span class="SpellE">Marababol</span> that </span>he <span style="">(Amos) had withheld action on <span class="SpellE">Patanao's</span>

notify <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> that further operations would be
illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Marababol</span>
transmitted this information to <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> and directed
him to stop imme­diately his operations, the same being illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> sought a
reconsideration, and, subsequently, protested against the refusal of <span class="SpellE">Marababol</span> to clear his logs for <span style="">ex</span>port and the imposition of a 300% surcharge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Office of the District Forester of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> replied stating that it was merely carrying out

<span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> "persisted in his logging operations </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">defiance of the order of Director Amos". </span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Moreover, </span><span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1958" day="17" month="6"><span style="">June </span><span style="">17, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> commenced
</span><span style="">Special </span><span style="">Civil </span><span style="">Case No. </span><span style="">50 </span><span style="">of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, for
injunction </span>and damages, with preliminary injunction, against <span style="">Amos </span>and <span class="SpellE">Marababol</span>,
including his assistant forester, Pedro B. Sal­vador.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> alleged, in his petition, that<span style=""> he </span>is the holder of a timber license,
which had been renewed from year to year, and that Salvador had seized 70
pieces of logs cut by <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> in the area covered by
said license, allegedly <span style="">upon <span style="">orders </span></span>of Amos and <span class="SpellE">Marababol</span>, upon the ground that his (<span class="SpellE">Patanao's</span>)
application for renewal of license had not been approved and that he had not
paid the surcharges imposed upon him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Patanao</span>, prayed, therefore, that respondents<span style=""> </span>therein be sentenced to pay damages,
and restrained from interfering with his logging operations, and from imposing
surcharges upon him, as well as directed to release the aforementioned logs and
to allow him to dispose of the logs cut in the forest area covered by his
alleged ordinary timber license.</p>

<p class="BODY">After appropriate proceedings, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> rendered judgment for <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span>,
prohibiting respondents therein from interfering with his logging op­erations, <span style="">res</span>training
them from imposing surcharges, ordering them to allow the transportation, sale
and shipment of all logs cut under his timber license(?) and sentencing them to
pay P25,000 by way of damages, in addition to the <span style="">costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>On appeal taken by
said respondents, this judgment was, on January 24, 1962, <u>reversed</u> by
the Court of Appeals in CA-GR No. 27271-R, for the reason that <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> "has no duly issued and valid timber license
to operate in the areas in question from July 1, <span style="">1958 </span>to June 30, 1959;" that he was delinquent in the
payment of taxes and surcharges aggregating P163,066.46; that the writ of
preliminary injunction issued by the lower court was "manifestly
erroneous"; and that there was no justification, therefore, for the award
of damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Court of
Appeals became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> on <st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="3">March 28, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A little over a month prior to the institution of <span style="">said Case No. 50, or on May 5, </span>1958, <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> had instituted Special Civil Case No. 48 of the <span style="">same </span>Court
of First Instance, against <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span> and one <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Merin</span>, to recover damages
<span style="">re</span>sulting
from their alleged illegal entry into the <span style="">area co­</span>vered by the timber <span style="">license </span>that
he (<span class="SpellE">Patanao</span>) claimed to have and the cutting of logs
therein by said respondents, as well as to restrain them from interfering with
his logging operations within said area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the course of said proceedings, the Clerk of Court of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, Mariano C. <span class="SpellE">Conde</span>, had
issued, on February 7, 1964, in compliance with an order of Judge Ortiz dated
February 5, 1964, a "writ of attach­ment and garnishment," addressed
to the Sheriff of Manila, directing him to "attach the estate, real and
personal, of <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span>, <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> to the
value" of <span class="SpellE">Patanao's</span> "demands" in said
case "and costs of suit." Pursuant to said writ, the She­riff of
Manila attached and garnished properties of <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, <a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
the latter filed Case CA-GR L-33604-R of the Court of Appeals, for a writ of
certiorari and prohibition, with preliminary injunction, against Judge Ortiz,
his Clerk of Court (<span class="SpellE">Conde</span>) and <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After giving due course to the petition and
issuing the writ of preliminary injunction therein prayed for, the Court <span style="">of </span>Appeals, dismissed the pe­tition, <a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
upon the ground that the amount involved therein is beyond its jurisdiction,
and within that of the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The action thus taken by the Court of Appeals was sustained by us in
L-22948.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Consequently, on May 28,
1964, <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span> filed, against the same respondents in
CA-GR No. 33604-R, the petition in L-22978, for a writ of certiorari and
prohibition, with preliminary injunction, to annul the aforementioned writ of
attachment and garnishment in Case No. 48 and to restrain the enforcement
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the filing of a P20,000 bond,
we issued a writ of preliminary injunction and ordered the respondents to set
aside such attachment or garnishment as may have been levied upon the
properties of <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In a seeming effort to
settle the conflict between <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span>, the Director of Forestry sought to con­duct a survey
of the common boundary of the areas covered by their respective claims; but, on
motion of <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span>, Judge Ruiz issued, on November 3,
1964, an order prohibiting the officials and employees of the Bureau of
Forestry, including the Philippine Constabulary, "from entering the areas
subject of litigation x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
without previous authority from" the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This order
was, on motion for reconsideration filed by Buena and <span class="SpellE">Merin</span>,
sustained by Judge <span style="">Ortiz.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, on <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="3">March
 25, 1965</st1:date>, the Director of Forestry and the District Forester of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> instituted Case G.R. No. L-24345, for certiorari end
prohibition, with preliminary injunction, against Judges Ortiz and Ruiz, as
well as <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span>, to annul said order of Novem­ber 3,
1964, and restrain its enforcement, alleging that said order is void for want
of jurisdiction over the of­ficials and employees of the Bureau of Forestry and
the Philippine Constabulary, who are not parties in Case No. 48.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the filing of the petition in said Case,
or on <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1965</st1:date>, we
issued the writ of preliminary injunct­ion therein prayed for.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, the issue raised by <span class="SpellE">Patanao's</span>
appli­cation for renewal and the opposition thereto filed by <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span> had, on <st1:date year="1960" day="17" month="6">June
 17, 1960</st1:date>, been decided by the Bureau of Forestry in favor of <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span>. On motion for reconsideration filed by <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span>, on June 27, 1960, the <span style="">Bureau </span>of Forestry, issued on October
11, 1960, an order suspending the effects of said decision, as well as the
resolution of said motion, until certain criminal and civil cases pend­ing
against <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> "are finally resolved by the
correspond­ing authorities x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1961</st1:date>,
the Director of Forestry rendered another decision rejecting <span class="SpellE">Patanao’s</span> application for re­newal and declaring the areas
covered by the same vacant, upon the ground that said cases were <u><span style="">prima</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>facie</u>
evidence of violations of the terms and conditions of his timber license.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later on, one of the criminal cases against <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> was dismissed and he was acquitted in another
criminal case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the Bureau of
Forestry found that two (2) civil cases against <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span>
did not refer to the logging operations under his timber license.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, on October 3, 1963, the then Acting
Director of Forestry, <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> Bernal, rendered a
decision giving due course to <span class="SpellE">Patanao's</span> application
for renewal, "upon satisfactory showing that all his accounts consisting
of forest charges and surcharges and reforestation funds, if any, shall be
first settled before the issuance of the corresponding licenses and that he
possesses sufficient financial capa­bilities and adequate logging
equipment." No new timber <span style="">License </span>was, however, <span style="">issued </span>to <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 3, 1964, the acting Director of Forestry, <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> Rivera, who had succeeded Director Bernal, issued
an order holding in abeyance the execution of the latter's decision,
"pending verification of the truth of the alle­gation that the area
covered thereby had already been de­forested and had long been under
cultivation." On May 31, 1965, the Director of Forestry ordered the
District Forester of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> to stop all logging
operations of <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> be­cause he was "operating
without <span style="">licenses",
</span>and "to secure PC assistance if necessary and prosecute criminally
to make <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> respect forestry authority."
Upon being advised of this development, on or about June 3, 1965, <span class="SpellE">Pa­tanao</span> instituted Special Civil Case No. 190 of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, against the Director of
Forestry, the District Forester of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, the Forest
Offi­cer of <span class="SpellE">Bayugan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>,
the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources <span style="">and </span>the PC, to prevent - first by a writ of preliminary
injunction, and later by permanent injunct­ion - the enforcement of the
aforementioned instructions of the Director of Forestry, and to compel him to <span style="">issue </span>and
release the renewed timber license applied for.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alleging that the area claimed by <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span>
overlaps over and encroaches upon the forested area covered by a timber license
in favor of <span class="SpellE">Bueno's</span> Corporation, the latter filed on <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1965</st1:date>, <span style="">a </span>motion to
intervene in Said Case No. 190.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It,
likewise, moved to dismiss <span class="SpellE">Patanao's</span> complaint
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither motion was, however,
acted upon by the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the other hand, </span><span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="6"><span style="">June 25, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Director </span>of Forestry and the

their answer with affirmative defenses, reiterating, in effect, the allega­tions
made in their aforementioned opposition to a preli­minary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that the day before, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, presided over by Judge Ruiz, had - on motion of <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span>, based upon the allegation that the PC had not as
yet filed its answer, although it had been <span style="">served </span>with summons on June 7, 1965 -
declared the PC in default and authorized <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> to
present his evidence against the PC on July 2, 1965, and the day following the
presentation of said evidence, or on July 3, 1965, Judge Ruiz rendered a
decision against the PC and <span style="">issued </span>against the same and "any person or persons acting in
their x <span class="SpellE">x</span> behalf" a writ of "permanent
preliminary injunction", restraining and prohibiting them from enforcing
the afore­mentioned order of the Director of Forestry, dated May 31, 1965, and
from stopping, delaying, molesting or disturbing <span class="SpellE">Patanao's</span>
logging operations in the disputed area, as well as directing the PC, its
officers and soldiers to <span style="">re­lease </span>certain trucks and logs of <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span>
that had been impounded and confiscated upon receipt of the order afore­mentioned.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1965</st1:date>,
the Provincial Commander of the PC in <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> filed an
Urgent Motion for Reconsideration of said decision. On <st1:date year="1965" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1965</st1:date>, the Director of Forestry and <span class="SpellE">Bueno's</span> Corporation commenced Case G.R. No. L-24770, for a
writ of certiorari and prohibition, with preliminary injunction, against <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> and Judge Ruiz, alleging that <span style="">said </span>partial
decision of July 3, 1965, constituted a gross violation of the Rules of Court
and of established prece­dents; that said motion for reconsideration of the PC
had not as yet been acted upon; that the delay in <span style="">its </span>resolution "irretrievably and irreparably works damage
and prejudice to the Government in terms of forest and reforestation charges
unpaid and public forest denuded as a result of the unabated night and day
logging done by <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> who holds no timber license" <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> and has defied the orders of the Director of
Forestry directing him to stop his ille­gal logging operations; and that, in
acting as he did, Judge Ruiz had acted without jurisdiction and/or with grave
abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1965</st1:date>,
we issued the writ of preliminary injunction prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, respondents herein filed their
answer, admitting some allegations of the peti­tion, denying other allegations
thereof and setting up special and/or affirmative defenses, to which reference
will presently be made.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main <span style="">issue </span>in L-22978 <span style="">is </span>whether
or not the lower court had committed a grave abuse of discretion in issuing a
writ of attachment and garnishment against the properties of <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span>, to answer for the damages he had allegedly caused to
<span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> by entering into the forest area covered by
his alleged timber license and cutting logs therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is­sue must <span style="">be resolved </span>in the affirmative, for <span class="SpellE">Patanao's</span>
alleged <span style="">cause
</span>of action in Case No. 48 is anchored upon the <span style="">claim </span>that he had a timber license on said area, which he does
not have, and it has been <u>so declared by the Court of Appeals in its
decision in CA-GR No. 27271-R</u>, promulgated on January 24, 1962, which
became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> on March 28, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although <span class="SpellE">Bueno's</span>
Corporation <span style="">was not a </span>party in
that case, <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> was, and, hence, said decision is
conclusive against him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is true that <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> had had two (2) licenses, but the</span> same had
expired, one <span style="">on
</span><st1:date year="1955" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1955</st1:date> and
the ot<span style="">h</span>er on <st1:date year="1957" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although he had applied for the renewal of
said licenses, he never went beyond getting <span style="">a </span>ruling of The Director of Forestry<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>

of which h<span style="">a</span>d bee <span style="">h</span>eld in abeyance owing to <span class="SpellE">Patanao<span style="">'</span>s</span>
delinquency in the payment of forests charges and surcharges, as well as
reforestation charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event,
giving due course to his application for renewal is <span style="">not </span><span style="">tantamount </span>to granting the same, for which the approval of the
department head is necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A<span style="">gain, </span>the due course given to his
application for renewal was subject to a condition precedent - submission of
proof of payment of his <span style="">debt </span>to
the government - which had not been complied with.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as the facts before the court of first instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> showed that <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> has no
timber license, hi<span style="">s</span> lack of
cause of action <span class="SpellE">againts</span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span> was</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">apparent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, </span>it committed <span style="">a </span><span style="">grave
abuse </span>of discretion, amounting to excess of jurisdiction, in issuing the
writ of attachment and garnishment complained of in L-22978.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is even more obvious that said court exceeded its jurisdiction
in issuing the writ of preliminary injunction involved in L-24345, because the <span style="">Bureau </span>of Forestry and the PC, against
which the writ was addressed, were not parties in said Case N<span style="">o. </span>48.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>H<span style="">e</span>nce, the lower court
had no jurisdiction over them.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards L-24770, <span style="">it is
urged </span>that <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bueno’s</span></span><span style=""> Corpora­tion </span>and the Director of
Forestry have no personality or cause of action against the respondents
therein, because the partial decision rendered in case No. 190 is directed
against the PC, not the Director of Forestry, and because <span class="SpellE">Bueno's</span>
Corporation <span style="">is
</span><span style="">not a party </span><span style="">in </span>said
case, his motion <span style="">to intervene therein
not having been granted </span><span style="">or </span><span style="">acte</span><span style="">d </span><span style="">upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent’s pretense is manifestly devoid </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span>Director of
Forestry was<span style=""> </span><span style="">one of t</span>he defendants in Case No. 190
and, although partial decision rendered and the injunction issued by Judge <span style="">Ruiz were</span> directed against the PC, <u>it
</u><u><span style="">sought to </span>restrain the
latter from </u><u><span style="">enforcing an or­der </span>of
said </u><u><span style="">Di</span>r</u><u><span style="">ector of </span>Forestry</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bueno</span> was not a party in Case No. 190,
because his motion <span style="">to </span>intervene
therein was no<span style="">t </span>resolved by
Judge Ruiz, several months after it had been filed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In their answer,
respondents herein allege that</span><span style="">
there "is no</span><span style=""> showing that
the area covered by the </span><span style="">license
(?) </span><span style="">of respondent <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">applied for" by <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> has,
however, no license as yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">In his own petition in Case </span><span style="">No. </span><span style="">190, h</span><span style="">e</span><span style=""> prays </span><span style="">that the Director </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">Forestry and the Secretary of Agriculture </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">Natural Resources "be ordered to <u>act on and release</u>
petitioner<span style="">'s</span> (<span class="SpellE">Patanao</span>) ordinary </span><span style="">tim­ber license".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It</span><span style=""> <span style="">is </span></span><span style="">thus </span><span style="">impliedly a</span><span style="">dmitted that no license </span><span style="">has,
</span><span style="">as yet, been </span><span style="">issued in </span><span style="">his favor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Bueno's</span> Corporation alleged in its motion to intervene, and
reiterated in the petition herein, that <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> <span style="">is </span>and has been logging in the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">former's</span></span><span style=""> licensed forest area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bueno</span> </span>can
not </span><span style="">possibly prove the truth of </span><span style="">this allegation until after <span style="">its </span>motion to intervene has </span><span style="">been granted </span><span style="">or acted upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the <span style="">existence </span>of an actual conflict
between <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span>
is attested to by <span class="SpellE"><u>Patanao's</u></span> action for damages
against <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span> in Case </span><span style="">No. 48.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, since the
"permanent </span><span style="">preliminary
injunction" issued by Judge Ruiz runs counter to the li­cense that <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span> claims to have, it is obvious that it has a right to
seek in L-24770 a relief against the injury <span style="">said </span>injunction </span><span style="">causes
upon </span><span style="">the corporation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is next urged that the petition in L-24770 <span style="">is </span>pre­mature because the PC<span style="">'s </span>motion for reconsideration in Case
No. 190 has not yet been acted upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
should be noted, however, that the "permanent preliminary injunction"
<span style="">com­plained </span>of <span style="">is </span>part - <span style="">in </span>fact, the main part - of the partial judgment complained
of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">judgment </span>partakes, therefore, of the <span style="">nature of a writ of preliminary injunction and is effective
immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being forthwith injurious </span>to
<span style="">public </span>interest, represented
here by the Director of Forestry, <span style="">and </span>to
<span style="">the interest that <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span></span><span style=""> claims to have over the area in which </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Patanao</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">engaged
In logging, and, <span style="">considering </span>the
lower court's delay in </span><span style="">acting </span><span style="">on </span><span style="">said </span><span style="">motion for
reconsider­<span style="">ation, petitioners herein
were fully justified in filing the </span></span><span style="">present action without waiting for </span><span style="">the </span>resolution of the aforesaid motion.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In
answer to </span><span style="">the charge that
respondent Judge had committed a grave abuse of discretion in rendering a
default judgment against the PC, respondents allege that, not having filed </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">answer within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period, the </span><span style="">PC </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">default, so that it was proper for <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> to forthwith present his evidence and for
respondent Judge <span style="">to render said
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span>should be noted, however,
that, in entering the area in </span><span style="">quest</span><span style="">ion and seeking to prevent <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> for continuing his logging operations therein, the
PC was merely executing an order of the Director of Forestry and acting as his
agent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Patanao'<span style="">s</span></span></span><span style=""> cause </span><span style="">of action against
the PC is, <span style="">therefore, </span>common
with its cause of action against the other respondents in Case No. 190, namely,
the Director of Forestr</span><span style="">y, </span><span style="">the District Forester of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>,
the </span><span style="">Forest </span><span style="">Officer of <span class="SpellE">Bayugan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, and </span><span style="">the Secretary of A</span><span style="">griculture
and Natural Resources.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to <span style="">Rule </span>18, Section 4, of the Rules of
Court, "when a complaint states a common cause of action against several
defendants <u>some</u> of whom answer </span><span style="">and </span><u><span style="">the other fail to
do so</span></u><span style="">, the court shall try
the case against <u>all</u> upon the answer thus filed</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and render judgment upon the evidenc</span><span style="">e </span><span style="">presented." In other words, the answer
filed by <u>one</u> or some of the defendants inures to </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">benefit of <u>all the others</u>, </span>even those who have <u>not</u>
seasonably filed their answer.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Indeed, since the
petition </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">Case No. 190 </span><span style="">se</span><span style="">ts forth a <u>common</u>
cause of action against <u>all</u> of the respondents </span>therein, a
decision in favor of one of them would necessary favor the others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the main issue, in said case, is
whether <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> has a timber license to undertake
logging operations in <span style="">the </span>disputed
area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is </span>not possible to <span style="">de<span style="">cide </span></span><span style="">such issue </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the negative, insofar as the Director of Forestry, and to settle it
otherwise, as regards </span><span style="">the PC, which</span><span style=""> is merely
acting as agent </span>of the Director of Forestry and <span style="">is, therefore, his alter e</span>go, with respect to the <span style="">disputed forest area.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Patanao</span></span><span style=""> says that the Director of Forestry, the Dis­trict
Forester, </span><span style="">the Forest Officer of <span class="SpellE">Bayugan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ag<span style="">usan</span></span><span style="">, </span>and
the Secretary of Agriculture and </span><span style="">Natural
</span><span style="">Resources <span style="">were, also, in default </span>in Case <span style="">No. </span>190, <span style="">because their answer then </span>in had been, similarly filed beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is, however, an allegation which</span><span style=""> ha</span><span style="">s not been so</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">far
substantiated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, <span class="SpellE">Patanao's</span> motion of </span><st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="7"><span style="">July </span><span style="">1, </span><span style="">1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, to</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">declare
the PC in default, suggests that the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> did not
believe the other respondents to be in the same predi­cament.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer to the petition herein, <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span>
has annexed a carbon copy of a motion he claims to have filed <span style="">in </span>Case No. 190<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
to strike off the answer of said respondents therein, and to declare them in
default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As of <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="8">Aug­ust 3, 1965</st1:date>, when <span class="SpellE">Patanao's</span>
answer in the case at bar was filed, said alleged motion had not seemingly been
granted or acted upon by Judge Ruiz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
any rate, when he rendered a partial judgment and issued a "permanent
preliminary injunction" against the <span style="">PC,
</span>there was no order declaring the other respondents in Case No. 190 in
default.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main question for determination in this case is whether
respondent Judge had acted without jurisdiction and/or committed a grave abuse <span style="">of </span>discretion, amounting to excess of
jurisdiction, in proceeding to hear Case No. 190 <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
on July 2, 1965, as regards the PC, and <span style="">in rende</span>ring its partial judgment of July 3,
1965, permanently restraining and prohibiting the PC, its officers, soldiers
and other persons acting on its behalf, from enforcing the order of the
Director of Forestry of May 31, 1965, and directing the release of the trucks
of <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> and the logs cut by him, which had been
respectively impounded and con­fiscated by the PC, upon receipt of said order.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the issue must be decided in the affirm­ative,
because:</p>

<p class="BODY">1. The order declaring the PC in default, <span style="">as </span>well <span style="">a</span>s the subsequent hearing on the merits and the partial judgment
against the PC contravenes the above-mentioned provision of the Rules of Court,
concerning cases involv­ing a common cause of action against several defendants;</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">2. </span><span style="">It is patent from the petition in Case No.
190 and the partial judgment therein that the PC had acted as </span><span style="">agent of the
Director of Forestry;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">3. It is apparent from
said petition that <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> has not as yet secured the
requisite timber license, although he claimed to be entitled to one and,
accordingly, sought to compel the respondents in Case No. 190 to </span><span style="">issue </span><span style="">said license;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">4. The decision of the
Director of Forestry dated October 31, 1963, on which <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span>
relies, <u>merely gives due course</u> to his application for a license, and
even this action is conditioned "upon satisfactory showing that all of his
accounts consisting </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">forest charges and
surcharges and reforestation funds, if any, </span><span style="">shall </span><span style="">first be settled x
</span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span style="">and
that he possesses sufficient financial capabilities and adequate logging
equipment," aside from the fact that there is no allegation or proof that this
condition has been fulfilled;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">5. On January 24, 1962,
the Court of Appeals rendered in CA-G.R. No. 27271-R thereof, a decision, which
is now fi­nal and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">well as binding and conclusive upon <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span>, declaring that his logging operations, after the
expiration of his timber licenses, are illegal;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">6. In L-24345, we issued, on March 28, 1965, a writ of
preliminary injunction restraining respondents therein, including <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span> and Judge Ruiz, from enforcing an order of the
Court of First instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> dated November 3,
1964, restraining the officers of the Bureau of Forestry and the PC from
entering the forest area which was soon later involved in Case No. 190, and the
"permanent preli­minary injunction" therein issued <span style="">by </span>Judge Ruiz on July 3 1965, had the
effect of nullifying our injunction <span style="">in said </span>Case L-24345.</p>
