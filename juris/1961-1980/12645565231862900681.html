<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petition for certiorari filed by 
<span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> Trinidad and <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Barroga</span> against the 
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Iriga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cmarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, and the Hon. Jose L. 
<span class="SpellE">Moya</span>, Presiding J of the third branch of the Court of 
First Instance of marines <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, to annul the latter's 
order of March 22, in Civil Case No. 4836, "commanding the defendants <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> Trinidad, <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Barroga</span>, and their agents to refrain and desist from 
collecting the rents, fees, and other benefits from the <span class="SpellE">Iriga</span> Central Market and <span class="SpellE">Sagrada</span> 
Market in <span class="SpellE">Iriga</span>, respectively, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of this action".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On December 11, 1959, pursuant to 
a resolution approved by the Municipal Council of <span class="SpellE">Iriga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, authorizing the leasing of the Central Public Market 
and the <span class="SpellE">Sagrada</span> Public Market of said municipality to 
private persons, the Municipal Mayor, Perfecto I. <span class="SpellE">Tanduran</span>, representing said municipality leased the Central 
Public Market to petitioner Trinidad and the <span class="SpellE">Sagrada</span> 
Public Market to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Barroga</span>, for P24,000.00 
and P360.00 yearly, respectively, both payable quarterly in advance within the 
first ten days of every quarter, for a period of one year beginning January 1, 
1960 extendible to another four years, subject to the approval of the Provincial 
Board. The Municipal Council approved said lease agreements on December 29, 1959 
in its Resolution No. 70, s. of 1959, and on January 1, I960 the lessees, after 
paying the rentals corresponding to the first quarter, took over the operation 
and administration of the said markets, collecting rents, market fees and other 
benefits therein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Stir against 
petitioners and its former mayor, Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Tanduran</span>, 
(Civil Case No. 836) to annul the aforementioned lease contracts, with a prayer 
for the issuance ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> of a writ of preliminary 
injunction restraining petitioners from collecting rents, market fees and other 
benefits in the leased premises during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of 
the action, and damages. The complaint alleged that, prior to the leasing of the 
markets to petitioners, respondent Municipality had been earning an average net 
income of no less than P35.000.00 annually from the operation thereof; that on 
or about the 26 day of December, 1959, Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Tanduran</span>, who was then the municipal mayor of <span class="SpellE">Iriga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, and who at the time knew that he lost his bid for 
reelection in the 1959 elections, in collusion and connivance with <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> Trinidad and <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Barroga</span>, with intent to defraud the municipality in 
the approximate sum of P1 1,000.00, Philippine Currency, for their own persona! 
gain and benefit, maliciously, irregularly and in deliberate disregard of the 
law governing the lease of public markets to private persons, leased in behalf 
of the plaintiff the said <span class="SpellE">Iriga</span> Central Market to 
defendant <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> Trinidad for a period of one year 
beginning January 1, 1960 in the patently unreasonable amount of P24.000.00, and 
the said <span class="SpellE">Sagrada</span> Market to defendant <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Barroga</span> for a similar 
period of one year beginning January lf 1960 in the patently unreasonable amount 
of P360.00; that respondent municipality, thru its then mayor and municipal 
council, had demanded petitioners to turn over to them the operation and 
administration of the premises, which the latter refused; and that to allow 
petitioners to continue collecting rents and market fees during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the action would cause great and irreparable 
injury to respondent municipality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners' motion to require 
respondent municipality to specify in its complaint the facts and circumstances 
constituting the fraud, connivance and collusion alleged therein having been 
denied, they filed their answer on March 11, 1960 alleging that the lease 
contracts were entered into and executed with all the requirements of the law; 
that the municipal council authorized the lease and approved said contracts 
because it believed that they were to the advantage of the municipality; and 
that the present suit was instigated for political reasons by the incumbent 
mayor, vice-mayor and councilors of said municipality who, conspiring together, 
immediately upon assuming office passed a resolution annulling the contracts of 
lease in question without any authority to do so; that by virtue thereof, 
petitioners have suffered damages which they seek to recover from the 
above-mentioned municipal officials by means of a third-party complaint filed 
against them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Subsequently, on March 22, I960, 
the Court issued an order granting ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> the writ 
of preliminary injunction prayed for in the complaint for the following reasons: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"It appearing from the facts set 
forth in the complaint, verified by the oath of the Provincial Fiscal as 
attorney for the plaintiff, that it (Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Iriga</span>) is entitled to the relief it socks, that the 
continued collection of the rents and fees from the two markets in question by 
the defendants <span class="SpellE">Anaclcto</span> Trinidad and <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Barroga</span> will likely cause 
irreparable injury to the plaintiff as the amount of these rentals and fees 
depends on the patronage of the public and it will be difficult to determine it 
with certainty if they are collected by private individuals, while this is not 
so where the collection is done by public officials who are under obligation to 
issue receipts for moneys coming into their possession; that although the 
complaint prays for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, the 
defendants did not deny in their answer the facts averred in support thereof; 
and that under the circumstances, a writ of preliminary injunction may be 
granted 'ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>' (Moran, Rules of Court, Vol. I, 
500-501), ***.‚Äù<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Their motion to set aside the 
order of preliminary injunction having been denied, petitioners filed the 
present action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is petitioners' contention now 
that the respondent Judge committed a grave abuse of discretion in issuing rte 
the writ of preliminary injunction mentioned above in denying their motion to 
set it aside. We find no merit in this claim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The general rule it is true is 
that a writ of preliminary injunction should be issued in proper cases only 
after Notice served upon the party Might to be enjoined, but the Rules of Court 
give the court discretion to issue the ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> upon a 
showing hat the party seeking the injunction will suffer irreparable injury 
should the writ not be issued immediately.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the present case, considering 
the allegations made the complaint filed in <span class="SpellE">Ciyil</span> Case 
No. 4836 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span> for the annulment of the lease contracts mentioned 
heretofore, we do not believe that the respondent judge committed any abuse of 
discretion at all in issuing ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> the writ 
complained of, considering that, had not said writ been issued, the defendants 
in said action would have continued administering and operating the public 
markets subject of the contracts of lease and would have continued collecting 
rents and fees in connection therewith, without any assurance that the 
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Iriga</span> would be able to recover the 
amounts thus collected should the lease contracts be finally annulled. At any 
rate, on matters where trial courts are given the right to use their discretion 
in granting or denying relief to a party in an action pending before them, our 
policy is not to interfere with the exercise of said discretion unless it is 
clearly shown that it was abused in a serious manner a circumstance not 
obtaining in the present case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the writ prayed for is denied, 
with costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
