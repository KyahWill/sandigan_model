				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><h3></h3><p>On May 17, 1948, the Acoje Mining Company, Inc. wrote the Director of Posts 
requesting the opening of a post, telegraph and money order offices at its 
mining camp at Sta. Cruz, Zambales, to service its employees and their families 
that were living in said camp. Acting on the request, the Director of Posts 
wrote in reply stating that if aside from free quarters the company would 
provide for all essential equipment and assign a responsible employee to perform 
the duties of a postmaster without compensation from his office until such time 
as funds therefor may be available he would agree to put up the offices 
requested. The company in turn replied signifying its willingness to comply with 
all the requirements outlined in the letter of the Director of Posts requesting 
at the same time that it for furnished with the necessary forms for the early 
establishment of a post office branch. </p>
<p>On April 1, 1949, the Director of Posts again wrote a letter to the company 
stating among other things that "In cases where a post office will be opened 
under circumstances similar to the present, it is the policy of this office t o 
have the company assume direct responsibility for whatever pecuniary loss may be 
suffered by the Bureau of Posts by reason of any act of dishonesty, carelessness 
or negligence on the part of the employee of the company who is assigned to take 
charge of the post office," thereby suggesting that a resolution be adopted by 
the board of directors of the company expressing conformity to the above 
condition relative to the responsibility to be assumed by it in the event a post 
office branch is opened as requested. On September 2, 1949, the company informed 
the Director of Posts of the passage by its board of directors of a resolution 
of the following tenor: "That the requirement of the Bureau of Posts that the 
Companj should accept full responsibility for all cash received by the 
Postmaster be complied with, and that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to 
the Bureau of Posts." The letter further states that the company feels that that 
resolution fulfills the last condition imposed by the Director of Posts and 
that, therefore, it would request that an inspector be sent to the camp for the 
purpose of acquainting the postmaster with the details of the operation of the 
branch office.</p>
<p>The post office branch was opened at the camp on October 13, 1949 with one 
Hilario M. Sanchez as postmaster. He is an employee of the company. On May 11, 
1954, the postmaster went on a three-day leave but never returned. The company 
immediately informed the officials of the Manila post office and the provincial 
auditor of Zambales of Sanchez' disappearance; with the result that the accounts 
of the postmaster were checked and a shortage was found in the amount of 
P13,867.24.</p>
<p>The several demands made upon the company for the payment of the shortage in 
line with the liability it has assumed having failed, the government commenced 
the present action on September 10, 1954 before the Court of First Instance of 
Manila seeking to recover the amount of P13,867.24. The company in its answer 
denied liability for said amount contending that the resolution of the board of 
directors, wherein it assumed responsibility for the act of the postmaster is 
<i>ultra vires</i>, and in any event its liability under said resolution is only 
that of a guarantor who answers only after the exhaustion of the properties of 
the principal, aside from the fact that the loss claimed by the plaintiff is not 
supported by the office record. </p>
<p>After trial, the court <i>a quo</i> found that of the amount claimed by 
plaintiff totalling P13,867.24, only the sum of P9,515.25 was supported by the 
evidence, and so it rendered judgment for the plaintiff only for the amount last 
mentioned. The court rejected the contention that the resolution adopted by the 
company is <i>ultra vires</i> and that the obligation it has assumed is merely 
that of a guarantor. Defendant took the present appeal. </p>
<p>The contention that the resolution adopted by the company dated August 31, 
1949 is <i>ultra vires</i> in the sense that it has no authority to act on a 
matter which may render the company liable as a guarantor has no factual or 
legal basis. In the first place, it should be noted that the opening of a post 
office branch at the mining camp of appellant corporation was undertaken because 
of a request submitted by it to promote the convenience and benefit of its 
employees. The idea did not come from the government, and the Director of Posts 
was prevailed upon to agree to the request only after studying the necessity for 
its establishment and after imposing upon the company certain requirements 
intended to safeguard and protect the interest of the government. Thus, after, 
the company had signified its willingness to comply with the requirement of the 
government that it furnish free quarters and all the essential equipment that 
may be necessary for the operation of the office including the assignment, of an 
employee who will perform the duties of a postmaster, the Director of Posts 
agreed to the opening of the post office stating that "In cases where a post 
Office will be opened under circumstances similar to the present, it is the 
policy of this office to have the company assume direct responsibility for 
whatever pecuniary loss may be suffered by the Bureau of Posts by reason of any 
act of dishonesty, carelessness or negligence on the part of the employee of the 
company who is assigned to take charge of the post office," and accepting this 
condition the Company, thru its board of directors, adopted forthwith a 
resolution of the following tenor: "That the requirement of the Bureau of Posts 
that the company should accept full responsibility for all cash received by the 
Postmaster, be complied with, and that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to 
the Bureau of Posts." On the basis of the foregoing facts, it is evident that 
the company cannot now be heard to complain that it is not liable for the 
irregularity committed by its employee upon the technical plea that the 
resolution approved by its board of directors <i>ultra vires</i>. The least that 
can be said is that it cannot now go back, on its plighted word on the ground of 
estoppel. </p>
<p>The claim that the resolution adopted by the board of directors of appellant 
company is an <i>ultra vires</i> act cannot also be entertained it appearing 
that the same covers a subject which concerns the benefit, convenience and 
welfare of its employees and their families. While as a rule an <i>ultra 
vires</i> act is one committed outside the object for which a corporation is 
created as defined by the law of its organization and therefore beyond the 
powers conferred upon it by law (19 C.J.S., Section 965, p. 419), there are 
however certain corporate acts that may be performed outside of the scope of the 
powers expressly conferred if they are necessary to promote fee interest or 
welfare of the corporation. Thus, it has been held that "although not expressly 
authorized to do so a corporation may become a surety where the particular 
transaction is reasonably necessary or proper to the conduct of its 
business,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and here it is undisputed 
that the establishment of the local post office is a reasonable and proper 
adjunct to the conduct of the business of appellant company. Indeed, such post 
office is a vital improvement in the living condition of its employees and 
laborers who came to settle in its mining camp which is far removed from the 
postal facilities or means of communication accorded to people living in a city 
or municipality. </p>
<p>Even assuming arguendo that the resolution in question constitutes an 
<i>ultra vires</i> act, the same however is not void for it was approved not in 
contravention of law, customs, public order or public policy. The term <i>ultra 
vires</i> should be distinguished from an illegal act for the former is merely 
voidable which may be enforced by performance, ratification, or estoppel, while 
the latter is void and cannot be validated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> It being merely voidable, an <i>ultra 
vires</i> act can be enforced or validated if there are equitable grounds for 
taking such action. Here it is fair that the resolution be upheld at least on 
the ground of estoppel. On this point, the authorities are overwhelming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The weight of authority in the state courts is to the effect that a 
transaction which is merely, <i>ultra vires</i> and not malum in se or malum 
prohibitum is, if performed by one party, not void as between the parties to all 
intents and purposes, and that an action may be brought directly, on the 
transaction and relief had according to its terms." (19 C.J.S., Section 976, p. 
432, citing Nettles <i>vs.</i> Rhett, C.C.A.S.C, 94 F. 2d, reversing, D.C., 20 
F. Supp. 48.) .</p>
<p>"This rule is based on the consideration that as between private 
corporations, one party cannot receive the benefits which are embraced in total 
performance of a contract made with it by another party and then set up the 
invalidity of the transaction as a defense." (London &amp; Lancashire Indemnity 
'Co. of America <i>vs.</i> Fairbanks Steam Shovel Co., 147 N.E. 329, 332, 112 
Ohio St. 136.).</p>
<p>"The defense of <i>ultra vires</i> rests on violation of trust or duty toward 
stockholders and should not be entertained where its allowance will do greater 
wrong to innocent parties dealing with corporation. </p>
<p>"The acceptance of benefits arising from the performance by the other party 
may give rise to all estoppel precluding repudiation of the transaction." (19 
CJ.S., Section 976, p. 433.) </p>
<p>"The current of modern authorities favors the rule that where the <i>ultra 
vires</i> transaction has been executed by the other party and the corporation 
has received the benefit of it, the law interposes an estoppel, and will not 
permit the validity of the transaction or contract to be questioned, and this is 
especially true where there nothing in the circumstances to put the other party 
to the transaction on notice that the corporation has exceeded its powers in 
entering into it and has in so doing overstepped the line of corporate ( 
privileges." (19 CJ.S., Section 977, pp. 435-437, citing Williams <i>vs.</i> 
Peoples Building &amp; Loan Ass'n. 97 S.W. 2d 930, 193 Ark. 118, Hays <i>vs.</i> 
Galion Gas Light Co., 29 Ohio St. 330.) </p></blockquote>
<p>Neither can we entertain the claim of appellant that its liability is only 
that of a guarantor. On this point, we agree with the following comment of the 
court <i>a quo</i> "A mere reading of the resolution of the Board of Directors 
dated August 31, 1949, upon which the plaintiff based its claim would show that 
the responsibility of the defendant company is not just that of a guarantor. 
Notice that the phraseology and the terms employed are so clear and sweeping and 
that the defendant assumed 'full responsibility for all cash received by the 
Postmaster.' Here the responsibility of the defendant is not just that of a 
guarantor. It is clearly that of a principal. "</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed. </p>
