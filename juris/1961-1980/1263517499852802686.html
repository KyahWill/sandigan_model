				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal taken by defendants Bruno Antonio and Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Dasalla</span> from a decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> convicting them of
the crime of murder, with which they are charged, and sentencing them to life
imprisonment, and to jointly and severally indemnify the heirs of Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> in the sum of P6, 000, as well as to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the morning of <st1:date year="1962" day="5" month="12">December
 5, 1962</st1:date>, between <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 a.m.</st1:time>, <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span>, chief of the barrio police of <span class="SpellE">Tibag</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Talugtog</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, learned about
a hogtied man west of said barrio, who was wounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Together with <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span>
Antonio, Ignacio Antonio and <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, he, thereupon, repaired to the indicated place,
where, between <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00</st1:time> a. m., they found a man seated at the
foot of a tree and reclining thereon, with his hands tied behind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His face was swollen and his clothes were
soaked with blood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had several wounds
in the head, the neck and the buttocks.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon inquiry from <span class="SpellE">Angellano,the</span> injured man
said that he was Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>; that, while he was
in the house of one Felix <span class="SpellE">Dalit</span>, with a woman, early
the previous night, several men suddenly entered the premises, in view of which
he got panicky and tried to escape by jumping out through the window; that, as
he hit the ground, a gunshot rang and he was wounded in the buttocks; that
unable to run away, several men, who presumably accompanied those who entered
the house, held him and, together with the latter, tied him and brought him to
the hut of one <span class="SpellE">Endring</span> <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span>,
in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Baloy</span>, municipality of <span class="SpellE">Cuyapo</span>, where he was maltreated; that, thereafter, they
placed him on a sledge, stating that he would be brought to a hospital in <span class="SpellE">Cuyapo</span>; that, noticing, later, that they were going in the
opposite direction, he rolled out of the sledge and then moved away, soon
thereafter, as he noticed his former captors walking about, nearby, with
flashlights switched on, evidently look­ing for him; and that he recognized
only two (2) of the six or seven persons who had beaten him up, and they were
Bruno Antonio and <span class="SpellE">Pon­yong</span> (or Alfonso) <span class="SpellE">Dasalla</span>, both from the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Baloy</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">While <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span> was causing this
statement of <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> to be written on a sheet of
paper, they noticed a group of seven persons approaching the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Led by appellant Bruno Antonio, the barrio
captain of <span class="SpellE">Baloy</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cuyapo</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, they were
drinking wine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His companions were
Alberto <span class="SpellE">Agpalo</span>, Tomas de la Cruz, Marcos <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span>, Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Ronquillo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Idong</span> or Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dasalla</span>, a brother
of appellant Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Dasalla</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon seeing <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span>,
Bruno asked him, in a commanding voice, what he (<span class="SpellE">Angellano</span>)
was doing there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Angellano</span>
answered that he intended to bring <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> to <span class="SpellE">Talugtog</span> for treatment, whereupon Bruno said that he and
his men would take <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>, inasmuch as he (Bruno) had
jurisdiction over the place where <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> was. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">Angellano</span> replied
that the same formed part of the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Tibag</span>,
municipality of <span class="SpellE">Talugtog</span>, but Bruno angrily insisted
that the place was subject to his authority.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a brief exchange of words, with a tone of animosity, Bruno
forcibly took <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>, had him placed on a sledge, and
then departed with him and the other members of his group.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then about <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 a.m.</st1:time></p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 p.m.</st1:time>,
that same day, <span class="SpellE">Semana's</span> mother, Juanita <span class="SpellE">Madronio</span>, was informed that her son had died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She found his body at the junction of the
roads from <span class="SpellE">Paitan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Baloy</span>,
where she saw Bruno Antonio, together with Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Sumangil</span>,
Alberto <span class="SpellE">Agpalo</span>, "<span class="SpellE">Gondo</span>"(?)
<span class="SpellE">Dasalla</span> and others whom she did not know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon later, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Pio</span>
Alberto, the health officer of <span class="SpellE">Cuyapo</span>, came and
performed an autopsy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He found the
following:</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style=""> </span>A well developed body measuring about 5 feet 4
inches brown with rigor mortis and blood serum oozing from the nose and
mouth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The clothes are soaked in dried
blood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pants have holes
corresponding to upper left buttock and thorn on both knees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style=""> </span>An irregular circular wound about 1 inch in
diameter on the left <span class="SpellE">fronto</span>-parietal region exposing
the skull.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style=""> </span>An irregular almost circular lacerated wound
about 1 inch in diameter behind the lower third of the right <span class="SpellE">sterno-cleido</span> mastoid muscle going inwards to about 2
inches deep.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Echimoses</span> of upper
and lower conjunctiva of the left eye.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style=""> </span>Skin abrasions denuding almost half the
thickness of the skin on the base of the head and back of the neck and is about
2 inches long by 1 inch wide.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“6.<span style=""> </span>Gunshot wounds five small ones and five bigger
ones on the upper and middle portion of the left buttock, the wounds
penetrating the skin and muscles from back forwards and downwards.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“7.<span style=""> </span>Skin abrasions on the left knee."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and concluded that <span class="SpellE">Semana's</span>
death had been due to hemorrhage and shock.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Bruno Antonio maintains that, when the members of his
group decided to rest under the shade of a tree, in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Baloy</span>, about two kilometers from the place where <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> had been, in effect, wrested from <span class="SpellE">Angellano's</span> custody, they noticed that <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>
was dead already; that, thereupon, Bruno and his companions took their lunch;
that, thereafter, they brought the body of <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> to
the aforementioned junction, for the purpose of going to <span class="SpellE">Cuyapo</span>,
14 to 16 kilometers away; that, upon reaching the junction, Bruno Antonio and
Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Sumangil</span> boarded a jeep and proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Cuyapo</span> in order to report to the authori­ties and find a
truck that could pick up the body of <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>; that
about two hours later, Bruno and <span class="SpellE">Sumangil</span> came back,
together with some policemen and Dr. Alberto, who performed the autopsy; and
that <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> must have died merely of shock in
consequence of the loss of blood due to the injuries he had when they forcibly
took him at the place above referred to.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Dasalla</span>
would have the Court believe that he was in his house, in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Baloy</span>, up to about 3:00 o'clock p.m. of December 5, 1962,
when <span class="SpellE">Sumangil</span> allegedly went to his (Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Dasalla's</span>) place and asked him to help carry the body of <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>; that, accordingly, he joined, in <span class="SpellE">Baloy</span>, the group headed by Bruno Antonio, and assisted its
members in bringing said body to the aforementioned junction; and that he had
had no participation whatsoever in the infliction of <span class="SpellE">Semana's</span>
injuries or in his death.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court, presided over by Honorable Judge <span class="SpellE">Placido</span> Ramos, accepted, however, the version of the
prosecution, as well as gave no credence to the evidence for the defense, and,
accord­ingly, rendered judgment, not only convicting and sentencing appel­lants
herein, as pointed out at the beginning of this decision, but, likewise,
directing the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> to conduct an investigation of the participation of
Alberto <span class="SpellE">Agpalo</span>, Tomas de la Cruz, Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Sumangil</span>, Marcos <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> and
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dasalla</span>, and to file the corresponding
information against them, for the death of Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>,
should the evidence so warrant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first question raised by appellants herein refers to the
admissibility in evidence of the statement made by <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>
to <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span>
concerning the circumstances under which the former had been injured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants maintain that the trial court has
erred in considering said statement as a dying declaration, for, upon being
asked how he felt, <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> answered that he would <u>not</u>
die <u>if treated</u> and was then still "strong", according to some
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said answer of <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> indicated, however, an <u>awareness of the danger of
death on his part</u>, should he not be seasonably given the necessary medical
treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the records show
that he was so weak that several people had to help him, in order that he could
ride the sledge that brought him to <span class="SpellE">Baloy</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, testifying for the defense, Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Sumangil</span> explained that <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>
was strong, because he was "still breathing" and could answer some
questions, apart from asking for, and drinking, some water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither singly nor collectively do these
circumstances show that <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> was "strong"
at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said factors may indicate
that he was then neither dead nor unconscious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the other hand, Bruno's failure to ask <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>
about the cause of his injuries suggests that the former did not feel he (<span class="SpellE">Semana</span>) was strong enough to undergo an interrogation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, Bruno stated that <span class="SpellE">Semana's</span>
injuries were "serious".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, he had been bleeding profusely, from at least <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> of December 4, or for over 8 hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One can imagine, therefore, the considerable
amount of blood lost and the weakness resulting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This explains, also, why <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>
was unable to take the food given to him and had been groaning - perhaps in a
state of coma, coupled by <span class="SpellE">stertorous</span> breathing, which
may have been mis­taken for groans - since the group of appellant Bruno Antonio
had taken him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that he expired
one hour later strongly indicates the seriousness of his condition when <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span> took his statement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense cites the testimony of Dr. Alberto to the effect that
none of the wounds of <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> was fatal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No matter how true this may have been when
the injuries were inflicted, it is not necessarily so over 8 hours later,
during his interrogation by <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, Dr. Alberto qualified his
aforementioned testimony by adding that said injuries <u>could</u> cause
bleeding and produce a shock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the
cir­cumstances pointed out by the defense do not sufficiently show that the
lower court had no reasonable ground to conclude that <span class="SpellE">Semana's</span>
state­ment was made under the belief that he was in imminent danger of death in
consequence of said injuries - as he died soon thereafter -unless the same were
treated soon enough.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, that statement was made <u>in the course</u> of the
unfor­tunate odyssey of <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> that started on <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1962</st1:date> at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00 p.m.</st1:time>, and ended with his death on December
5, around <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time> time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aforesaid statement formed part,
therefore, of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span><u>
</u>and is competent evidence in this case.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The next and most important question for determination is the
sufficiency of the proof of appellants' guilt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this connection, the following circumstances deserve special
attention:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The witnesses for the
prosecution testified that, in answer to questions propounded by <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> said that he had recognized only two of his
assailants, namely, appellants Bruno Antonio and <span class="SpellE">Ponyong</span>
or Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Dasalla</span>; and that, when Bruno's party
showed up soon thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> asked <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span> not to deliver him to them, because they might
kill him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These facts were established
by the testimony of Ignacio Antonio and <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, who were corroborated substantially by <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span>, although the
latter affirmed that <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> had merely named Bruno
and <span class="SpellE">Ponyong</span> - the nick­name of Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Dasalla</span> - without mentioning their respective sur­names.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such affirmation was, however, contradicted
by <span class="SpellE">Angellano's</span> statement, Exhibit "C" -
subscribed and sworn to by him, on Decem­ber 7, 1962, or two (2) days after the
occurrence, before the Justice of the Peace of <span class="SpellE">Guimba</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> - in which he
said that <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> had named, among his aggressors,
appellants herein, not only with their respective surnames, but, also, adding
that Bruno Antonio is the barrio captain of <span class="SpellE">Baloy</span>,
and that <span class="SpellE">Ponyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Dasalla</span>,
likewise, hails from the same barrio.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense would have Us believe that, upon reaching the place
where <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> was found by <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span>,
Bruno Antonio inquired from the latter whether or not he had investigated <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>, and that <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span>
answered in the affirmative and allegedly revealed that <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>
had not recognized any of his assailants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Suffice it to say that his Honor, the trial Judge, found the testimony
thereon of the witnesses for the defense unworthy of credence, and that the
records before Us do not justify our disturbing such finding.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not disputed that <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span> was unwilling to yield the person of <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> to Bruno Antonio, who insisted on being entitled to
take <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>, alleging that he was in a territory
subject to his (Bruno's) jurisdiction as Barrio Captain of <span class="SpellE">Baloy</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said reluctance of <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span>
and this insistence of Bruno are, to be sure, quite significant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, Bruno had announced his intention to
take <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> to a hospital in <span class="SpellE">Cuyapo</span>,
and both Bruno and <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span> must have known that the
most urgent matter at the moment was to provide medical treatment for <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in
order to bring <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> to the clinic in <span class="SpellE">Talugtog</span>, as <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span> wanted to,
he and his men would have had to carry him afoot 5 or 6 kilometers away, using <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> a footpath, since there was no road to <span class="SpellE">Talugtog</span> from the place where <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>
had been found by <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One would, therefore, expect him to welcome
the opportunity to avoid the trouble and the responsibility that went with
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Angellano's</span>
willingness to take said trouble and to assume this responsibility bear out his
tes­timony, and that of Ignacio Antonio and <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, to the effect that <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>
had previously mentioned Bruno Antonio as one of his assailants and had pleaded
to <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span> not to let Bruno Antonio and his men
take him (<span class="SpellE">Semana</span>), because they may kill him.</p>

<p class="BODY">This version of the witnesses for the prosecution is further
borne out by Bruno's attitude on that occasion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a private citizen, and in the official capacity in which he claimed
to act, Bruno had no reason either to be angry at <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span>
for trying to take <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> to the health clinic in <span class="SpellE">Talugtog</span> or to engage in an altercation with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Angellano</span> and
forcibly take possession of the person of <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was, according to the very evidence for
the defense, 1-1/2 to 2 kilometers or one-hour walk <u>from</u> <span class="SpellE">Baloy</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, the place was not part of Baby or within Bruno's jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants' own witness, Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Sumangil</span>, confirmed <span class="SpellE">Angellano's</span>
assertion to the effect that said place is within the barrio of <span class="SpellE"><u>Tibaq</u></span>, which is part of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Talugtog</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why, then, was Bruno so anxious to take <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>, to the point of asserting falsely that he (Bruno)
had jurisdiction over the place where <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> was? And
why was Bruno Antonio so eager to undertake the inconvenient and difficult task
of carrying <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> along a footpath from said place
to <span class="SpellE">Baloy</span>, about 2 kilometers or one-hour walk away,
thence to the junc­tion, requiring another one-hour walk, and thereafter to <span class="SpellE">Cuyapo</span>, 14 to 16 kilometers away? Considering that <span class="SpellE">Talugtog</span> was less than half that distance from the scene of
the occurrence; and that - having reminded <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span>
of the responsibility that he would bear should <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>
remain and die in his (<span class="SpellE">Angellano's</span>) custody - he
(Bruno) assumed that respon­sibility, in taking <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>
with him, why was the former so keen about having the latter under his custody,
as to resort not only to threats, but, also, to force, in order to attain his
purpose? In short, Bruno's afore­mentioned behavior dovetails with the theory
of .the prosecution and reveals the artificiality of the theory of the defense.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears from the
testimony of Ignacio Antonio that, when Bruno forcibly took <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>,
he had the following injuries:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>two
wounds at the left rear portion of the neck, two at the left front portion of
the neck, and one on the upper left portion of the buttocks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> testified that <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>
had a wound about one (1) centimeter below the left ear, another on the left
side of the neck, near the left jaw, two wounds at the lower left portion of
the neck, and still another on the upper part of the left thigh.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Alberto, however, found in the body of <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> an <u>additional</u> wound, namely, an irregular
circular wound, about 1 inch in diameter, on the left <span class="SpellE">fronto</span>-parietal
region, <u>exposing the skull</u>, probably caused with a semi-bladed
instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> sustained this injury <u>after</u> he had been
forcibly taken by Bruno and when the former was under the latter's control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that it was midway between the
forehead and the temple, and, hence, more visible than the injuries in the
neck, said witnesses for the prosecution could not have failed to notice said <span class="SpellE">fronto</span>-parietal wound, were the theory of the defense true.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have not overlooked
that <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> had, according to <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span>,
a wound on the left portion of the head <u>two inches above the left ear</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This witness had, however, turned hostile to
the prose­cution, thereby compelling the latter to produce his aforementioned
affidavit, Exhibit "C", and make him admit that he had informed the
Provincial Fiscal that he (<span class="SpellE">Angellano</span>) had transferred
his residence from the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Tibag</span> to the town of
<span class="SpellE">Talugtog</span>, "because I was afraid of the threats
of (to) my life," were he to give evidence for the prosecution; and that
many people - including Ignacio (Antonio) and <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Tolen­tino</span>) - had informed him about said
threats.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, likewise, interesting to
note that said reference to the alleged wound above the left ear was made, <u>on
cross-examination by counsel for the defense</u>, upon the latter's request
that the injuries of <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> be described, <u>a
request made without anything to suggest its relevance to the questions
preceding the same.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words,
the surrounding circumstances suggest that the one making the request <u>knew
beforehand </u>what <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span> would do or say in
connection therewith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> did <u>not</u> have the injury des­cribed by <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span>, two inches above the ear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This goes to show that he <u>never</u> saw
either such injury or the one found by Dr. Alberto at the <span class="SpellE">fronto</span>-parietal
region; that <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> had <u>neither</u>, when <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span> con­ferred with him; and that, having <u>heard</u>
later about said additional injury found by Dr. Alberto in the body of the
deceased, <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span> merely imagined the one - <u>the
first</u> - he described on the witness stand, apparently to help the
defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in the affidavit
(Exhibit "C") made before the justice of the peace of <span class="SpellE">Guimba</span> on <st1:date year="1962" day="7" month="12">December
 7, 1962</st1:date>, he claimed to have seen no such injury.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an evident effort to offset the implications of the foregoing
circumstances, appellants intimated that there had been, between <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span> and Bruno, a previous misunderstanding concerning
a parcel of land - as if to imply that the testimony of the former, insofar as
unfavorable to the latter, had been prompted by ill-feeling or bad blood
between them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of all the testimonial
evidence for the prosecution, that of <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span> was,
however, the <u>least</u> adverse to Bruno.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, most of the incriminating testimony of <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span>
was given <u>after</u> the prosecution had exposed his change of heart and the
fear under which he was laboring In fact, <span class="SpellE">Angellano's</span>
behavior on the witness stand was characterized by his reluctance to reveal
details or answer questions pregnant with implications against him or the
accused, and by his frequent lapses of memory as regards the facts pertinent
thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, <span class="SpellE">Angellano's</span> testimony about the
information given to him by several persons, including Ignacio Antonio and <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, concerning
the threat to the, life of those who may testify against appel­lants herein,
was, in a way, corroborated by the circumstance that <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Angellano</span>, Ignacio Antonio, <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span>
Antonio and <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
refused to sign the subpoena requiring them to appear before the lower court,
to testify in the case at bar, in November, 1964, and that they had to be
arrested to insure their presence at the trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Despite the absence of proof of motive - although <span class="SpellE">Semana's</span> panic upon the sudden entry of two (2) men in the
house of Felix <span class="SpellE">Dalit</span>, where he was with a <u>woman</u>,
followed by his immediate, but unsuccessful, attempt to escape and, later (when
he was found by <span class="SpellE">Angellano</span>), his fear of falling into
the hands of the people from <span class="SpellE">Baloy</span>, suggest that he
and the woman were probably doing, in said house, something wrong, which was
offensive to someone in <span class="SpellE">Baloy</span>, and that the beating
he got thereafter was due thereto - We are satisfied that the guilt of
appellant Bruno Antonio has been established beyond reasonable doubt, and that
the crime committed by him is that of murder, qualified by treachery, <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> having been maltreated while his hands were tied.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a>
The penalty of life imprisonment meted out to Bruno Antonio is, therefore, in
accordance with law, but the amount of the indemnity due to the heirs of the
deceased should be increased from P6,000 to P12,000.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We, however, entertain doubts on the sufficiency of the proof
against appellant Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Dasalla</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The very evidence for the prose­cution shows
that he was <u>not</u> among those who accompanied Bruno, when he forcibly took
<span class="SpellE">Semana</span> in <span class="SpellE">Tibag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, there is <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>
testimony for the defense to the effect that Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Dasalla</span>
did not join the group headed by Bruno until <u>after</u> the death of <span class="SpellE">Semana</span>, when Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Sumangil</span>
asked him (Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Dasalla</span>), in <span class="SpellE">Baloy</span>,
to help them bring the deceased to the junction, where they expected to find a
vehicle to take his body to <span class="SpellE">Cuyapo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only evidence against Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Dasalla</span> is, therefore, the statement made by <span class="SpellE">Semana</span> about the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
participation in the beating administered to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of any corroboration of said
statement, We do not believe that his guilt has been established beyond
reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the judgment of
conviction against him should be reversed, and the case dismissed, insofar as he
is concerned, with the proportional part of the costs <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">So modified, with respect to the civil liability of Bruno
Antonio, and the absolution of Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Dasalla</span>, as
well as the dismissal of the case against him, the decision appealed from is,
accordingly, affirmed in all other respects, with one-half of the costs <u>de</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span><u>.<o:p></o:p></u></p>
