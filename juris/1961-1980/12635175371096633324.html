offered to repurchase the <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> lot for P14,000.00

department of the RFC, and offered to redeem said lot for P14,000.00 but the
offer was rejected and they were told to participate in the public sale of the
land to be conducted by the RFC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose L.
Ponce de Leon did not offer to redeem the mortgaged properties sold at anytime
before the expiration of the period of redemption.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The RFC scheduled a public sale of the lot registered in the
name of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> and of the other lots which
the RFC acquired in the Sheriff's sale for February 20, 1956 in view of the
inability of Ponce de Leon or <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> to legally
redeem the pro­perties sold by the Sheriff within the one year period after the
sale.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On February 18, 1956, Jose L. Ponce de Leon instituted the
present action alleging that there was delay in the releases of the amount of
the loan; that the RFC withheld the amount of P19,000.00 from the loan until it
had verified whether Ponce de Leon had still an unpaid indebtedness to the
defunct Agri­cultural and Industrial Bank, the AFC's predecessor, and this was
paid only after one year had passed; that the typhoon in October and November,
1952 had caused destructions to his sawmills and hampered his operations for
which reason, he asks, in his complaint, that the amortizations on his
obligations which became due since October, 1952 be declared extinguished; that
the sheriff's sales be declared null and void because the properties were sold
at grossly inadequate prices and that said sales were not conducted in
accordance with law; that the RFC be compelled to account for his machineries
and equipments at his lumber mill in <span class="SpellE">Calbayog</span> and to
reimburse him for the value of the unaccounted machineries and equipments; that
the RFC be ordered to pay him actual and moral dam­ages for P105,000.00 and
costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>De <st1:country-region><st1:place>Leon</st1:place></st1:country-region>
asked for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction to restrain the RFC
from carrying out its contemplated public sale.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court set the petition for injunction for hearing but no one
appeared for the RFC at the hearing thereof so that the Court had to issue the
preliminary injunction prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>De <st1:country-region><st1:place>Leon</st1:place></st1:country-region>
caused notice of <span class="SpellE">lis</span> <span class="SpellE">pendens</span>
to be recorded in relation with this case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The RFC filed its answer sustaining the le­gality of the
mortgage and Sheriff's sales and counter­claimed that Ponce de Leon be ordered
to pay the de­ficiency claim representing the balance of the latter's
indebtedness, rental of the lot and house at Taft Ave­nue, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City occupied by Ponce de Leon and dam­ages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Subsequent to the filing of Ponce de Leon's complaint against
the RFC, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> wrote a letter, dated
February 20, 1956, to the President asking the latter's intervention so that
the projected sale on the same date to be conducted by the RFC may be suspended
insofar as the lot in his name is con­cerned and that he be allowed to redeem
it (Exhibit '27-Soriano').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This letter
was referred by the Executive Office to the RFC, which sent a letter, Exhibit
'29-Soriano', to Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> informing the
latter that he could redeem his former property for not less than its appraised
value of P59,647.05, payable 20% down and the balance in ten years, with 6%
interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
did not redeem the lot under the conditions of the RFC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then filed a third-party complaint in this
case with the RFC and Jose L. Ponce de Leon as the third-party defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due to the death of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, he was substituted as third-party plaintiff by his
children, namely, <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
del Rosario, Rosalina <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> and Rev. Fr. <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span> contend that the
mortgage in favor of the RFC and promissory note signed by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> lacked the latter's consent and was without con­sideration
insofar as Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> is concerned and hence
null and void as to him and his children; that the lot covered by original
certificate of title No. 8094 in the name of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
belonged to the conju­gal partnership of the latter and his wife, <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> Rodriguez, now deceased, and since the latter was
already dead when the mortgage was executed and her children who have thus
inherited her share have not signed the mortgage contract and promissory note,
at least,, the one-half share of the lot belonging now to the <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> sisters and brother, the third-party plaintiffs,
have not been legally included in the mortgage to the RFC so that the latter
had not acquired said one-half share in the sheriff's sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span>
further ask that they be allowed to redeem the remaining one-half share, that
which belonged to their father, for one-half of P10,000.00 which was the amount
for which the RFC acquired the whole lot in the sheriff's sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third party-plaintiffs also ask that
Ponce de Leon be ordered to reimburse them for whatever amount they may use in
redeeming the lot and expenses incident thereto and that Ponce de Leon and the
RFC be made to pay them moral damages which their father suffered and attor­ney's
fees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Answering the third-party complaint, the RFC and Ponce de
Leon affirm the legality of the mortgage deed insofar as <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The RFC further contends
that the mortgage was binding on the whole <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
lot and that there was no valid redemption of this lot.</blockquote>

money allegedly received from him by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>

<p class="BODY">In due course, the lower court rendered judgment the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which is quoted at the beginning of
this decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said court held that the
typhoons in October and November 1952 did not relieve the plaintiff from his
obligations under the promissory note and the deed of mortgage in favor of the
RFC; that the sheriff's sale of the mortgaged properties is valid; that the RFC
need not ac­count for the machineries and equipment of the sawmill in <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> or reimburse the value of such machinery and
equipment as may be un­accounted for, they having become property of the RFC,
owing to plaintiff's failure to exercise the right of redemption in accordance
with law; that neither may he recover damages from the RFC for the alleged
delay in the releases made by the same, since their con­tract stipulates that
the proceeds of the loan shall be released at the discretion of the Mortgagee
and plaintiff's offer of redemption came long after the expiration of the
period <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, and was not for the full amount of
plaintiff's liability, which he, moreover, asked to be reduced and wanted to
pay in installments; and that, accordingly, plaintiff has no right to recover
any damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the court found that plaintiff should
pay:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) rentals for the use of the
mortgaged property (house and lot) at <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City,
after the title thereto had passed to the RFC, and (2) the sum of P529,265.54,
representing the balance of plaintiff's obligation in favor of the RFC - which,
as of November 24,1954, amounted to P583,270.49, plus 10% thereof, as
stipulated penalty, or the aggre­gate sum of P641,597.54 - after deducting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the sum of P112,332.00 for which the mortgaged
properties had been sold, (3) apart from the sum of P5,000.00, as damages for
the injunction issued, at his behest, and the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the third party complaint of the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span>,
the lower court:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) overruled their
claim to the effect that Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> had signed
the promissory note and the deed of mortgage in favor of the RFC without
knowledge of the contents thereof and with­out any consideration <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>; but (b) held that, being registered in the name
of "Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, married to <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> Rodriguez," the property covered by original
certificate of title No. 8094 - here­inafter referred to as the <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span> property - is presumed to be long to the conjugal
partnership of said spouses, and that, the RFC having failed to offset this
presumption, the mortgage on and the sale of the property by the sheriff are
null and void as to one-half (1/2) thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the court declared:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(a) that the RFC was justified in rejecting the offer, made by the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span>, to redeem said property for, pursuant to section
78 of Republic Act No. 337, redemption could be effected "only by paying
the amount fixed in the order of execution"; (b) that plaintiff's
counterclaim against the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span> is barred by the
statute of limitations; (c) that neither may he recover damages from the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span>, their alleged bad faith not having been
established; and (d) that, similarly, the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span>
are not bound to pay damages to the RFC, the action of the former against the
latter not being altogether unjustified.</p>

<p class="BODY">All of the parties - namely, plaintiff, Jose Ponce de Leon,

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span> maintain that the lower
court erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in holding that the
promissory note and the deed of mortgage executed by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> in favor of the RFC are valid as regards one-half
of the <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span> property; (2) in ruling that the
extra-judicial sale thereof to the RFC is valid as to the aforementioned
one-half of said property; (3) in not sentencing the RFC to allow the
redemption of such half of said property by the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span>,
as heirs of the deceased Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, for
one-half of the sum of P10,000 for which the whole lot was sold to the RFC, or,
at least, for the whole sum of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P10,000;
(4) in not declaring that section 78 of Rep. Act No. 337 is unconstitutional
and in holding that the same, instead of Act No. 3135, as amended by Act No.
4118, is the law applicable to the case; (5) in considering that the case of <span class="SpellE">Villar</span> v. de Paderanga<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> is authoritative or controlling in
the case at bar; (6) in not sentencing the plaintiff and the RFC to pay damages
to the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span>; (7) in not ordering the RFC to
return OCT No. 8094, covering the <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span> property,
to the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span>, free from any lien or encumbrance;
and (8) in denying the motion for reconsideration of the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The latter's first assignment of error is predicated upon the
theory that, when the promissory note and the deed of mortgage in question were
executed by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, he was somewhat
absent-minded, owing to senility, he being then a septuagenarian, apart from
illiterate, for he could write only his name; that he was persuaded to sign
said promissory note and deed of mortgage thru fraud, deceit and undue
influence, and did not know the true nature of these instruments when he
affixed his signatures thereon; and that said instruments are also null and
void for lack of cause and consi­deration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this connection, the appealed decision has the following to say:</p>

<blockquote>"The third-party plaintiffs ask that the mort­gage deed and
promissory note be declared null and void with respect to Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> for lack of consent and consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is claimed that Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> was made to believe by Ponce de Leon when he
signed, the mortgage deed and the promissory note that these were documents
releasing his land from the previous mortgage in favor of the PNB and that
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> did not receive a single centavo
out of the RFC loan.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The principal witness on the above allegation of the
third-party plaintiffs is Rosalina <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, who testi­fied
that her father, Francisco was an old man who was absent-minded; that in 1945,
Ponce de Leon merely bor­rowed her father's certificate of title on the pretext
that he would see if it were valid; that she gave it to Ponce de Leon who never
returned the certificate and it turned out that the latter mortgaged it to the
PNB by deceiving her father in signing the mortgage contract; that in 1951, her
father received a sheriff's notice that the land would be foreclosed; that her
father went to see Ponce de Leon in <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> but the latter
assured him that nothing would happen to his land; that in October, 1951, she
and her father went to see Ponce de Leon; that when the latter told her father
that the property was mortgaged to the RFC, her father got angry at Ponce de
Leon saying that the latter fooled him but Ponce de Leon' assured him that he
would redeem the land but he failed to do so.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Ponce de Leon denied having deceived Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> into signing the mortgage deed covering his land,
saying that the transaction was with the full and complete knowledge and
understanding of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was supported by Felipe <span class="SpellE">Cuaderno</span>, Jr., the Notary Public, who notarized the
mortgage deed, who said that he explained and translated into <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>, a language known and spoken by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, the mortgage deed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The fact that Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> may
have been absent-minded could not be said to have the effect of vi­tiating his
consent to the mortgage deed because the exe­cution and signing of a contract
is not a matter that con­cerns past events in which absent-mindedness may be
taken into account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the
testimony of Rosalina <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> to the effect that her
father told Ponce de Leon that the latter fooled him shows that the old man <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> could remember past events, for if truly
absent-minded, Francisco would not recollect what he claims to be what really
took place at the RFC office as testified to by Rosalina.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Neither could Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> be
considered feeble-minded if we believe the testimony of Rosalina which shows <span class="SpellE">Soriano's</span> determination to see to it that the wrong done
him was righted and that his property may not be taken away from him, for
according to Rosalina, he even went to <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> alone
to see Ponce de Leon he received the Sheriff's notice of foreclosure and as shown
by his alleged going to see Ponce de Leon a number of times about his land and
of his enlisting the aid of Ramon <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span> stress that, according
to Felipe <span class="SpellE">Cuaderno</span>, Jr., the Notary Public, when the
latter asked Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, after he had
translated the mortgage deed into <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span> if he
(Francisco) understood it, it was Ponce de Leon who said that the old man
already (k)new it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, granting that
this was what happened, yet, Fran­cisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> would
certainly have protested against the statement of Ponce de Leon if Francisco
did not really know what the transaction was about or he would have told <span class="SpellE">Cuaderno</span> that the document was not in accordance with the
agreement between him and Ponce de Leon con­sidering that the document was
already translated to the old man by <span class="SpellE">Cuaderno</span> in the <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span> language which <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
understood.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Besides, if Ponce de Leon really deceived Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> into signing the mortgage deed and promissory note
so much so that in October, 1951, the old man <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
was so angry at Ponce de Leon that he told the latter that he fooled him as
testified to by Rosalina <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, then why was it
that <u>Ponce de Leon was made one of the sponsors of the thanksgiving mass of
Neo-<span class="SpellE">Prysbeter</span> Rev. Fr. <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, the old man's son</u> and one of the present
third-party plaintiffs?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conduct of
the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span> in making Ponce de Leon one of the
sponsors in the thanks­giving mass of Rev. Fr. <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> <u>in which Ponce de Leon 'spent a
considerable amount for the big feast that followed the mass is inconsistent
with the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span>' claim</u> that Ponce de Leon had
hoodwinked Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> into signing the
mortgage instrument and the promissory note.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, the mere oral unsupported testimony of Rosalina <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, an interested party and one of the plaintiffs
herein, is not sufficient to overcome the legal presumption of the regularity
of the mortgage deed, a contract celebrated with all the legal requisites under
the safeguard of a <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> certificate (Naval, et
al. v. Enriquez, 3 Phil. 670-72).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
unsupported testimony of the interested party Rosalina <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
is not that clear, strong and convincing evidence beyond mere preponderance of
evidence, required to show the falsity or nullity of a <span class="SpellE">notarial</span>
document (<span class="SpellE">Sigue</span>, et al., v. <span class="SpellE">Escaro</span>,
CA, 53 Q. C. 1161; <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Ratacion</span>,

v. <span class="SpellE">Coquinco</span>, G. R. No. L-1355; Robinson v. <span class="SpellE">Villafuerte</span>, 18 Phil. 171).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With reference to the contention that there was no
consideration received by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> out of the
mortgage contract and the promissory note executed in connection therewith,
this is a matter which concerned merely Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
and Jose L. Ponce de Leon for Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> had
expressly in writing (Exhibit '33­a-Soriano') authorized Jose L. Ponce de Leon
to have the check or checks covering the amount of the mortgage is­sued in the
name of said Jose L. Ponce de Leon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What­ever
arrangements the latter and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> may
have had with respect to the amounts thus given by the RFC on account of the
mortgage is not the concern of the RFC if Ponce de Leon did not in fact give
any portion of the amount to Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, <u>there is ample evidence to
show that Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> received part of the
consideration of the loan from the RFC</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It will be recalled that <u>part of this loan was paid for the
obligation of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> and Ponce de Leon to
the Philippine National Bank</u> secured by a mortgage of the lot in the name
of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That Fran­cisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> received portions of
this PNB loan from Ponce de Leon is shown by the fact that on <u>August 16,
1945, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> received the amount of
P2,000.00 from Ponce de Leon</u>, evidenced by the receipt exhibit 'N', and
this amount must have been part of the P10,000.00 consideration of the PNB
mortgage because this <u>mort­gage was executed on August 11, 1945 or two days
before<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
received from Ponce de Leon the amount of<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>P2,000.00 on August 16, 1945</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And two days thereafter, <u>on August 18, 1945, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> again received from Ponce de Leon the amount of
P350.00</u> as shown by the receipt exhibit '0-3' and, <u>on April 27, 1945,
the amount of P1,000.00 was received by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
from Ponce de Leon </u>as shown by his receipt exhibit '0-1' to pay the
mortgage on his lot to <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>On March 12, 1952, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> received the amount of P3,000.00</u> from de Leon
as shown by the check exhibit 'X-2' and <u>on June 3, 1952, the am­ount of
P50.00</u> as shown by the check exhibit 'X-6' and <u>P200.00 on October 22,
1952</u> as shown by the check exhibit 'X-7'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Rosanna <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> herself received P50.00 on
March 30, 1952</u> from Ponce de Leon as shown by the check marked Exhibit
'X-3' and third-party plaintiff <u>Rev. <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> received P100.00 on March 3, 1952</u> as shown by
the check exhibit 'X-1' <u>and P50.00 on March 31, 1952</u> as shown by exhibit
'X-4'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is therefore no grounds for
declaring the mortgage contract and promissory note invalid for lack of
consideration insofar as Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> and his

<p class="BODY">The facts thus relied upon by His Honor, the Trial Judge, are

<span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>In support of their second
assignment of error, the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span> maintain that the
sum of P10,000, for which the <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span> property was
sold to the RFC, is ridiculously inadequate, considering that said property had
been assessed at P59,647.05.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
pretense is devoid of merit, for said property was subject to redemption and:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>

<p class="BODY">Then, again, as the trial court had correctly observed:</p>

<blockquote>"But, mere inadequacy of the price obtained at the sheriff's
sale unless shocking to the conscience will not be sufficient to set aside the
sale if there is <u>no showing that, in the event of a regular sale, a better
price can be obtained</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason is
that, generally, and, <span class="SpellE">inforced</span> sales, low prices are
usually offered (1 Moran's Rules of Court, pp. 834-835).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that in <span class="SpellE">Gov't</span>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span> insist that the present
case is governed, not by Rep. Act No. 337, but by Act No. 3135, as amended by
Act No. 4118 - pursuant to which, in relation to section 465 of Act No. 190,
the re­demption may be made by "paying the purchaser the <u>amount of his
purchase</u>," with interest and taxes - the deed of real estate mort­gage
in favor of the RFC having allegedly been executed and the aforementioned property
having been sold pursuant to said Acts Nos. 3135 and 4118.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion drawn by the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span>
from these facts is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As set
forth in its title, Act No. 3135 was promulgated "to regulate the <u>sale</u>
of property under special powers inserted in or annexed to real estate
mortgages," Section 6 thereof provides that in all cases of
"extrajudicial sale x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
made under the special power he <span class="SpellE">reinbefore</span> referred
to," the property sold may be redeemed within "one year from and
after the date of the sale x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>" Act No. 4118 amended Act No. 3135 by
merely adding thereto three (3) new sections.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the other hand, Rep. Act No. 337, otherwise known as "The
General Banking Act," is entitled "An Act <u>Regulating Banks and
Banking Institutions</u> and for other purposes." Section 78 thereof
limits the amount of the loans that may be given by banks and banking or credit
institutions on the basis of the appraised value of the property given as
security, as well as provides that, in the event of foreclosure of a real
estate mortgage to said banks or institutions, the property sold may be
redeemed "by paying the <u>amount fixed by the court in the order of
execution</u>," or the amount judicially adjudicated to the creditor
bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This provision had the effect of
amending section 6 of Act No. 3135, insofar as the redemption price is
concerned, when the mortgagee is a bank or a banking or credit institution,
said section 6 of Act No. 3135 being, in this respect, inconsistent with the
above-quoted portion of section 78 of Rep. Act No. 337, In short, the <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span> property, was sold pursuant to said Act No: 3135,
but the sum for which it is redeemable shall be governed by Rep. Act No. 337, <u>which
partakes of the nature of an amendment to Act No. 3135</u>, insofar as
mortgages to banks or banking or credit institutions are concerned; to which
class the RFC belongs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the
conflict between the two (2) laws must be resolved in favor of Rep. Act No.

<p class="BODY">The sixth, seventh and eighth assignments of error made by the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span> are mere consequences of those already disposed

is necessary.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><u>Plaintiff's Appeal<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff Ponce de Leon alleges that the lower court has
erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) "in not setting aside
the foreclosure sales on the mort­gage contract dated October 8, 1951";
(2) "in stating that the pro­ceeds of the foreclosure sales were
conscionable"; (3) in not granting Ponce de Leon's claim for adjustment
and not "giving him a reasonable time to pay whatever obligations he may
have"; (4) in not granting him damages nor directing the return of his
properties; (5) "in not ordering a new trial for the purpose of
adjusting" his "obligations and determining the terms and conditions
of his obli­gation"; and (6) in not granting his claim against the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to his first assignment of error, plaintiff main­tains
that his promissory note Exhibit A was not yet overdue when the mortgage was
foreclosed, because the installments stipulated in said promissory note have
"no fixed or determined dates of payment," so that the note is
unenforceable and "the RFC should have first asked the court to determine
the terms, conditions and period of maturity thereof."</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, it should be noted that, pursuant to Exhi­bit
A, the total sum of P495,000 involved therein shall be satisfied in quarterly
installments of P28,831.64 each - representing interest and amortization - and
that, although the date of maturity of the first installment was left blank,
the promissory note states that the "date of maturity (was) to be fixed as
of the date of the last release," com­pleting the delivery to the
plaintiff of the sum of P495,000 lent to him by the RFC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He now says that this sum of P495,000 has
not, as yet, been fully released by the RFC.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But, this is contrary to the facts of record, for, during the trial, his
counsel, Atty. Jose Orozco, made the following admission:</p>

<blockquote>"Out of the loan of P495,000.00, the following were paid to
the creditors of Jose Ponce de Leon: P100,000.00 to the PNB, P30,000.00 to Cu <span class="SpellE">Unjieng</span> Bros, P5,000.00 to Arturo <span class="SpellE">Colmenares</span>,
P1,000.00 to Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Balagtas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The total amount paid to the creditors is
P136,000.00 which were <u>taken out of the proceeds of P495,000.00.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>rest </u>were <u>all</u> paid in the
name of Jose Ponce de Leon."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In short, part of the sum of P495,000 had been delivered by the
RFC to the creditors of the plaintiff and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>,
as agreed upon by them, in payment of their outstanding obligations, and the
balance of said sum of P495,000 was turned over to the plain­tiff, with the
written authorization and conformity of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is borne out by the fact that, prior to
the institution of this case, plaintiff had not complained of failure of the
RFC to fully release the aforementioned sum of P495,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in his own complaint herein, he
merely alleged a "<u>delay</u> in the release." Even so, he impliedly
admitted that the first installment was due in October 1952 - or, more
specifically, on October 24, 1952, this being the date given <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> in the letter-demands of the RFC, the accuracy of
which were not questioned by the plaintiff - so that the last release made by
the RFC to complete the sum of P495,000 must have taken place on July 24, 1952,
although, in answer to a question propounded to him, by his own counsel, as
regards the date he "received the <u>total</u> amount granted by the
RFC," plaintiff said - on the witness stand - he "believed that it
was in the last part or quarter of <u>1953</u>." At this juncture, it is noteworthy
that plaintiff claims the right to a suspension of payment or an extension of
the period to pay the RFC owing to the typhoons that had lashed his saw­mill in
October and November 1952, thus indicating clearly that the amount of the loan
extended to him and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> had then been <u>fully</u>
released by the RFC three (3) months before October 1952 and that the first
installment under the promissory note Exhibit A was due that month, as claimed
by the RFC.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, Annex A, in effect, authorized the RFC to fix the
date of maturity of the installments therein stipulated, which is allowed by
the Negotiable Instruments Law<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> and when a promissory note
expresses "no time for payment, it is deemed "payable on
demand."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Under his second assignment of error, plaintiff maintains that
the aggregate price of P112,332.00, for which the mortgaged properties had been
sold at public auction, is unconscionable, said properties being allegedly
worth P1,202,976.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This premise is in­accurate.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that plaintiff and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> were granted a P495,000 loan on the security, not
only, of the <u>existing</u> properties offered as guarantee, but, also, on
that of assets - ap­praised at P570,000 - <u>yet to be acquired</u> by
plaintiff, partly with money thus received from the RFC and partly with his own
funds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After obtaining said loan and
receiving the amount thereof, less the sum of P136, 000 applied to the payment
of outstanding obligations, plaintiff failed to purchase the machinery and
equipment he had pro­mised to get, or to set up the constructions he had
undertaken to make.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the RFC
found that the mortgaged lots in the cities of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:place></st1:city> and <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:place></st1:city>, which were originally
appraised at P492,288.00, were actually worth P172,530.00 only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, a good part of the ma­chinery and
equipment existing in one of the mortgaged lands, when it was inspected before
the granting of the loan, were subsequently lost or missing, and those that
remained were, at the time of the sale to the RFC, in bad shape, so that the
appraised value thereof was then estimated at P10,000 only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances, it is clear that
the lower court did not err in approving the sale of the mortgaged properties
for the aggregate sum of P112, 332.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards his third assignment of error, it is urged by the
plaintiff that he is entitled to a "suspension of payment," or a
postponement of the date of maturity of his obligation to pay, in view of the
typhoons that had "practically wiped out" his sawmill in <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> during the months of October and November 1952.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This claim is predicated upon Article 1174 of
our Civil Code, reading:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Except in cases expressly specified by the law, or when it is otherwise
declared by stipulation, or when the nature of the obligation requires the
assump­tion of risk, no person shall be responsible for those events which
could not be foreseen, or which, though foreseen, were inevitable."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff cannot avail of the benefits of this provision since he
was not bound to deliver the aforementioned sawmill, or any other the specific
thing damaged or destroyed by typhoons, to the RFC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His obligation was merely generic, namely, to
pay certain sums of money to the RFC, at stated intervals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As His Honor, the Trial Judge, had aptly put
it:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> in the instant case, 'there was an obligation on
the part of the debtor to pay his loan; <u>independently</u> of the purpose for
Which the money loaned, was intended to be used arid this obligation to pay
continues to subsist notwithstanding the fact that it may have become
impossible for the debtor to use the money loaned for the particular purpose
that was in­tended (Milan v. Rio y <span class="SpellE">Olabarrieta</span>, 45
Phil. 718).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is hence no ground for
declaring the amortiza­tions due on the principal loan since October, 1952 as
extinguished due to fortuitous event or to grant plaintiff a reasonable time to
pay the due amortiza­tions as asked for by Ponce de Leon in his, com­plaint."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Being mere corollaries to his first three assignments of error,
which cannot be sustained, plaintiff's fourth, fifth and sixth assignments of
error must have the same fate.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><u>Defendant's Appeal<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The RFC contends that the lower court erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in holding that the <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>
property is presumed to belong to the conjugal partnership of Mr. and Mrs.
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>; (2) in failing to give due weight
to the testimony of Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, and in holding
that the same is insufficient to overcome the presumption in favor of the
conjugal nature of said property; (3) in failing to consider that the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span> are now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from
questioning the validity of the mortgage on and the foreclosure sale of said
property; (4) in annul­ling the mortgage insofar as one-half of said property
is concerned, despite the finding that part of the proceeds of the RFC loan was
paid to settle the PNB loan secured by the same property; and (5) in holding
that the mortgage thereon and the sheriff's sale thereof to the RFC are null
and void as regards one-half of said property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These assignments of error may be reduced to one, namely, that the lower
court erred in voiding the sale to the RFC of the <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>
property, upon the ground that the same formed part of the conjugal partnership
of Mr. and Mrs. Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, it appears that the property was registered
in the name of "Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, married to <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> Rodriguez," and that based upon this fact alone
- without any proof establishing satisfactorily that the property had been <u>acquired
during <span class="SpellE">coverture</span></u> the lower court presumed that it
belongs to the conjugal partnership of said spouses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the RFC that the lower court
has erred in applying said presumption.</p>

<p class="BODY">We should not overlook the fact that the title to said property
was not a transfer certificate of title, but an <u>original</u> one, issued in
accordance with a decree which, pursuant to law, merely <u>confirms</u> a <u>pre-existing</u>
title.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a>
Said original certificate of title does <u>not</u> estab­lish, therefore, the <u>time</u>
of acquisition of the <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span> property by the
registered owner thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, again, the lower court applied said presumption, having in
mind, presumably, Article 160 of our Civil Code, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> All
property of the marriage is presumed to belong to the conjugal partnership,
unless it be proved that it pertains exclusively to the husband or to the
wife."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This provision must be construed in relation to Articles 153 to
159 of the same Code, enumerating the properties "acquired x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> during the marriage"
that constitute the conjugal partnership.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Con­sistently therewith, We have held that "the party who invokes
this presumption must <u>first prove</u> that the property in controversy was <u>acquired
during the marriage</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words,
<u>proof of acquisition during <span class="SpellE">coverture</span> is a
condition sine qua non for the operation of the presumption</u> in favor of
conjugal partnership."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> It had, earlier, been declared,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a>
that "(t)he presumption under Article 160 of the Civil Code refers to
property <u>acquired during-the marriage</u> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." We even, added that, there being "no showing
as to when the pro­perty in question was acquired x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <u>the fact that the title is in the wife’s name
alone is determinative</u>." This is borne out by the fact that, in the
previous cases applying said presumption,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a> <u>it was duly established </u>that
the property in question therein had been <u>acquired during. <span class="SpellE">coverture</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
was, also, the situation obtaining in <span class="SpellE">Servidad</span> v.
Alejandrino<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a>
cited in the decision appealed from.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case at bar is differently situated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span> have <u>not</u>
succeeded in proving that the <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span> property was
acquired "during the marriage" of their parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, <u>there is substantial
evidence to the contrary</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> testified that his
first cousin, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, had acquired said
property <u>from his parents</u>, long before he got married.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, the lower court, however,
said that:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the
credibility of this witness is subject to doubt for it was shown that he had an
improper mo­tive in testifying against the third-party plaintiffs because he
had a niece who was prosecuted by the third­ party plaintiffs for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x.”<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This observation is, to our mind, hardly justifiable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be­gin with, when counsel for the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span> asked the witness whether or not his grandchild or
grandniece <span class="SpellE">Flordeliza</span> <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>
had been ac­cused of "<span class="SpellE">estafa</span>" by the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span>, counsel for the RFC objected thereto, and the
court <u>sustained</u> the objection, upon the ground that the question was
"<u>irrelevant</u>." As a consequence, there is no evi­dence of the
prosecution of <span class="SpellE">Flordeliza</span> <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>
by the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span>. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>What is more, the ruling of the court
declaring the matter "<u>irrele­vant</u>" to the present case
rendered it unnecessary for the RFC to prove that said prosecution - if it were
a fact - had nothing to do with the testimony of Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would, therefore, be less than fair to the
RFC to draw an inference adverse thereto re­sulting from the absence of
evidence to this effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate,
said prosecution does not necessarily warrant the conclusion that Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> was impelled by an "improper motive" in
testify­ing as he did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span> are, likewise, nieces of Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> and he was not the party allegedly accused by them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, this witness testified in a straightforward manner, and
disclosed a good number of details bearing the earmarks of veracity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, his testimony <u>was
corroborated</u>, <u>not only</u> by Felipe <span class="SpellE">Cuaderno</span>,
Jr. and OCT No. 8094, <u>but, also</u>, by the tes­timony of third-party
plaintiff Rosalina <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, Felipe <span class="SpellE">Cuaderno</span>,
Jr. - an assistant attorney and notary public of the RFC, before whom the deed
of mortgage was acknowledged - testified that, in a conference he had before
the execution of the promissory note and the deed of mortgage in favor of said
institution, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> assured him that the <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span> property was "his own separate property,
having acquired it from his deceased father <u>by inheritance </u>and that his
children have <u>nothing to do</u> with the pro­perty." This was, in
effect, confirmed by no less than Rosalina <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>,
for she stated, on cross-examination, that her father, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, "was <u>born</u> and x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <u>raised</u>" in said property, so that -
contrary to her testimony in chief - he could not have told her that he and his
wife had bought it, as the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span> would have Us
believe.</p>

<p class="BODY">Needless to say, had the property been acquired by them during <span class="SpellE">coverture</span>, it would have been registered, in the name <u>not</u>
of "Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, married to <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> Rodriguez," but <u>of the spouses</u>
"Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span>
Rodriguez." In <span class="SpellE">Litam</span> v. Espiritu,<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> We
quoted with approval the following observation made in the decision under
review therein:</p>

<blockquote>"Further strong proofs that the properties in question are the
<span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span> properties of <span class="SpellE">Marcosa</span>
Rivera, are the very Torrens Titles covering said pro­perties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the said properties are registered in the
name of '<span class="SpellE">Marcosa</span> Rivera, married to Rafael <span class="SpellE">Litam</span>.' This circumstance indicates that the properties in
question belong to the registered owner, <span class="SpellE">Marcosa</span>
Rivera, as her <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span> properties, for <u>if they
were conjugal, the titles covering the same should have been issued in the
names of Rafael <span class="SpellE">Litam</span> and <span class="SpellE">Marcosa</span>
Rivera</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The words 'married to Rafael
<span class="SpellE">Litam</span>' written after the name of <span class="SpellE">Marcosa</span>
Rivera, in each of the above mentioned titles are merely descriptive of the
civil status of <span class="SpellE">Marcosa</span> Rivera, the registered owner
of the properties covered by said titles."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The records further show that on August 16, 1945 - or two (2)
days after the execution of the deed of mortgage for P10,000 in favor of the
PNB - Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> received P2,000 from plain­tiff
herein; that, early in 1951, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
received a letter informing him that the PNB mortgage on the <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span> property would be foreclosed, unless the debt
guaranteed therewith were settled;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that,
accordingly, his children came to know of the mortgage in favor of the PNB;
that on October 8, 1951, said mortgage was transferred to the RFC; that,
thereafter, or from March to October 1952, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
and his children, Rosalina <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, received several
sums of money, aggregating P3,450, from plaintiff herein; that the latter,
moreover, spent over P6,000 on the occasion of the ordination of third-party
plaintiff, <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>,
as a priest, on April 20, 1952; that plaintiff, also, paid the bills of
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> in the <span class="SpellE">Singian</span>
Clinic when he fell sick in 1953; and that the former had, likewise, paid the
real estate tax on the <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span> property from 1947
to 1952.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under these circumstances, it is difficult to believe that the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span> did not know then of the mortgage constituted by
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, on <st1:date year="1951" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1951</st1:date>, in favor of the RFC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, Rosalina <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
testified that when, that month, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
and she conferred with the plaintiff, he stated that the <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>
property was mortgaged to the RFC, whereupon her father got angry at the
plaintiff and said that he had fooled him (Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being thus aware of said mortgage since
October 1951, the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span> did not question its
validity - until <st1:date year="1957" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1957</st1:date>,
when they filed in this case their third-party complaint in intervention - as
regards, at least, one-half of the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Paranaque</span></st1:place></st1:city>
property, which they now claim to be their mother's share in the conjugal
partnership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse still, <u>after the
foreclosure sale</u> in favor of the RFC, they <u>tried to redeem the property</u>
for P14,000, and, when the RFC did not agree thereto, they even sought the help
of the Office of the President to effect said redemption.</p>

<p class="BODY">Their aforementioned failure to contest the legality of the mort­gage
for over five (5) years and these attempts to redeem the property constitute
further indicia that the same belonged <u>exclusively</u> to Francisco <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, not to the conjugal partnership with his deceased
wife, <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> Rodriguez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apart from the fact that said attempts to
redeem the property constitute an implied admission of the <u>validity</u> of
its <u>sale</u> - and, hence, of its <u>mortgage</u> to the RFC - there are
authorities to the effect that they bar the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span>
from assailing the same.</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
defendants, by their repeated requests for time to redeem had <u>impliedly
admitted</u> - and <u>were</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>estopped</u></span> to
question - the validity and regularity of the Sheriff's sale.”<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The petitioner himself believed that the com­pany had a right

the repurchase</u> of the property, and the company agreed to resell it to him
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unluckily he could make no down payment and
the repurchase fell through.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wherefore,

<blockquote>"The fact that <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Mallorca</span></st1:place>
failed to exercise right of redemption, which <u>she sought to enforce</u> in a

mort­gage lien thereon."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is thus clear that the lower court erred in annulling the RFC
mortgage on the <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span> property and its sale to
the RFC as regards one-half of said property, and that the decision appealed
from should, accordingly, be modified, by eliminating <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
the second paragraph of its <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part, quoted
earlier in this decision.</p>
