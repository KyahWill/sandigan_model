				<BR><BR><div align="justify">From &nbsp;the &nbsp;decision &nbsp;of the Court of &nbsp;First Instance of Cebu in Civil Case No. &nbsp;R-4372 sentencing Mario Delgado and Leonor Delgado Dee to &nbsp;pay, jointly and severally, to the Capital Insurance and &nbsp;Surety Company &nbsp;Inc., the sum of P583.95, with legal interest thereon from the filing of the complaint until &nbsp;paid in full, &nbsp;plus &nbsp;the &nbsp;sum of P116.79 as attorney's &nbsp;fees and costs, the Delgados interposed &nbsp;an appeal &nbsp;to &nbsp;this court. <p>In &nbsp;our &nbsp;decision &nbsp;promulgated &nbsp;on &nbsp;March 30, &nbsp;1963, we stated the facts &nbsp;established by the evidence &nbsp;as follows: </p> <blockquote> <p>"Appellee, Capital &nbsp;Insurance &amp; &nbsp;Surety &nbsp;Co. Inc., an &nbsp;insurance company duly organized under the laws of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Philippines, issued on August &nbsp;1, &nbsp;1953, &nbsp;its &nbsp;Fire &nbsp; Insurance Policy No. &nbsp;C-1137 &nbsp;for P30.000, &nbsp;whereby it insured several personal properties of appellants &nbsp;located at Sanciangko Street, Cebu City, for a period of one year, &nbsp;at &nbsp;an &nbsp;annual &nbsp;premium &nbsp;of P337.50 On &nbsp;August 8, 1953, &nbsp;a bill for the premium &nbsp;charges of P337.50, &nbsp;plus P5.10 &nbsp;for documentary stamps was sent to &nbsp;the latter, &nbsp;but the same remained unpaid. &nbsp;This notwithstanding, on August 31, 1954, a renewal certificate (No. C-1238) of Policy No. C-1137 &nbsp;was &nbsp;issued by appellee covering the period from &nbsp;August 1, 1954 to &nbsp;August 1, 1955 at the same rate of premium.</p> <p>"On October 25, 1954, appellee's assistant &nbsp;manager, Virgilio Formoso, &nbsp;wrote appellant Mario Delgado &nbsp;reminding him of &nbsp;the unpaid premium in the total sum &nbsp;of &nbsp;P685.20. In &nbsp;reply thereto, &nbsp;Delgado promised to pay the &nbsp;unpaid charges &nbsp;on or &nbsp;before &nbsp;November 10th of the same year. As he &nbsp;failed to do &nbsp;so, appellant filed the &nbsp;present action with the Court of First Instance of &nbsp;Cebu &nbsp;against appellant to recover from them the sum of &nbsp;P583.95, representing the premium charges &nbsp;an &nbsp;Fire Insurance &nbsp;Policy No. C-1137, the further &nbsp;sum of P16.79 as &nbsp;attorney's fees, and costs.</p> <p>"Appellants' answer alleged that they did not insure their property against fire &nbsp;with appellee, and disclaimed liability on the &nbsp;further ground that, as they failed &nbsp;to &nbsp;pay &nbsp;the corresponding premium no contract of insurance was consummated &nbsp;and &nbsp; therefore appellee had no cause of action against them."</p> </blockquote> <p>The above facts notwithstanding, we set aside the appealed decision and &nbsp;dismissed the case without &nbsp;costs, on the ground that the Court of First Instance of Cebu had no original jurisdiction over the case and all proceedings had thereat were void.</p> <p>In due time, appellee filed a motion for reconsideration, the pertinent portions of which &nbsp;read as &nbsp;follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>"2. That this Honorable Court is justified in &nbsp;the &nbsp;foregoing conclusion &nbsp;for the reason that the Record &nbsp;on Appeal merely indicated thru &nbsp;inadvertence and omission &nbsp;that this &nbsp;case &nbsp;was &nbsp;filed &nbsp;in &nbsp;the Court of First Instance of Cebu;</p> <p>"2. That this Honorable Court is justified in &nbsp;the &nbsp;foregoing con-thru Atty. Eufrosino L. Ramos there &nbsp;appears on Page 1 the following (1) That plaintiff filed with &nbsp;the &nbsp;above-named Court &nbsp;of First Instance of Cebu, Philippines a Complaint dated November 28, 1955 for the recovery of a sum of money docketed as Civil Case No. R-4372 which Complaint &nbsp;reads as follows: &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;*'</p> <p>"That the &nbsp;foregoing allegation in &nbsp;the Record on Appeal is misleading erroneous, and not in &nbsp;accordance with the true facts but the same escaped the notice of the plaintiff &nbsp;so that &nbsp;no objection was filed to the Record on Appeal; and the trial &nbsp;court did not also notice the error and therefore approved the Record &nbsp;on Appeal (pages &nbsp;13 &amp; 14, &nbsp;Record on Appeal); </p> <p>"4. That the true fact is that the &nbsp;Complaint dated Nov. 28, 1955 quoted on pages 2 and 3 is a Complaint &nbsp;filed in the Municipal Court of Cebu City in &nbsp;Civil Case &nbsp;No. R-2327; &nbsp;that &nbsp;this &nbsp;is &nbsp;shown by the allegation of venue in paragraph &nbsp;5 of said &nbsp;complaint &nbsp;dated) November 28, 1955 which would not be necessary in a Complaint filed in the Court of First Instance as said &nbsp;Paragraph 5 &nbsp;of the Complaint reads: '(5) that the insurance policy &nbsp;issued by the plaintiff to the &nbsp;defendants was issued &nbsp;in &nbsp;Cebu City &nbsp;and this &nbsp;court has jurisdiction &nbsp;over this case pursuant &nbsp;to &nbsp;sub- paragraph &nbsp;(b), Sec. 2, Rule 4, Rules of Court' (page 3, Record on &nbsp;Appeal);</p> <p>"5. That there &nbsp;is attached hereto a Certification of the Clerk of Court of the Court of First Instance of Cebu that Civil Case No. R-4372 &nbsp;is a case &nbsp;on &nbsp;appeal from the Municipal Court of &nbsp;Cebu City being Civil &nbsp;Case No. R-2327 &nbsp;of &nbsp;said Municipal Court and the Complaint in the Municipal Court was dated &nbsp;November &nbsp;28, &nbsp;1955; that the Certification of the Clerk of Court of the Court of First Instance of Cebu is &nbsp;attached hereto and made an &nbsp;integral part hereof duly marked as Exh. 'A'; that this &nbsp;court can take judicial cognizance of all proceedings &nbsp;before it and in the lower &nbsp;courts; that the interest of justice require that the true &nbsp;facts that this case, started &nbsp;in &nbsp;the Municipal &nbsp;Court &nbsp;should be made &nbsp;to &nbsp;prevail over an error in the Record on Appeal; that this Honorable Court if not satisfied with the attached Certification an require the Clerk of Court of the Court of First Instance of Cebu to elevate to it fill of the original records of this case so that it can ascertain for itself that it actually &nbsp;originated in the Municipal &nbsp;Court of Cebu City;"</p> </blockquote> <p>Appellants &nbsp;filed &nbsp;an &nbsp;opposition &nbsp;to &nbsp;said motion for reconsideration, alleging, firstly, that it is &nbsp;now too late to correct the record &nbsp;on appeal; secondly, that appellee &nbsp;is not entitled to relief, because of its &nbsp;failure &nbsp;to &nbsp;object in the &nbsp;lower court to the approval of the record on appeal, incomplete and inaccurate as it was when filed in said court; and lastly, &nbsp;that "the defendants-appellants are not &nbsp;bound to pay premiums on an insurance policy which would not have been honored anyway because they did not pay the premiums."</p> <p>It appearing now that the &nbsp;present action was in &nbsp;fact commenced in the Municipal Court of Cebu City where it was docketed &nbsp;as &nbsp;Civil Case No. &nbsp;R-2327, it &nbsp;is clear that the ground upon which we set aside the appealed decision can not &nbsp;be maintained.</p> <p>On the other hand, the &nbsp;preponderance of the evidence shows that appellee issued fire insurance policy No. C-1137 in favor of appellants, covering a certain property belonging to the latter &nbsp; located in Cebu City; that appellants failed to pay a balance of P583.95 on the premium charges due, notwithstanding demands made upon &nbsp;them. As &nbsp;with the issuance of the policy to appellants the same &nbsp;became effective and &nbsp;binding upon the contracting parties, the latter can not avoid the obligation of paying the premiums agreed upon. &nbsp;In fact,, appellant Mario Delgado, in a &nbsp;letter marked in the record as Exhibit G, expressly &nbsp;admitted his unpaid account for premiums and asked &nbsp;for an extension of time to pay the same. &nbsp;It is &nbsp;clear from the foregoing that appellants are under obligation to pay the amount sued upon.</p> <p>Wherefore, our original decision is hereby set aside, and the appealed decision &nbsp;is affirmed, with &nbsp;costs.</p> <p><i>Bengzon, C. &nbsp;J., Padilla, Barrera, Paredes, &nbsp;Regala</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.,</i> concur.</p> </div>
