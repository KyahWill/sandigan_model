				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The sole issue in this petition for prohibition is whether or not
the Court of First Instance of Pampanga, Branch I, <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, in Civil Case No. 2515, gravely abused its
discretion in denying petitioner's motion to dismiss on the ground of improper
venue.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 16, 1964, private respondent Lawrence Heller, as a
consequence of the injuries sustained by him when his motorcycle was bumped by
a bus of the <span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span> Transportation Co., Inc., filed
an action with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
against petitioners James G. <span class="SpellE">Gayot</span>, the bus driver,
and <span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span> Transportation Co., Inc., owner of the
bus, and docketed therein as Civil Case No. 2515,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
for damages (actual and compensatory – P30,000.00, moral and exemplary – P14,000.00).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his complaint, private respondent alleges,
among others, (1) that he is of legal age, single, American citizen, an Airman
First Class of the United States Air Force, and presently assigned and
stationed at Clark Air Base, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, Philippines;
while the defendant James G. <span class="SpellE">Gayot</span>, is also of legal
age, Filipino, married, and a resident of Engineer's Hill, <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City and the other defendant <span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span> Bus Company<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
is a juridical person or corporation organized and existing in accordance with
the laws of the Republic of the Philippines, with business address at Trinidad
Valley, <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span>, Mountain Province, where summons and
other lawful processes of the court may be served; (2) that James G. <span class="SpellE">Gayot</span> is a driver and employee of said bus company, a common
carrier and registered owner of <span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span> bus bearing
Plate No. PUB-1986; (3) that on December 30, 1963, at Twin Peaks, <span class="SpellE">Kennon</span> Road, Tuba, <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span>,
Mountain Province, this <span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span> bus was driven by
James G. <span class="SpellE">Gayot</span> with such reckless imprudence and at a
greater speed than was reasonable and proper, that the bus collided with
Lawrence Heller who was then riding on his motorcycle; (4) that, as a result of
the collision, the latter sustained serious physical injuries, namely, a closed
fracture of the left femur and a compound fracture of the left tibia, and his
motorcycle was totally wrecked; (5) that, thereafter, he was confined at the
USAF Hospital, Clark Air Base, Angeles, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>; and
(6) that as Airman First Class in the USAF assigned to the 1st Mobile
Communication Group, Clark AFB, he received a monthly pay of $234.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 25, 1964, the petitioners filed a motion to dismiss<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> on
the ground that venue was improperly laid with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> under Section 1(c) of Rule 16 of the Revised Rules
of Court, for private respondent, an American citizen, is not a resident of
Clark Air Base, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, as the first paragraph of
his complaint alleges that he is "presently assigned and stationed at
Clark Air Base, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, Philippines", and, as
such, his assignment in the Philippines is temporary since members of the
United States Air Force may be assigned any time to any station under the
exclusive control and decision of the Commanding Officer; and that, pursuant to
Section 2(b), Rule 4, of the Revised Rules of Court, the venue of private
respondent's action should not be <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> but the
City of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> or <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span>,
Mountain Province.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 8, 1964, the private respondent filed an Opposition<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
to the aforesaid motion to dismiss alleging, among others, (1) that the
residence required by the rule (Section 2[b], Rule 4, Revised Rules of Court)
need not necessarily be permanent, it being sufficient that the plaintiff had
his actual residence at the place where the action was brought;<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> (2)
that he has the privilege to elect which court to file his action and he had
chosen the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>,
because he is a resident of Clark Air Base, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>,
not only at the time of the commencement of the present action, but also even
before the accident happened; and (3) that when he alleged in his complaint
that he is stationed in Clark Air Base, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>,
Philippines, he meant to convey that, as long as he stays in the Philippines,
his residence is in Clark Air Base, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, April 8, 1964, respondent Judge Malcolm G. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> issued an Order denying petitioners' motion to
dismiss,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
and stating that private respondent's actual residence is in Clark Air Base, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, and his action, therefore, was properly instituted
in said province, for "residence under this action need not be continuous,
it being sufficient that a party, though a foreign subject, has his actual residence
in the place when the action was brought."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We find the petition without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that respondent Lawrence Heller has his
fixed place of abode at Clark Air Base, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing in the record that Heller
has not resided consistently and with continuity in his place of abode at Clark
Air Base at the time he filed this action.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><i>Koh</i></span><i> v. Court of Appeals</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
We explained that the term "resides" as employed in the rule on venue
on personal actions filed with courts of first instance<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
means the place of abode, whether permanent or temporary, of the plaintiff or
the defendant, as distinguished from "domicile" which denotes a fixed
permanent residence to which, when absent, one has the intention of returning.</p>

<blockquote>"It is fundamental in the law governing venue of actions (Rule
4 of the Rules of Court) that the <span class="SpellE">situs</span> for bringing
real and personal civil actions are fixed by the rules to attain the greatest
convenience possible to the parties litigants by taking into consideration the
maximum accessibility to them of the courts of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is likewise undeniable that the term <i>domicile</i>
is not exactly synonymous in legal contemplation with the term <i>residence</i>,
for it is an established principle in Conflict of Laws that <i>domicile</i>
refers to the relatively more permanent abode of a person while <i>residence</i>
applies to a temporary stay of a person in a given place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact this distinction is very well
emphasized in those cases where the Domiciliary Theory must necessarily
supplant the Nationality Theory in cases involving stateless persons.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This Court held in the case of <span class="SpellE">Uytengsu</span>
vs. Republic, 50 O.G. 4781, October, 1954, rever­sing its previous stand in <span class="SpellE">Larena</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>, 61 Phil. 36 and
<span class="SpellE">Nuval</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Guray</span>, 52 Phil.
645, that–</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><i>'There is a difference between domicile and residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Residence is used to indicate a place of
abode, whether permanent or temporary; domi­cile denotes a fixed permanent
residence to which when absent, one has the intention of returning</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A man may have a residence in one place and a
domicile in another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Residence is not
domicile, but domicile is residence coupled with the intention to remain for an
unlimited time</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A man can have but
one domicile for one and the same purpose at any time, but he may have numerous
places of residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His place of
residence generally is his place of domicile, but is not by any means,
necessarily so since no length of residence without intention of remaining will
constitute domicile.' (<span class="SpellE">Italicised</span> for emphasis)</p>

<blockquote>"We note that the law on venue in Courts of First Instance
(Section 2, of Rule 4, Rules of Court) in referring to the parties utilizes the
words 'resides or may be found,' and not 'is domiciled,' thus:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Sec. 2(b) Personal actions – All other actions may be commenced
and tried where the defendant or any of the defendants <i>resides or may be
found,</i> or where the plaintiff or any of the plaintiffs <i>resides,</i> at
the election of the plaintiff.' (<span class="SpellE">Italicised</span> for
emphasis)</p>

<blockquote>"Applying the foregoing observation to the present case, We
are fully convinced that private respondent Coloma's protestations of domicile
in San Nicolas, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, based on his manifested
intention to return there after the retirement of his wife from government
service to justify his bringing of an action for damages against petitioner in
the C.F.I. of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, is entirely of no moment
since what is of paramount importance is where he actually resided or where he
may be found at the time he brought the action, to comply substantially with
the requirements of Sec. 2(b) of Rule 4, Rules of Court, on venue of personal
actions." (<span class="SpellE"><i>Koh</i></span><i> v. Court of Appeals, supra</i>,
pp. 304-305.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The same construction of the word "resides" as used in
Section 1, Rule 73, of the Revised Rules of Court, was enunciated in <span class="SpellE"><i>Fule</i></span><i> v. Court of Appeals, et al. </i>(G.R. No.
L-40502) and <span class="SpellE"><i>Fule</i></span><i> v. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Ernani</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Paño</span>, et al.</i> (G.R.
No. L-42670), decided on <st1:date year="1976" day="29" month="11">November 29,
 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, this Court, in
the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> cases, stated:</p>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, the far-ranging question is this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What does the term 'resides' mean?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Does it refer to the actual residence or
domicile of the decedent at the time of his death?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We lay down the doctrinal rule that the term
'resides' connotes <i>ex</i> <i>vi</i> <i>termini</i> 'actual residence' as
distinguished from 'legal residence or domicile.' This term 'resides,’ like the
terms 'residing’ and ‘residence’ is elastic and should be interpreted in the light
of the object or purpose of the statute <i>or</i> <i>rule</i> in which it is
employed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the application of venue
statutes and rules–Section 1, Rule 73 of the Revised Rules of Court is of such
nature–residence <i>rather</i> <i>than</i> domicile is the significant
factor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even where the statute uses the
word 'domicile' still it is construed as meaning residence and not domicile in
the technical sense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some cases make a
distinction between the terms 'residence' and 'domicile' but as generally used
in statutes fixing venue, the terms are synonymous, and convey the same meaning
as the term 'inhabitant.' In other words, 'resides' should be viewed or
understood in its popular sense, meaning, the personal, actual or physical
habitation of a person, actual residence or place of abode.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It signifies physical presence in a place and
actual stay thereat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this popular
sense, the term means merely residence, that is, personal residence, not legal
residence or domicile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Residence</i>
simply requires bodily presence as an <i>inhabitant</i> in a given place, while
<i>domicile </i>re­quires bodily presence in that place and also an intention
to make it one's domicile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No particular
length of time of residence is required though; however, the residence must be
more than temporary.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent court having found that private respondent Lawrence
Heller had his actual residence at Clark Air Base, Angeles (now a City), <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, at the time he filed his personal action against
the petitioners, it did not, therefore, gravely abuse its discretion in
refusing to dismiss the case.</p>
