				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Joint and direct appeal by plaintiffs, on points of law, from a
decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
in its Civil Case No. D-48, dismissing, after trial on the merits, their
re-amended complaint for <span class="SpellE"><u>reivindicación</u></span>, on
the ground of prescription; and by defendants, for refusal of the trial court
to grant their counterclaim for moral damages in the sum of P205,000.00, as not
having been sufficiently proved during the trial of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">As found by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, the facts of this case
are:</p>

<p class="BODY">Mariano K. Laurel died on <st1:date year="1921" day="26" month="3">March
 26, 1921</st1:date> and he was survived by his wife, <span class="SpellE">Celerina</span>
(@ Elena) A. <span class="SpellE">Nevado</span>, and four (4) legitimate
children, namely, <span class="SpellE">Procopio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span>,
Juana, and Angel, all surnamed Laurel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He left some personal and real properties, among which was a parcel of
land situated in <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
and registered in his name under Original Certificate of Title No. 22435 of the
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> and designated
therein as its Parcel No. 1, which is the property involved in the present
litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Shortly after said Mariano K. Laurel's death, intestate proceeding
of his estate was filed, on <st1:date year="1921" day="15" month="4">April 15,
 1921</st1:date>, in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
and the same was docketed therein as its Special Proceeding No. 876.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The above-mentioned property <span style="">(O.C.T. No. 22435 of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>)
was included in the inventory of the decedent's properties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On March 19, 1925, the court issued an order finding that the estate
had no sufficient cash assets to pay its outstanding debts, and authorizing <span class="SpellE">Procopio</span> N. Laurel, as judicial administrator, upon his
motion, to sell <u>a</u> <u>retro</u> the property covered by Original
Certificate of Title No. 22435; wherefore said administrator on March 21, 1925,
executed a <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u>de</u> <u>retro</u> sale
of the property in favor of the spouses, <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>
Galvan and Carmen Cabrera, for the sum of P23,000.00, subject to the right of
redemption within a period of seven (7) years from the date of execution
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1925" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1925</st1:date>, the probate court approved the
sale <u>a</u> <u>retro</u> made by the Administrator.</p>

<p class="BODY">After clearing the estate of its debts, the court ordered, on <st1:date year="1928" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1928</st1:date>, the adjudication of
all the remaining properties of said deceased Mariano K. Laurel in favor of his
above named children, subject to the right of usufruct of the widow, as
provided for under the Civil Code of 1889.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Among the properties adjudicated to the children was Parcel No. 1 of
O.C.T. No. 22435 and the same was cancelled and registered in the names of said
children under Transfer Certificate of Title No. 6957, and designated therein
as its Parcel No. 2.</p>

<p class="BODY">The estate or heirs of said Mariano K. Laurel failed to redeem
the property in question from the vendees <u>a</u> <u>retro</u> within the
seven (7) year-period stipulated in the <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u>de</u>
<u>retro</u> sale; hence, the <span class="SpellE">Galvans</span> consolidated
their ownership thereon and caused, in April, 1932, T.C.T. No. 6957 to be
cancelled and registered in their names under Transfer Certificate of Title No.
6958.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Galvans</span> and/or their
successors-in-interest have possessed the property in question openly,
continuously, adversely, in the concept of owners under color of title and in
good faith from 1925 up to the present time.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 16, 1954, plaintiffs, who are the successors-in-interest
(daughter and grandchildren) of deceased Mariano K. Laurel, filed their
original complaint, which was amended four (4) times, the last one being dated
December 10, 1958, to recover the above mentioned property (T.C.T. No. 6958)
from the defendants, claiming that the contract entered into by and between <span class="SpellE">Procopio</span> N. Laurel, as Judicial administrator, and the <span class="SpellE">Galvans</span> was not in reality a <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span>
<u>de</u> <u>retro</u> sale, but an equitable mortgage; that the <span class="SpellE">Galvans</span> began posses­sing said property since 1932 as mere
mortgage creditors; and that the <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u>de</u>
<u>retro</u> sale was illegally contracted and was null and void for not having
complied with the essential requisites laid down in Sections 714 and 722 of the
old Code of Civil Procedure (Act No. 190) which was the law then in force when
the proceedings were then had.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their amended answer to the re-amended complaint, defendants,
who are successors-in-interest of the <span class="SpellE">Galvans</span> (<span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> Galvan having died during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of this suit and Carmen Cabrera having died before the filing thereof),
specifically denied its material allegations, <span style="">set </span>up the defense of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> and
prescription and counterclaimed for moral damages in the total amount of
P205,000.00, plus attorney's fees in the sum of P5,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due hearing thereon, and on the basis of the above narrated
facts, the court <u>a</u><span style=""> <u>quo</u>, </span>despite
its finding and declaration that the <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u>de</u>
<u>retro</u> sale was null and void for non-compliance with the requirements of
Sections 714 and 722 of the old Code of Civil Procedure (Act No. 190), ruled,
however, that plaintiffs' action to recover the property in question has
already prescribed, since the present defendants, through themselves and their
predecessors-in-interest, the <span class="SpellE">Galvans</span>, have possessed
said property under claim of ownership, with just title and in good faith from
the year 1925 up to the filing of the suit in 1954; hence, the filing thereof
after 29 years had elapsed (1925 to 1954) is well beyond the prescriptive
period, as provided for in Sections 40 and 43 of the old Code of Civil
Procedure; and that defendants, being buyers in good faith, they acquired the
land by prescription, pursuant to Section 41 of the same Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said court ruled, however, that defendants
are not entitled to moral damages for insufficiency of evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both parties, not being satisfied with the decision, plaintiffs
prosecuted their appeal directly to this Court on points of law; while
defendants first moved to reconsider the portions of the decision declaring the
<span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u>de</u> <u>retro</u> sale null and
void, and refusing to award them moral damages, but when their motion was
denied, they like­wise appealed to this Court on factual issues, the total
amount (P205,000.00) involved in their claim for damages being within the
jurisdiction of this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no reversible error in the dismissal of the
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even granting that the order
of March 19, 1925, authorizing the sale was invalid in that it did not state
the amount of the debt of the deceased nor the value of his personal estate,
nor was a time and place for hearing and resolving the application previously
set, nor was due notice thereof ordered to be given to the persons interested
(although this is disputed by defendants), the unexplained interval of
twenty-nine (29) years that plaintiffs allowed to elapse (1925-1954) before
making any claim or instituting action constitutes <span class="SpellE"><u>laches</u></span>
that places them in <span class="SpellE"><u>estoppel</u></span> to question the
validity of the probate court's order and of the transactions executed in
pursuance thereof (Go Chi Gun vs. Go <span class="SpellE">Cho</span>, 96 Phil.
622; Lucas vs. <span class="SpellE">Gamponia</span>, 100 Phil. 277).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the strength of a court order, regular
on its face, Galvan and his wife purchased the property, openly and without
concealment, in 1925 for P23,000.00; consolidated their title in 1932, upon
expiration of the stipulated period of repurchase, and secured a certificate of
<span style="">title in their name, holding the
property as owners uninterruptedly since 1925.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now that the value of these properties has undoubtedly increased, it
would be manifestly inequitable to permit plaintiffs-appellants to overturn the
entire transaction when they never lodged any protest nor have given any sign
of a desire to do so for almost three decades.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs-appellants cite American authorities to the effect
that the defense of <span class="SpellE"><u>estoppel</u></span> <u>by</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>laches</u></span><u> </u>requires inaction for a period
comparable or equivalent to the statutory limitation applicable to their action
for recovery (Brief, pp. 30-32).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
the precise situation before us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
statute of limitations in force in 1925 (when the Court order was issued and
the property was sold) was the bid Code of Civil Procedure, Act 190; and the <u>maximum</u>
period for bringing actions under it was no more than ten (10) years (Act 190, <span class="SpellE">secs</span>. 40-43).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs'
inaction thus lasted almost <u>three</u> <u>times</u> as long as the maximum
period of prescription under <span style="">the
applicable law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even </span>if we were to
count the prescriptive period from 1932 when the <span class="SpellE">Galvans</span>
consolidated their title <span style="">and obtained a
certificate in their name, plaintiffs would </span>still be in <span class="SpellE"><u>laches</u></span> for twenty-two (22) years, <u>more than twice</u>
as long as the <span style="">prescriptive period
properly applicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their demand is ob­viously
a stale one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is argued that the <span class="SpellE">Galvans</span> must have
completed the thirty (30) year-period of extraordinary prescription under the
new Civil Code, since their contract is null and void, and hence they lack just
title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The glaring error in this
pretense lies in assuming that the Civil Code <span style="">of </span>the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> could retroactively apply </span>to this
case, although the cause of action arose in 1925, long before the Code was
enacted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a thesis is negated by the
Civil Code itself in its article 1116,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"ART.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1116.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prescription already running before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of this Code shall be governed by laws previously
in force; but if since the time this Code took effect the entire period herein
required for prescription should <span style="">elapse,
</span>the present Code shall be applicable, even though by the former laws a
longer period might be required."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, must rule that plaintiffs' action is now barred <span style="">and </span>the present appeal devoid of
merit, it being unnecessary to discuss the other arguments advanced.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span><span style="">now </span>come to the appeal of the
defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants con­tend that the
lower court erred in not awarding them moral damages for <span style="">the sum (P205,000.00) alleged in their
counterclaim against plaintiffs, considering that plaintiffs imputed bad faith
against them, thereby </span>causing <span style="">them
serious embarrassment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon careful review of the records of the case, we find no grave
abuse of discretion in the trial court's refusal to award moral damages to
defendants, since not only was the amount not proved, but the complaint was
apparently based on an honest mistake in the appreciation or interpretation of
the applicable law and jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
has already been held that, as a general rule, it is not sound public policy to
place a penalty on the right to litigate (Estate of <span class="SpellE">Buan</span>
<span style="">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Camaganacan</span>,
G. R. No. L-21560, <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="2">Feb. 28, 1966</st1:date>,
citing Tan Ti vs. <span class="SpellE">Alveor</span>, 26 Phil. 268), and there
are no circumstances in this case to justify an exception.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS</b>, the appealed decision is hereby
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
