against petitioner-appellant <span class="SpellE">Hatib</span> <span class="SpellE">Abbain</span> with the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Bongao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pertinent are <span class="SpellE">Tongham</span>

Chua, on January 16, 1952 and from that date up to the present time he has
"assumed ownership's thereof, taken "possession of the land and paid

Justice of the Peace Mariano <span class="SpellE">Managula</span> rendered
judgment directing <span class="SpellE">Hatib</span> <span class="SpellE">Abbain</span>
to vacate the premises and place <span class="SpellE">Tongham</span> Chua in
possession of the plantation, with costs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This judgment was predicated upon the findings, after trial, that
sometime before World War II, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Hatib</span> <span class="SpellE">Abbain</span>, because of financial hardship, sold for P225.00 to <span class="SpellE">Subing</span> Chua the coconut plantation, subject matter of the
suit; that after the sale, <span class="SpellE">Hatib</span> <span class="SpellE">Abbain</span>
became the tenant of <span class="SpellE">Subing</span> Chua, the harvests of the
land divided on a 50-50 basis; that subsequently, on January 16, 1952, <span class="SpellE">Subing</span> Chua donated the plantation to his son, <span class="SpellE">Tongham</span> Chua, and <span class="SpellE">Hatib</span> <span class="SpellE">Abbain</span>, the same tenant of the father, continued to be the
tenant on the land; that the tenancy relation­ship was at the beginning
harmonious and cordial, but that during the month of December, 1957, the
tenant, <span class="SpellE">Hatib</span> <span class="SpellE">Abbain</span>,
"got ambitious, and wanted to assume ownership of the plantation; that the
said tenant desisted to give the share of his landlord of the harvests, hence,
the plaintiff [respondent <span class="SpellE">Tongham</span> Chua] filed the
present case on March 12, 1958."</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:date year="1959" day="30" month="6"><u>June</u> <u>30</u>, <u>1959</u></st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Hatib</span> <span class="SpellE">Abbain</span> filed the present petition in the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> against respondent <span class="SpellE">Tongham</span>
Chua and Judge Mariano <span class="SpellE">Managula</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The verified petition, with an affidavit of
merits, sought "relief from judgment of the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Bongao</span> and/or annulment of its decision in Civil Case No.
21 with preliminary injunction."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner there averred that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the
Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Bongao</span> did not have
jurisdiction over said Civil Case 21 which is within the exclusive original
jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations; and (2) because of
"fraud, mistake or excusable negligence," he was deprived of a
hearing in said Civil Case 21, and prevented from taking an appeal from the
decision therein rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Tongham</span> Chua traversed the averments of the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="10"><u>October</u> <u>30</u>,
 <u>1964</u></st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After trial,
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> issued the order
now the subject of appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court
struck down petitioner's prayer for relief upon the finding that there was no
fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence which deprived defendant
(petitioner) of a hearing because he was present at the trial and given
opportunity to prepare his defense; and that neither was there evidence that
defendant was prevented from taking an appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court, moreover, noted that the petition
for relief was filed more than four months after the oral promulgation of the
decision on <st1:date year="1959" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the jurisdictional issue, the court ruled that
"petitioner has not presented any proof or showing of landlord and tenant
relationship between the parties" to bring the case within the
jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations, and that upon the allegations
of the complaint in Civil Case No. 21, the case is "clearly one of <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition was thus dismissed without costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present is a direct appeal to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The three errors assigned in appellant's brief raise but one
issue:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. Appellant plants his case upon the provisions of Section 21 of
Republic Act 1199 (approved <st1:date year="1954" day="30" month="8">August 30,
 1954</st1:date>), known as the "Agricultural Tenancy Act of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>",
which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 21.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Ejectment</u></span>; <u>violation</u>; <u>jurisdiction</u>. -
All cases involving the dispossession of a tenant by the land­holder or by a
third party and/or the settlement and dis­position of disputes arising from the
relationship of land­holder and tenant, as well as the violation of any of the
provisions of this Act, shall be under the original and exclusive jurisdiction
of such court as may now or hereafter be authorized by law to take cognizance
of tenancy relations and disputes."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The statutory precept just quoted is supplemented by Section 7,
Republic Act 1267, creating the first Court of Agrarian Relations, effective <st1:date year="1955" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1955</st1:date>, as amended by Republic
Act 1409 which took effect on <st1:date year="1955" day="9" month="9">September
 9, 1955</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Section 7
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Jurisdiction</u>
<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Court</u>. - The Court shall have original and
exclusive jurisdiction over the entire Philippines, to consider, investigate,
decide, and settle all questions, matters, controversies or disputes involving
all those relationships established by law which determine the varying rights
of persons in the cultivation and use of agricultural land where one of the
parties works the land:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As heretofore adverted to, <span class="SpellE">Tongham</span> Chua's
complaint was filed on <st1:date year="1958" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1958</st1:date>
- long after Republic Acts 1199, 1267 and 1409 were incorporated in our statute
books.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well to remember then is that <span class="SpellE">Tongham</span> Chua's complaint positively avers that <span class="SpellE">Hatib</span> <span class="SpellE">Abbain</span> is his tenant on a
50-50 sharing basis of the harvest; and that he seeks <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Hatib</span> <span class="SpellE">Abbain</span> "due
to his non-compliance of our agreement of [his] giving my share of the several
harvests he made."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Justice of
the Peace Court itself found, after hearing, that <span class="SpellE">Hatib</span>
<span class="SpellE">Abbain</span> con­tinued to be the tenant of <span class="SpellE">Tongham</span> Chua after the latter became, on <st1:date year="1952" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1952</st1:date>, owner of the
plantation which he acquired from his father by virtue of a donation; and that <span class="SpellE">Hatib</span> <span class="SpellE">Abbain</span> refused to give
"the share of his landlord of the harvest."</p>

<p class="BODY">If both the complaint and the inferior court's judgment have any
meaning at all, it is that the Justice of the Peace Court had no juris­diction
over the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Right at the outset, the
complaint should have been rejected.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Failing in this, the case should have been dismissed during the course
of the trial, when it became all the mere evident that a landlord-tenant
relationship existed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge had no
power to determine the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, <span class="SpellE">Tongham</span> Chua's suit comes within the coverage of the
statutory provision (Section 21, R.A. 1199) heretofore mentioned that [a]<span class="SpellE">ll</span> cases involving the dispossession of a tenant by the
landholder," shall be under the "<u>original</u> and <u>exclusive</u>
jurisdiction of such court as may now or hereafter be authorized by law to take
cognizance of tenancy relations and disputes" and the broad sweep of
Section 7, Republic Act 1267, which lodged wish the Court of Agrarian Relations
"<u>original</u> and <u>exclusive</u> jurisdiction x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> to consider, in­vestigate, decide, and settle all
questions, matters, controversies or disputes involving all those relationships
established by law which determine the varying rights of persons in the
cultivation and use of agricultural land where one of the parties works the
land."</p>

<p class="BODY">Jurisprudence has since stabilized the jurisdiction of the Court
of Agrarian Relations over cases of this nature.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Such exclusive authority is not divested by a mere averment on the part of the
tenant that he asserts ownership over the land, "since the law does not
exclude from the jurisdiction" of the Court of Agrarian Relations
"cases in which a tenant claims ownership over the land given to his for
cultivation by the landlord."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment and proceedings of the Justice of the Peace Court
are null and void.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. We take note of the observation of the Court of First instance
that the petition for relief from judgment must have to be ruled out because it
was filed beyond the 60-day period after appellant learned of the
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this is beside the point.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment of the Justice of the Peace Court is not merely a <span class="SpellE">voidable</span> judgment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is void on its face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be
attacked directly or collaterally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here,
the attack is direct.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner-appellant sought to annul the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even after the time for appeal or review had
elapsed, appellant could bring, as he brought, such an action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More, he also sought to enjoin enforcement of
that judgment.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
In varying language, this Court has expressed its reprobation for judgments
rendered by a court without jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such a judgment is held to be "'a dead limb on the judicial tree,
which should be lopped of or wholly disregarded as the circumstances
require."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
In the language of Mr. Justice Street:<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
"Where a judgment or judicial order is void in this sense it may be said
to be a lawless thing, which can be treated as an outlaw and slain at sight, or
ignored wherever and whenever it exhibits its head." And in <u>Gomez</u> <u>vs</u>.
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><u>Concepcion</u></span></st1:place></st1:city>,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court quoted with approval, the following from <u>Freeman</u> <u>on</u> <u>Judgments</u>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“A void judgment is in legal effect no
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By it no rights are
divested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From it no rights can he
obtained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being worthless in itself, all
proceedings founded upon it are equally worthless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It neither binds nor bars any one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All acts performed under it and all claims
flowing out of it are void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties
attempting to enforce it may be responsible as trespassers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purchaser as a sale by virtue of its
authority finds himself without title and without redress."</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the judgment here on its face is void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span>, the limited periods for relief from
judgment in Rule 38 are inapplicable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That judgment is vulnerable to attack "in any way and at any time,
even when no appeal has been taken."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the view we take of this case, the appealed order of <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1964</st1:date> is hereby reversed
and set aside; and the decision of the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Bongao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>, in Civil Case 21,
