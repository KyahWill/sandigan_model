				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE CORRECTION OF CERTAIN ENTRIES IN THE REGISTER OF BIRTHS OF OZAMIS CITY GUADALUPE UY SIOCO NACAGUE TAN AS NATURAL GUARDIAN OF LORETA, TERESITA, CORAZON, ALMA, ROSALINA AND VICTOR, ALL SURNAMED NACAGUE TAN, PETITIONERS AND APPELLEES, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>REGALA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an appeal by the Government directly from
    a decision of the Court of First Instance of Misamis
    Occidental, on questions of law.</p>
  <p>Appellees filed in the lower court a petition for
    the correction of certain entries in the civil register
    of Ozamiz City. Their petition alleged:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"1. That Guadalupe Uy Sioco Nacague Tan is
      the mother of the above-named petitioners, and
      she herself is a citizen of the Philippines as
      shown by the certificate of the Division of
      Archives at the City of Manila which is marked
      as Annex "A" hereof;</p>
    <p>"2. That petitioner Loreta Nacagui Tan was
      born to the above-named Guadalupe Uy Sioco Naca-
      gue Tan by her husband Cokoc (alias Tan Sin Guan)
      at Ozamiz City on March 20, 1947, but her name
      is mistakenly recorded as Loreta Tan Suat Ching,
and her mother is erroneously recorded as Guadalupe Ong, a Chinese Citizen;</p>
    <p>"3. That petitioner Teresita Nacagui Tan
        was born on Oct. 15, 1948 to the same spouses
        at Ozamiz City but her name is erroneously recorded as Teresita Tan Suta Tin, and her mother
        as Guadalupe Ong, a Chinese citizen;</p>
    <p>"4. That petitioner Corazon Nacagui Tan was
        born on Sept. 1, 1950 to the same spouses at
        Ozamiz City, but her name is erroneously recorded as Bi Ling Corazon Tan, and her mother as
        Guadalupe Uy, a Chinese citizen;</p>
    <p>"5. That petitioner Alma Nacague Tan was
        born on June 9, 1954 to the same spouses at
        Ozamiz City, but her mother is erroneously recorded as being a Chinese citizen;</p>
    <p>"6. That petitioner Rosalina Nacague Tan
        was born on October 13, 1956 to the same parents,
        but her mother is erroneously recorded as a citizen of China;</p>
    <p>"7. That petitioner Victor (Tan Giok Cheng)
        N. Tan was born on March 23, 1958 but her mother's
        citizenship is erroneously recorded as Chinese;</p>
    <p>"8.
That the errors in the records of birth of the above-named petitioners
will cause great inconvenience to them and will especially prejudice
them when they would already elect Philippine citizenship for which
they are qualified and which they contemplate on doing;</p>
    <p>"WHEREFORE, it is most respectfully prayed
        of this Honorable Court that the proper corrections be made on the records of births of the
        above-named petitioners in the Registry of Births
        Of the City of Ozamiz as above indicated."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Barely four days after the filing of the petition,
    without previous hearing and/or publication, the lower
    court, thru the then Justice of the Peace of Oroquieta
    Misamis Occidental, in the absence of the District Judge
    who was then on vacation, issued an order granting the
    petition and, accordingly ordered the civil registrar "to make the proper corrections as above indicated in the
    names of the petitioners (appellees herein) appearing in
    the Registry of Births of the said City and in the name
and citizenship of their mother, which should be Guadalupe
    Uy, a Filipino citizen."</p>
  <p>Upon
learning of this order, the city fiscal asked the court for a
reconsideration on the ground that appellees' petition was not
published and that article 412 of the Civil Code authorizes the
correction only of clerical errors, not errors involving substantial
matters, such as citizenship. Acting on the city fiscal's motion for
reconsideration, the said court, with now the District Judge presiding,
set aside the order. However, the court reversed itself again when the
appellees in turn asked for a reconsideration. In its modified order of
February 10, 1962, the court directed that the name of appellee
Guadalupe Uy Sioco Nacague Tan, which appears as "Guadalupe Ong" in the
birth records of appellees Loreta Tan Suat Ching and Teresita Tan Suat
Tin, be changed to "Guadalupe Uy " It is from this order that the
Solicitor General, in representation of the Government, appealed. His
position is that the change from
"Guadalupe Ong" to "Guadalupe Uy" cannot be made in a summary
proceeding under article 412 of the Civil Code because the alleged
error is not a mere clerical error.</p>
  <p>Article 412 of the Civil Code provides that "no entry
    in a civil register shall be changed or corrected, without
    a judicial order."</p>
  <p>Interpreting this provision, this Court held in the
    case of Ansaldo <em>vs</em>. Republic, 102 Phil., 1046:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"For the information of the parties concerned
        and for the guidance of the public in general, we
        may venture the opinion that the clerical errors
        which might be corrected through judicial sanction under Article 412 of the Civil Code, would
        be those harmless and innocuous changes, such as
        correction of a name that is clearly misspelled,
        occupation of the parents, etc. <em>but for changes
        involving the civil status of the parentst their
        nationality or citizenship, those are grave and
        important matters which may have a bearing and
        effect on the citizenship and nationality not only of said parents, but of the offsprings, and to
        seek said changes, it is necessary to file a proper
        suit wherein not only the State, but also all parties concerned and affected should be made parties
        defendants or respondents</em>, and evidence should be
        submitted, either to support the allegations of the
        petition or complaint, or also to disprove the
        same so that any order or decision in the case may
        be made with due process of law and on the basis
        of facts proven," (Italics supplied)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In the present case, no less than the lower court itself, in its first order, has observed that the mother of
    the petitioners was recorded as Guadalupe Ong, a Chinese
    citizen but that her name should be corrected to Guadalupe
    Uy, a citizen of the Philippines. This shows that in petitioning for the correction of the entries of their names,
    it is also the intention of petitioners to make it appear
    that their mother is not a Chinese but a Filipino. This
    correction cannot be allowed in a summary proceeding, following our ruling in the abovecited case of Ansaldo <em>vs</em>. Republic, <em>supra</em>, because it involves the citizenship of petitioner's mother, a grave and important matter, which will
    eventually have a bearing on the citizenship of her child-
    ren. To allow such a correction would set wide open the
    door to fraud or other mischief the consequences of which
    might be detrimental or far reaching, (Ty Kong Tin <em>vs</em>. Republic, 94 Phil. 321)</p>
  <p>In the most recent case on the subject, Consuelo Calicdan Baybayan <em>vs</em>. Republic, G. R. No. L-20717, March 18, 1966,
    where the correction sought concerns place of birth and
    citizenship, this Court, reiterating the ruling in the Ansaldo case, thru Mr. Justice J.B.L. Reyes, stated:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"* * * It has been the uniform jurisprudence
      of this Court since Ty Kong Tin <em>vs</em>. Republic
      (1954) 94 Phil. 321, that substantial alterations,
      such as those affecting the status and citizenship of a person in the Civil Registry records,
      can not be ordered by the court unless first
      threshed out in an 'appropriate action wherein
      <em>all</em> parties who may be affected by the entries
      are notified or represented' (see Rule 108 of
      the Revised Rules of Court), and that the summary proceedings under Article 412 of the Civil
      Code only justify an order to corrects innocuous
  or clerical errors such as misspellings and the
      like, errors that are visible to the eyes or
      obvious to the understanding (Black <em>vs</em>. Republic,
      L-10869, Nov. 28, 1958; Ansaldo <em>vs</em>. Republic,
      L-10226, Feb. 14, 1958; Tan Su <em>vs</em>. Republic, L-
      12140, April 29, 1959; Bentoto <em>vs</em>. Republic, L-14978, May 23, 1961; De Castro <em>vs</em>. Republic, L-
      17431, April 30, 1963; Lui Lin <em>vs</em>. Republic, L-
      18213, Dec. 24, 1963)."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It
follows that since the correction contemplated in this case does not
refer merely to clerical errors, a summary proceeding would not be
sufficient. Instead, petitioners should file a petition as that
provided for under Rule 108 of the Revised Rules of Court,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> section 4 of
    which requires notice and publication, as in change of
    names, as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Upon the filing of the petition, the court
        shall, by an order, fix the time and place for
        the hearing of the same, and cause reasonable
        notice thereof to be given to the persons named
        in the petition. The court shall also cause
        the order to be published once a week for three
        (3) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general
        circulation in the province."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Referring to a similar provision under Article 103 of
    the Revised Rules of Court, we have explained in Jesus Ng
    Yao Siong <em>vs</em>. Republic, G. R. No. L-20306, March 31, 1966,
    that "publication is notice to the whole world that the proceeding has for its object 'to bar indifferently all who
    night be minded to make an objection of any sort against
    the right sought to be established'."</p>
  <p>It being apparent from the foregoing that the order
    of the lower court is not in accordance with the rule
    applicable in the premises, the same is hereby reversed,
    and consequently the petition is dismissed. No costs.</p>
