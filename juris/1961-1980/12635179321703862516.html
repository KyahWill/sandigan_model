				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This present special civil action for certiorari, prohibition and
mandamus is directed against certain resolutions of the Court of Appeals in CA
- <span style="">G. R. No. </span>35867-R, <span style="">in connection with proceedings in the Court
of First Instance </span>of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> after judgment was
rendered in its Civil Case No. <span style="">7950.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That case, </span>instituted <span style="">by </span><span style="">the spouses </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Magin</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">and Lucy </span><span style="">Velez, now</span><span style=""> petitioners,
against <span class="SpellE">Uldarico</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacay</span>, now
one of the respondents, the Social Security System and the Home Financing </span><span style="">Com­mission, was
for </span><span style="">rescission
of a deed of absolute sale of a house and lot, with assumption of mortgage,
executed by the said spouses in favor of <span class="SpellE">Bacay</span> on
January 15, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The judgment,
rendered on <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1965</st1:date>,
declared the sale with assumption of mortgage resolved and rescinded and, among
other dispositions, ordered <span class="SpellE">Bacay</span> to make certain
money payments to the plaintiffs and to restore <span style="">to </span>them the possession of the property subject of the sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the <span style="">same
time the cross-claims of the </span><span style="">Social
</span>Security System and the Home <span style="">Financing
Commission </span><span style="">against their co-defendant <span class="SpellE">Bacay</span> were
dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bacay</span></span><span style=""> </span>received a copy of the decision on <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="3">March 2, <span style="">1965</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the following March 31 he filed a notice of appeal and a record on appeal,
consideration </span>of which was, upon his request, set for April 15,
1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1965</st1:date>, however, upon motion of the <span style="">plaintiffs the Court of First Instance </span><span style="">disapproved </span><span style="">the record </span><span style="">on </span><span style="">appeal on </span>the ground that the appeal bond, which had been filed
only on <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1965</st1:date>, was
out of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bacay</span>
moved to reconsider but was turned down; and on <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1965</st1:date>, upon motion of the plaintiffs the <span style="">court </span>ordered execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The corresponding writ was issued on <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1965</st1:date>; <span class="SpellE">Bacay</span>
moved on the same date that it be quashed; and the plain­tiffs in turn moved
that <span class="SpellE">Bacay</span> be declared in contempt of court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 4, 1965 both motions were resolved: <span style="">the </span><span style="">motion to quash </span><span style="">was denied and </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bacay</span></span><span style=""> was </span><span style="">ordered </span><span style="">"to vacate </span>the house and lot in question... and deliver the
possession of the same to the plaintiffs through the intervention of the
Sheriff within a period of five days from today, under pain of contempt of
court and arrest and confinement in jail until he complies."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1965</st1:date>
<span class="SpellE">Bacay</span> filed <span style="">a </span>notice of appeal, to the Court of Appeals
from the aforesaid order of June 4, and asked the trial court to fix <span style="">a </span>bond for
the stay of its execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime - on <st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="6">June
 1, 1965</st1:date> - <span class="SpellE">Bacay</span> filed a petition for
relief from the order of May 12 denying his appeal from the decision of <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on June 8 he filed a special civil action
for certiorari and prohibition in the Court of Appeals against the Velez
spouses, the presiding Judge of the trial court (Hon. Modesto R. <span class="SpellE">Ramolete</span>) and the sheriff of the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, praying that the order of June 4, 1965 be set aside;
that execution of the judgment be stayed; that the respondents be enjoined not
to disturb the petitioner's possession of the party in question; <span style="">and that the trial court be ordered to act on
the petition for relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It
appears, however, that this petition for relief was denied in an order dated <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1965</st1:date>, although <span class="SpellE">Bacay</span> had not yet been notified of the denial when he went <span style="">on certiorari and prohibition to the Court of
Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="9" month="6">June 9, 1965</st1:date>
the sheriff of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city>
implemented the writ of execution and delivered the pro­perty to the Velez
spouses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was at <st1:time minute="45" hour="13">1:45</st1:time> in the afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile <span class="SpellE">Bacay's</span>
petition for certiorari and prohibition had been given due course in the Court
of Appeals; and pursuant to the prayer for preliminary injunction therein the
said Court issued the writ <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span><u>,</u>
also on June 9, 1965, of which Judge <span class="SpellE">Ramolete</span> was
notified at 9:10 and the sheriff at 9:30, both in the evening of <span style="">the </span>same day.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff-spouses offered to post a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>
to lift the writ of preliminary injunction, but the same was denied on <st1:date year="1965" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On June <span style="">23,
</span>the Court of Appeals issued another order, directing the provincial
sheriff, herein respondent Vicente Miranda, to "maintain petitioner's
possession of the premises, ousting respondents <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,"
and requiring the City sheriff as well as the Velez spouses to show cause why
they should not be cited for contempt of court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The provincial sheriff filed his return of service on <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1965</st1:date>, informing the Court of
Appeals that the writ of preliminary injunction could not be enforced because
the respondent spouses refused to vacate the pre­mises and had all the doors of
the <span style="">house locked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Velez spouses filed
their answer, dated July </span>1, 1965, to the petition for certiorari, and
prohibition, denying the substantial averments therein and pleading <span style="">by way of defense that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Bacay</span> had not exhausted</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">his remedies in the
trial court since he had not yet received the order denying his petition for
relief when he filed his petition before the Court of Appeals, and that in fact
he filed a motion for reconsideration of</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the said order on June
18, 1965.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">One of the members of the
division in the Court </span>of Appeals which acted on the petition for
certiorari and prohibition was Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> S.
<span class="SpellE">Piccio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1965</st1:date> the Velez spouses filed a
motion that he disqualify himself from taking part in the consideration of the
case on the ground, supported by an affidavit of <span class="SpellE">Magin</span>
Velez, that he had allegedly granted private interviews with <span class="SpellE">Bacay's</span> wife before the order of June 23 was issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">records before us do not show that this motion has
been expressly resolved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1965</st1:date>
the Court of Appeals issued an order for the arrest of <span class="SpellE">Magin</span>
and Lucy Velez and their confinement in the provincial jail of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> until they re­linquished the possession
of the disputed property to <span class="SpellE">Bacay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order was carried out and the parties
were accordingly incarcerated.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1965</st1:date>
Velez spouses filed in this Court the present petition for certiorari,
prohibition and mandamus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On July 20
this Court issued a restraining order to stop implementation of the resolution
of the orders of the Court of Appeals of June 23 and July 14; and on July 22,
this Court issued another resolution for the release of the petitioners upon a
bond of P1, 000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Three
issues are raised in the petition before us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1. The petitioners' first point <span style="">is </span>that the Court of Appeals acted
without or in excess of jurisdiction in giving due course to <span class="SpellE">Bacay's</span> petition for certiorari and prohibition before
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of this averment the
petitioners invoke the finality of the decision of the Court of First Instance
and hence the propriety of the order of execution issued by it; claim that <span class="SpellE">Bacay</span> still <span style="">had adequate remedies at </span><span style="">law available </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">him, namely, </span><span style="">stay </span><span style="">such execution upon bond under Section 2 of Rule 39 </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">well as appeal from
the order of the trial court denying his petition for relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These questions, however, are precisely the
questions which should be litigated and resolved in the Court of Appeals in
connection with the petition before it, and which in fact had been raised by
the herein petitioners in their </span><span style="">answer </span><span style="">thereto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There can be no doubt that the petition was properly lodged in the said
court, the writ prayed for therein being in aid of its appellate
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot preempt its
authority and function by considering, in the present special civil action, the
issues that it should pass upon and decide in the first instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To say that the Court of Appeals abused its
discretion in giving due course to the petition because the decision of the
trial court had become final, or that the petitioner therein had other adequate
remedies at law, is to beg the very questions at issue before it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We therefore refrain from ruling one way or
the other on these questions despite the rather exhaustive discussion thereof
indulged in by the parties.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2. The next issue refers to the petitioners' motion in the Court of
<span style="">Appeals to disqualify </span>Justice <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Piccio</span> and his failure
to resolve the said motion before taking further <span style="">action in the </span>case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
should be noted, however, that when Justice <span class="SpellE">Piccio</span>
did take such <span style="">action, </span>as in the
issuance of the order of arrest of herein petitioners, the motion for disqualification
was impliedly denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It any <span style="">event </span>it <span style="">cannot </span>be said that the action was an absolute nullity, because
the reason adduced to <span style="">disqualify him,
which is nothing but </span>an indirect imputation of partiality or bias, is
not one of the grounds enumerated in the first paragraph of Section 1 of Rule
137 concerning disqualification of judges.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Other than upon those grounds a judge cannot be disqualified by <span style="">a litigant.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Insofar as further proceedings in
the Court of Appeals are concerned the issue of disquali­fication has become
moot, since death has long since re­moved Justice <span class="SpellE">Piccio</span>
from membership in the appellate court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. The petitioners' last plea is against the resolution of the
Court of Appeals finding them guilty of contempt for disobeying the writ of
preliminary injunction and the order of <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="6">June
 23, 1965</st1:date> for their dispossession.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On this point we believe that the petitioners are entitled to the relief
prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writ was prohibitory in
nature, the purpose of which was to stop enforcement of the writ of execution
issued by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the
injunction was served, however, the execution had already been implemented and
the petitioners herein placed by the city sheriff in actual possession of the
property in dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was nothing
more to enjoin or prohibit;<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and no mandatory injunction was asked for or issued subsequently to revert the
parties to their former position <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> said
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <span style="">with respect to the order of </span><st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="6"><span style="">June 23, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, it was addressed not to the herein
petitioners but to the provincial sheriff, herein respondent Vicente
Miranda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances we are
not prepared to say that the act of said petitioners in remaining in possession
of the property, where they had been placed by virtue of the writ of execution
issued by the trial court, constituted contempt of the Court of Appeals.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b> the writ prayed for is denied, except with
respect to the order of contempt dated <st1:date year="1965" day="14" month="7">July
 14, 1965</st1:date>, which is hereby set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
