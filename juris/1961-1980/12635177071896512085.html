				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Primarily </span>upon the
averment of the Government Corporate Counsel that plaintiff Santiago Virginia
Tobacco Planters Associ­ation, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as SVTPA) had
failed to present sufficient evidence to prove deliveries of seven (7)
shipments of tobacco to defendant Farmers' Virginia Tobacco <span class="SpellE">Redriers</span>,
Inc. (FVTR) which, it is claimed, had purchased the tobacco for the other
defendant Philippine Virginia Tobacco Administration (PVTA, for short), a
government corporation, and that on the contrary, such shipments, upon which
plaintiff's cause of action was pre­dicated, were fictitious, PVTA came to this
Court on appeal to reverse the lower court's judgment sentencing defendants
PVTA and FVTR, jointly and severally, to pay plaintiff the following amounts:
(a) P227,342.31, representing the value of said seven shipments of tobacco; (b)
<span style="">P30, 000, </span>as loss of profits;
(c) <span style="">P10, 000 </span>in attorneys' fees;
and (d) the costs of the suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant FVTR, for its part, steadfastly clings to its averment
in its answer that all the seven shipments were actually received; and that its
liability was that of agent of PVTA. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">FVTR's</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">brief assails the judgment below from </span>two
directions: <u>first</u>, th<span style="">a</span>t <span style="">although it actually received the seven
shipments, it did so merely as such agent of PVTA; and <u>second</u>, that if
this Court should declare that no shipment was actually received, then no
liability at all attaches to said defendant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

marketing facilities in suitable centers and supervise the <span style="">sell­</span>ing and buying of Virginia
tobacco so that the farmers will enjoy reasonable prices that secure a fair

</span>Amongst the specific powers allocated <span style="">to </span>PVTA under Section 4(a) of the charter is "[t]o take over

<p class="BODY">The evidence of plaintiff consists mainly of documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These documents may be classified according
to the stages in the trading process: (a) shipping documents; (b) checklists;
and (c) tally sheet summaries.</p>

<p class="BODY">The shipping documents are: (1) Application for inspection of
leaf tobacco, accomplished by the SVTPA manager requesting BIR to inspect the
tobacco due for delivery to the <span class="SpellE">redriers</span>; (2) The
Commercial Waybill, indicating the scheduled date of delivery of the tobacco
shipment; (3) Request for tobacco clearance, which is a form accomplished by
the SVTPA manager requesting PVTA that the delivery be made to FVTR (it is
significant to note here that as for <span class="SpellE">guias</span> 28 and 29,
the shipments were authorized for delivery <u>not</u> <u>to</u> <u>defendant</u>
<u>FVTR</u> but to other <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> plants, the <span class="SpellE">Fil</span>-Am Tobacco Corporation and the Central Cooperative Ex­change);<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
(4) Pre-sales invoice (offer to sell), accomplished by the SVTPA officers
indicating the description as to weight and grade of each bale of tobacco, and
that the same had been already <span style="">inspected
by the PVTA tobacco field inspector; (5) Progressive stock and shipment control
form of SVTPA enumerating therein the tobacco acquisitions and sales withdrawal
of said company for a certain period <span style="">of
time; (6) Abstract </span>of daily purchases, which is a list of the names of
the planters from whom the <span style="">tobacco
were<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>supposedly <span style="">purchased; </span>and (7) Ten-day report of <span style="">Virginia tobacco </span>purchases, which is
merely a ten-day <span style="">summary </span>report
of <span style="">the entries in </span>the abstract
of daily purchases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The checklists, on the </span>other
hand, are accomplished at FVTR as soon as the shipping documents mentioned
above are delivered for processing and they merely indicate that the ship­ping
documents are complete and in order.</p>

<p class="BODY">The third set of documents presented by SVTPA <span style="">was </span>the tally sheet summary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was prepared by FVTR based on the
primary tally sheets prepared <span style="">at the </span>FVTR
<span style="">ramps after the sup­</span>posed
delivery, weighing, grading and acceptance of the tobacco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These tally sheet summaries, Exhibits RRR <span style="">to XXX, were </span>signed<span style=""> only by the FVTR checker, processor/
computer and accountant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No official of
PVTA certified as to the correctness of these tally sheet summaries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Is there then sufficient evidence of delivery? The import­ance of
the aforementioned documents in relation <span style="">to the fact in </span>issue can be gathered from the trading process
between SVTPA and FVTR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This process was
reconstructed by the plaintiff's wit­nesses as well as the officials of
PVTA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The outline of the manner of
trading is as follows: SVTPA would purchase tobacco from planters who are
mostly members of said association.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Payment to these farmers would be held up until SVTPA could deliver the
tobacco to, and was paid by, FVTR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
the tobacco <span style="">is ready </span>to be sold
to PVTA through FVTR, SVTPA would file an application for inspection of leaf
tobacco with the Bureau of Internal Revenue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After which SVTPA would request for another inspection with the PVTA
field inspector.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is followed by
another inspection by the provincial tobacco agent for clearance to
deliver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the shipping documents and
inspection papers enumerated above are ready, the tobacco is loaded in trucks
and sent to the <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> plant of FVTR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, the SVTPA representative would present
the shipping documents mentioned above at the FVTR office for processing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A checklist is prepared for each set of
documents for the corresponding <span class="SpellE"><u>guia</u></span> to
determine whether they are in order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the meanwhile, the tobacco is unloaded and made ready for weighing and grading.</p>

<p class="BODY">The delivered tobacco undergoes another procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each bale is graded, weighed and accepted for
deposit at the FVTR ramps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As each bale
is graded and weighed, the actual grade and weight are noted down, in long
hand, in the <span class="SpellE">weighers</span>' tally sheets which are
accomplished in quadruplicate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These <span class="SpellE">weighers</span>' tally sheets are signed and certified correct by
FVTR and PVTA officials or em­ployees who made the actual weighing and
grading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon acceptance of the tobacco
for deposit at the FVTR warehouse, the warehouse receipt or <span class="SpellE">quedan</span>
<span style="">is duly </span>accomplished and issued
to the shipper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, FVTR
prepares in typewritten form the tally sheet summary in its office on the basis
of the copy of the <span class="SpellE">weighers</span>' tally sheet issued to
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the time to collect comes, it
is the official tally sheet that is usually presented to PVTA and made the
basis for the payment of the tobacco shipment.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
The PVTA head of the Trading Department, <span class="SpellE">Quirico</span> T. <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span>, testified that the presentation of the ramp tally
sheets was required after PVTA officials learned of irregularities in trading.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It can be seen, therefore, that the shipping documents and the
checklists are all accomplished prior to delivery of the tobacco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These documents are inconclusive in proving

susceptible of proving the fact in issue, which is delivery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are the ramp or <span class="SpellE">weighers</span>'
tally sheets aforesaid and the warehouse receipts or <span class="SpellE">quedans</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">These
tally sheets, it needs to </span>be emphasized, are signed and certified

or <span class="SpellE">quedan</span> <span style="">is
issued to </span>SVTPA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The actual
presence of the tobacco delivered and accepted at <span class="SpellE">FVTR's</span>
ramps and deposited at the FVTR warehouse was not checked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, because of the permission granted <span style="">to all </span>trading entities to mix their
tobacco with those of other <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> plants.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Which rendered
identification impossible.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Actual
physical examination would not produce any result.</p>

<p class="BODY">The best evidence available, therefore, is that which relates
directly or has a direct connection with the delivery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And these are the documents prepared at the moment
of delivery and which affirm the presence of the tobacco delivered at the FVTR
warehouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Kneedler</u></span>

checks were held to be the primary or the best evidence to prove the fact of
payment and must be produced or its non-production convincingly explained.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the importance of the <span class="SpellE">quedans</span> and
the <span class="SpellE">weighers</span>' tally sheets is not limited to their
probative value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These <span class="SpellE">quedans</span> and tally sheets are the very same documents agreed
upon between FVTR and SVTPA as amongst those to be produced and presented and
surrendered before PVTA may make direct payments to trading entities.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The failure of FVTR and SVTPA to produce

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">And more.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>These tally sheets and <span class="SpellE">quedans</span>
were intended to safeguard the interest of the government against unlawful
disbursements of funds for purchases which were never <span class="GramE">effected</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>SVTPA and FVTR should have known that the
fate of their case hinges on these two documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said documents were also for their own <span style="">protection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And yet, neither </span>could produce <span style="">them, even </span>as FVTR in the course of <span style="">the pre-trial promised to present one </span><span style="">of them, the <span class="SpellE">quedans</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">FVTR in </span><span style="">fact admitted that

<p class="BODY">Finding that direct and sufficient <span style="">evidence by </span>plaintiff is wanting, the claim cannot prosper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff failed to discharge its burden.</p>

<p class="BODY">4. But the claim of delivery is not alone contradicted by the
absence of the ramp tally <span style="">sheets </span>and
the <span class="SpellE">quedans</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Other proofs there are to counter plaintiff's unsatisfactory <span style="">evidence that </span>there were indeed
shipments and that delivery was actually made.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><u>First</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not one of the witnesses presented and
offered by SVTPA as rebuttal could categorically state that the tobacco in
question was actually delivered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
witness could only state that sometime in 1963 he saw trucks belonging <span style="">to </span>SVTPA <span style="">inside </span>the FVTR compound loaded with tobacco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another also testified that he saw tobacco
belonging to SVTPA being graded at the FVTR ramps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But then, the disputed shipments were not the
only ship­ments of SVTPA. There were other shipments of SVTPA in 1963 which
were already paid by PVTA such as shipments represented by <span class="SpellE">guia</span>
32 and <span class="SpellE">guia</span> 33 for which checks had been issued by
PVTA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is need therefore to
identify which particular shipment was seen by the witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">The witnesses were unable to give a particular descrip­tion of
the tobacco or the shipments they saw.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their <span style="">testimony </span>therefore
cannot be given much weight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For even if
one were to believe that SVTPA indeed delivered tobacco under <span class="SpellE">guias</span> 32 and 33, it does not give rise to the implication
that similar commodities upon <span class="SpellE">guias</span> 28, 29, 31, 34,
35, 36 and 37 were also delivered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For,
it is an evidentiary rule that "[e]<span class="SpellE">vidence</span> that
one did or omitted to do a certain thing at one time <span style="">is </span>not admissible to prove that he did or omitted to do the same
or a similar thing at another time."<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Second.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>PVTA

of a number of the planters - forty of them - from whom the alleged tobacco was
purchased <span style="">by </span>SVTPA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their statements, the planters denied
having supplied <span style="">to </span>SVTPA tobacco

disturb the conclusion we have reached.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence coming from an overwhelming majority of the supposed
suppliers of SVTPA did serve to cut off whatever connecting thread there
remains in plaintiff's evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For,
these alleged suppliers, too, are "ghost" suppliers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, to think of the fact that if it were
really true that they supplied tobacco to SVTPA - which in turn was allegedly
delivered to FVTR - each of these farmers stands to lose a considerable amount
of money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had they been worshippers of
the Golden Calf, self-interest could have benumbed their souls with icy <span style="">hands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They could have said that </span><span style="">they
</span><span style="">did supply the tobacco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And who would be able to check their
