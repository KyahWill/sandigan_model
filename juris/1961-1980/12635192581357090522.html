<p>An information for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> thru falsification of a 
commercial document—a Philippine National Bank check for P4<span class="GramE">,608.62</span>—was filed on <st1:date month="12" day="29" year="1961">December 29, 1961</st1:date> against Jose Ignacio y Santos.</p>
<p>When arraigned on <st1:date month="8" day="31" year="1962">August 31, 
1962</st1:date>, Jose Ignacio y Santos pleaded guilty. Thereupon the Court of 
First Instance of Manila sentenced him "to suffer one (1) year, eight (8) months 
and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span> as minimum, to four (4) years, nine (9) months 
and eleven (11) days of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span>, as maximum; to indemnify the Philippine 
National Bank in the sum of P4.608.62; and to pay a line in the sum of 
13,000.00, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency of both indemnity 
and fine, and the costs of the proceedings."</p>
<p>Not satisfied with the penalty imposed, the accused a motion for 
reconsideration, but it was denied. Thereafter he appealed to the Court of 
Appeals. By resolution of <st1:date month="7" day="25" year="1968">July 25, 
1968</st1:date>, the Court of Appeals has certified the case to this Court 
because "the only question for determination is one of law".</p>
<p>Appellant, as stated, pleaded guilty to the complex crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> thru falsification of a commercial document. The 
penalty for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> where the amount involved is 
P4.608.62 is <span class="SpellE">arresto</span> mayor in its maximum period to 
<span class="SpellE">prision</span> correctional in its minimum period (Art. 315, 
par. 1, No. 3, Revised Penal Code). The penalty for falsification of a 
commercial document is <span class="SpellE"><em>prision</em></span> 
<em>correctional</em> in its medium and maximum periods and a fine of not more 
than 5,000 pesos (Art. 172, par. 1, Revised Penal Code). So, for the complex 
crime afore-stated, the penalty is that provided for falsification of a 
commercial document, the same to be applied in its maximum period (Art. 48, 
Revised Penal Code).</p>
<p>Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum of the indeterminate 
sentence should be "within the range of the penalty next lower to that 
prescribed by the code for the offense (Sec. 1, Act No. 4103 as amended by Act 
No. 4225). In People vs. <span class="SpellE">Mape</span>, 77 Phil. 809, 811, we 
said: "For purposes of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the penalty next lower 
should be determined without regard as to whether the basic penalty provided by 
the Code should be applied in its maximum or minimum period as the circumstances 
modifying liability may require (People vs. Gonzalez, 73 Phil. 549)."</p>
<p>The basic penalty that the Code provides in this case is, as aforesaid, <span class="SpellE">prision</span> correctional in its medium and <span class="GramE">Maximum</span> periods. The penalty next lower to it, therefore, is 
<span class="SpellE"><em>arresto</em></span><em> mayor</em> in its maximum period 
to <span class="SpellE"><em>prision</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>correccional</em></span> in its minimum period; which is four 
(4) Months and one (1) day to two (2) years and four (4) months.</p>
<p>Thus, the minimum of the sentence imposed by the court a quo, that is, one 
(1) year, eight (8) months and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><em>prision</em></span> <em>correctional</em>, is within the range 
prescribed by the Indeterminate Sentence Law. In the absence of abuse, and 
appellant has not shown any, the discretion of the court a quo to fix the 
minimum term of the indeterminate sentence anywhere within the range provided by 
law, will not be interfered with (People vs. De <span class="SpellE">Joya</span>, 
98 Phil., 238; 52 Off. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gaz</span></span><span class="GramE">., 788).</span></p>
<p>Since appellant admits that the maximum term of his sentence is correct, 
there is no need to state the reasons why it is so. We may, however, mention 
that in fixing the maximum term of the sentence, the court a quo rightly 
considered in appellant's favor the simple mitigating circumstance of plea of 
guilty. Appellant's error lies in contending that, contrary to what has been 
held in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Mape</span>, supra, the mitigating 
circumstance should also be considered in determining the minimum of his 
indeterminate sentence.</p>
<p>As to the fine of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, the same is obviously 
in order. Article 172, paragraph 1, of the Revised Penal Code provides, in 
addition to imprisonment, "a fine of not more than P5<span class="GramE">,000</span> pesos".</p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs. 
</p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>SO ORDERED</b>.</span></p>
