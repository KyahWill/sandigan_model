<p class="BODY"><span style="">Actually, there were four

<p class="BODY">No new <span style="">issues are raised
in this separate appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following
facts found by the court </span><u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> <u>quo</u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">in its joint decision
are undisputed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>“</span>x x x during the five crop years
mentioned in the <span style="">law, </span>namely,
1951-1952, 1952-1953, 1953-1954, 1954-1955- and 1955-1956, defendant
Bacolod-Murcia Milling Co., Inc., has paid P267,468.00 but left an unpaid
balance of P216,070.50; defendant Ma-ao Sugar Central Co., Inc., has paid
P177,613.44 but left an unpaid balance of P235,800.20; defendant <span style="">Talisay-Silay </span>Milling Company has
paid P251,812.43 but left an unpaid balance of P208,193.74; and defendant
Central Azucarera del Danao made <span style="">a </span>payment
of P48,879.73 but left an unpaid balance of P48,059.77.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question regarding the
correctness of the amounts paid and the amounts that remain unpaid.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"From the evidence presented, on which there is no
controversy, it was disclosed that on Septem­ber 3, 1951, the Philippine Sugar
Institute, known as the PHILSUGIN for short, acquired the Insular Sugar
Refinery for a total consideration of P3,070,909.60 payable, in accordance with
the deed of sale Exhibit A, in 5 installments from the proceeds of the sugar
tax to be collected under Republic Act 632.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The evidence further discloses that the operation of the Insular Sugar
Refinery for the <span style="">years </span>1954,
1955, 1956 and 1957 was disastrous in the sense that PHIL­SUGIN incurred
tremendous losses <span style="">as </span>shown by
an exami­nation of the statements of income and expenses marked Exhibits 5, 6,
7 and 8. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Through the testimony of Mr.
Cenon Flor Cruz, former acting general manager of PHILSUGIN and at present
technical consultant of said entity, presented by the defendants <span style="">as witness, </span>it <span style="">has </span>been shown that the operation of
the Insular Re­finery has consumed 70% of the thinking time and effort of the
PHILSUGIN management.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x x x."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The sole issue before Us
now is the same as that in the other three </span>cases <span style="">already decided, </span>which is:</p>

<blockquote>"Contending that the purchase of the Insular Sugar Refinery
with money from the Philsugin Fund was not authorized by Rep. Act 632 and that
the con­tinued operation of the said refinery was inimical to their interests,
the appellants refused to con­tinue with their contributions to the said
fund.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They maintained that their
obligation to contribute or pay to the said Fund subsists only to the limit and
extent that they are benefited by such contribu­tions<span style=""> since Rep. Act </span>632 is not a revenue measure <span style="">but an Act which establishes a 'special
assessment.' Adverting to the finding of the lower court that pro­ceeds of the
said Fund had been used or applied to absorb the "tremendous losses"
incurred by </span>Philsugin in its <span style="">"disastrous
operation" of the said refinery, the appellants herein argue that they
should not only </span><span style="">be </span><span style="">released </span><span style="">from their obligation to pay the said
assessment but be refunded, besides, of all that they might have previously </span>paid
thereunder.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The appellants' thesis is simply to the effect that the '10
centavos per picul of sugar' authorized to be collected under Sec. 15 of
Republic Act 632 <span style="">is </span><span style="">a </span>special
assessment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">As </span>such, the proceeds thereof may be
devoted only to the specific purpose for which the assessment was authorized, a
special assessment being a levy upon property predicated on the doctrine that
the property against which it is levied derives some special benefit from the
improvement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is </span>not a tax measure intended to raise
revenues for the Government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, once it has been determined that no benefit accrues or
inures to the property owners paying the assessment, or that the proceeds from
the said assessment are being misapplied to the prejudice of those against whom
it has been levied, then the authority to insist on the payment of the said
assessment ceases."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Accordingly, We
reiterate:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The nature of a 'special assessment' similar to the case at
bar <span style="">has </span>already been discussed
and explained by this Court in the case of Lutz v. Araneta, 98 Phil. 148.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For in this Lutz case, Commonwealth Act 567,
otherwise known as the Sugar Adjustment Act, levies on owners or persons in
control of lands devoted to the cultivation of sugar cane and ceded to others
for a consideration, on lease or otherwise -</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"'a tax equivalent to the difference between the money value
of the rental or consideration collected and the amount rep­resenting<span style=""> 12 per centum of the </span>assessed <span style="">value of such land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Sec. 3).'"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Under Section 6 of the <span style="">said law, </span>Commonwealth Act 567, all
collections made thereunder 'shall accrue to <span style="">a </span>special fund in the Philippine Treasury, to be known as the
"Sugar Adjustment and Stabilization Fund", and shall be paid out only
for any or all of the foregoing purposes or to attain any or all of the
following ob­jectives, as may be provided by law.' It then proceeds to
enumerate the said purposes, among which are 'to place the sugar industry in a
position to maintain itself; x x x to readjust the benefits derived from the
sugar industry x x x so that all might continue profitably to engage therein;
to limit the production of sugar to areas more economically suited to the pro­duction
thereof; and to afford labor employed in the <span style="">industry a living wage and to improve their living and </span><span style="">working </span><span style="">conditions.'<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The plaintiff in the above case, Walter Lutz, contended that
the aforementioned tax or special <span style="">assessment
</span><span style="">was </span>unconstitutional because
it was being 'levied for the aid and support of the sugar industry <span style="">exclusively,' </span>and therefore, not for a
public <span style="">purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In rejecting the theory advanced </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">the said plain­tiff, this Court said:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"'The <span style="">basic </span>defect
in the plaintiff's <span style="">position in his
assumption </span>that the tax provided for in Commonwealth Act 567 <span style="">is </span>a pure exercise of the taxing
power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Analy­sis <span style="">of the Act, and particularly section 6, </span>will show that the tax <span style="">is </span>levied with a regulatory purpose,
to provide means <span style="">for </span>the
rehabilitation and stabilization of <span style="">the
threatened sugar industry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><u>In
other words, the Act is primarily </u><u><span style="">an
</span>exercise of the police power.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="2Q">"This Court can take judicial notice <span style="">of the fact that sugar production is </span>one <span style="">of the great industries of our nation, </span>sugar occupying <span style="">a </span>leading position among <span style="">its export products; that it </span>gives
employ­ment to thousands of laborers in fields and <span style="">factories; that </span>it is a <span style="">great
source of the state's wealth, is one of </span>the important sources of foreign
exchange needed by our govern­<span style="">ment, and
is thus pivotal in </span>the plans of a regime committed to a policy of
currency sta­<span style="">bility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its promotion, </span>protection and ad<span style="">vancement, therefore redounds greatly to </span><span style="">the general welfare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence it was competent for </span><span style="">the legislature to find that the </span><span style="">general </span><span style="">welfare demanded that </span><span style="">the
sugar industry </span><span style="">should be
stabilized </span><span style="">in turn; and in </span>the
<span style="">wide field of its police power, </span><span style="">the </span>law-<span style="">making body could provide that the distribution of benefits </span><span style="">therefrom </span><span style="">be readjusted</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">among its components to </span><span style="">enable </span><span style="">it to resist the added strain of the increase in taxes that it had to
sustain (Sligh v. Kirkwood, 237 U.S. 52, 59 L. Ed. 835; Johnson v. State ex
rel. Marey, 99 Fla. 1311, 128 So. 853; Maxcy Inc. v. Mayo, 103 Fla. 552, 139
So. 121).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"‘As stated in Johnson v. State ex rel, Marey, with reference
to the citrus <span style="">industry </span>in
Florida --</p>

<p class="3Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">'The protection of a large <span style="">industry </span>constituting one of the <span style="">great </span>source of the state's wealth and
therefore directly or indirectly affecting the welfare of so great a portion of
the population of the State is affected <span style="">to
such an extent by public interests as to be within the police power of the
sovereign.' (128 So. 837).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"'Once it is conceded, as it must be that the protection and
promotion of the sugar in­dustry is a matter of public concern, it fol­lows that
the Legislature may determine within reasonable bounds what is necessary for
its protection and expedient for its promotion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here, the legislative discretion must be allow­ed full play, subject
only to the test of reasonableness; and it is not contended that the means
provided in section 6 of the law (above <span style="">quoted)
bear no relation to the objective pursued or are oppressive in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If objective and methods are alike
constitutionally valid, no reason is seen why the state may not levy taxes to
raise funds for their prosecution and attainment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Taxation may be made the imple­ment of the
state's police power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Great Atl. &amp;
Pac. Tea Co. v. Grosjean, 301 U.S. 412, 81 L. ed. 1193; U.S. v. Butler, 297
U.S.1, 80 L. ed. 477; M'cullock v. Maryland, 4 Wheat, 316, 4 L. ed. 579).'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"</span>On the
authority of the above case, then, <span style="">We </span>hold that the special assessment at bar
may be considered <span style="">si­</span>milarly <span style="">as </span>the
above, that is, that the levy for the Phil<span style="">sugin
Fund is not so much an exercise of the power of taxation, nor the imposition of
a special assessment, but the exercise of the police power for the general
welfare of the entire country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is,
therefore, an </span>exercise <span style="">of a
sovereign power which no private citizen may lawfully resist.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Besides, under Section 2(a) of the charter, the Philsugin is
authorized 'to conduct research work for the sugar industry <u>in all its
phases</u>, either agricultural or industrial, for the purpose of introducing
into the sugar industry such practices or processes that will re<span style="">duce the cost of production, x x x,<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>and achieve great­</span>er <span style="">efficiency in the industry.' This provision,
first of all, more than justifies the acquisition of the refinery in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Who can dispute that the
operation of a sugar refinery is a phase of sugar production and that from such
operation may be learned methods of reducing the cost of sugar manufacture no
less than it may afford the opportunity to discover the more effective means of
achieving progress in the industry?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Philsugin's experience alone of running a refinery </span><span style="">is a gain </span><span style="">to the entire industry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the operation resulted </span>in <span style="">a fi­nancial loss is by no </span><span style="">means </span><span style="">an index that the industry did not profit
therefrom, as other gains of a different nature may have been realized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, from its finan­cially unsuccessful
venture, the Philsugin could very well have advanced in its appreciation of the
problems of management faced by sugar centrals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It could have understood more clearly the difficulties of marketing </span><span style="">sugar products.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could have known with better intimacy the
precise area of the industry in need of the most help from the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The view of the appellants herein, therefore,
that they were not be­nefitted by the unsuccessful operation </span><span style="">of the re­</span><span style="">finery in question </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">not entirely accurate.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Furthermore, Section 2(a) specifies a field of research
which, indeed, would be difficult to carry out <span style="">save </span>through the actual operation of <span style="">a </span>refinery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quite
obviously, the most practical or realistic approach to the problem of what
'practices or proces­<span style="">ses' might most
effectively cut the cost of production </span>is to experiment on production
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, how can such an
experiment be carried out without the tools, which is all that <span style="">a </span>refinery <span style="">is?"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, even if it were
assumed that the acquisition of a re­finery is not contemplated in Rep. Act 632
</span><span style="">as </span><span style="">within the objectives and powers of the
Philsugin, there is no denying the fact that not </span><span style="">all the money in the Sugar Research and </span>Stabilization <span style="">Fund created </span><span style="">by the law from the levy on the appellant and the other sugar centrals
and planters is involved in such </span><span style="">purchase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indisputably, the Phil­</span><span style="">sugin is using the rest of the said fund for
purposes which cannot be questioned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such being </span>the <span style="">case, </span><span style="">the obligation of appellant to pay the tax in
question is </span><span style="">clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The idea of proportioning the amount </span><span style="">it will pay according to its own </span><span style="">computation of how much of the above Fund is
being devoted to what it deems to be </span><span style="">legitimate ends only cannot </span><span style="">be sanctioned, if for no other reason than that such a manner of
payment will unduly hamper the proper programming and budgeting of the said
Fund </span><span style="">by the Philsugin even for
its unquestionably autho­</span><span style="">rized </span><span style="">projects, thereby reducing its efficacy and </span><span style="">defeating the pur­pose for which </span><span style="">it has been established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span>remedy that suggests itself the <span style="">moment Philsugin indulges in unauthorized
ventures or pro­</span><span style="">jects is to
raise the illegality thereof in appropriate </span><span style="">proceedings, </span><span style="">either
administrative or judicial, so that the same may be </span><span style="">enjoined or annulled and those responsible
therefor may be properly called to ac­count, but, certainly, not by refusing to
pay the levy fixed by law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the three other cases already referred to,
the judgment of the trial court in this case is affirmed, with costs against ap­pellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
