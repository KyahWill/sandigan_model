<p>On December 14, 1960, the petitioner, a corporation duly organized
and existing under the laws of the Philippines and operating the only
mine within the jurisdiction of the municipality of Hinabangan, filed
this case of declaratory relief in the Court of First Instance of
Manila questioning the validity of the ordinance as enacted without
authority and in violation of law. Respondents answered averring the
ordinance's validity with a counter-claim for damages; and petitioner
having filed an amended petition and answer to the counterclaim, which
amended petition was accordingly answered by respondents; the case was
tried by the Court a quo on March 15, 1961, the parties filed
respective memoranda, and on April 4, 1961 the Court a quo rendered its
decision declaring the ordinance in question illegal, from which
judgment respondents in due time perfected their appeal to this Court.</p>
<p>Neither petitioner-appellee nor respondents-appellants adduced any
evidence before the Court a quo, the facts heretofore stated having
been based on the allegations of the amended petition and the
admissions thereof in the appellants' amended answer thereto, and the
case was submitted for decision on the pleadings.</p>
<p>Respondents-appellants maintain in this appeal that the Court a quo
erred in finding that Ordinance No. 7 does not impose a tax, that
Ordinance No. 7 was intended to impose a tax on sales; that Ordinance
No. 7 is illegal because it is an imposition of a double taxation; and
that Ordinance No. 7 is null and void. </p>
<p>On the petitioner-appellee's side, they maintain that Section 2 of
Municipal Ordinance No. 7 does not impose a tax or levy, and there is
no clear and express imposition of a charge in the other provisions of
the ordinance; that the declaration of authority to impose a tax is
false and erroneous because no such power is conferred in Section 2 of
Republic Act No. 2264, upon which such authority is based; that,
moreover, there is no finding by the Court a quo that a tax was
imposed, much less, that the same is based on the gross outputs or
sales, because the Court a quo merely assumed that the tax is imposed
and declared it illegal as not within the Municipal Council's authority
to impose because it falls within the exceptions to the taxing powera
of municipal governments, as prescribed in Section 2, last paragraph,
of the Local Autonomy Act (RA No. 2264). </p>
<p>We find no error in the decision appealed from in so far as it holds
that the ordinance in question fails to levy any tax. Appellants admit
in their brief that the main section (section 2) of the ordinance
"seems merely declaratory of authority", albeit they aver that a
reading of it as a whole leads to the conclusion that a tax was
intended. It is, however, a well established rule that— </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"A statute will not be construed as imposing a tax
unless it does so clearly, expressly and unambiguously." (82 C.J.S.,
956) (Italics supplied) <br></p></blockquote><p>and that—</p><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is an ancient principle that a tax can not be imposed without
clear and express words for that purpose. Accordingly, the general rule
of requiring adherence to the letter in construing statutes applies
with peculiar strictness to tax laws and the provisions of a taxing act
are not to be extended by implication." (30 Am. Jur. 153; also
McQuillin on Municipal Corp., Vol. 16, p. 267; italics ours)</p>
<p>A mere reading of the ordinance discloses that not only are there no
words therein imposing a tax but that the peruser is left in doubt as
to whether the intention is to levy a tax for revenue or charge a fee
for permitting the business to be carried on; for section 2 declares
that the law "empowers the Municipal Council of Hinabangan, Samar, to
impose graduated Municipal License Fees". Since the validity of taxes
and license fees are governed by different principles, the taxpayer is
left in doubt as to the true nature of the charge, and whether he must
bear it or not. The rule is that taxes may not be imposed by
implications,<span class="style2 style1 style1"></span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
and "a tax statute is to be construed strictly and aoainat the
subjection to a tax liability where the question is whether a matter,
property or person is subject to the tax" (82 C.J.S., p. 957).
Considering the unavoidability of taxes by the citizen, it seems that
the Marinduque Iron Mines Agents, Inc. vs. Municipal Council of
Hinabangan, Samar, et al. least he is entitled to is to be expressly
required to pay a tax, which the words of the questioned ordinance do
not state. This is particularly true where the ordinance, as in this
case, carries penal provisions.</p>
<p>We further agree with the judgment appealed from that Ordinance No.
7, Ser. 1960, of Hinabangan, Samar, is invalid because the same
infringes upon the express restrictions placed by tha legislature upon
the taxing power delegated to city and municipal councils. Section 2,
paragraph 1, of Republic Act No. 2264, after conferring power to
cities, municipalities, and municipal districts to impose license taxes
and service fees or charges on business and occupations, expressly
limited said powers by the following proviso:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"<span style="font-style: italic;">Provided</span> that municipalities and municipal
districts shall, in no case, impose any percentage tax on sales or
other taxes in any form based thereon; x x x "</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even granting that it does impose a tax, the ordinance in question,
while not providing for a percentage tax, but a graduated tax (the
progressive tax therein imposed not being calculated on a percentage of
the sales made by the taxpayer), nevertheless, it prescribes a tax
based on sales, contrary to the statute (R.A. 2264). It is true that
the ordinance purports to base the tax on either "gross output or
sales"; but the only standard provided for measuring the gross output
is its peso value, as determined from "true copies of receipts and/or
invoices" (which are precisely the evidence of sales) that the taxpayer
is required to submit to the municipal treasurer (section 3), without
deduction being provided for freight, insurance, or incidental costs.
Directly or indirectly, the amount of payable tax under this ordinance
is determined by the gross sales of the taxpayer, and violates the
explicit prohibition that the municipality must not levy, or impose,
"taxes in any form based on sales". </p>
<p>The plea that the members of the Municipal Council are not attorneys
and of low scholastic ability" affords no excuse for not observing
well-established legal principles. The tax imposing authority is held
to know and understand that the levying of taxes ia a subject of grave
responsibility, and of serious consequences to the taxpayer. Taxation
is not merely a matter of wishing before an unused well, or of stroking
some wornout lamp. </p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the  judgment appealed  from is affirmed, with costs against appellants. </p>
