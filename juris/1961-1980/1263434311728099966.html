				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align=""><o:smarttagtype name="date" namespaceuri="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags"></o:smarttagtype><div class="Section1"><p>From the decision of the Court of Appeals affirming with modification the 
decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila (in Civil Case No. 41080), 
<span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> P. Perez filed, the instant petition for 
review, contesting the correctness of the ruling ordering him to pay to 
respondent Armando <span class="SpellE">Herradura</span> P600.00 for unpaid 
salaries, P400.00 separation pay, and Pl<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as 
moral damages.</p>
<p>On <st1:date month="8" day="1" year="1958">August 1, 1958</st1:date>, 
respondent <span class="SpellE">Herradura</span> was appointed by petitioner as 
manager of the D. P. Perez Insurance Agency with a monthly salary of P400.00. 
Respondent forthwith discharged the functions thereof. However, in a letter 
dated January 15, 1959, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> Perez 
informed respondent that because respondent failed to produce the promised 
amount of business, the agency would no longer be in a position to continue with 
his services under the original arrangement and, consequently, the latter was 
being appointed, effective that date, as manager of its Non-Life department with 
compensation on commission basis only. As a result thereof, respondent resigned 
the following day, from his employment in the agency.</p>
<p>On <st1:date month="2" day="11" year="1959">February 11, 1959</st1:date>, 
respondent filed in Regional office No. 3 of the Department of Labor a claim for 
separation <span class="GramE">pay<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>1]</sup></span> against petitioner <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> P. Perez. On <st1:date month="2" day="24" year="1959">February 24, 1959</st1:date>, respondent, likewise, filed a 
complaint for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> in the City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> office against petitioner, for the same act of 
alleged non-payment of his salaries (I.S. 4482).</p>
<p>On August 4, 1959, or while this criminal complaint was pending 
investigation, petitioner instituted in the Court of First Instance of Manila 
Civil Case No. 41080 (the present action), for consignation and declaratory 
relief, alleging that notwithstanding his offers for payment of the sum of 
P600.00 demanded by respondent as unpaid salaries, the latter refused to accept 
the same. Thus, petitioner deposited said amount in court. In his answer to this 
petition, respondent denied the allegation that there was tender of payment made 
by petitioner, and in turn made a counterclaim for moral damages and attorney's 
fees. Thereafter, the City Fiscal dropped the criminal complaint against 
petitioner by reason of the alleged satisfaction of the unpaid salaries subject 
of the complaint, and due to defendant's desistance to prosecute.</p>
<p>In the consignation-case, the lower court, after hearing, rendered judgment 
finding petitioner liable for unpaid salaries of respondent for the period of 
from <st1:date month="12" day="1" year="1958">December 1, 1958</st1:date> to 
<st1:date month="1" day="15" year="1959">January 15, 1959</st1:date>. Petitioner 
was also ordered to pay him separation pay corresponding to respondents one 
month salary, or P400.00, moral damages in the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and P500.00 as attorney's fees. On appeal by 
petitioner, the Court of Appeals modified the lower court's decision only by 
reducing the moral damages from P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to P1,000.00 
and eliminating the provision for attorney's fees. <span class="GramE">Hence, the 
filing of the instant petition for review.</span></p>
<p>There is no disagreement as to the fact that respondent worked for 
petitioner's agency for five and one-half months from August 1, 1958 to January 
15, 1959) that he was informed of the change of the nature of his employment, 
from monthly salary to commission basis, on January 15, 1959 said arrangement to 
take effect on the same day; that this new appointment forced him to resign from 
his employment. In assailing the award of separation pay to respondent, 
petitioner contends that the former was not entitled thereto, respondent having 
rendered service for less than six months. The contention is without merit.</p>
<p>Under Republic Act 1052<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> before 
its amendment by Republic Act 1787, an employment for an indefinite period can 
not be terminated by the employer without serving upon the employee, one month 
advance notice thereof or paying him separation pay corresponding to his salary 
for one month. Note that while the law imposes the obligation, to give one month 
advance notice, on both the employer and employee, should the employee violate 
the same, the latter is not subject at all to any liability. Also, the law makes 
no distinction between justified and unjustified separation <span class="GramE">or</span> dismissal. Neither is the employee's length of service 
taken as a factor in the matter of award of separation pay. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[3]</sup></span> With the introduction of the amendment, 
however, the law on termination pay became more specific. In the first place, 
termination of employment was classified into two: those for just cause and 
those without, the law itself providing what constitute just cause for severance 
of employment. The <span class="GramE">employee</span> who violates the injunction 
against termination of employment without advance notice to his employer, may 
now be held liable for damages. Upon the other hand, in determining the period 
of notice or the corresponding compensation to which a dismissed employee shall 
be entitled, the length of his service to the employer is taken into 
consideration. It is clear, therefore, that while under Republic Act 1952, every 
dismissed employee is entitled to one month advance notice or the equivalent 
separation pay, under Republic Act 1787, an employee who was dismissed without 
just cause shall be entitled to at least one month advance notice or severance 
pay, or shall be credited with half-month for every year of service, whichever 
is longer. In other words, if an employee had rendered services for 3 
years—since he shall be credited half-month for every year of service—he will be 
entitled to advance notice of one and one-half months or the equivalent salary 
for said period. If he is credited with two years service, he is entitled to one 
month notice. If he has served for at least one year and six months, he also 
deserves one month notice, because the fraction of six months shall be 
considered one year. Suppose the employee has worked for one year and five 
months? Although the employee shall be credited with only half month for the one 
year service, and the fraction of five months is not considered one year, 
nevertheless, he is to be given one month notice, because under the law an 
employee is entitled to at least one month notice, the length of service being 
the basis of computation only if the result thereof will be more than one month. 
Differently stated, the minimum period of notice to which an employee is 
entitled, irrespective of the length of his service to the employer, is one 
month. It is needless to emphasize that this provision applies only if the 
termination of employment has been made without just cause. In the present case, 
it has not been proved that respondent's separation from the service was for any 
of the causes mentioned in the law as justifying termination of his 
employment.</p>
<p>Petitioner, likewise, assails the award of moral damages to respondent in the 
sum of Pl<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>. In this connection, the only basis 
mentioned by the Court of Appeals for the award of moral damages was that "from 
the time his (respondent's) services were terminated by the plaintiff on January 
15, 1959, up to the time that he was able to land a job with the <span class="SpellE">Stanvac</span> Company, he had suffered much, being the father of a 
family with five children; he was downtrodden and had no other recourse than to 
pawn the small pieces of jewelry belonging to his wife." We do not believe this 
is sufficient ground to award moral damages. In no part of the decision under 
review is a finding that the non-payment of respondent's salary in due time was 
malicious, fraudulent or in bad faith. And we have held in various cases that in 
breach of contracts, moral damages may be awarded only where the breach was 
wanton or deliberately injurious, or the one responsible acted fraudulently or 
with malice or bad faith<span class="GramE">.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>4]</sup></span> </p>
<p>As petitioner acknowledges his liability for respondents unpaid salaries for 
one and one-half months, the sum of P600.00 deposited in court may accordingly 
be disposed of for this purpose.</p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, as thus modified, by eliminating the award, of moral 
damages, the decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby affirmed, with costs 
against petitioner. <span class="GramE"><b><br></b></span></p><p><span class="GramE"><b>SO ORDERED</b>.</span></p>
