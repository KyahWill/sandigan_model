				<H3>GOV. PEDRO R. DIZON, PETITIONER, VS. HON. TITO

THE PROVINCIAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS OF BATAAN; GUILLERMO ARCENAS; AND MEDINA

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These three cases, docketed here under G.R. Nos. L-28550 to
L-28552, <span style="">inclusive, <span class="GramE">have</span>
their origin in Cases Nos. 80, 83 and 84, respectively, </span>of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the elections of <st1:date month="11" day="14" year="1967">November
 14, 1967</st1:date> three candidates ran for the office of Governor in said
province:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pedro R. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>,
peti­tioner herein; Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Arcenas</span> and Mrs. Medina
<span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> de Leon, the last two now respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Case No. 80 was a petition <span style="">filed </span>by <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> on December 21, 1967 for
a judicial recount of votes in precinct No. 5 of <span class="SpellE">Balanga</span>
and precinct No. 10 of Hermosa; Case No. 83 was a similar petition filed by <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> on December 27, 1967, with respect to the votes in
precinct No. 9 of <span class="SpellE">Abucay</span> and precinct No. 31 of <span class="SpellE">Balanga</span>; and <span style="">Case </span>No.
84 was also a petition of the same nature with respect to precinct No. 1 of <span class="SpellE">Abucay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">After trial </span>the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
dismissed Case No. 80 in its decision of <st1:date month="1" day="12" year="1968">January 12, 1968</st1:date>; <span style="">Cases </span>Nos. 83 and 84 met the same fate, <span style="">but merely on a motion to dismiss filed by the two respondents and
resolved in an order dated </span><st1:date month="1" day="15" year="1968"><span style="">January 15, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitions before us are for certiorari, mandamus and/or prohibition, with
preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In essence the
petitioner seeks a reversal of the actuations of the court below and an order
for the judicial recount of the votes cast for the office of Governor in the
precincts above referred to and the inclusion of the votes as thus recounted in
the canvass to be made.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We gave due course to the
petition and issued a restraining order to stop the respondents, particularly
the provincial board of canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>, from
resuming the canvass of the returns for the contested <span style="">office </span>and from making the corresponding proclamation of the
winning candidate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result of the
restraining order the petitioner here, as incumbent Governor, continues to hold
the position.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In case No. 80, judicial
recount is sought in view of certain alleged discrepancies in the various
copies of the election returns in precincts No. 5 of <span class="SpellE">Balanga</span>
and No. 10 of Hermosa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to
precinct No. 5 of <span class="SpellE">Balanga</span>, the discrepancy alleged in
the petition and found by the trial court <span style="">is </span>that while in the copies of the return for the municipal
treasurer and the provincial treasurer <span class="SpellE">Arcenas</span>
appears to have obtained 68 votes, in the copy for the Commission on Elections
he appears to have obtained 6<span class="GramE">,7</span> votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court also noted that the first two
copies aforesaid contain erasures and superimpositions, which it said were made
by the election inspectors to correct erroneous entries, but that the entries
in the third copy, that is, in the one for the Commis­sion on Elections, are
clear and legible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is this third copy
that the supervisor of the Commission on Elections in </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bataan</span></span></st1:place><span style=""> instructed the board of canvassers to use
once the injunction issued by the lower court was lifted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Since the discrepancy
between the different copies of the return consists of only one (1) vote and
would not materially affect the result of the election for the office of
Governor, the lower court held that a judicial recount was not in order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This conclusion is correct, as far <span style="">as </span>it goes, for sander Section 163 of
the Revised Election Code the difference must really be such <span style="">as </span>to affect the result of the elec­tion
in order to justify a judicial recount.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, the petitioner
has asked for a recount not only in precinct No. 5 of <span class="SpellE">Balanga</span>
but also in precinct No. 10 of Hermosa, and alleges in effect that a recount in
these two precincts together could change the result of the election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In precinct No. 10 of Hermosa the petitioner
points out the following discrepancy:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in
the copies of the return for the municipal treasurer, the provin­cial treasurer
and the Commission on Elections, respondent <span class="SpellE">Arcenas</span>
is credited with 132 votes, both in words and figures, although there <span style="">are </span>visible erasures in said entries,
while in the "advance municipal treasurer's copy" he is credited with
122 votes, both in words and figures, also with erasures.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It
</span><span style="">is
alleged in the petition that if the questioned entries for respondent <span class="SpellE">Arcenas</span> are read as 68 votes in precinct No. 5 of <span class="SpellE">Balanga</span> and 132 votes in precinct No. 10 of Hermosa, he
would win by a plurality of 3 votes over petitioner <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>,
but if said entries are read as 67 and 122 votes, respectively, the petitioner
would win by 8 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no
dispute as to the materiality of the differences referred to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue is whether or not these
differences, particularly in precinct No. 10 of Hermosa, are such </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">to justify a
judicial recount under the law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
findings of the trial court are </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Coming now to the returns for precinct 10 of Hermosa:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A perusal of the copy of the return for the
Municipal Treasurer (Exhibit R-1-Court); copy for the Provincial Treasurer,
Exhibit W-1-Court; copy for the Commission en Elec­tions, Exhibit Y-1-Court,
shows the entries clearly written in words that respondent Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Arcenas</span> obtained "one hundred thirty-two" votes;
Pedro R. Dixon obtained "twenty-six" votes; <span style="">and Medina </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Lacson</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">de Leon obtained "two " votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In figures, the corresponding votes clearly
and legibly </span><span style="">read </span><span style="">"132", "26" and
"2", respectively, for the three candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In these </span><span style="">three </span><span style="">copies of the
returns for Precinct 10 of Hermosa, the words "thirty-two" written
after the words "one hundred" opposite the name of candidate
Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Arcenas</span> appear to have been erased and
corrected; neverthe­less, the correction, which is in the same handwriting is
clear and legible, so that the number of votes obtained </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Arcenas</span> is clearly recorded as "one hundred thirty-two".<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>This observation of the Court was affirmed by Atty. Arturo Lopez,
supervi­sor of the Commission on Elections, when he concluded "that all
the erasures were done by members of the Board of Inspectors merely to rectify
an error because the hand­writing in the three (3) copies are very similar<span class="GramE">. "</span> <span class="GramE">(See p. 4, Minutes of the Board <span style="">of Canvassers, Annex B to Answer of respond­ent
<span class="SpellE">Arcenas</span>).</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Lopez instructed the
provincial board of canvassers to use the copy of the return for the Provincial
</span><span style="">Treasurer (Exhibit W-1-Court) as
"the basis of the canvass because the three (3) copies are all authentic
copies, they are all genuine." </span><st1:state><st1:place><span class="GramE"><span style="">Id.</span></span></st1:place></st1:state><span class="GramE"><span style="">, p. 5)."</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"From this circumstance, the Court finds and so concludes that
the erasures complained of by petitioner in the entries on the number of votes
obtained by the candidates for the office of governor in the returns for
Precinct 10 of Hermosa are merely corrections to rectify an erroneous entry,
which could be attributed to clerical error.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The discrepancy was not attributed to tamper or obvious fraudulent
practices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the Court finds
no contradictory statements in the returns for Precinct 10 of Hermosa to
warrant a judicial re­count of the votes recorded therein."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The conclusion thus
reached by the trial court is not without strong basis both in law and in
fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In law, because the advance
municipal treasurer's copy of the return, which shows a different entry (122 </span><span style="">votes) </span><span style="">from that in the three other copies (132 votes) - the official copy for
the municipal treasurer and the copies for the pro</span><span style="">vincial </span><span style="">treasurer and the Commission on Elections - is not one of the copies
which can be the basis of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">recount (<span class="SpellE">Acuña</span> <span class="SpellE">Golez</span>, 16 </span>Sup. Ct. Rep. <span class="SpellE">Anno</span>.
<span class="GramE">32; <span class="SpellE">Palarca</span> vs. Arleta, G.R. No.</span>
L-22224, <st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="10">Oct. 24, 1966</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in fact, because the three official
copies not only tally with each other but also with the tally board, which was
produced before the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A <span class="SpellE">photostat</span> of this tally board is annexed to the answer of
respondent <span class="SpellE">Arcenas</span>, and his allegation that the
entries therein coincide with the figures appearing in those official copies of
the returns, particularly insofar <span style="">as </span>the
votes for <span class="SpellE">Arcenas</span> are concerned, has not <span style="">been denied </span>by the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is our opinion,
therefore, that the trial court committed no error in denying </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">recount with respect to precinct 5 of <span class="SpellE">Balanga</span>
and precinct 10 of Hermosa, and in dismissing Case No. 80 accordingly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Going now to Cases Nos.
83 and 84, the lower court dismissed the petitions for recount upon motion by
the respondents on two grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) lack
of jurisdiction and (2) splitting of a single cause of action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In connection with the
first ground it appears that the </span>election returns for <span class="SpellE">Abucay</span> and for <span class="SpellE">Balanga</span> were
canvassed by the provincial board of canvassers on December 5 and 6,
respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No question was then
raised by the petitioner or by anyone acting for <span style="">him in connection with any one of those returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 163 of the Revised Election Code
authorizes </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">judicial recount, upon motion of the board or of any candidate affected,
"in case it appears to the provincial board of canvassers that another
copy or other authentic copies of the statement from an election precinct
submitted to the board give to </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">candidate a different number of votes and the
difference affects the result </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the election," In other words the
discrepancy must be brought to the attention of the board in the process </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was done with respect to the returns
subject of Case No. 80.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact the
board had to suspend the canvass in order to allow the petitioner to go to
court, as he did; but with respect to the returns subject of Cases Nos. 83 and
84, the canvass had long been terminated when he filed his petitions therein on
</span><st1:date month="12" day="27" year="1967"><span style="">December 27, 1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> and </span><st1:date month="1" day="8" year="1968"><span style="">January 8, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">, respectively.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">Concerning the second
basis of the order of dismissal</b><span style="">, we
really see no justifiable reason why several distinct petitions should be
filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor has the petitioner given
any.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A judicial recount under Section
163 of the Revised Election Code, no matter how many precincts may be involved,
constitutes only one cause of action:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the ground is the same and so is the relief which the court </span><span style="">may </span><span style="">grant in all of
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proceeding envisioned by the
law is more or less summary in cha­racter and is designed to settle the
causative controversy without un­necessary delay so that the winning candidate
may be identified and duly proclaimed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This objective of the law would be nullified if a petitioner is
permitted to seek his redress piecemeal, or in installments - asking for a
recount now with respect to one precinct, next week with respect to another
precinct, and so on successively as long as there </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">yet no
proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Public policy, which is
behind the rule against split­ting causes of action, forbids such </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">course.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We are of the opinion that the respondent court did not commit a
grave abuse of discretion or so neglected a duty enjoined by law as to justify
the issuance of the writs prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petition is therefore dismissed and the restrain order heretofore
issued is lifted, with costs.</p>
