				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> (in its Criminal Case No. 22788-II) convicting
the three accused, <span class="SpellE">Marceliano</span> Bautista, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Morondos</span> and Orlando <span class="SpellE">Morondos</span>, of
conspiring and murdering one Federico <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> and
sentencing them to <u><span style="">reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></span></u><span style="">,
</span>to pay P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to the heirs of the deceased
by way of indemnity but without subsidiary imprisonment, and to defray the
costs of the proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The findings of the court below are amply supported by the
evidence <span style="">on </span>record
which establishes that the afternoon of <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="3">31
 March 1966</st1:date> Federico <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> was in the
store of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Perdido</span> in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Cabayugan</span> of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Mangatarem</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, drinking liquor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, he was celebrating his recent
release from the municipal jail where he had been confined for theft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused joined him, and all became
intoxicated, to the extent that Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Perdido</span>,
cousin of <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>, at the request of the store owner's
wife, advised them to leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ricardo
left ahead, and on passing the house where Federico <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
lived with his sister, <span class="SpellE">Ponciana</span>, he informed the
latter of her brother's release and of his being drunk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ponciana</span> waited for
Federico in the balcony of the house with several of her children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly thereafter, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">seven o'clock P.M.</st1:time>, her brother appeared <span class="GramE">walking</span> down the road accompanied by the three
accused-appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Federico was heavily
drunk, and carried his shirt hanging from the shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Near the house, accused Bautista and Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Morondos</span> were heard inviting Federico <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
to drink further with them, but <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> refused
twice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon, Bautista hit <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> from behind with a piece of wood, the blow landing on
the base of the neck and causing <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> to fall on the
road face up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then Orlando <span class="SpellE">Morondos</span> took hold of the same piece of wood and struck <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> in the face, while Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Morondos</span>
boxed the stomach of the fallen man.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then the three accused took hold of the victim and dumped him inside a
dry canal near the road, battered him further and left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assault was witnessed by <span class="SpellE">Ponciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> and her son,
Hernando <span class="SpellE">Gabay</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ponciana</span>, on seeing the aggression on
her brother, shouted for help, but as no one came, she sent two of her children
to the nearby house of her uncle, <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span>
Fernandez, who turned out to be out in his field.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mother and children, afraid that the accused
might return and do them harm, sought refuge in the Fernandez house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Celes­tino</span>
Fernandez was summoned and was informed of what had transpired, he lost no time
to inform Barrio Captain <span class="SpellE">Esmenio</span> Bravo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter sent two men to notify the police
and later that night Patrolman Daniel <span class="SpellE">Campit</span> of the
local police force arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
questioned the eyewitnesses, viewed the corpse and, with one Sergeant <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>, looked for the <span class="SpellE">Morondos</span> at
the latter's home, where they were advised that the two brothers, Orlando and
Alfredo, were threshing <span class="SpellE">palay</span> at the place of one
Sergio <span class="SpellE">Sidon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Proceeding thither, the patrolmen found only Alfredo and Orlando <span class="SpellE">Morondos</span>, who were taken for investigation at the municipal
building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused Bautista was then not
at <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sidon</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="SpellE">'s</span> house, but was taken in sometime later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>
Velasquez was summoned to make the autopsy that <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>
and found that death was due to severe shock, cerebral concussion and
hemorrhage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The body exhibited
contusions <span style="">in </span>the mouth and lips
which, with the nose, were filled with blood; contusions with <span class="SpellE">hematoma</span> in the occipital region, in the left shoulder and
at the back of the thoracic wall.</p>

<p class="BODY">Charged and tried, the court below held the appellants guilty of
murder, as stated at the beginning of this opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial judge dis­counted the version of
the accused that they had left the deceased standing on the road, and had not
touched him, but that they went dir­ectly to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sidon</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="SpellE">'s</span>
place where they threshed <span class="SpellE">palay</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel for appellants insists that the eyewitnesses, <span class="SpellE">Ponciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> and her 10-year
old son, Hernando <span class="SpellE">Gabay</span>, are not worthy of credence,
and with commendable diligence points out various contra­dictions in their
individual testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our study of the
records reveals that these contradictions refer to minor matters that do not
detract from the credibility of the eyewitnesses; rather, they enhance it, for
it is not to be wondered at that a grown-up woman and a 10-year old boy should
not coincide in the appreciation of details.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, the spontaneity of their identification of the
accused (who were their <span class="SpellE">barriomates</span>), is supported by
their immediate denunciation of the three accused to the police on the same
night of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their narration of
the events tallies with the autopsy findings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Above all, no reason is shown why they should wish to link the accused,
and not others, to this crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that at <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7 o'clock P.M.</st1:time>
of 31 March the sun had already set; but it is well-known that there is a
period of afterglow before the onset of real darkness, and in March twilight is
already rather prolonged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, as
shown by the Weather Bureau certificate (Exhibit "5"), the moon had risen
shortly after midday (12.59 P.M.) to set at 2:29 <span style="">A.M. </span>the next day; at 7 o'clock P.M.
it was nearly overhead with 59% illumination.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We, therefore, can not conclude that the scene was not sufficiently
lighted to enable the eyewitnesses to see what they narrated in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While there were acacia trees around the <span class="SpellE">situs</span> of the <span class="SpellE">delict</span>, it is not
proved that they completely blocked the view of <span class="SpellE">Ponciana</span>
<span class="SpellE">Celso</span> and her son.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants harp on the absence of evidence on any motive on their
part to commit the aggression on the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The evidence is that the deceased repeatedly rejected appellants'
invitations to drink; and many cases in the annals of this Court emphasize that
such refusals have often triggered homicidal assaults, particularly where the
attackers were already under the influence of liquor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, from U.<span style="">S. vs. </span><span class="SpellE">McMann</span>,
4 Phil. 561, to People vs. Raquel, 12 SCRA 441, it has been the constant
doctrine of this Court that where the accused is clearly identified by credible
witnesses (as in this case), lack of <span style="">known motive is </span>not important.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason is that, as remarked by <span class="SpellE">Wigmore</span> (Science of Judicial Proof, 3d Ed., page 183), -</p>

<blockquote>"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>. . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be futile
to try to catalogue the various facts of human life with reference to their
potency in exciting a given emotion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such an attempt would exhibit two defects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be pedantic, because <span style="">it is </span>impossible to suppose that the
operation of human emotions can be reduced to fixed rules, and that a given
fact can have an unvarying quantity <span style="">of
emotional potency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be useless,
because the emotional effect of any fact must depend so </span><span style="">often on </span><span style="">the individual and the surrounding circumstances that no general
formula could provide for the infinite combinations of circumstances.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Courts have therefore always been agreed that in general no
fixed negative rules can be made; that no circumstance can be said beforehand
to be without the power of exciting a given emotion; and that, in general, any
fact may be conceived as tending with others towards the emotion in question. .
. . . . . . . .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Alexander <span class="SpellE">Burril</span>, in his "Treatise
on Circumstantial Evidence", pages 317-318, observes:</p>

<blockquote>"But turning from argument to facts, the evidence recorded in
numerous actual trials serves incon­testably to show by how trifling and apparently
wholly inadequate motives or causes men <u>have been</u> led to the commission
of the most appalling crimes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere
expectation of obtaining a few pounds for a dead human body, as an anatomical
subject, was sufficient to induce <u>Burke</u> and his associates to murder no
less than sixteen persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few words
of reprimand led <u>Courvoisier</u> to cut his master's throat as he lay asleep
in his bed."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is no rule of law which determines <span class="GramE">what
is an adequate motive</span>, even where it is ne­cessary to show one." (<span class="SpellE">Barculo</span>, J., in People vs. <st1:place>Lake</st1:place>, 1
Parker's Criminal Reports, page 540)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' defense, in the last analysis, is but an <u>alibi</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They claim that they left <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
alive and were threshing <span class="SpellE">palay</span> at <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sidon</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="SpellE">'s</span>
when the crime took place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But a
distance of less than half a kilo­meter is certainly not sufficient to raise
reasonable doubt as to the possibility of their presence at the time and place
they were seen by the witnesses for the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also point out that <span class="SpellE">Celso's</span>
uncle, <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> Fernandez, expressed willingness to
hire <span style="">someone </span>to kill <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>; but the circumstances surrounding the utterance and
the fact that it was made to the barrio captain and the mayor, who <span style="">did </span>nothing about it, is proof that
the threat was not serious.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree that there is not sufficient evidence to indicate cons­piracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, the murderous assault was
provoked by <span class="SpellE">Celso's</span> persistent rejection of the
invitations to drink made by Bautista and Orlando <span class="SpellE">Morondos</span>,
who inflicted the most serious injuries.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Morondos</span>, who merely boxed the
victim in the stomach, should be held guilty only of <span class="SpellE"><u>lessiones</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">leves</span>,</u> or light physical injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the other two accused are guilty of
murder characterized by <span class="SpellE"><u>alevosia</u></span> in the case
of Bautista, who struck the victim from behind, and of Orlan­<span style="">do <span class="SpellE">Morondos</span>, </span>who
hit him in the face while lying helpless on the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of aggravating or mitigating
circumstances, the penalty <span style="">of <u>reclusion
<span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u> </span>was correctly imposed by the
trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There <span style="">is no evidence </span>that the intoxication
of appellants was not habitual.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the sentence appealed from is affirmed as to
appellants <span class="SpellE">Marceliano</span> Bautista and Orlando <span class="SpellE">Morondos</span> and modified as to Al­fredo <span class="SpellE">Morondos</span>,
who is hereby sentenced to only fifteen (15) days of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">menor</span></u>; and con­sidering the time of his
preventive imprisonment since 1966, it is directed that he be immediately
released from custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All accused are
