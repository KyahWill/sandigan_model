				<BR><BR><div align=""><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span><p>Appeal by the National Waterworks and Sewerage authority — hereinafter 
referred to as NAWASA — from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Cebu, 
the dispositive part of which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, judgment is hereby 
rendered:</p>
<p>(1) Declaring the plaintiff Municipality of Compostela the true, lawful and 
exclusive owner and possessor of the waterworks system in question, with the 
concomittant legal attributes of ownership, such as possession, administration, 
jurisdiction, supervision, operation and control over the same;</p>
<p>(2) Ordering the defendant Authority to restore to the plaintiff Municipality 
of Compostela the ownership, supervision, jurisdiction, administration, 
possession, operation and control of the waterworks system in question upon 
payment to the latter of the amount of P8,000.00, representing the value of the 
necessary and useful improvements introduced in the aforesaid waterworks system 
from the time that defendant Authority took possession and adminis- tration 
thereof;</p>
<p>(3) Ordering the herein plaintiff Municipality of Compostela to pay to the 
herein defendant Authority the sum of P8,000.00, representing the value of the 
necessary and useful improvements that it has introduced in the waterworks 
system in question."</p></blockquote>
<p>Sometime in 1940, plaintiff herein, the Municipality of Compostela, Province 
of Cebu, secured a P30,000 loan from the National Markets and Waterworks Fund, 
for the construction of a waterworks system within said municipality, pursuant 
to Commonwealth Act No. 403. The construction was completed in December, 1940, 
and the system began to operate since January, 1941. As of the year 1953, the 
municipality had paid, on said pre-war loan, the sum of P8,889.29, as interest, 
and P192.10, as principal, thereby leaving a balance of P29,607.90, payment of 
which was later assumed by the National Government.</p>
<p>In March, 1956, the NAWASA, purporting to act pursuant to Republic Act No. 
1383, approved on June 18, 1955, assumed the administration, operation and 
maintenance of said waterworks system, without the consent of plaintiff, which 
instituted the present action on October 25, 1960, to recover the ownership, 
possession, operation, jurisdiction, supervision and control over the 
aforementioned system, with the result adverted to above. Hence, this appeal by 
the NAWASA.</p>
<p>Appellant maintains that the waterworks system in question belongs to the 
National Government, because funds thereof had been used in the construction of 
the system. Said funds had been lent, however, to the plaintiff, which thereby 
became the owner tiereof and, hence, of the system constructed therewith, 
subject to the corresponding obligation to pay the National Government. Surely, 
no such obligation would have existed had the system belonged, at the time of 
its construction, to the National Government. Although the municipality was, 
later, relieved of said obligation, this was due to its condonation by the 
National Government. Indeed, this condonation necessarily implied that the 
National Government was plaintiff's creditor, a legal relation which could not 
have possibly existed had the system belonged,since its establishment in 1940, 
to the National Government.</p>
<p>The alleged sufficiency of Republic Act No. 1383 to justify the action taken 
by the NAWASA has been overruled by this Court in City of Baguio vs. NAWASA (57 
Off. Gaz. 1584), City of Cebu vs. NAWASA, L-12892 (April 20, 1960), Naguilian 
vs. NAWASA, L-18540 (November 29, 1963), and La Carlota vs. NAWASA, L-20232 
(September 30, 1964), in which we held that the National Government can not 
appropriate patrimonial property of municipal corporations without just 
compensation and due process of law. As a consequence, neither may the National 
Government assume the power of administration of patrimonial property of 
municipal corporations, if such action is based upon the aforementioned 
appropriation of said property by the State, in fact, it may not, by operation 
of law, assume such administration, without appropriating the title to the 
property, if the same or the income derived from its operation will be comingled 
with or other property, either of the National Government/of other municipal 
corporations, in such a way as to permit the use of the property or income 
belonging to one of such corporations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] 
</sup>for the benefit of another municipal corporation or of the State 
itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p>
<p>Appellant, likewise, questions plaintiff's authority to fix and collect fees 
for the water supplied by its waterworks system, but such authority is clearly 
deducible from Sections 2317 and 2308(f) of the Revised Administrative Code, as 
well as from Section 2 of Republic Act No. 2264.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p>

affirmed, with costs against apellant NAWASA.</p>
