<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the
plaintiffs <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> Barcelona Justine <span class="SpellE">Curamen</span> and <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> <span class="SpellE">Curamen</span>, and against the defendants Juanita <span class="SpellE">Curitana</span> and her minor children namely <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span>,
Darwin, <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span> and <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span>,
all surnamed Rivera, directing the said defendants:</blockquote>

all the three parcels of land described in paragraph 2 of the complaint as
covered by Original Certifi­cates of Title Nos.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>P-594 and 6289 and/or all their rights and interests therein to the
plaintiffs upon payment by the plaintiffs of the sum of "4,000.00 together
with whatever amounts might have been paid by the defendants to the R.F.C., now
D.B.P., on account of the mortgage;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To execute the necessary
deed of re-conveyance and such other instruments to effect the said <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> within five days from receipt of the
aforementioned amounts from the plaintiffs; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To</span>
pay the plaintiffs P500.00 as attorney's fees, and to pay the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Curamen</span>
commenced the present action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> on <st1:date year="1957" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1957</st1:date> against the spouses
Ernesto Rivera and Juanita <span class="SpellE">Curitana</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon his death during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the case below, he was substituted as party plaintiff by his daughters <span class="SpellE">Justina</span> and <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not his widow was also made a
party is now in question.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Rivera also died on <st1:date year="1958" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1958</st1:date>, for which reason
his minor children <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span>, Darwin, <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span> and <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> were
substituted in his place, and because of their minority their mother was
appointed as their guardian ad <span class="SpellE">litem</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that pursuant to a free patent issued on <st1:date year="1950" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1950</st1:date>, original certificate
of title No. P-594 was issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">On the same date in the name of <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Curamen</span>, married to <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span>
Barcelona, covering lots 1 and 2, F-61908, both situated in <span class="SpellE">Pantabañgan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, containing an
area of 6.6775 hectares.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to a homestead title issued on <st1:date year="1938" day="1" month="11">November 1, 1938</st1:date> in the name of <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Curamen</span>, widower, over
another parcel of land with an area of 20.5278 hectares, situated in the same
municipality, original certificate of title <span class="GramE">No</span>. H-6289
was likewise issued on the same date in his name.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1950" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1950</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Curamen</span> spouses mortgaged the three parcels of
land abovementioned to the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation - hereinafter
referred to as the RFC - to secure payment of a 73,500.00 loan payable within
five years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deed of mortgage was
registered in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because the mortgagors failed to pay the amortizations due, the RFC
foreclosed the mortgage and the properties were sold at public auction on <st1:date year="1955" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1955</st1:date>, with the RFC as the
highest bidder. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The certificate and
final deed of sale executed in the latter's favor were registered on September
1, 1965, and, as a result, the original certificates of title covering the
mortgaged properties were cancelled and transfer certificates of title Nos.
NT-20845 and 20846 were issued in favor of the RFC.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also admitted that on April 1, 1955 the <span class="SpellE">Curamen</span>
spouses sold their right to repurchase the properties to the Rivera spouses for
the sum of P4,000.00), but under the condition that the latter would continue
to pay the mortgage obligation to the RFC - presumably for the purpose of re­purchasing
the properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection the
trial court found by admission made on the witness stand by Juanita <span class="SpellE">Curitana</span> - that she was still paying the mortgage debt to
the RFC up the time of the trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, the <span class="SpellE">Curamens</span> sought to
repurchase the properties their right to repurchase them by offering to the <span class="SpellE">Riveras</span> the sum of P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
together with whatever amounts the latter had already paid to the RFC on
account of the mortgage obligation, and demanded execution of the proper deed
of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because the <span class="SpellE">Riveras</span> ignored this demand, the <span class="GramE">present<span style="">&nbsp; </span>action</span> was
instituted.</p>

<p class="BODY">As reason for their refusal, the <span class="SpellE">Riveras</span>
relied, in part, upon a quit claim deed allegedly executed by Domingo Barcelona
on <st1:date year="1958" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1958</st1:date>,
whereby, for the total sum of P74<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, she ceded
and transferred to them her rights and interest in the properties in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His Honor, the trial judge, while not ruling
expressly that the deed was void, expressed doubts as to its authenticity or <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> by making the observation that the document
was only <span class="SpellE"><u>thumbmarked</u></span> by <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span>
Barcelona who was admittedly illiterate and about 75 years of age at the time
of its alleged execution in <span class="SpellE">Caranglan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, and appears to have
been acknowledged only on October 30, 1958 before a Notary Public in Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Juanita <span class="SpellE">Curitana</span> denied that
<span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Curamen</span> had ever
offered to repurchase said lands from her and her husband, and further claimed
that because in 1955 said lands were still uncultivated they had to spend
P1;500.00 for clearing, and P5,000.00 for irrigation canals.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the lower court, however, her testimony regarding
expenditures for the improvement of the properties, was "not worthy of
belief, because she was in no financial position to accumulate such cash for
such expenses", she being only a sari-sari store-owner with an operating
capital of P200 to P500 from 1948 to 1955.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court further observed that she never claimed that she and her
husband had tenants working for them, and had further admitted that she herself
had never gone to the lands in question before 1955.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing findings and conclusions of the trial court having
been affirmed by the Court of <span class="GramE">Appeals,</span> are now beyond
our power to review.</p>

<p class="BODY">We shall now, therefore limit ourselves to considering the main
questions raised by petitioner, namely, that the Court of Appeals erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in holding that <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span>
Barcelona is not one of the plaintiffs (below) in this case, as well as in
altogether disregarding the quit-claim deed executed by her; and finally, in
affirming <i>in <span class="SpellE">toto</span></i> the decision of the lower
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first two questions are interrelated, and the last depends,
more or less entirely upon their resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is some confusion in the record on the question of whether
or not <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> Barcelona was really made a party in
this case upon the death of her husband.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This matter, however, is not decisive of the merits of this appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is the quit-claim allegedly executed
by her, con­sidering our view regarding its legal effect upon the right of the
other respondents herein to repurchase the properties in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the law, every conveyance of land acquired under the free
patent or homestead provisions of existing laws shall be subject to repurchase
by the applicant, his widow or legal heirs, within five years from the date of
the conveyance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that the
original grantees, <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Curamen</span>
And his widow, had lost their right to repurchase the properties - in the case
of the first because of the sale of his right to repurchase made on April 1,
1955, and in that of the second because of the quit-claim already referred to -
it does not necessarily follow that their legal heirs had likewise lost their
right to repurchase or that they would be entitled to repurchase only their
share as heirs of their deceased father who died after instituting the present
case for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law clearly grants them the right to
repurchase the <u>property</u> covered by a free patent or a homestead title
within five years from the date of the conveyance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Speaking specifically of
the present case, that right is not limited to the repurchase of the share
corresponding to their father only, because the latter is already dead, but
refers to the repurchase of the property meaning the whole of it.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, in our opinion, is the only logical
meaning to be given to the law which because its purpose is to enable the
family of the applicant or grantee to keep their homestead (Lusted vs. <span class="SpellE">Piñol</span>, et al., C. R. L-10825, September 27, 1957) -must be
liberally construed in order to carry out that purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">The quit-claim executed by <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span>
Barcelona can not have the effect of depriving her children of their right to
repurchase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that it is valid,
it binds her alone.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record is not clear as to whether or not at the time the
appealed decision was rendered the defendants in that court had already
repurchased the properties from the RFC.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said decision, however, would seem to imply that they had done so
because its <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part orders said defendants
to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> to the plaintiffs all the three parcels
of land described, in the complaint and/or all their rights and interest
therein, under the conditions therein <span class="SpellE">setforth</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But if such is not the case, the proper
relief to be granted to the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Curamen</span> is to
require Juanita <span class="SpellE">Curitana</span> Rivera and her co-parties to
<span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> to the plaintiffs below the right to repurchase
the pro­perties from the RFC from whom they may proceed to re­purchase the
properties.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>MODIFIED AS ABOVE INDICATED,</b> the decision appealed from is
affirmed in all other respects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs.</span></p>
