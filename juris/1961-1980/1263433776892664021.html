of respondent Court of Appeals, promulgated on August 17, 1970, denying the
Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition filed therein by petitioner and
ordering the preliminary injunction theretofore issued dissolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, the Petition assails the Order
dated <st1:date year="1970" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1970</st1:date>, denying
petitioner's Motion to Quash, issued by respondent Hon. Vicente Santiago, Jr.,
then Presiding Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span> Branch.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner prays ultimately that Criminal Case No. U-1425, entitled
"People vs. <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Bermisa</span>"
be dismissed on the ground of infringement of his constitutional right to a
speedy trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">A review of the antecedent facts discloses that, on <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1963</st1:date>, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Bermisa</span> was charged
with the crime of Frustrated Murder before the Justice of the Peace (now
Municipal Court) of San Manuel, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> (Criminal
Case No. 797).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having waived his right
to enter into the second stage of the preliminary investigation, the Municipal
Court forwarded the case to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tayug</span> Branch (Criminal Case No. T-1062).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="26" month="11">November
 26, 1963</st1:date>, the corresponding Information was filed charging
petitioner with the same crime of Frustrated Murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After protracted proceedings, petitioner was
arraigned on <st1:date year="1964" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1964</st1:date>,
and he entered a plea of "not guilty".</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1965</st1:date>,
the Prosecuting Fiscal, instead of proceeding with the trial, moved for
provisional dismissal on the ground that the witnesses for the prosecution had
failed to appear despite notice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering that the case had been pending for almost two years, the
trial Court in its Order, dated June 2, 1965, "dismissed (it) provisionally
with the consent of the accused and his counsel, with costs de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span>".</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1969</st1:date>,
after a lapse of 4 years, 3 months and 8 days, respondent Assistant Provincial
Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Proculo</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Viernes</span>,
filed before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span> Branch, the second Information for Frustrated
Murder (Criminal Case No. U-1425), reproducing exactly the same allegations as
in the first Information.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 18, 1970, before entering his plea to the second
Information, petitioner, thru his counsel, moved to quash the same on the
ground that he had been denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial,
citing the ruling in <span class="SpellE">Conde</span> vs. Rivera, et al., (45
Phil. 650 [1924] and in <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span>,
et al. (64 Phil. 852 [1937], as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"This Court has held that there is a positive remedy in cases
where the constitutional right of the accused to have a speedy trial is
violated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused, who is deprived
of his fundamental right to have a speedy trial, is entitled to ask for his
release, if he is restrained of his liberty, or for the final dismissal of the
case pending against him."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">An opposition to the Motion to Quash was
filed by respondent Fiscal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1970</st1:date>,
the day set for petitioner's arraignment, respondent Judge denied the <span class="SpellE">quashal</span> in open Court and ordered the arraignment of the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over his objection, petitioner
entered his plea of not guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Trial
was set for <st1:date year="1970" day="22" month="4">April 22 to 24, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the same proceedings, counsel for the
petitioner manifested in open Court his intention to file a Motion for
Reconsideration, and, in fact, requested for three days within which to file
the same "because this case really affects the life and liberty of the
accused and the possibility of bringing the case to the Supreme Court is being
studied."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
To this, respondent Judge replied that the Motion for Reconsideration would be
denied because it had already taken the arguments of both sides into
consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the aforesaid Order of respondent Judge, petitioner,
alleging grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction and that
he had no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of
law, lodged a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition with Preliminary
Injunction before the Court of Appeals, docketed therein as CA-G.R. No.
45077-R, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Bermisa</span>
vs. Hon. Vicente M. Santiago, Jr., et al." The same was given due course
and a writ of Preliminary Injunction was issued upon the filing of the required
bond of P500.00 by the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1970</st1:date>,
respondent Court of Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
rendered its Decision dismissing the Petition and dissolving the Preliminary
Injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> judgment, which is
assailed for not being in conformity with law and established precedents, is
now the subject of this Petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
giving due course to the same, on September 11, 1970, this Court issued a
temporary Restraining Order enjoining respondent Court from executing its
Decision dated August 17, 1970, and restraining respondent Judge and Assistant
Provincial Fiscal from proceeding with Criminal Case No. U-1425, entitled
"People vs. <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Bermisa</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Three closely related errors have been assigned by petitioner,
namely, that respondent Court erred</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<blockquote>"IN REFUSING TO GRANT THE PETITION FOR <i>CERTIORARI</i> AND
PROHIBITION WITH PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, CA.G.R. NO. 45077, AND TO DISMISS
FINALLY CRIMINAL CASE NO. U-1425, ENTITLED PEOPLE VS. DOMINADOR BERMISA, FOR
FRUSTRATED MURDER NOTWITHSTANDING THE VALID REASONS STATED THEREFROM, THEREBY
SANCTIONING THE UNJUSTIFIED, SCANDALOUS AND LONG DELAY CAUSED BY INEXCUSABLE
FAILURE AND NEGLECT OF THE RESPONDENT ASSISTANT PROVINCIAL FISCAL TO REFILE THE
ALREADY DISMISSED CRIMINAL CASE NO. T-1062 IN TAYUG BRANCH WITHIN THE PERIOD OF
TIME IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULES, REGULAÂ­TIONS AND DECISIONS OF THIS HONORABLE
SUPREME COURT;</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<blockquote>"IN HOLDING THAT THE DOCTRINES LAID DOWN IN THE CASES OF CONDE
VS. RIVERA AND UNSON AND KALAW VS. APOSTOL, ET AL., (Supra) ARE NOT APPLICABLE
IN THE CASE AT BAR;</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<blockquote>"IN NOT DECLARING THE FINAL DISMISSAL OF CRIMINAL CASE NO.
U-1425 -- PEOPLE VS. DOMINADOR BERMISA PENDING IN THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE
OF PANGASINAN, URDANETA BRANCH."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The errors raised may be consolidated into the single question of
whether or not under the facts recounted, petitioner's constitutional right to
a speedy trial has been violated as to warrant the final dismissal of the
criminal charges against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our organic and criminal laws expressly guarantee that in all
criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to have a speedy
trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A speedy trial "is a trial
conducted according to the law of criminal procedure and the rules and
regulations, free from vexatious, capricious, and oppressive delays."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
It can be one which may be had as soon after indictment as the prosecution can
with reasonable diligence prepare for trial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And such a trial is denied an accused person where through the
vacillation and procrastination of prosecuting officers, the accused is forced
to wait many months or years for trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A review of the facts on record constrains us to rule that the
right to a speedy trial is not <span class="SpellE">invocable</span> in this
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The delay in the <span class="SpellE">refiling</span> of the case was not a delay in trial amounting to
a violation of a constitutional right.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was no trial to speak of, in the legal sense, as there was no
indictment, as yet.</p>

<blockquote>It has been held that the right to speedy trial cannot be violated
by delay between offense and indictment, though it can be violated by an
inordinate delay in the return of the indictment after the arrest has been
made.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>Where a statute requiring indictment or information within a
certain period after defendant is held to answer is treated as a legislative
definition of the constitutional right, the right arises when defendant is held
to answer by a magistrate, and the right has been held not violated by unwarranted
delay in bringing him before a magistrate following arrest.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The criminal case at bar was provisionally dismissed with the
consent of the accused and his counsel on <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering its nature, it was entered with a possibility of the filing
of a subsequent suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was <span class="SpellE">refiled</span> approximately four years thereafter, or on <st1:date year="1969" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1969</st1:date>, before another
Branch of the same Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <span class="SpellE">refiling</span> was an act within the prerogative of the prosecution.</p>

<blockquote>In the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary, there is
no reason why the court may not, in the interest of justice, dismiss a criminal
case provisionally, i.e., without prejudice to reinstating it before the order
becomes final or to the subsequent filing of a new information for the same
offense.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The right of an accused to a speedy trial is guaranteed to him by
the Constitution but the same shall not be utilized to deprive the State of a
reasonable opportunity of fairly indicting criminals.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
It secures rights to a defendant but it does not preclude the rights of public
justice.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, the consent of petitioner to the dismissal constituted a
waiver of his constitutional right not to be prosecuted for the same offense.</p>

<blockquote>xxx where a defendant expressly consents to or move for the
dismissal of the case against him, even if the court or judge states in the
order that the dismissal is definite or does not say that the dismissal is
without prejudice to the filing of another information, the dismissal will not
be a bar to a subsequent prosecution of the defendant for the same offense.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>The effect of a discharge (of a person committed on a criminal
charge in case of a failure to find an indictment or file an information within
a certain time) depends upon the particular statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under some statutes, the discharge does not
prevent another indictment for the same offense, since it is considered that
the effect of the discharge is merely to relieve the accused from imprisonment
or from being held to bail, and not to acquit him of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>xxx <span class="SpellE">xxx</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">If petitioner believed that the provisional dismissal deprived
him of the right to a speedy trial, then he should have objected to the same instead
of having given his consent thereto.</p>

<blockquote>If the accused should deem such conditional or provisional
dismissal to be unjust and prejudicial to him because he has been deprived of
his right to a speedy trial, as for instance where the case has dragged on for
an unreasonably long time without his fault, he could and should object to such
dismissal and insist that the case be heard and decided on the merits.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A contrary conclusion would run afoul of the provision on
prescription of crimes, which states:</p>

<blockquote>Art. 90.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prescription of
Crimes - Crimes punishable by death, reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>
or reclusion temporal shall prescribe in twenty years.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The crime of Frustrated Murder, with
which petitioner is charged, is punishable by <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u>-mayor</u>
in its maximum period to <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> in its medium
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the rule that when the
penalty fixed by law is a compound one, the highest penalty, or <u>reclusion
temporal</u>, for the computation of the prescriptive period shall be made the
basis (Art. 90, last paragraph of the Revised Penal Code), the crime prescribes
in twenty years.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">refiling</span> of the case on <st1:date year="1969" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1969</st1:date>, therefore, was
still well within the prescriptive period of twenty years, even considering the
interim period of approximately four years when prescription commenced to run
again from the date of provisional dismissal up to the <span class="SpellE">refiling</span>
of the criminal case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Withal, petitioner's prayer for the final dismissal on the ground
that he was denied the right to a speedy trial of the criminal case against him
finds no legal sanction nor doctrinal support.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant Petition is hereby denied for lack
of merit.</p>
