the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission denying the claim of
petitioner, Dolores A. <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span>, for compensation
benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Act against respondent Republic of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(Bureau of Public Schools).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner was a public school teacher who retired at the age of
61 years for physical disability which she contracted in 1968 while in the
continuous service of the respondent Republic (Bureau of Public Schools) from
1946 up to <st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was employed in 1946 as a public school
teacher by the respondent Republic (Bureau of Public Schools) and assigned to
teach in several far-flung barrios in <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span> and
later in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> where she stopped working on <st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her ailment was diagnosed as "Essential
Vascular Hypertension, chronic, severe; Osteoarthritis, chronic, left hip and
Tuberculosis." In 1969, petitioner underwent medical treatment but to no
avail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since then she has been suffering
from a dislocation of her hip joints making it difficult for her to walk, and
constraining her to apply for periodic leaves.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The records show that she has been under treatment by her family doctor
from <st1:date year="1970" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1970</st1:date> up
to March 1975.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1975</st1:date>,
the last day for filing compensation claims occurring prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the New Labor Code, she filed a claim for
compensation benefits against the respondent Republic (Bureau of Public
Schools).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:placename>Respondent</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Republic</st1:placetype></st1:place> did not controvert the
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, it passed
upon and reviewed the claim and through its Division Committee on Evaluation
favorably recommended payment of compensation benefits to the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Based on said recommendation, the Acting
Referee of the Workmen's Compensation Section, Regional Office No. 5, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
rendered a decision on <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="11">November 25,
 1975</st1:date> awarding compensation benefits in favor of petitioner, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered judgment is rendered in favor
of the claimant, ordering the Bureau of Public Schools:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To pay claimant, Dolores <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span>,
thru his Office, the sum of ONE THOUSAND NINETY THREE PESOS AND EIGHTY CENTAVOS
(P1,093.80), as disability compensation benefits, and thereafter, effective
November 23, 1975, to a weekly compensation of P53.17 until such time that she
shall have been cured, provided, however, the amount of compensation in its
entirely shall not exceed P6,000.00;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To pay claimant the amount of SEVEN HUNDRED
FIFTY FOUR PESOS (P754.00), as reimbursement of medical expenses pursuant to
Section 13 of the Act; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To pay this Office, the sum of ELEVEN PESOS
(P11.00) as fees pursuant to Section 44 of the Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">From said decision, respondent Republic
appealed to the Workmen's Compensation Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1976</st1:date>,
the respondent Commission set aside the decision of the Acting Referee and
dismissed the claim of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
dismissing the claim, the respondent Commission ruled that the decision of the
Acting Referee is null and void because he has no more jurisdiction to
entertain said claim inasmuch as the claimed disability occurred after January
1, 1975 and that jurisdiction over claims for compensation benefits starting
said date is vested either in the Government Service Insurance System or in the
Employees Compensation Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">We reverse the respondent Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A review of the records reveal that the
petitioner has been suffering from her illness since 1968 which after
consultation with a physician, was found to be Rheumatic Arthritis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="27" month="9">September
 27, 1974</st1:date>, she was treated by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Cristopher</span>
R. <span class="SpellE">Villarala</span>, Sr. who also found her to be suffering
from Essential Vascular Hypertension, chronic, severe; Osteoarthritis, chronic,
left hip and Tuberculosis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
treatment of her ailment she spent P874.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the Division Committee on Evaluation composed of Juan R. <span class="SpellE">Belica</span>, General Education Supervisor, Chairman; and
Norberto T. <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, Administrative Officer, and <span class="SpellE">Gertrudes</span> Reyes, as members, assessed favorably
petitioner's illness, the committee recommended payment of the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she was examined by the Compensation
Rating Medical Officer, the latter affirmed the previous findings on the
claimant's illness and rated her disability at 25% loss of the use of her left
leg.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner applied for sick leaves
several times, particularly in the year 1974 until 1975.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus evident that the illness of
petitioner occurred during the course of her employment long before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the New Labor Code and therefore
petitioner's claim still falls within the coverage of the Workmen's
Compensation Act in so far as the issue of compensability of her claim is
concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner then can invoke
the presumption mandated by Section 44 of the Workmen's Compensation Act that
her illness either arose out of, or at least aggravated by her employment and
that the burden to overthrow the presumption and to disconnect, by substantial
evidence the injury or sickness from employment, is laid by the statute at the
door of the employer<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and there is no more need for the claimant to carry the burden of proof, to
establish her case to the point of demonstration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is enough to show that the hypothesis on
which she bases her claim is probable.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The claimant is relieved from the burden of proving causation once the illness
or injury is shown to have arisen in the course of employment.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The claim of respondent Republic that the Workmen's Compensation
Commission has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case because the
claimed disability occurred after <st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="1">January
 1, 1975</st1:date> cannot be sustained, because it is not correct for
respondent Republic to say that the claimed disability occurred after <st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is undisputed that the illness of
petitioner started as early as 1968; that she has been under medical treatment
in 1969; hospitalized in 1970 and thereafter periodically until <st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere fact that jurisdiction over
compensation cases has been transferred from WCC to the Employees Commission
cannot throw out the claim of petitioner because there is in the New Labor Code
(P.D. 442) as amended by <span class="SpellE">P.D.'s</span> 570-A, 626 and 643 a
provision which states:</p>

<blockquote>“Workmen's compensation claims accruing prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of this Code and during the period from <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="11">November 1, 1974</st1:date> up to <st1:date year="1974" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1974</st1:date> shall be filed
with the appropriate regional office of the Department of Labor not later than <st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1975</st1:date>; otherwise they shall
be forever barred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In the case before Us, the cause of
action of petitioner arose from the moment she contracted her illness in 1968,
and continued to run from said date up to <st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1975</st1:date> when she was hospitalized in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Veterans</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Memorial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she filed therefore her present claim
for compensation benefits with Regional Office No. 5, within the period allowed
by the New Labor Code (P.D. 442), as amended by <span class="SpellE">P.D.'s</span>
570-A, 626 and 643, that is up to March 31, 1975, she was well within the
coverage of the transitory provision <span class="SpellE">abovequoted</span>
because said provision allowed the <u>filing of claims with the appropriate
regional office</u> of the Department of Labor not later than March 31,
1975.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True it is, that the Workmen's
Compensation has been abolished by the New Labor Code and in lieu thereof the
GSIS and Employees Compensation Commission were vested with the authority to
decide the claim of government employees or private employees as the case may
be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the claim of petitioner was
filed with the Regional Office No. 5 instead of the GSIS, it does not follow
that the claim cannot be entertained anymore.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The filing of the claim with the said office that has no authority to
act on it can be treated as having been filed with the appropriate agency as
long as it is filed within the period allowed by law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the judgment of the respondent
Commission is hereby reversed and set aside and that of the Acting Referee of
the Workmen's Compensation Section, Regional Office No.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>5 reinstated and revived with the
modification that respondent Bureau of Public Schools should also reimburse
petitioner for her medical and hospital expenses properly receipted for until
her full recovery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without pronouncement
as to costs.</p>
