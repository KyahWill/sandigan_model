of petitioner to his position as clerk expediter with respondent Government Ser­vice
Insurance System.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The record discloses that had petitioner and his counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Antonino</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, dealt with
the Court with truth and candor, instead of concealing the true facts and
misleading the Court, the petition would not have been given due course at the
time of its filing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, in this verified petition, represented to the Court
that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- he is a civil service eligible
employed as a clerk expediter in respondent GSIS since 1951; in July, 1960, the
GSIS filed administrative charges against him for "misconduct or
dishonesty" and suspended him from his office since then; on August 23,
1960, prior to the expiration of the 60-day period of preventive suspension, the
GSIS forewent the administrative charges against him and "in lieu thereof,
it elected to file in the City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office in
Manila a criminal complaint (I.S. No. 60-25705) for the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> thru falsification of commercial and public
documents"; on July 17, 1961, the corresponding information<span style="">&nbsp; </span>was filed against him before the Court of
First Instance of Manila;<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
on July 28, 1962, the Court of First Instance of Ma­nila dismissed the
information against the petitioner, upon mo­tion of the fiscal, that upon reinvestigation
it was found that <span style="">“he </span>is not in
any way connected with the said case,"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
but the said Court denied his motion for reinstatement with back pay;<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
he then requested the GSIS for reinstatement but the latter refused, alleging
the existence of another criminal case for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
against him before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bul­acan</span>;
this second criminal case was dismissed upon petition of the fiscal by the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> on February 5,
1963, which further directed in its Order that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x
</span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> As prayed for by
the defense counsel <span style="">without objection
on the part of the Assistant Provincial Fiscal, the immediate reinstatement of

<p class="BODY">Petitioner then wrote the GSIS per his letter of February 6,
1963, notifying it of the dismissal of said criminal charge of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> by the <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> Court, and
requesting, for his immediate reinstatement, which request was reiterated in
another letter of <span style="">February 12, 1963;</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and despite the lapse of more than 30</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">days </span><span style="">since then, the
GSIS refused to reinstate him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner averred;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"That the continuous suspension of the peti­tioner is, under
the circumstances, equivalent to a separation from the service and petitioner has
been deprived and/ or excluded of his right to due process of law as he
(petitioner) was not given an opportunity to defend himself or through counsel,
hence, his separation is therefore unlawful;"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent GSIS, in its documented Answer, showed that
petitioner's allegations were far from true; and that far from being
"under continuous suspension" since July, 1960, petitioner had been
found guilty in the administrative charges against him <span style="">and </span>separated from the service effective from the date of his suspen<span style="">sion, after due hearing where he testified on his own behalf and was
duly represented by another counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Dakila</span>
Castro; and that petitioner had been advised several times of his separation
from the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the records
submitted by the GSIS, which have not been disputed by petitioner but on the
contrary were admitted by him in his Reply and Memorandum, as shown
hereinafter, disclose the following facts:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

GSIS, far from foregoing the administrative charges against petitioner and
electing to prosecute him crimi­nally in Manila, as claimed by petitioner,
formally proceeded with said charges before its 3-member Special Board of
Inquiry, the GSIS body created to investigate administrative cases in the
System, which formally heard the case, and petitioner testified on his own
behalf and was represented by his counsel during the proceedings;<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>“After a careful scrutiny of the evidence presented by both the
prosecution and the defense and taking note of the contents of the memorandum
for respondent as submitted by his counsel, the Special Board of Inquiry
deduced the following points which are clearly shown by the facts and the
evidence:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that both the prosecution
and the def­ense have no dispute as to the fact that the check in question
(Exhibit "A”) was taken out of the room of the Life Insurance Claims
Division, Office, in the afternoon of July 6, 1060, and subsequently <span class="SpellE">encashed</span> by fraudulent means; (2) That the said check was
taken unnoticed from the same division <span style="">by an employee <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> and passed it over to only one person who is an
outsider; and (3) That this person to whom it was passed is Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Buzon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only
question in issue is, 'Who bet­ween Messrs. <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>
Cruz, the respondent herein, and Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Ledda</span>, was
the employee who took the check?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was it
the respondent or Mr. <span class="SpellE">Ledda</span>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the words of the very person who
received the check himself, Mr. Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Buzon</span>,
respondent was the one who passed the said check to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony is direct and positive, not
vague and circumstantial."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Said board, therefore, made the following recommenda­tion and
decision:</p>

<blockquote>"Premises considered and as shown
by the facts and the evidence, the Special Board of Inquiry finds respondent
guilty of the administrative offenses of (1) DISHONESTY, and (2) ACTS
PREJUDICIAL TO THE BEST INTEREST OF THE SERVICE, and recommends that he be
considered resigned from the service <span style="">with
</span>prejudice to his reinstatement in the GSIS, effective as of the date of
his preventive suspension."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The GSIS Board of Trustees, per its resolution No. 956 approved
on March 15, 1961, acting pursuant to said findings of its Special Board of
Inquiry and the recommendation of Board Trustee del Rosario (to whom the Board
had previously referred the matter) and who noted that petitioner,
“participated in the illegal handling and cashing of checks, intercepting their
deli­very to the prejudice of the payees", resolved "to approve that
Mr. <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> Cruz be considered resigned from the
service with prejudice to his reinstatement in the GSIS, effective as of the
date of his preventive suspension." Petitioner was advised of his
separation per letters to him dated <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="3">March
 17, 1961</st1:date>, sent by registered mail and <st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1961</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to petitioner's
claims, the subject matter of the administrative case and the criminal case in
Manila against him consisted of two different GSIS checks in favor of two
distinct payees lost and fraudulently <span class="SpellE">encashed</span>, and
therefore had no relation to each other;<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
similarly, the criminal case against <span style="">petitioner in <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> was
an <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> charge filed <span style="">by certain <span class="SpellE">Bula­can</span> residents and had no
relation to the administrative case.</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">After the dismissal in July, 1962 of <span style="">the criminal case in Manila, the GSIS refused his request for
reinstatement, not on the ground </span>of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the other criminal case in <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, (as alleged by
petitioner) but because he had already been separated from the service for
cause since March, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
letter-reply of Ramon A. Diaz dated </span><st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="10"><span style="">October

Amendatory Order of February 13, 1963, upon the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span>
motion, had ordered the deletion of that portion as to petitioner's reinstate­ment,
since this obviously was the prerogative of the Department head concerned and
beyond said Court's authority.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, in his Reply to Answer, as well as in his Memorandum
now admit that indeed that he had been duly heard in the administrative case
and that the GSIS Board of Trustees had "adopted the initial decision of
the Special Board of Inquiry and dismissed the petitioner from the
service."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In his Reply, petitioner, through counsel, had earlier contended
that the GSIS Board of Trustees' approval of the recommendation "that
petitioner be considered resigned effective as of July 27, 1960 is ineffectual
because petitioner has <span style="">not </span>resigned
from his position in the respondent corporation"<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> - </span>a patently erroneous and frivolous
non-argument, since the penalty of "considered resigned" is but a
form of imposing dismissal or separation from the service.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find, therefore, no basis for the petition in the facts and in
the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner has not been
unlawfully exclud­ed from the position claimed by him, but has in fact been
legally separated <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> for cause effective <span style="">from the </span>date of his preventive
suspension on July 26, 1960 after due hearing where he appeared and was duly
represented by counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent owed
him no duty of reinstatement, enforceable by the writ of mandamus.</p>

<p class="BODY">A final note of advertence is required in view of the above
recital of the facts of record which show that petitioner and counsel
nevertheless filed on May 15, 1963, the verified petition at bar, suppressing
the fact <span style="">of his separation from the
service </span>of <span style="">the </span>GSIS after
due hearing, and alleging instead that he had been under "continuous
suspension' since July 1960, and that he had not been given an opportunity to
defend himself or through counsel -- allegations obviously made to give a
delusive semblance of plausibility to the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The admonition of the Court, speaking through
Justice Fernando, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Batangas</u></span><u> Laguna <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Bus Co. v.

<blockquote>"This is all then that this petition presents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly it should be dismissed for it is
bereft of any support in law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A word
more however is required in view of the <span class="SpellE">conspicious</span>
failure of petition<span style="">er's counsel to exhibit the candor required of an officer of the
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition, as shown in the
motion to dismiss and in the course of the oral argument, left out many facts
within the knowledge of the petitioner with the evident purpose of impart­ing a
semblance of plausibility to a petition other­wise clearly lacking merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While counsel is expect­ed to exhibit the
utmost zeal on behalf of a client, it is likewise imperative if the rule of law
were to be truly meaningful that the orders of this Court be based on a full and
candid disclosure of relevant matters, so that whatever action may thereafter
be taken be warranted by the events as they did transpire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Members of the Bar would then be remiss in
their duty towards a court of justice if in their un­doubtedly earnest effort
to serve their client's cause, there is, as in this case, a failure to live up
to their exacting responsibility to exert the utmost diligence that their
pleadings submitted reflect the facts with truth and accuracy."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
