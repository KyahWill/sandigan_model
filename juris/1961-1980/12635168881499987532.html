<p class="BODY">On the morning of November 12, 1962 in <span class="SpellE">Aringay</span>,
La Union, a joint team of Philippine Constabulary and local police apprehended
two trucks loaded with 666 cases of assorted untaxed "blue seal"
cigarettes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date the <span style="">two </span>trucks were impounded in the PC
compound under the custody of the Provincial Commander while the Provincial
Fiscal filed <span class="GramE">an information</span> in the Court of First
Instance of La Union against the drivers for violation of the Tariff and Customs
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 19, 1962 the Collector
of Customs issued a Customs Warrant of Seizure and Detention to the Provincial
Commander with instruction to detain, hold and/or keep the said trucks in
custody and instituted <span style="">Seizure-Forfeiture
Proceedings Identification No. </span><span style="">28/62
</span><span style="">pur­suant to Section 2530,
paragraphs (f) and (k), of the Tariff and Customs Code, which provide as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Any vessel or aircraft, cargo, articles and other objects
shall, under the following conditions, be subject to forfeiture:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1962</st1:date>,
during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of Seizure-Forfeiture Proceedings
Identification No. 28/62, the plain­tiffs, claiming to be the owners of one of
the trucks (identified in the complaint) filed a suit in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>,
with a prayer for damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Collector
of Customs, however, was not included as party-defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style=""> </span>ordered the
release of the truck to the plaintiffs upon a bond of P10<span class="GramE">,000</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="12" month="12"><span style="">December
 12, 1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> the
Collector of Customs, thru the Office of the Solicitor General, filed an urgent
motion to intervene, with the answer in intervention attached thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was granted and the answer
admitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Collector of Customs
prayed for the dismissal of the complaint for lack of jurisdiction and failure
to state a cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Provincial Commander, likewise thru the Office of the Solicitor General, filed
an answer adopting that of the Collector of Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon motion of the defendant and the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>, a preliminary hearing was held on the
affirmative defense of lack of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On </span><st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="6"><span style="">June 28, 1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">issued an order the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Wherefore, the above-entitled case <span style="">is </span>hereby ordered DISMISSED, for lack
of jurisdiction, without special pronouncement as to costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Consequently, the order for the seizure of personal property issued
by this Court is hereby set aside, and since no return of the service thereof
has been submitted to the Court it <span style="">is </span>hereby ordered recalled and counsel for
the plaintiffs given a period of ten (10) days from receipt hereof within which
to return the same to the Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Both parties moved to reconsider.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Solicitor General's motion was limited to the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the order "so as to include therein a directive that the
plaintiffs should forthwith return to the Collector of Customs for <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city> the truck subject matter of the complaint to
be dealt with under the Tariff and Customs Code." In an order dated <st1:date year="1963" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1963</st1:date>, the trial court
granted the Solicitor General's motion and denied that of the plaintiffs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeals, which
subsequently certified the case to us, the only issue being whether or not the
court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span>has jurisdiction over the
subject-matter of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue presented is not one of first impression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Averia</span>, L-22526, <st1:date year="1966" day="29" month="11"><span class="GramE">November</span> 29, 1966</st1:date> and in De <span class="SpellE">Joya</span>,
et al., vs. David, et al., L-23504, <st1:date year="1967" day="29" month="12">December
 29, 1967</st1:date>, we said:</p>

<blockquote>"At issue is the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> to entertain Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">TM-114, and the existence of therein plaintiff's cause of action.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> This original jurisdiction of the Court of First
Instance, when exercised in an action for recovery of personal property which
is a subject of a forfeiture proceeding in the Bureau of Customs, tends to
encroach upon, and to render futile, the jurisdiction of the Collector of
Customs in seizure and forfeiture proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Should Section 44(c) of the Judiciary Act of <span style="">1948 </span>give way to the provisions of the
Tariff and Customs Code, or vice versa?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In our opinion, <span style="">in </span>this particular case, the Court of First Instance should yield
to the jurisdiction of the Collector of Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jurisdiction of the Collector of Customs
is provided for in Republic Act <span style="">1937 </span>which
took effect on <st1:date year="1957" day="1" month="7">July 1, <span style="">1957</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>much later than the Judiciary Act of
1948.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is axiomatic that a later law
prevails over a prior statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
on grounds of public policy, it is more reasonable to conclude that the
legislators intended to divest the Court of First Instance of the prerogative
to <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> a property which is a subject of a
seizure and forfeiture proceedings for violation of the Tariff and Customs
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, actions for forfeiture
or property for violation of Customs laws could easily be undermined by the
simple device of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Furthermore Section 2303 of the Tariff and Customs Code
requires the Collector of Customs to give to the owner of the property sought
to be forfeited, written notice of the seizure and to give him the opportunity
to be heard in his defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
provision clearly indicates the intention of the law to confine in the Bureau of
Customs the determination of all questions affecting the disposal of property
proceeded against in a seizure and forfeiture case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judicial recourse of the property owner
is not in the Court of First Instance but in the Court of Tax Appeals, and only
after exhausting administrative remedies in the Bureau of Customs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">App</span>ellants
argue that the truck in question could not be the subject of seizure,
confiscation or forfeiture in the absence of any evidence showing that the
cigarettes loaded therein had been imported illegally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This argument is gratuitous and begs the
question at issue before the Collector of Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prima facie, at least, the cigarettes that
were loaded on the truck in question when it was apprehended, being of the
"blue seal" or untaxed category, had been imported illegally; and it
was before the Collector of Customs in the seizure-forfeiture proceeding he had
instituted that evidence to the contrary should be adduced by the
plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as may be gathered from
the pleadings, that administrative proceeding had been set for hear­ing twice
with due notice to the parties, but no actual hearing had yet been conducted
when the instant case was instituted in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style="">. </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The law grants the Collector of Customs
sufficient latitude in determining whether or not a certain article is subject
to seizure or forfeiture (Sec. 2530, pars. (f) <span class="GramE">and</span>
(k), Tariff and Customs Code of 1957, supra); and his decision on the matter is
<span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the Commissioner of Customs and then to
the Court of Tax Appeals, not to the Court of First Instance.</p>
