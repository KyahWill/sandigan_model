				<H3>LU DO & LU YM CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. PHILIPPINE LAND-AIR-SEA LABOR UNION (PLASLU) AND THE PROGRESSIVE EMPLOYEES AND LABORERS UNION (PELU), RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>REGALA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This is an appeal from the resolution dated March 2, 1961 of the Court of 
Industrial Relations, ordering Lu Do &amp; Lu Yin Corp. to pay P8,413.93 to its 
employees as additional compensation for services rendered by them on Sundays 
and legal holidays. </p>
<p>The antecedents of this case are: </p>
<p>In a decision dated March 12, 1953, the Court of Industrial Relations 
rendered judgment for the Philippine Land-Air-Sea Labor Union (PLASLU), by 
ordering Lu Do &amp; Lu Ym Corp. to pay the employees concerned extra 
compensation computed at the rate of 25 per cent of their daily wages for work 
done on Sundays and legal holidays. </p>
<p>Thereafter, the court directed its examiner to compute "the money value of 
all rights and privileges due the employees and laborers of the respondent (Lu 
Do &amp; LuYm Corp.) in accordance with the decision of this Court xxx and to 
submit his report to the Court." </p>
<p>On April 8, 1954, the examiner rendered a report. According to him, the 
company claimed that it had paid its employees the equivalent of eight hours 
work on Sundays and legal holidays during the period in question even if the 
employees worked for just six hours, the implication being that the company did 
not feel bound to pay more because the employees had been paid more than the 
differentials ordered by the Court. The examiner said that there was no means by 
which to check the correctness of the company's claim inasmuch as the time cards 
were missing. There was nothing in the payrolls, which were the only records 
available, to indicate the time spent by the employees in working. All that was 
written in them opposite the names of the employees were the symbols "x" for 
those present, and "o" for those who were absent. The examiner added, however, 
that an alleged leader of the PLASLU substantiated the claim of the company. 
</p>
<p>In his second report dated December 3, 1954, the court examiner stated that 
after computing the extra pay of the employees, he found that the amount 
totalled P8,413.93.The company vigorously assailed this report and insisted that 
it had paid its employees the equivalent of eight hours work although they 
actually put in only six hours of work on Sundays and legal holidays. </p>
<p>In the meantime, 111 members quitted from the PLASLU, formed a new union — 
the Progressive Employees and laborers Union (PELU) — and sought intervention in 
the case. The court allowed the intervention and thereafter heard the opposition 
of the company against the examiner's report. </p>
<p>On November 19, 1956, the court, thru Judge Arsenio I. Martinez, sustained 
the company's opposition and disapproved the report of the examiner. In his 
decision, Judge Martinez stated: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the hearing of this opposition, respondent (Lu Do &amp; Lu Ym Corp.) 
presented <em>twenty</em> (20) <em>witnesses and all of them were positive, firm 
and uniform in their testimonies that they only worked for 6 hours during 
Sundays and legal holidays and they were paid equivalent to 8 hours work</em>. 
The time keeper who was with the respondent company since 1948 up to 1955 
testified that they only worked for 6 hours during Sundays and legal holidays 
and on the payroll he marked ("X") for those who had actually worked but in the 
computation of their payments it was computed on the basis of 8 hours work. </p>
<p>"The Progressive Employees and Laborers Union(PELU) movant-intervenor 
presented and introduced only three witnesses but their declarations were 
contradictory and conflicting.</p>
<p>"For the petitioner (Philippine Land-Air-Sea Labor Union) only Felipe Terso, 
Court Examiner who declared that in his computations he considered the mark "X" 
during Sundays and legal holidays as work corresponding to eight hours because 
there was no evidence shown to him by the respondent company, that the same 
corresponds to six hours. This view as declared by the petitioner thru the 
testimonies of the Court Examiner, cannot be sustained considering the unanimity 
of the respondents' witnesses who were coherent, uniform and definite in their 
declarations that they only worked for 6hours during those days yet they were 
paid equivalent to 8 hours work.</p>
<p>"All things considered, it is the feeling of this Court that the workers of 
the respondent company involved in this case only worked for six (6)hours during 
Sundays and legal holidays instead of8 hours as computed by the aforementioned 
Examiner.</p>
<p>"WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the report of Felipe Terso, Chief of 
Examiner dated December 3, 1954, on the matter of the money value of the 25% 
additional compensation in the amount of P8,413.93, should be, as it is hereby 
disapproved."(Underlining supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>On December 7, 1956, PELU moved for a reconsideration of this decision, but 
its motion was dismissed by the Court of Industrial Relations, sitting <i>en banc</i>, 
on the ground that it was not filed "in accordance with the rules of this 
Court." </p>
<p>Obviously, the rule referred to was Section 15 of the Rules of the Court of 
Industrial Relations which requires that a motion for reconsideration must be 
verified as to the correctness of the allegations of fact. That is why on 
December 20, 1956 PELU submitted the affidavit of its president and asked for a 
reconsideration of the dismissal of its appeal. </p>
<p>No action appears to have been taken on the motion for reconsideration. On 
March 2, 1961, however, the Court of Industrial Relations <i>en banc</i> reversed the 
decision of judge Martinez and ordered the company to pay the sum of P8,413.93. 
The resolution was prepared by Judge Arsenio I. Martinez himself, with judges 
Villanueva and Bugayong concurring and Presiding Judge Jose s. Bautista 
abstaining. </p>
<p>In reversing the trial court's decision, the Court of Industrial Relations in 
bane stated: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The company agreed that an ‘X’ mark appearing in its payrolls represents 8 
hours in the case of the 26 guards whose total claim for 25% additional 
compensation for work done on Sundays and legal holidays amounts to P2,124.33. 
The company did not object to the report of examiner about the guards' unpaid 
additional compensation for Sunday and holiday work.</p>
<p>"The company objects to the computation of the amount of P8,413.93 as 25% 
additional compensation for work done on Sunday and legal holidays for the 
period June, 1952 to August 13, 1954 in the case of more than 250 employees and 
laborers other than the guards, on the ground that these employees did not 
render 8 hours service on Sun-days and legal holidays but only 6 hours during 
those days.</p>
<p>"The company presented some 25 employees who testified that they worked only 
6 hours during Sundays and legal holidays. These employees represent about 1/12 
of the more than 250 employees whose names appear in Appendix "2".</p>
<p>"It is doubted if these employees could still remember the number of hours 
rendered by them on Sundays and legal holidays as far back as the years 1952, 
1953, and 1954. At best, their testimony was the result of pure guess work and 
could not be relied upon. x x x</p>
<p>"The report of the examiner was based from the official payrolls of the 
respondent which were kept in the ordinary course of business. The computation 
of the amount of P8,413.93 re-presenting the 25% additional compensation for 
work done on Sundays and legal holidays for the period June, 1952 to August 13, 
1954, was based on the principles (1) that an ("X") mark appearing on the 
payrolls of the company should be considered as a full day is work of eight (8) 
hours for all employees and laborers for all days of the week and (2) that a 
uniform practice of not paying the 25% additional compensation for work done on 
Sundays and legal holidays by all its workers was consistently followed by the 
respondent company. If it is true that an ("X") mark in the company's payrolls 
on Sundays and legal holidays represents work of only 6 hours, why did not the 
respondent indicate clearly the number 6 in their payrolls? The company was 
notable to produce the time books or the time cards which are the best evidence 
and most convincing proofs of the employees' hours of service, the reason being 
that they were destroyed by typhoons. Business and accounting records should be 
properly kept to avoid different interpretations and misleading inferences in 
the future. When the company admitted the examiners' computation of the overtime 
in the amount of P643.61 (Appendix "1" Report of Examiner dated April 8, 1954) 
as correct, it also approved as correct the basis of timing — an (X) mark to 
mean 8 hours. As stated elsewhere in this Resolution, the computation of the 
overtime and the Sunday and legal holiday differentials was based on only one 
timing and the same number of hours on a given Sunday. If the overtime 
computation submitted by the Court examiners is correct, the timing of 8 hours 
for an (X) mark on Sundays and legal holidays must per-force be correct, because 
that was the basis of the examiner's computation. If the timing of 8 hoursfor an 
(X) mark in the payrolls of the respondent is correct, it must follow that the 
computation of 25% additional compensation for work done on Sundays and legal 
holidays is, no doubt, correct. It could never happen that the overtime 
differential is correctly stated while the Sunday and holiday differential is 
erroneously computed. The two differentials must either be both correct or both 
wrong because they were determined from one base timing and the same number of 
hours rendered." </p></blockquote>
<p>From this resolution, the company appealed, contending that –</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. The Court of Industrial Relations erred in giving more weight to the 
second report of an examiner of the aforesaid court which contradicts his first 
report than to the firm, affirmative and uniform testimonies of twenty (20) 
witnesses who are among the laborers involved in the said reports ;</p>
<p>"2. The Court of Industrial Relations erred in basing its resolution dated 
March 2, 1961 up-on the opinion of an examiner of the aforesaid court which is 
completely contradictory to the evidence presented by Lu Do &amp; Lu Ym 
Corporation consisting of the positive, firm and uniform testimonies of twenty 
witnesses for said corporation which was the respondent in Case No. 652-V and 
now the petitioner in these proceedings;</p>
<p>"3. The Court of Industrial Relations erred in entertaining a motion for 
reconsideration which was already dismissed under a prior and final resolution 
on the ground that said motion was not in accordance with the rules of the 
aforesaid court." </p></blockquote>
<p>With respect to the first two assignments of error, the only question is 
whether the employees worked for eight hours on Sundays and legal holidays 
during the period in question, as the Court of Industrial Relations found, or, 
whether they worked for six hours only but were paid the equivalent of eight 
hours work, as the company contends. Incidentally, the inquiry turns on the 
meaning of "X", as found opposite the names of employees in the payrolls of the 
company. </p>
<p>As Judge Martinez stated in his decision of November 19, 1956, twenty 
witnesses for the company testified that although they worked for only six hours 
on the days in question, the company actually paid them the equivalent of eight 
hours work. This means that they were more than paid their Sunday and holiday 
differentials. The testimony of these witnesses, which the trial judge described 
as “positive”, firm and uniform," was substantiated by the company's timekeeper 
who said that he credited the 250employees with eight hours work by placing an 
"x" mark opposite their names although in reality these employees put in only 
six hours of work. </p>
<p>The trial judge held that as against this evidence for the company, the 
testimony of the three witnesses for the PELU and the PLASLU, which he called 
"contradictory and conflicting," and that of the court examiner who said he 
considered "x" as meaning eight hours work in the absence of anything to 
indicate the contrary, could not prevail. </p>
<p>However, when the case came up for review before the Court of Industrial 
Relations, <em>en banc</em>, Judge Martinez reversed his decision as trial judge 
on the ground that if "x" meant eight hours work with respect to the guards of 
the company, there was no reason why the same mark should not mean the same 
thing with regard to 250 other employees. In so doing, he disregarded the 
testimony of witnesses for the company —testimony which he had earlier 
characterized as "positive, firm and uniform." </p>
<p>To be sure, the findings of the Court of Industrial Relations on the weight 
of evidence are conclusive, but its findings unsupported by substantial or 
credible proof are not binding on the reviewing court. (See The Superintendent 
of the La Loma Catholic Cemetery vs. CIR, et al., G. R. No. 13365, July 31, 
1963) </p>
<p>On this score, this Court reversed a finding of the Court of Industrial 
Relations that no violence was committed by a union in a certain case, despite 
testimony to that effect, simply because "no incident of whatever nature had 
been reported to the police." It held that the mere circumstance that the police 
was not called in had no ration-al probative force to discredit the testimony of 
other-wise credible witnesses, testimony which had all the ring of truth. (Union 
of the Phil. Edu. Emp. v. Phil. Edu. Co. 91 Phil. 93) </p>
<p>Here, the mere fact that "x" was admitted by the company to mean eight hours 
work in the case of the guards does not justify the inference that it must also 
mean the same thing with respect to the other classes of employees such as the 
250 other employees of the company. The mere fact that the mark was admitted as 
standing for eight hours work for purposes of overtime compensation does not 
justify the inference that it must also mean the same number of hours for 
purposes of Sunday and legal holiday differentials. This fact alone is not 
strong enough to overcome the probative force of the testimony of witnesses for 
the company who declared that although they worked for only six hours on Sundays 
and legal holidays during the period in question, they were actually paid the 
equivalent of eight hours work. To repeat, the testimony of these witnesses is, 
in the language of the trial judge, "positive, firm and uniform, compared to the 
"contradictory and conflicting" testimony of the witnesses for the union. If 
their testimony is indeed positive, then it is stronger than the negative 
statement of the court examiner, one of the witnesses for the unions, who said 
he took "x" to mean eight hours because he found no evidence that the mark 
stands for six hours. Affirmative testimony is stronger than negative testimony. 
(6 Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, 146-147 [1963]) </p>
<p>Finally, there is no merit in the belated observation of the court that the 
testimony of the witnesses for the company is at best guess work considering the 
lapse of time, because these witnesses were not testifying on the details of 
their working hours during the period 1952-1954. They testified only as to the 
total number of hours they spent working just a few years before, since they 
testified in 1956 about working hours in 1952-1954. </p>
<p>Under the circumstances, we feel it unnecessary to discuss the third 
assignment of error. </p>
<p>WHEREFORE, the resolution of the Court of Industrial Relations dated March 2, 
1961 is hereby set aside, without pronouncement as to costs. </p>
