entitled "Sebastian <span class="SpellE">Dimdiman</span>, Claimant, versus,
Philippine National Railways, Respondent"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
reversing the decision of the Hearing Officer in Regional Office No. 1, <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> City, which ordered the payment of sickness com­pensation
benefits and attorney's fees and the reimburse­ment of medical expenses to the
petitioner, Sebastian <span class="SpellE">Dimdiman</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1973</st1:date>,
Sebastian <span class="SpellE">Dimdiman</span> filed with the Regional Office No.
I at <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> City a claim for illnesses of rheumatic
heart disease, congestive heart failure, a trial fibrillation and
osteoarthritis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim was <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> by the respondent, Philippine National
Railways, hence, the same was heard on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Hearing Officer rendered a decision dated <st1:date year="1975" day="17" month="2">February 17, 1975</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which reads:</p>

<p class="BODY">The Philippine National Railways appealed to the Workmen's
Compensation Commission which dismissed the claim for lack of merit
because:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The record is bereft of
any showing that claimant herein suffered a disabling disease during his
employment or that he was disabled when he retired."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that the petitioner was first employed by the
Philippine National Railways in October 1945 as security guard, then promoted
to corporal and finally to sergeant with the latest salary of P4,104.00 per
annum; that he retired by reason of physical disability on October 16, 1972
under the Disability Plan, Republic Act 660, as amended; that in 1967, during
his employment with the Philippine National Railways, the petitioner began to
feel the symptoms of his illnesses; that from 1970 until his retirement on
October 16, 1972, he suffered pains in the knees and his legs were stiff and
numb and began to swell; that his heart became large and his left ear became deaf;
that he consulted Dr. <span class="SpellE">Ordoña</span> of the Philippine
National Railways for treatment; and that said doctor prescribed the necessary
medicines.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Francisco Peralta testified that on November 4, 1972, he
found the petitioner to be suffering from congestive heart failure and
arthritis; that congestive heart failure was probably due to rheumatic heart
disease while arthritis was probably due to degenerative processes; that the
heart disease could be aggravated by petitioner's work; and that the arthritis
could be caused by the nature of the petitioner's work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claimant presented evidence that he
incurred the amount of P520.67 for medical expenses.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Hearing Officer granted disability benefits to the petitioner
because:</p>

<blockquote>"The evidence on record has clearly shown that contraction of
the claimant's sickness supervened while in the course of his employment with
the respondent which is the preliminary link required by law to establish the
presumption that his sickness comes within the purview of the Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once this is shown, it is presumed in the
absence of substantial evidence to the contrary that claimant's illness arose
out of and in the course of his employment or either aggravated by or the
result of the nature of his employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The burden of demonstration by substantial evidence of absence of work
connection, is laid by law at the door of the employer, but it failed to
discharge such duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the
presumption of compensability in this case has not been overcome by
respondent's evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Workmen's
Compensation Law is a social legislation enacted to protect the workman and all
doubts as to compensability of the claim should be resolved in his favor
(Francisco vs. <span class="SpellE">Consing</span> 63 Phil. 241).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case the claimant retired at
the age of 58 which is before the compulsory retirement age and it was
established that he retired due to ailment and as a matter of fact, his
disability retirement was approved by the <span class="SpellE">GSIS</span> under
Disability Plan RA 660 (Exhibit 'F').<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From this piece of evidence where the <span class="SpellE">GSIS</span>
approved his retirement due to total and permanent disability and considering
that the claimant has incurred his illness in the course of his employment, it
is our considered opinion that the claim comes within the coverage of Sec. 2 of
Act 3428, as amended, and, it is compensable."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner was awarded the maximum compensation of P6,000.00
pursuant to the ruling in <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> vs. Seven-Up
Bottling Co. of the Philippines and Workmen's Compensation Commission, where
the Supreme Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"In the light of the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
authoritative opinions and/or comments on what constitutes permanent total
disability within the meaning of the Workmen's Compensation Act, it is Our
considered view that herein petitioner had contracted illness in the course of
his employment which rendered him permanently and totally disabled to work, and
as such is entitled to full compensation as provided for in Sections 14 and 15
of the Workmen's Compensation Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
have arrived at this conclusion ever mindful of the constitutional mandate that
the State should afford protection to labor, and of the doctrine that the
Workmen's Compensation Act being basically a social legislation, designed to
give relief to a workman, it must be liberally construed, and all doubts should
be resolved in favor of the workman and his dependents, in order to attain the
purpose for which it was enacted."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is undisputed that the illnesses of the petitioner supervened
during his employment with the Philippine National Railways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, there is a disputable presumption that
the claim is compensable.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The burden is shifted to the employer, Philippine National
Railways, to prove that the claim is not compensable.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent, Philippine National Railways, failed to overcome
the presumption of compensability and the evidence of the petitioner that his
illnesses were caused and aggravated by his work.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Hearing Officer correctly awarded the maximum compensation of
P6,000.00 to the petitioner who had to apply for retirement at the age of 58
years because of disability caused by the illnesses which supervened during his
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reimbursement of medical
expenses in the amount of P520.67 is supported by the documentary evidence of
the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the attorney's
fees should be increased to P600.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Workmen's Compensation
Commission sought to be reviewed is hereby set aside, and the respondent,
Philippine National Railways, is ordered:</p>

<p class="BODY">1)<span style=""> </span>To pay the claimant the
amount of Six Thousand Pesos (P6,000.00) as disability compensation benefits;</p>

the sum of Five Hundred Twenty Pesos and Sixty-Seven Centavos (P520.67)
