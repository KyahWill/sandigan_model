				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal, purely on questions of law, from a decision of the Court 
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City, ordering the 
defendant Manila Railroad Company to pay the plaintiffs Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> and her husband Jose <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> the sum of P5,070.60, with legal interest from June 
6, 1956,the date of the filing of the complaint, and to pay the costs.<div class="Section1">
<p>In the morning of March 8, 1955 in <span class="SpellE">Cabugao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> boarded bus no. 155, with plate no, TPU-5994, of 
the <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> Auto Line (BAL), a subsidiary of the 
Manila Railroad Co. (MRR),<sub><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sub> driven by Santiago <span class="SpellE">Caccam</span>, bound for <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City. In 
that trip, Juana brought with her 3,024 chicken eggs to be sold in <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City, and some personal belongings which she needed 
in that trip. About three kilometers away from <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> 
City, along the <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span> road, the bus hit a stone 
embankment, causing it to fall into a 65-foot deep precipice, resulting in death 
to two of its passengers and serious physical injuries to Juana and loss and 
destruction of all her belongings.</p>
<p>From the scene of the accident, Juana was brought to the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> General Hospital. Radiologist Dr. Hector Lopez, after 
examining her injuries, certified that she sustained comminuted fracture in the 
left mandible near the articulation, cracked fracture in the right temporal 
bone, crushed fractures, both scapular, and fracture in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th 
ribs. She was confined in that hospital until April 14, 1955, when she was 
transferred to the National Orthopedic Hospital, whereat she stayed until June 
6, 1955 when she was discharged. She was also treated by Dr. Luis Martinez of 
the V. Luna Hospital, and Dr. <span class="SpellE">J.V.de</span> <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos, both orthopedists, and later by Dr. J.O. <span class="SpellE">Floirendo</span>, an EENT specialist, for "visual and other 
defects."</p>
<p>Santiago <span class="SpellE">Caccam</span> was thereafter charged in the Court 
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City with the crime of 
double homicide and serious physical injuries thru reckless <span class="GramE">imprudence</span>. He pleaded guilty to the crime of double homicide 
and serious physical injuries thru simple imprudence and was sentenced 
accordingly. Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> did not intervene in the 
criminal case because she filed a formal reservation to institute a separate 
civil action for damages and indemnity against the MRR and the BAL.</p>
<p>Because of the loss of the eggs and the destruction of the personal effects 
that Juana brought with her in that trip, Jose <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span>, her husband, demanded from the defendant companies 
the value thereof amounting to P370.66 (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. C-3), of 
which sum the MRR paid P300 (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. 2). The MRR also 
paid the daily expenses, allowances, subsistence, hospitalization, medical fees 
and medicines of Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span>, as well as the 
service fees of her caretaker. The MRR has paid a total sum of P4,219 (exhs.3 
&amp; 4). Later the MRR offered to settle the case extra-judicially, tendering 
to the <span class="SpellE">Soberanos</span> the additional sum of P5,000. The 
offer was rejected, and the <span class="SpellE">Soberanos</span> filed the 
present action against the defendant companies and <span class="SpellE">Caccam</span>, to recover from them damages in the total sum of 
P76,757.76.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</span></sup> The defendant companies in due time filed their answer to the 
complaint with counterclaim for damages by way of attorney's fees, and praying 
that the complaint against them be dismissed, or, in the alternative, that the 
court approve their offer of settlement. The <span class="SpellE">Soberanos</span> 
filed a reply to the counterclaim and prayed for its dismissal.</p>
<p>After due trial, the lower court rendered the decision appealed from, 
dismissing at the same time the complaint against <span class="SpellE">Caccam</span>. The <span class="SpellE">Soberanos</span> moved to 
have the decision reconsidered. The motion for reconsideration was denied; hence 
the present recourse.</p>
<p>The nine errors imputed by the <span class="SpellE">Soberanos</span> to the 
lower court actually pose only two basic issues, namely, whether the dismissal 
of the complaint against <span class="SpellE">Caccam</span> is proper, and whether 
the amount of damages awarded is adequate.</p>
<p>Upon the first issue it is the contention of the <span class="SpellE">Soberanos</span> that the lower court, instead of dismissing their 
complaint against <span class="SpellE">Caccam</span>, should have <span class="SpellE">prlorly</span> declared him in default for failure to file an 
answer to the complaint. It is true that <span class="SpellE">Caccam</span> did 
not file any answer to the complaint; but it is also true that the plaintiffs 
did not move to declare him in default. And no default order may be issued 
against a defendant who fails to file a timely answer to a complaint except 
"upon motion of the plaintiff" (sec. 6, Rule 35, old Rules of Court, now sec. 1, 
Rule 18, Revised Rules of Court), and a court cannot issue a default order <span class="SpellE">motu</span> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span> (<span class="SpellE">Viacrucis</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Estenzo</span>, 
etc., et al., L-18457, June 30, 1962). In spite of the lack of a formal motion 
to secure a default order against <span class="SpellE">Caccam</span>, however, the 
<span class="SpellE">Soberanos</span> contend that at the hearing held on July 11, 
1959, their counsel, Atty. Marcos Vega, before closing his evidence, manifested 
to the lower court that because <span class="SpellE">Caccam</span> failed to file 
an answer to the complaint, he should "be declared in default and that we be 
allowed to present evidence against him in accordance with our complaint." This 
manifestation would nevertheless not have precluded the dismissal of the 
complaint against <span class="SpellE">Caccam</span>. In resolving this 
manifestation, the lower court asked Vega upon what basis the complaint is 
predicated, whether on culpa contractual or culpa <span class="SpellE">aquiliana</span>. Vega at first said, "It can be taken as both." 
But when the lower court pointedly declared that it "cannot allow you or give 
you both remedies," said counsel then replied that the complaint is predicated 
upon culpa contractual. Because of this reply, the lower court ruled that the 
<span class="SpellE">Soberanos</span> cannot go against <span class="SpellE">Caccam</span>, because he cannot be held liable on culpa 
contractual. Vega was given another chance to make a choice, but he finally 
decided to proceed on the basis of "culpa contractual because we cannot get 
anything from <span class="SpellE">Caccam</span>", adding that "although we are 
ready to present evidence to sustain our allegations against Santiago <span class="SpellE">Caccam</span>, we will close because moral damages against him 
cannot be recovered just the same."</p>
<p>That the complaint is in fact predicated on culpa contractual can be seen 
from a perusal thereof. While it names three defendants, the MRR, the BAL, and 
Santiago <span class="SpellE">Caccam</span>, the prayer thereof shows that the 
action is directed against the first two only, "to declare the defendant 
companies Manila Railroad Company and <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> Auto 
Line solidarity liable." And although paragraph 11 of the complaint recites that 
the incident was "due to the negligence and reckless imprudence of the defendant 
driver Santiago <span class="SpellE">Caccam</span>," it is significant that there 
is no prayer for declaration of liability against <span class="SpellE">Caccam</span>.</p>
<p>The complaint against <span class="SpellE">Caccam</span> was therefore properly 
dismissed. He was not a party to the contract; he was a mere employee of the 
BAL. The parties to that contract are Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span>, 
the passenger, and the MRR and its subsidiary, the BAL, the bus owner and 
operator, respectively; and consequent to the inability of the defendant 
companies to carry Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> and her baggage and 
personal effects securely and safely to her destination as imposed by law (art. 
1733, in relation to arts. 1736 and 1755, N.C.C.), their liability to her 
becomes direct and immediate.</p>
<p>We now come to the question of damages.</p>
<p>The <span class="SpellE">Soberanos</span> initially contend that the lower 
court erred in disallowing their claim of P200, representing the expenses of 
Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> in attending as a witness in the 
criminal case and attorney's fees incurred in connection therewith. This claim 
was correctly denied by the lower court, because these expenses were properly 
taxable in the criminal case. It may be argued that the <span class="SpellE">Soberanos</span> could not have recovered this sum in the criminal 
case because Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> expressly filed a formal 
reservation to institute a separate civil action for damages, but such 
reservation did not preserve whatever rights they had against <span class="SpellE">Caccam</span> on the basis of the latter's imprudence. The 
reservation is ineffective as to <span class="SpellE">Caccam</span> as it did not 
include him among those against whom their rights had been reserved. And the 
<span class="SpellE">Soberanos</span> not having intervened in the criminal case, 
this claim must be considered as having been impliedly adjudicated in the 
criminal case, and cannot therefore be ventilated in the present action.</p>
<p>The <span class="SpellE">Soberanos</span> next contend that the lower court 
erred in denying their claim for moral damages in the sum of P15,000, for the 
physical suffering, mental anguish, serious anxiety and fright they suffered as 
a consequence of the mishap. The lower court denied this claim on the strength 
of the oft-reiterated ruling of this Court that moral damages cannot be 
recovered against an employer in actions based on a breach of contract of 
carriage in the absence of malice, fraud, or bad faith.</p>
<p>The lower court rightly denied the claim for moral damages as far as Jose 
<span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> is concerned. In case of physical injuries, 
moral damages are recoverable only by the party injured and not by his next of 
kin, unless there is express statutory provision to the contrary (<span class="SpellE">Strebel</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Figueras</span>, L-4722, Dec. 
29, 1954; <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Arreglado</span> et al., L-11394, Sept. 9, 1958) In this case it 
was Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span>, not her husband Jose, who 
sustained the bodily injuries.</p>
<p>With respect to the claim of Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> for 
moral damages, the rule is well-settled in this jurisdiction that in cases of 
breach of contract of carriage, moral damages are recoverable only "where the 
defendant has acted fraudulently or in bad faith" (art. 2220, N.C.C.), and the 
terms fraud and bad faith have reference to "wanton, reckless, oppressive, 
malevolent conduct", or, in the very least, to "negligence so gross as to amount 
to malice." (<span class="SpellE">Fores</span> v. Miranda, L-12163, March 4, 1959; 
<span class="SpellE">Necesito</span>, etc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> et 
al., L-10605-10606, June 30, 1958.)</p>
<p>To prove malice and bad faith on the part of the defendant companies, the 
<span class="SpellE">Soberanos</span> aver that the said defendants intentionally 
omitted the name of Juana as one of the offended parties in the information in 
criminal case 1086, and that her name was included therein only upon the 
intervention of the <span class="SpellE">Soberanos</span> themselves; that the 
defendant companies prevailed upon <span class="SpellE">Caccam</span> to plead 
guilty to the lesser crime of double homicide and serious physical injuries thru 
simple imprudence, purposely to prevent the introduction of evidence of gross 
negligence amounting to malice against the said companies; that the BAL 
physician, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Nievera</span>, disowned having been an 
attending physician of Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span>, and, together 
with the MRR physician Dr. Salvador, suppressed the introduction of the X-ray 
plates taken of Juana as evidence to prove the extent of the injuries suffered 
by the latter; and that the defendant companies exerted undue influence upon Dr. 
Fernandez, who treated Juana's dental injuries, not to testify to such matters 
or identify a medical certificate issued by him describing the dental injuries 
suffered by Juana. These incidents, even if true, cannot be considered as acts 
committed fraudulently or in bad faith by the defendant companies in the 
operation of their transportation business which directly resulted in the mishap 
that caused the injuries to Juana. Moreover, the allegation in paragraph 11 of 
the complaint that the incident was "due to the negligence and reckless 
imprudence of the defendant driver Santiago <span class="SpellE">Caccam</span>", 
does not per se justify an inference of malice or bad faith on the part of the 
defendant companies (Rex Taxicab Co. v. Bautista, et al., L-15392, Sept. 30, 
1960; <span class="SpellE">Cachero</span> v. Manila Yellow Taxicab Co., Inc., 
L-S721, May 23,1957), for fraud, malice, or bad faith must be proved to support 
a claim for moral damages if only physical injuries are sustained (Lira vs. 
Mercado, L-13358, Sept. 29, 1961).</p>
<p>The absence of fraud, malice, or bad faith on the part of the defendant 
companies justifies the denial of Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano's</span> 
claim for moral damages as well as the denial of the claim for exemplary damages 
(art. 2232, N.C.C.).</p>
<p>The third claim - for attorney's fees - was also properly denied by the lower 
court. The <span class="SpellE">Soberanos</span> aver that they were obliged to 
file a separate civil action for damages against the defendant companies. This 
claim is predicated upon paragraphs (2) and (5) of article 2208 of the New Civil 
Code, which provide that attorney's fees and expenses of litigation may be 
recovered when the defendant's act or omission has compelled the plaintiff to 
litigate with third persons or incur expenses to protect his interest, or when 
the defendant acted in gross and evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy the 
plaintiff's plainly valid, just and demandable claim. It will be observed that 
the defendant companies offered to settle the case by offering to the <span class="SpellE">Soberanos</span> the additional sum of P5,000. The <span class="SpellE">Soberanos</span>, however, rejected the offer and proceeded to 
court to recover damages in the total sum of P76,757.76. It was not, therefore, 
the defendant companies that compelled the <span class="SpellE">Soberanos</span> 
to litigate, or to incur expenses in connection with the litigation instituted 
by them. The <span class="SpellE">Soberanos</span> went to court after rejecting 
the defendant companies' offer of settlement. The latter can not likewise be 
considered to have acted in gross and evident bad faith in not satisfying the 
claim of the <span class="SpellE">Soberanos</span>, because, as the lower court 
puts it, the <span class="SpellE">Soberanos</span> "have asked for too much", and 
the "defendant was justified in resisting this action." We are not without 
precedent on this point. In Globe Assn. vs. <span class="SpellE">Arcache</span>, 
L-12378, May 28,1958, this Court observed that the refusal of the defendant 
therein to pay the amount claimed was due not to malice but to the fact that the 
plaintiff therein demanded more than it should, and consequently ruled that the 
defendant had the right to refuse it; and in the <span class="SpellE">Cachero</span> case, supra, this Court held that the plaintiff in 
that case cannot recover attorney's fees, because the litigation was caused not 
by the defendant's failure to pay but by the plaintiff's "exorbitant 
charge."</p>
<p>We now come to the claim for additional unpaid allowances of Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> while she was undergoing medical and dental 
treatment in Manila and <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, in the total sum 
of P600. In our view, this claim has merit. The allowance of ten pesos for each 
day of stay in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City of Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> was recommended for approval by the superintendent 
of the BAL, Mr. C. Rivera (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. C-4) and by the MRR 
physician, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Saigado</span>, and appears to have been "OK" 
by the MRR administrative officer, Mr. F.C. <span class="SpellE">Unson</span> 
(<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. C-5). These exhibits C-4 and C-5 were admitted 
in evidence without objection from the Government Corporate Counsel who 
represented the defendant companies. The defendant companies have already paid 
to Jose <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> the total sum of P600, covering Juana 
Soberano'8 stay for 60 days in a private house, from June 7 to July 5, 1955, and 
from July 7 to August 5, 1955 (<span class="SpellE">exhs</span>. 3-1 and 3-J). As 
to the balance of P600, it was error for the lower court to include this sum in 
the assessment of loss of earning capacity, because this amount represents 
expenses for board and lodging, short orders such as milk and fruit, laundry and 
transportation of Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> incurred during her 
stay in a private house in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, after her 
discharge from the National Orthopedic Hospital, which continued stay was upon 
the advice of her attending physician that she go to that hospital every other 
day for physical therapy (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. C-3). It will be seen 
under exhibits C-4 and C-5 that the defendant companies agreed to pay the ' 
<span class="SpellE">Soberanos</span> the sum of P10.00 a day for her said stay 
beginning "June 7, 1955 not to exceed 60 days, depending upon the advice of the 
attending physician or other bone specialist." The deposition of, and a medical 
certificate issued by, Dr. Juan O. <span class="SpellE">Floirendo</span>, an EENT 
specialist who treated Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> for "visual and 
other defects", show that he treated her for more than sixty days, from 
September 10, 1955 to February 2, 1956 (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. L). The 
balance of P600 should, therefore, be paid to Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span>. We come finally to the claim for loss of earning 
capacity in the total sum of P50,000, based upon the expectancy that Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span>, who was 37 years old at the time of the accident, 
would live for 20 more years and be able to earn an average annual income of 
P2,500. On this point, the lower court found that "Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> suffered greatly and that her injuries left her 
permanently disfigured and partially disabled as she walks with a stiff neck and 
her arms have partly lost their full freedom." After finding, however, that she 
is not altogether a helpless woman and can still engage in business, the lower 
court awarded to her P5,000 to compensate loss of earnings as a result of her 
partial disability.</p>
<p>The appellants contend that the award is inadequate. We agree.</p>
<p>This Court, in three cases, allowed in one, and increased in the two others, 
the amount of compensatory damages. In <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> vs. 
Manila Electric Railroad and Light Co., 44 Phil, 165 (1922), this Court awarded 
P2,000 in future damages to the plain-tiff therein, after finding that due to 
the accident, wherein <span class="SpellE">Borromeo's</span> left foot was passed 
over by the rear wheels of the electric car of the defendant company and had to 
be amputated, he had to use an artificial foot in order to be able to walk; that 
he could no longer be employed as a marine engineer which he had been for 
sixteen years; that at the time of the accident he was a chief engineer with a 
monthly salary of P375; and that because he knew of no other profession, his 
incapacity had put an end to his activities and had destroyed his principal 
source of professional earnings in the future. In <span class="SpellE">Cariaga</span> et al. vs. Laguna <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> 
Bus Co., et al,, L-11037, Dec. 29, 1960, this Court increased the award of 
compensatory damages from P10,490 to P25,000, after finding that <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cariaga's</span> right forehead 
was fractured, necessitating the removal of practically all of the right frontal 
lobe of his brain; that he had become a misfit for any kind of work; that he 
could hardly walk around without someone helping him and he had to use a brace 
on his left leg and foot; that he was a virtual invalid, physically and 
mentally; that at the time of the accident he was already a fourth-year student 
in medicine in a reputable university; that his scholastic record is sufficient 
to justify the assumption that had he continued his studies, he would have 
finished the course and would have passed the board examinations; and that he 
could possibly have earned as a medical practitioner the minimum monthly income 
of P300. And in <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Arreglado</span> et al., L-11394, September 9, 1958, this Court 
increased the award of compensatory damages from P1,000 to P18,000, after 
finding that Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> sustained "permanent 
deformity and -- something like an inferiority complex" as well as a 
"pathological condition on the left side of the jaw" caused by the defendant 
Dario <span class="SpellE">Arreglado</span> who inflicted the injury upon him 
voluntarily; that to arrest the degenerative process taking place in the 
mandible and to restore the injured boy to a nearly normal condition, surgical 
intervention was needed; that a repair, however skillfully conducted, is never 
equivalent to the original state; and that because of the injury, the boy had 
suffered greatly.</p>
<p>In the case at bar, the nature and extent of the physical injuries suffered 
by Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> and their after-effects upon her 
life and activities, are attested by three reputable physicians: Dr. Hector 
Lopez, a radiologist of the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> General Hospital; 
Dr. Angel <span class="SpellE">Poblete</span>, an orthopedist of the National 
Orthopedic Hospital; and Dr. Juan O. <span class="SpellE">Floirendo</span>, an 
EENT specialist. Dr. Lopez declared that </p>
<p>Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> suffered comminuted fracture in the 
left mandible near the articulation, cracked fracture in the right temporal 
bone, crushed fractures both scapular, and fracture in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th 
ribs. As a result of these injuries, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Poblete</span> said 
that she suffered and would continue to suffer limitation of mouth opening, bad 
approximation of the jaw alignment which is drawn inside, limitation of neck and 
shoulder movements with numbness on the right side of the face and right and 
left side of the body, disturbance in vision, and poor mastication resulting in 
indigestion. Dr. <span class="SpellE">Poblete</span> further testified that she 
will be "abnormal and naturally she could not be expected to live a normal 
life." Dr. <span class="SpellE">Floirendo</span> declared that she suffers from 
pain along the cheeks on both sides of her face, double vision, and paralysis of 
the ocular muscles due to partial disequilibrium of the eye muscles. Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> herself categorically declared, and this was not 
contradicted, that prior to the accident, she had a complete and healthy set of 
teeth; that as a result of the accident she lost three of her teeth, and the 
remaining ones in the upper jaw had to be extracted because they were already 
loose and a denture had perforce to be made for her; and that her face is 
permanently disfigured (<span class="SpellE">exhs</span>. K &amp; K-1.).</p>
<p>There is absolutely no doubt that the resultant physical handicaps would 
entail for Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> a loss of positive economic 
values. In fact, they will greatly adversely affect her occupation as a peddling 
merchant which she has been since 1950 (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. A), 
earning from 1950 to March 8, 1955, when the accident happened, an average 
annual net income of about P1,500 (<span class="SpellE">exhs</span>. B, B-1 to 
B-5, inclusive). It is to be assumed that had the interruption to her occupation 
through defendants' wrongful act not occurred, she would continue earning this 
average income.</p>
<p>Considering all the facts detailed above, this Court is of the opinion that 
the sum of P5,000 in compensatory damages awarded to her for loss of earning 
capacity is inadequate; the amount should be increased to P15,000.</p>
<p>She should also be awarded the sum of P45.35, representing unrealized profits 
from the 3,024 chicken eggs which she brought with her in the trip and which 
were destroyed. She brought those eggs to be sold in <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City. She bought them at nine centavos each, was to 
sell them in <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City to definite customers at an 
agreed price of ten and a half centavos each, or with a profit of one and a half 
centavos per egg.</p>
<p>Finally, all the awards to Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> should 
earn interest at the legal rate from the date the judgment a quo was rendered, 
on November 25, 1960, and not from the date of the filing of the complaint.</p>
<p>ACCORDINGLY, the judgment appealed from is modified to read as follows: 
"Judgment is therefore rendered ordering the Manila Railroad Company to pay to 
the plaintiffs (1) P600 representing the balance of the unpaid allowances due to 
Juana <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> in connection with her stay in a 
private house in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City during the period of her
