be <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
moved to Esther's side, pointed a gun at her waist, and told her not to shout
or he would kill her, or, as she testified on cross-examination, he pointed a
gun at her when they were at <span class="SpellE">Blumentritt</span> Street (9 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> Sept. 16, 1971; 21, 26 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>

placed the knife on the floor and removed his clothes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He took off her blouse, mashed her breasts,

shouted because of the pain and later she lost consciousness.</p>

<p class="BODY">When she regained consciousness, she saw blood on her private
parts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was scared and feeling
weak.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She put on her panty while <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> put on his clothes.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">When it was already getting dark, she and <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
boarded the boat and returned to the shore.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He cautioned her not to tell anything to his aunt; otherwise, he would
kill her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They rode in the jeep and went

gun at her, removed her clothes (except her skirt), fondled her breasts, made
her lie down on the floor and <span style="">had
sexual intercourse with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They stayed
in that room up to June 11.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the morning of <st1:date month="6" day="11" year="1971">June

tell her folks that she was in good condi­tion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Esther went to the house of <span class="SpellE">Peña's</span> cousin and
asked her to phone her sister, <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was able
to talk with the mother-in-law of her sister.<span style="">&nbsp;

her was not her own desire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While she
was at the phone, <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> was allegedly poking a gun at
her waist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mother-in-law of her
sister advised her not to leave the place where she was staying.</p>

<p class="BODY">At noontime, <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> locked her in the
room and went out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon his return, he
removed his clothes, pointed the gun at her, caressed her body, sucked her
breasts, and told her to suck his penis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She did not obey him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had
sexual intercourse with her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Later in the day, while she was at the window, she saw her mother
riding in a car with some companions.<span style="">&nbsp;

told her not to go with her mother because if she left him, he would be jailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She and her mother and the policemen went to

<p class="BODY">He was later brought to <st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> </span>and investigated by the <st1:place>Manila</st1:place>
police at Precinct No. 5 in <span class="SpellE">Balut</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, where he made an extrajudicial confession.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="6" day="15" year="1971">June 15, 1971</st1:date>
a complaint for forcible abduction with rape was filed against <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> in the Court of First Instance of Manila (Criminal Case
No. 5297).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Esther swore to the
complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">For having committed rape with the use of a knife and a revolver,
the trial court sentenced <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Peña</span></span><span style=""> </span>to <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> but did not require him </span><span style="">to pay an indemnity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Peña</span> contends that the trial court
erred (1) in admitting in evidence his extrajudicial confession; (2) in giving
credence to complainant's testimony; (3) <span style="">in </span>finding that <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> had carnal
knowledge of the complainant by means of threats; (4) in finding that <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> used a gun and a knife, and (5) in convicting him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Peña</span> assailed the <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span>
of his confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified that a <st1:place>Manila</st1:place>
policeman gave him a karate blow on his back and thigh while he was in Precinct
5, <span class="SpellE">Balut</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Tondo</span></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span> C. Angeles testified
that Pena volun­tarily recounted what had happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The investigation was con­ducted in a room
twenty meters long and seven meters wide.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Patrolman Angeles asked <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> questions which
he typed together with his answers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Angeles denied that he made threats against <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court found that the confession was
voluntary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with that finding.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that on the occasion when <span class="SpellE">Peña's</span>
con­fession was taken, Esther <span class="SpellE">Tayag</span> was in the police

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Peña</span> invoked section 20, Article IV of
the 1973 Constitu­tion which provides that "no person shall be compelled
to be a witness against himself"; that "any person under
investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the right to remain
silent and to counsel, and to be informed of such right"; that "no
force, violence, threat, intimidation, or any other means which vitiates the
free will shall be used against him", and that "any confession
obtained in violation" of section 20 "shall be inadmissible in
evidence".</p>

<p class="BODY">We have already held that the innovations introduced by section
20 have no retroactive effect (<span class="SpellE">Magtoto</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Manguera</span>, L-37201-02, March 3, 1975, 63 SCRA 4).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The confession in this case was obtained
before <st1:date month="1" day="17" year="1973">January 17, 1973</st1:date>
when the present Constitution took effect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant's first assignment of error is not well-taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having ruled that <span class="SpellE">Peña's</span> confession was
not obtained through duress, it follows that his admission therein that he
raped Esther <span class="SpellE">Tayag</span> is conclusive against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Peña's</span> argu­ments
in his other assignments of error, wherein he impugned complainant's
credibility and contended th<span style="">a</span>t
no weapons were used and that his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt,
cannot destroy his own admission that he intimidated Esther into having sexual
intercourse with himself.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find the following
conclusions of the trial court, re­jecting </span><span class="SpellE">Peña's</span>
<span style="">version, which contradicts his
confession, to be correct and plausible:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, the statement of the accused that he did
not commit the act imputed to <span class="GramE">him,</span> is solely based
upon his uncorroborated and self-serving testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to his version, Ester was his
sweetheart, whom he met on board a '<span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>' in the
morning of June 9, 1971; that as Ester was already late for her work, Rolando (<span class="SpellE">Peña</span>) invited her to go with him to <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>
to introduce her to his relatives; that Ester agreed but while they were
already on the way, they thought of buying oysters, and accordingly they
proceeded to a place near the sea­shore; that at the time, there were no
oysters for sale, and so the two went boating instead and then stayed for about
one-half hour in a <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> hut constructed near the
oyster farm; that after passing away the time in the <span class="SpellE">nipa</span>
hut, they left the place and <span style="">proceeded
to Barrio <span class="SpellE">Bagbag</span>, Rosario, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>,
where at the house of the sister of his father, Rolando introduced Ester as his
wife; that at 3:00 p.m., Rolando left Ester in the house of his aunt and
returned to Manila, where he worked as security guard from 5:00 p.m. of June 9,
1971, to 1:00 a.m. of June 10, 1971; that early in the morning of the last
date, he returned to Barrio <span class="SpellE">Bagbag</span>, Rosario, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, where between 8:00 and 9:00 in the morning, with
her assent, he </span><span style="">had </span><span style="">carnal knowledge of Ester; that before noon,
Rolando and Ester went to <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> City, where she was
introduced to a cousin of the mother of the accused; </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">Ester tried to call his mother by long distance telephone, but she was
unable to make a connection; that in the afternoon of the same day, they
returned to Rosario, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, where Ester was again
left in the house of the aunt of Rolando </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Peña</span></span><span style="">, </span><span style="">who went to </span><span style="">Manila </span><span style="">to work as security guard; that early in the morning of June 11, 1971,
Rolando returned to Rosario, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, and joined Ester
in the house of his aunt; that after lunch, Rolando accom­panied Ester to <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> City, where she made another long dis­tance
telephone call to Manila, and this time she was able to talk with the
mother-in-law of her sister; that Ester informed that party where she was, with
the request to relay the message to her mother; that in the afternoon of said
date, Ester's mother, with several companions, arrived in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Bagbag</span>, Rosario, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>; that
Ester was investigated by the police authorities of said municipality and as a
result thereof Rolando was detained in its jail.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The story given by the <span class="GramE">accused,</span> was
irrational and un­convincing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
pretension that Ester accepted his proffer of love in the morning of Holy
Friday, after he visited her three times in her house, which was usually done
at about 5:00 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon, could not be true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, the accused failed to
produce any tangible evidence like a letter, gift, or any item which may have
come from Ester indicating that they are already sweethearts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Besides, Rolando affirmed that he was required to re­port for
work every day of the week and so had he visited Ester on two Sundays in March,
1971, he would have been absent from work for two days, and yet in the report
of <span class="SpellE">Hercon</span> Security Agency to the Social Security
System for said month no deduction was made from his salary (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 8), thereby indicating that he worked everyday that
month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, it is very unlikely and
hard to believe that a young man would visit the young woman he is courting
especially in the morning of a Holy Friday, because to Christian Filipinos, it
is a day dedicated to prayers and meditation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The explanation given by the accused to the effect that he
invited Ester to go to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>
to introduce her to his relatives is not worthy of credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming that Ester was the sweetheart
of the accused (which the former, however, vehemently denied), any introduction
should have been made first to his parents, who reside in <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, for which reason there
would be no need to go to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the second place, any such introduction would be premature
because the accused and his alleged sweetheart have not yet made any plan to
get married.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it <span style="">could not be </span>true that Ester was
brought to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>
so that she would come to know the relatives of the accused, because for two
days that she was in said province, she was introduced only to two of them,
namely, a sister of the father of Rolando and <span style="">a </span>cousin of his mother.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Finally, Ester was made to stay in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city> up to <st1:date month="6" day="11" year="1971">June 11, 1971</st1:date> and not allowed to return to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
in the afternoon of <st1:date month="6" day="9" year="1971">June 9, 1971</st1:date>,
for which reason she was not able to report for work on the 10th and 11th of
said month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, the reason given
by the accused for inviting Ester to go to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city> because she was already
late in going to her place of work in the morning of <st1:date month="6" day="9" year="1971">June 9, 1971</st1:date>, was not true.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Counsel contends that the accused could not have brought
Ester to the <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> hut against her will because she
could easily have done something along the way which would attract the
attention of other persons, thereby thwarting whatever plans the accused
had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contention, in the opinion of
the Court, is not well taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According
to Ester, they were the only passengers on board the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
and the accused had the barrel of a revolver pointed against her right
waistline.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Ester is a nervous and easily scared type of individual, and
so upon being threatened with a deadly weapon, she lost her composure so much
so that what she did was merely to cry and<span style="">
</span>cover her face with a handkerchief.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, Ester became more helpless when two 'husky and dark' men
boarded the '<span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>' somewhere in <span class="SpellE">Baclaran</span>, and she was informed by the accused that they are
'tough' thereby making it more difficult, if not to say impossible, for her to
make any attempt to escape or run away.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Another circumstance which persuaded the Court into giving
more credence to the testimony of Ester than to that of the <span class="GramE">accused,</span>
was the reaction of the former when asked to iden­tify the person who abducted
and raped her and she <span style="">had </span>to
look in the direction where the accused was seated in the Court room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ester immediately became <span class="GramE">hysterical,</span>
and uttered words of indignation and condemnation against the accused, which
reached a high pitch and then she collapsed and lost consciousness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This happened on several occasions so much so
that the trial had to be suspended for half an hour or transferred to another
date be­cause Ester was visibly in no condition to give further
testimony."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The result is that the fact of the commission of the rape or the <u><span style="">corpus <span class="SpellE">delicti</span></span></u><span style=""> </span>was proven by the testimony of Esther
<span class="SpellE">Tayag</span> and the medical certificate <span style="">and </span>testimony of the medico-legal
officer of the Constabulary crime laboratory.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's voluntary extrajudicial confession, <span style="">that </span>he raped Esther, was, therefore,
corroborated by evidence of the <u><span style="">corpus</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicti</u></span><u> </u></span>(Sec.
3, Rule 133, <span class="GramE">Rules</span> of Court).</p>

<p class="BODY">We also agree with the trial court that the crime of forcible
abduction was not proven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant's
story as to how she was abducted contains improbabilities, such as that the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, wherein she was riding, made no stops during <span style="">its trip from </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Blumentritt</span></span><span style=""> Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style=""> to <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span> and that
she did not remember the streets traversed by the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Although the forcible abduction, which was supposedly commenced
in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, was not proven and
although the rape, which was proven, was actually committed in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>, still the Court of First
Instance of Manila had jurisdiction to convict the accused of rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complex crime of forcible abduction with rape was charged in
the complaint on the basis of which the case was tried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That complex crime is a transitory
offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of First Instance of
Manila had jurisdiction over that complex crime because an essential element of
the abduction took place in Manila (Sec. 14, Rule 110, Rules of Court; <span class="SpellE">Parulan</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Rodas</span> and Reyes, 78
Phil. 855; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Parulan</span>, 88 Phil. 615; <span class="SpellE">Parulan</span> vs. Director of Prisons, L-28519, February 17,
1968, 22 SCRA 638; U. S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>, 23 Phil. 154,
159).</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the averments in the complaint or information
characterize the crime to be prosecuted and the court before which it must be
tried (<span class="SpellE">Balite</span> vs. People, L-21475, September <span style="">30, 1966, 18 SCRA 280, 288).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complex crime of forcible abduction with
rape was explicitly spelled out in the complaint of Esther <span class="SpellE">Tayag</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Rape committed with the use of a deadly weapon is punished by <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no aggra­vating nor mitigating
circumstances, <span class="GramE">the trial court correctly imposed <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> </span>on
defendant-appellant <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> (Arts. 63[2] and 335,
Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 4111)</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court overlooked the imposition of an indemnity or
civil liability which is mandated in articles 100, 104(3), 107 and 345(1) of
the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An indemnity of
twelve thousand pesos should be imposed on <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
(People vs. Gonzales, L-33926, July 31, 1974, 58 SCRA 265, 271; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span>, L-31238, February 27, 1971, 37 SCRA 813).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the trial court's judgment is affirmed with the
