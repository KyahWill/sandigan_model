				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These eight appeals, consolidated in one decision because of
identity of issues, question the correctness <span style="">o</span>f the order of the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>
(pro­vincial capital of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental)
dismissing, on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, eight criminal cases
"delegated" or assigned to it by the Court of First Instance of said
province for trial and judgment.</p>

were in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On different dates in
1963 and 1964, the Court of First Instance (Judge Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Catolico</span>
presiding) issued separate orders "delegating" or assigning the
above-mentioned criminal cases to the </span>municipal <span style="">court of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span> for trial and judgment in
view, according to the Judge, of the many cases pending in his court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon objection raised by the respective
counsel for the accused questioning the jurisdiction of the municipal court, it
returned the cases to the Court of First Instance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="9"><span style="">September
 11, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Court
of First Instance issued a consolidated order sending all the eight cases </span>back
<span style="">to the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span> for "trial and final disposition." In
the same order </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">Court made the observa­tion that "it should
be rather more to the interest of justice that if question of jurisdiction is
squarely raised, the said </span>Municipal <span style="">Judge should resolve the same directly, rather than just return the
cases back to the Court of First Instance, or if finding it to be the other
way, try the cases and on conviction, let the accused raise the question him­self,
rather than the court raising same x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thereafter, the municipal
court of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span> issued the disputed order
dismissing the cases "for lack of juris­diction."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Provincial Fiscal, <span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Ocaya</span>, filed a
consolidated motion for reconsideration on November 20, 1965, stating that the
municipal court, instead of dis­missing </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">cases, should have
either insisted upon their return to the Court of First Instance or appealed
from the latter's order of September 11, 1965.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The municipal court denied the reconsideration, pointing out that his
previous order returning the cases had been overruled by the Court of First
Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it even drew a
citation for contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The municipal
court suggested that "if <span class="SpellE">movant</span> fiscal <span class="SpellE">Ocaya</span> really believes that the afore­said order of </span><st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="9"><span style="">September
 11, 1965</span></st1:date><span style=""> (of the
Court of First Instance) is erroneous, he could still ask for the review of the
aforesaid order by a superior court by <i>certiorari</i> proceedings."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Provincial Fiscal
forthwith filed a notice of appeal to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 28, 1965 the municipal court gave
the appeal due course and ordered the records elevated through the Clerk of the
Court of First Instance, but at the same time expressed "serious doubts as
to the </span>propriety of the present appeal interposed by the government
since this appears to be not the case which could be directly appealed from the
municipal court to the Supreme Court."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The records, however, were
sent back by the Court </span>of First Instance on the excuse that they should
be forwarded by the municipal court itself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1966</st1:date>
the municipal court issued another order, this time disapproving the appeal on
the ground that what should have been appealed was the order of the Court of
First Instance of <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again the Provincial Fiscal moved to
reconsider but was turned down.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On April 25, 1966, the
Court of </span><span style="">First </span><span style="">Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental, in Special Civil Case 2552 entitled "The People of the
Philippines vs. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Dajao</span>,
</span>as Municipal Judge of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>" (for <i>Mandamus</i>),
ordered him to forward to the Supreme Court the records of the eight criminal
cases.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The jurisdiction of
Justices of the Peace in provincial capitals to try criminal cases assigned to
them by the Courts of First Instance was conferred originally by Section 87 of
the </span>Judiciary Act <span style="">of 1948 (R.A.
No. </span><span style="">296), </span><span style="">which provided:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Justices of the Peace in the capitals of provinces may, by
assignment of the respective district judge in each case, have like
jurisdiction as the Court of <span style="">First </span>Instance
to try parties charged with an offense committed within the province in which
the penalty pro­vided by law does not exceed imprison­ment for two years and
four months, or a fine of two thousand pesos, or both such imprisonment and
fine, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1959</st1:date>
Republic Act No. 2613 took effect, in which the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
provision on delegation or assign­ment of cases was suppressed, and instead the
jurisdiction of Justices of the Peace in provincial capitals and Judges of
municipal courts (of chartered cities) was enlarged, <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Justices of the Peace in the capitals of provinces and Judges
of Municipal Courts shall have like juris­diction as the Court of First
Instance to try parties charged with an offense committed within the province
in which the penalty provided by <span style="">law </span>does not <span style="">exceed <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correcional</u></span>
or imprisonment for not more than six years or fine not exceeding three thousand
pesos or both, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It should be noted that
in both provisions the jurisdiction thus conferred upon Justices of the Peace
in provincial capitals referred to "an offense committed within the
province," although under the former provision the jurisdiction was a
"delegated" one, while under the latter it was original and could be
exercised concurrently with the Court of First Instance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The law underwent another
amendment on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="6"><span style="">June 22, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, when </span>Republic <span style="">Act No. 3828 was approved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As amended the pertinent portion of Section
87 reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Justices of the peace in the capitals of provinces and
sub-provinces and judges of municipal courts shall have like jurisdiction as
the Court of <span style="">First Instance to try
parties charged with an offense committed within their respective
jurisdictions, in which the penalty provided by law does not exceed <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>
or imprisonment for not more than six years or fine not exceeding six thousand
pesos or both, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This last amendment, which was already in effect<span style=""> when the eight cases involved herein were
assigned by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental to the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> no longer refers to offenses committed
within the province but to those "com</span><span style="">mitted within their respective jurisdictions," that is, within the
territorial jurisdictions of the corresponding justices of the peace in
provincial capitals and Judges </span>of municipal courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, as the law then stood the said courts
could only try cases originally brought before them, and where their original
jurisdiction was not exclusive but concurrent with that of the Courts of First
Instance the territorial limits of such jurisdiction must be considered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The eight cases here involved obviously fell
under neither category: they came to the <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>
court by assignment, <span style="">and the offenses
charged were committed in other municipalities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With particular reference to the five cases appealed to the Court of
First Instance, the lack of competency of the <span class="SpellE">Oro­quieta</span>
court </span><span style="">is
</span><span style="">even more obvious, for they
called for the exercise of appellate jurisdiction, which the said court could
not possibly have, whether by delegation or concurrent­ly with the Court of
First Instance under Section 87(c) of the Judiciary Act, as amended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The order of assignment
issued by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental was therefore nothing but an exercise in futility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was void and ineffective, and vested no
authority upon the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>
except to return the cases physically to the court whence they came.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of dismissal subject of this
appeal, issued by </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">court without
jurisdiction, was equally to no purpose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The status of these cases is as if they had neither been assigned nor
dismissed, but had remained pending in the Court of First Instance all the
while.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is of course to be deplored
that the rigmarole, unnecessary and avoidable as it was, has unduly delayed the
disposal of these cases and to that extent adversely affected the administration
of justice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">Wherefore</span></b><span style="">, the records are ordered remanded to </span>the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental for
further proceedings.</p>
