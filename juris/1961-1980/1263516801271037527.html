That was not so before.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case before us, petitioner was preventively suspended by
the Auditor General from his position as Provincial Auditor of <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span> on <st1:date year="1951" day="13" month="1">January
 13, 1951</st1:date> and was riot recalled to the service until <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1963</st1:date>, when he was extended
an appointment as Acting Provincial Auditor of the same province, a period of
more than twelve and a half years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
then filed an action for the recovery of his salaries from the time of his suspension
on <st1:date year="1959" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion to dismiss was filed by the
Provincial Fiscal and the Solicitor General on behalf of respondents included
among whom were the then Auditor General, Pedro M. <span class="SpellE">Gimenez</span>,
and the Commissioner of Civil Service, <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower
court, presided by the Hon. <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> Z. <span class="SpellE">Arrieta</span>, found the motion meritorious and dismissed the
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence this
appeal by petitioner.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>We affirm
the order of dismissal of the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">What were the controlling facts?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to the well-reasoned order of the lower court of November 9,
1964:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Assuming the allegations of
the petition to be true, it appears that the peti­tioner was preventively
suspended by the Auditor General from his position as Provincial Auditor of <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span> on January 13, 1951 because of the filing before
the Court of First Instance of the province of Criminal Case No. 182 for <span class="SpellE">Malversation</span> of Public Funds against him and the then
Provincial Treasurer of the province.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An
administrative case was also commenced by the Auditor General against the
petitioner in which a decision was rendered by the Com­missioner of Civil
Service on <st1:date year="1953" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1953</st1:date>
finding him guilty of the charge so that he was fined one (1) month's pay and
reprimanded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not appeal from said
decision of the Commissioner of Civil Service but made some efforts to obtain
his reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Auditor General,
nevertheless, refused because of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the
criminal case <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually, the petitioner was convicted by
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span> and the
Auditor General, on <st1:date year="1958" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1958</st1:date>
recommended to the Commissioner of Civil Service his permanent separation from
the service effective as of the date of his suspension on <st1:date year="1951" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1951</st1:date>."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Then, on <st1:date year="1959" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1959</st1:date>,
petitioner wrote the Civil Service Commission requesting that no action be
taken on the recommen­dation of the Auditor General pending his appeal to the
Court of Appeals of the decision in the criminal case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Civil Service Commission however turned a
deaf ear to such a plea approving such recommendation and separating him from
the service as of <st1:date year="1959" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This order in turn was appealed to the Civil
Service Board of Appeals.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Subsequently, his conviction was set aside by the Court of Appeals which
ordered a new trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, on <st1:date year="1960" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1960</st1:date>, petitioner again
sought his reinstatement from the Auditor General, in view of the aforesaid
decision of the Court of Appeals.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact of reinstatement was then noted in the appealed decision
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"On <st1:date year="1962" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1962</st1:date>, the Civil Service Com­mission
informed the Auditor General that it would interpose no objection to the
reinstatement of the petitioner, but nothing was done about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="6" month="2">February
 6, 1963</st1:date>, however, the Commissioner of Civil Service again called
the attention of the Auditor General, and the latter, extended him an
appointment as Acting Provincial Auditor for <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>
on <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1963</st1:date>, which
was forwarded to the Commissioner of Civil Service on <st1:date year="1963" day="6" month="9">September 6, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He accepted said appointment and is actually serving in that capacity at
present."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The first ground of the dismissal, as noted in the first
assignment of error for petitioner in this appeal, is that the lower court
could not have validly issued such an order on the ground of the delay in the
claim for salary during the period of his preventive suspension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second alleged error would likewise
dispute the other ground for the order to dismiss, namely, that the emoluments
to a public office would go <span style="">to </span>the
person who rendered the service unless the contrary is provided.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It would thus appear that the lower court was of the belief that a right to
recover salary after reinstatement exists, which could not be enforced, there
being in this particular case an insuperable obstacle to its being respected,
due to the long delay that elapsed before a claim was made.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This view of the lower court is subjected to a challenge, as set
forth above in the first error assigned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If there were no such right, however, no inquiry need be made on whether
or not such delay sufficed to constitute a bar to the success of the petition
in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence the crucial question
is the existence of a right to back salary assuming that the acceptance of an
appointment as Acting Provincial Auditor twelve and a half years later did
constitute reinstatement?</p>

<p class="BODY">The answer, so petitioner believes, is supplied by the applicable
statutory provision found in the Revised Administrative Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reads thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"When the Chief of a Bureau or Office
suspends a subordinate officer or employee from duty, the person suspended
shall not receive pay during suspension <span style="">unless
the Department Head shall so order; but upon subsequent reinstatement of the
suspended person or upon his exoneration, if death should render reinstatement
impossible, any salary so withheld shall be paid, but without prejudice to the
application of the disciplinary provisions of section six hundred and
ninety-five hereof."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner would further invoke at least four decisions, decided
by us, which for him would be decisive of his right to compensation during the
period of his preventive suspension.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Batungbakal</span>
v. National Development Co.,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
National Rice and Corn Corp. v. <span class="SpellE">Naric</span> Workers' <st1:place>Union</st1:place>,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Tabora</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Montelibano</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
and Tan v. <span class="SpellE">Gimenez</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The <span class="SpellE">Batungbakal</span> opinion was particularly stressed by
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I<span style="">t </span>is understandable why. Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Having proven that he (the plaintiff) had been suspended and
dismissed without cause, contrary to the express provision of the Constitution,
his rein­statement becomes a plain ministerial duty of the Auditor General, a
duty whose performance may be controlled and en­joined by mandamus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no room for discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">Auditor
General </span>is not being directed to perform an act which he may or may not
execute according to his discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
is being asked and enjoined to redress a grievance, to right a wrong done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the payment of the back salary is merely
incidental to and follows reinstatement, this, aside from the parallel and
analogy which may be found in section 260, para­graph 1, Revised Administrative
Code which provides for the payment of back salary upon reinstatement."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
The pronounce­ment therein made by us finds confirmation in the two subsequent
cases <span class="SpellE">abovecited</span>, National Rice and Corn Corp. V. <span class="SpellE">Naric</span> Workers' <st1:place>Union</st1:place> and <span class="SpellE">Tabora</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Montelibano</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then came Tan v. <span class="SpellE">Gimenez</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
which apparently would further strengthen petitioner's stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For we there explicitly announced:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"To deny [petitioner] the right to
collect his back salaries during such period would be tantamount to punishing
him after his exoneration from the charge which caused his dismissal from the
service."</p>

<p class="BODY">This apparently well-entrenched position of petitioner is
illusory however.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision in
Gonzales v. Hernandez,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
cited by respondents is controlling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
cases cited by peti­tioner would be applicable if he were exonerated of the
charge lodged against him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, however, as noted in the appealed order of dismissal,
cited in his own brief and noted by us earlier, an administrative case was
commenced against him by the Auditor General for <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>
of public funds with a decision being rendered by the Commissioner of Civil
Service on February 12, 1953, finding him guilty of the charge, the <span class="GramE">penalty</span> imposed being a fine of one month's pay and a
reprimand, a decision from which he did not bother to appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Such a conviction is fatal to his claim, as the above cited
Gonzalez v. Hernandez will explain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The law which allows payment of back salaries in cases like this
is Section 260 of the Revised Administrative Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A perusal of the decisions of this Court in
cases similar to the case at bar, however, show that back salaries are ordered
paid to an officer or an employee only if he is exonerated of the charge
against him and his suspension or dismissal is found and declared to be
illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, plaintiff
was not completely exonerated, because although the decision of the
Commissioner of Civil Service was modified and the plaintiff was allowed to be
reinstated, the decision ordered him to forfeit two months pay and not to be
given back salaries."</p>

<p class="BODY">That is all then that this appeal presents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could not in any wise, therefore, lay any
valid claim to be considered favorably.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There could have been some plausibility for peti­tioner's invocation of
the appropriate Administrative Code provision which would, on its face, lend
color to his claim for compensation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Once the tyranny of literalness is rejected, however, to paraphrase
Frankfurter, and the decisive feature of the Gonzalez decision, which would
thus give a rational content to the language of the statutory provision,
recognized, petitioner's case falls apart completely.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of dismissal of the lower court dated
<st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="11">November <span style="">9, </span>1964</st1:date>, is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs against
