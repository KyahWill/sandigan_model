				<H3>IN RE: PETITION FOR NATURALIZATION OP ALEJANDRO TAN TIU. ALEJANDRO TAN TIU, PETITIONER-APPELLEE, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR-APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.P., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align=""><div align="justify"><br><p>From a decision of the Court of First Instance of Surigao del Norte, rendered 
on January 15, 1962, granting petitioner Alejandro Tan Tiu's application for 
naturalization, the Republic has appealed.</p>
<p>The petitioner is single, and derives a total income of P230 a month or 
P2,760 annually, as storekeeper of his brother. In his petition for 
naturalization, he mentioned only one place of residence, that is, his present 
residence, at Numancia, Surigao. (Petition, par. 2) As to his place of birth, he 
alleged that on February 27, 1929 he was born in Dapa, Surigao, Philippines 
(Petition, par. 1). Further alleging that he has resided in the Philippines 
since birth, he claimed to be exempt from the requirement of making a 
declaration of intention under Section 5 of the Revised Naturalization Law.</p>
<p>The Solicitor General contends that the applicant is not exempt from a 
declaration of intention; that he fatally omitted to state in his petition all 
his places of residence; and that he has no lucrative trade, profession or 
occupation.</p>
<p>Appellant rightly argues that the petitioner's application cannot be granted. 
During the trial, petitioner testified that from the time of his birth on 
February 27, 1929 until 1948—for a period of almost twenty years—he resided in 
Dapa, Surigao del Norte, his place of birth (Tsn., p. 47). Yet, as stated, he 
did not allege Dapa as one of the places of residence in his petition. Such 
defect is fatal to the application as it violates the mandatory requisite of 
Section 7 of the Naturalization Law providing that not only the present address 
but former places of residence should also be stated in the petition.<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> Anent the contention that the mention of Dapa 
as a place of birth amounts to mention thereof as a place of residence, the same 
is obviously untenable. For place of birth and place of residence are two 
different concepts. Thus, Section 7 of the Naturalization Law requires that the 
petition set forth <em>inter alia</em> "x x x <em>his present and former places 
of residence</em>; his occupation;<em> the place and date of his birth</em>; x x 
x", thereby showing that the two notions abovementioned are distinct, so that 
the data for one cannot supply omission of the other.</p>
<p>Secondly, petitioner's income, as employee of his brother's store, is about 
P230 a month, consisting of salary of P150 a month plus free board and lodging 
equivalent to P80 a month (Tsn., pp. 48-50). This is clearly not lucrative. As 
this Court pointed out, an applicant having a total income of P250 a month,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> or even an unmarried applicant earning 
P300 a month,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> does not meet the 
lucrative trade, profession or occupation requirement for naturalization.</p>
<p>There is thus no further need for Us to dwell on the Solicitor General's 
other assignment of error.</p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is reversed and the instant 
petition for naturalization is hereby denied. Costs against appellee.</p>
