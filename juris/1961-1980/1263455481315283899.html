				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal by the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
from a decision granting the petition of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Santiago Yap for natural­ization in a decision rendered by the lower court on <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal possesses merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its brief as appellant, six errors were assigned as com­mitted
by the lower court, the first of which consisted in its failure to hold that
petitioner Santiago Yap "has not conducted himself in a proper and
irreproachable manner in relation to the community in which he is living."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a failing was manifested by petitioner's
participating or taking part in the national elections held in 1961 as well as
the barrio elections in 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
testimony from a witness, Victor Rodriguez, to the effect that petitioner
"violated the election law prohibiting aliens from electioneering or
helping a candidate."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The witness, who was then a municipal secretary, asserted that petitioner
"campaigned for <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span> because we were together,
he drove a truck, he hauled people to attend the meeting and he even
distributed drinks, offered them to the people who attended the rally * *
*."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner and the witness had the same candidate.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, according to the same witness, who ran for barrio lieutenant in
January of 1962, petitioner "strongly opposed [his] candidacy and he even
supported Billy White.”<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the above testimony was sought to be refuted by
pe­titioner's witness, one Primo L. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, who
testified that while petitioner was present at such an occasion in the 1961
elections, "he was not distributing drinks and he was not the one who
drove the truck."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
When asked whether petitioner "had been helping actively, financially or
materially any candidate in connection with any election" all that the
witness could answer was "I have not known him to be doing so."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
When questioned as to whether petitioner did help the opponent of the witness
Rodriguez when he ran for barrio lieutenant, the answer of the rebuttal witness
was:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I do not think that is the
case because White happens to be my first cousin and he has means of his own,
he can foot his own expenses, * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It is evident that the above answer far from constituting categorical denials
were at the most half­hearted, timid attempts at minimizing what was testified
to as a clear participation in both national and barrio elections.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is likewise noteworthy that petitioner when called as a
rebuttal witness, far from refuting in a detailed and convincing manner the
above accusation, contented himself in saying that it was not true that he
helped actively in the elections of 1961 and it was not true either that he
drove a truck and distributed drinks on the occasion mentioned. There was not
even a denial as to his alleged participation in the barrio elections of 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is even more revealing is that the
six-page brief of petitioner as <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is bereft of
any effort to disprove such an accusation of participation in the two
elections.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the authority of <span class="SpellE">Benluy</span> v. Republic
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
the lower court must be reversed and this petition denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of that case were as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The appellant <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span>
Ho <span class="SpellE">Benluy</span>, a Chinese citizen, filed an application
for naturalization in 1951.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no
opposition to the application on the part of the Govern­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing the applicant presented
evidence in support of his application, including two character witnesses, one
of them, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>,
a resident of <span class="SpellE">Obando</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.
With one exception, <span class="SpellE">Benluy</span> proved that he possessed
all the qualifications for Philippine citizenship and none of the
disqualifications, and the trial court so found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exception is that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>, one of his witnesses, in his endeavor, even
enthusiasm to prove that the applicant had identified himself with the
Filipinos, helped them when asked was very congenial and friendly, said that <span class="SpellE">Benluy</span> even took part in two electoral campaigns in <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, not only persuading some voters connected with is
business but also contributing to the campaign fund of the Liberal
Party."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances,
the evidence of such political activities, being presented by his own witness,
this Court, according to Justice <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span>, who
penned the opinion, was "at the beginning inclined not to attach much
importance to that phase of his residence in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and association with the Filipinos."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was not prosecuted for such violation of the Election Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, at the time of the decision, the
offense had already prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an
attitude, however, did not prevail for the law is clear."</p>

<p class="BODY">A foreigner is prohibited from aiding any candidate directly or indirectly
or taking part in or influencing in any manner any election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The violation of the above provision is
considered a serious election offense.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
As was aptly stated by this Court:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"These provisions of the Revised Election Code may not be taken
lightly, much less ignored. They were intended to discourage foreigners from
taking active part in or otherwise interfering with our elections, under
penalty not only of imprisonment but also of deportation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It might be well be that as already stated,
the evidence about this violation of the election law was given by his own
witness who in all likelihood gave it in good faith and in all friendship to
the applicant to bolster the latter's application for naturalization, without
realizing that by said declaration he was forever closing the door to <span class="SpellE">Benluy's</span> ever becoming a Filipino citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the law must be applied and
enforced."</p>

<p class="BODY">There must be a reiteration of the above ruling; the conclusion
reached merits full and unconditional approval.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The political right of suffrage, so wisely reserved to Filipinos, is of
such transcendental importance that its exercise by a foreigner is to be
condemned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deplorable practice of a
non-citizen, whether by himself or in association with others, to exert
pressure or influence on voters, di­rect or indirect, should not be
countenanced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court would be
failing in its duty if it does not express its displeasure at such alien
interference in the most categorical language. Petitioner having been shown to
have engaged not once but twice in such a prohibited activity, rightly made a
criminal offense under the Revised Election Code, cannot be said to have
conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other objections to his application for citizenship need not
be considered for by such a shortcoming, fatal in its consequences, his
petition ought to have been denied.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is reversed and the
petition of Santiago Yap, alias Yap Yu <span class="SpellE">Hai</span>, is
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With costs against petitioner.</p>
