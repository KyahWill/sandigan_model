<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On May 3, 1955, Perfecto A. <span class="SpellE">Tabora</span> bought from the Lawyers Cooperative Publishing 
Company one complete set of American Jurisprudence consisting of 48 volumes with 
1951 pocket parts, plus one set of American Jurisprudence, General Index, 
consisting of 4 volumes, for a total price of P1<span class="GramE">,675.50</span> 
which, in addition to the cost of freight of P6.90, makes a total of P1 ,082.10. 
<span class="SpellE">Tabora</span> made a partial payment of P300.00, leaving a 
balance of P1<span class="GramE">,382.40</span>. The books were duly delivered and 
receipted for by <span class="SpellE">Tabora</span> on </span><st1:date year="1955" day="15" month="5"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 15, 
1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> in 
his law office at Ignacio building, </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Naga</span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="0"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">midnight</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> of the same date, however, a big 
fire broke out in that locality which destroyed and burned all the buildings 
standing on one whole block including that where the law office and library of 
<span class="SpellE">Tabora</span> were located. As a result, the books bought 
from the company as above stated, together with <span class="SpellE">Tabora's</span> important documents and papers, were burned during 
the conflagration. This unfortunate event was immediately reported by <span class="SpellE">Tabora</span> to the company in a letter he sent on 
</span><st1:date year="1955" day="20" month="5"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 20, 
1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. On 
May 23, the company replied and as a token of good will it sent to <span class="SpellE">Tabora</span> free of charge volumes 75, 76, 77 and 78 of the 
Philippine Hearts. As <span class="SpellE">Tabora</span> failed to pay the monthly 
installments agreed upon on the balance of the purchase price notwithstanding 
the long time that had elapsed, the company demanded payment of the installments 
due, and having failed to pay the same, it commenced the present action before 
the Court of First Instance of Manila for the recovery of the balance of the 
obligation. Plaintiff also prayed that defendant be ordered to pay 25% of the 
amount due as liquidated damages, and the costs of action. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Defendant, in his answer, pleaded 
<i>force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span></i> as a defense. He alleged that the 
books bought from the plaintiff were burned during the fire that broke out in 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Naga</span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> on </span><st1:date year="1955" day="15" month="5"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 15, 
1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, and 
since the loss was due to <i>force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span></i> he 
cannot be held responsible for the loss. He Played that the complaint be 
dismissed and that he be awarded moral damages in the amount of P15<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After due hearing, the court <i>a 
quo</i> rendered judgment the plaintiff. It ordered the defendant to pay the sum 
P1<span class="GramE">,382.40</span>, with legal interest thereon from the filing 
of complaint, plus a sum equivalent to 25% of the total amount due as liquidated 
damages, and the costs of action. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Defendant took the case to the 
Court of Appeals, but the same is now before us by virtue of a certification 
issued by that Court that the case involves only questions of law. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellant bought from <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> one set of American Jurisprudence, including one 
set of general index, payable on installment plan. It was provided in the 
contract that "title to and ownership of the books shall remain with the seller 
until the purchase price shall have been fully paid. Loss or damage to the books 
after delivery to the buyer shall be borne by the buyer." The total price of the 
books, including the cost of freight, amounts to P1<span class="GramE">,682.40</span>. Appellant only made a down payment of P300.00 
thereby leaving a balance of P1<span class="GramE">,382.40</span>. This is now the 
import of the present action aside from liquidated damages. Appellant now 
contends that since it was agreed that the title to and the ownership of the 
books shall remain with the seller until the purchase price shall have been 
fully paid, and the books were burned or destroyed immediately after the 
transaction, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> should be the one to bear the 
loss for, as a rule, the loss is always borne by the owner. Moreover, even 
assuming that the ownership of the books was transferred to the buyer after the 
perfection of the contract the latter should not answer for the loss since the 
same occurred through <i>force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span></i>. Here there 
is no evidence that appellant has contributed in any way to the occurrence of 
the conflagration. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This contention cannot be 
sustained. While as a rule the loss of the object of the contract of sale is 
borne by owner or in case of <i>force <span class="SpellE">mujeure</span></i> the 
one under o to deliver the object is exempt from liability, the application of 
that rule does not here obtain because the law and the contract entered into on 
the matter argue against it. It is true that in the contract entered into 
between the parties the seller agreed that the ownership of the books shall 
remain with it until the purchase price shall have been, fully paid, but such 
stipulation cannot make the seller liable in case of loss not only because such 
was agreed merely to secure the performance by the buyer of his obligation but 
in the very contract it was expressly agreed that "the loss or damage to the 
books after delivery to the buyer shall be borne by the buyer." And such 
stipulation is sanctioned by Article 1504 of our Civil Code, which in part 
provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"(1) Where delivery of goods has 
been made to the buyer or to a <span class="SpellE">bailee</span> for the buyer, 
in pursuance of the contract and the ownership in the goods has been retained by 
the seller merely to secure performance by the buyer of his obligations under 
the contract, the goods are at the buyer's risk from the time of such 
delivery."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Neither can appellant find 
comfort in the claim that since the books were destroyed by fire without any 
fault on his part he should be relieved from the resultant obligation under the 
rule that an obligor should be held exempt from liability when the loss occurs 
thru a fortuitous event. This is because this rule only holds true when the 
obligation consists in the delivery of a <i>determinate</i> thing and there is 
no stipulation holding him liable even in case of fortuitous event. Here these 
qualifications are not present. The obligation does not refer to a determinate 
thing, but is pecuniary in nature, and the obligor bound himself to assume the 
loss after the delivery of the goods to him. In other words, the obligor agreed 
to assume any risk concerning the goods from the time of their delivery, which 
is an exception to the rule provided for in Article 1262 of our Civil Code. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellant likewise contends that 
the court <i>a quo</i> erred in sentencing him to pay attorney's fees. This is 
merely the result of a misapprehension for what the court <i>a quo</i> ordered 
appellant to pay is not 25% of the amount due as attorney's fees, but as 
liquidated damages, which is in line with an express stipulation of the 
contract. We believe, however, that the appellant should not be made to pay any 
damage because his denial to pay the balance of the account is not due to bad 
faith. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision appealed from is 
modified by eliminating that portion which refers to liquidated damages. No 
costs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
