				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company commenced this suit in the Court of 
First Instance of Manila to recover from the Macondray &amp; Co., Inc. and/or 
the Manila Port Service (a subsidiary of the Manila Railroad Company), as 
alternative defendants, the sum of P532.86 representing the damage said to have 
been caused to a cargo of Holy Scriptures shipped from New York City, U.S.A., on 
board the "S.S. Leoville" of the Barber Steamship Lines, Inc. (of which the 
defendant Macondray &amp; Co. is the agent in the Philippines), consigned to the 
Bible House, Philippines, and unloaded at the Port of Manila by the Manila Port 
Service between May 29 and June 2 of 1956. The shipment was insured with 
plaintiff firm, which paid the corresponding loss and then brought this action 
in subrogation of the rights and interests of the consignee.
<p>The parties submitted the case to the lower court for decision solely on the 
basis of their stipulation of facts, from which it appears that on or about 
April 20, 1956, the American Bible Society of New York shipped to Manila 312 
cartons and cases of Holy Scriptures, on board the "S.S. Leoville" of the Barber 
Steamship Lines, Inc., consigned to the order of the Philippine Agency, Bible 
House, Manila; that said shipment was insured by the shipper with the plaintiff; 
that as shown by good order tally sheets, out of said cargo, 309 cases and 
cartons were discharged "complete and in good order" at the Port of Manila from 
May 29 to June 2, 1956, into the possession and custody of defendant Manila Port 
Service in its capacity as arrastre contractor; that the remaining three (3) 
cases were discharged on June 1, 1956, apparently in bad order, but examination 
by marine surveyors showed that their contents were in good order, except that 
the cover of one copy of Holy Scripture was slightly torn and pressed on the 
edge and another copy slightly soiled on the edge; that on June 6, 1956, the 
consignee requested for the inspection of 162 other cases, whereupon it was 
revealed that all were in apparent good condition but with signs of having been 
wet; that upon subsequent examination requested on June 9, 1956, the surveyors 
discovered that another five (5) cases and contents showed signs of having been 
wet with fresh water and injured. The damage was placed at P532.86. It is 
likewise admitted that the responsibility of the Manila Port Service over the 
damaged goods started on the dates they were respectively unloaded into its 
custody, i.e., from May 29 to June 2, 1956.</p>
<p>Upon the foregoing admissions, the lower court rendered judgment, ordering 
defendants Manila Port Service and Manila Railroad Company to pay the plaintiff 
the sum of P532.86, with legal interest thereon from the filing of the complaint 
until fully paid, and absolving defendant Macondray &amp; Co., Inc. from the 
complaint.</p>
<p>After the denial of their motion for reconsideration, defendants Manila Port 
Service and Manila Railroad Company interposed their appeal to the Court of 
Appeals; but as the case only involved questions of law, the appellate court 
certified the same to this Court. The certification is proper, considering that 
the case had been submitted for decision by the parties on stipulation of 
facts.</p>
<p>There is no merit in the appeal. Here and below, the only issue raised 
revolves around the question as to when the damage arose to the cases received 
in good order by appellants; for if it occurred while the goods were still on 
board the vessel, then the liability should attach to the carrier; but if the 
damage happened when said goods were already discharged by and taken into the 
custody of the Manila Port Service, then the latter should answer for the loss. 
Resolving the question solely upon the stipulation of facts of the parties, 
there is no alternative but to hold the appellants liable. It was admitted that, 
except for three cases noted as received in bad order (and which are not now in 
question), the entire shipment was received from the carrier by the appellant 
Port Service "complete and in good order" Stip., par. 2(a) and not merely in 
<i>apparent</i> good condition, as it now urges. Later examination of these 
goods upon request of the consignee before taking delivery having showed that 
the contents of some of the cases were actually damaged, but without any showing 
when such damage occurred, the inference obviously is that it happened while in 
the appellants' possession, since the cases in question were received by it in 
good order when unloaded from the ship. It may be noted that the questioned 
shipment was in the possession of the appellants for about ten days, more or 
less, prior to its delivery to the consignee. By law, loss or damage while in 
the possession of an obligor is presumed due to its fault in the absence of 
contrary proof (Civil Code, Art. 265). It was incumbent upon appellant Port 
Service to rebut this legal presumption, and it has failed to do so.</p>
<p>The terms of the management contract entered into by and between the Bureau 
of Customs and the appellants have nothing to do with this case, because they 
were not properly presented in the court below, and therefore cannot be 
considered for the first time on appeal.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the 
appellants.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, 
Reyes, J.B.L., Paredes, De Leon</i> and <i>Natividad, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
