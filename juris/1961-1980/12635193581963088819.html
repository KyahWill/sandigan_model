				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In this appeal from the decision of the Court
of Appeals reversing the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila,
Branch III, in its Civil Case No.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>56528, the question presented is whether the said Branch III has the
power or authority to annul a judgment rendered by Branch XVII of the same
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The spouses Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dulap</span> and Dolores <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span>, petitioners herein, were owners, of a parcel of
land in <span class="SpellE">Novaliches</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>, containing an area of
five thousand (5,000) square meters, more or less, and co­vered by TCT No.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>66821.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Through some happening which later became the subject of a criminal
action, the <span class="SpellE">Dulaps</span> duplicate certificate of title
came into the hands of herein private respondent Asian Surety &amp; In­surance
Co., Inc., which had in its possession, as well, a registered deed of mortgage
in its favor allegedly signed by the <span class="SpellE">Dulaps</span> and
ratified before a notary public, covering the same property.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The obli­gation which was the subject matter
of the mortgage having fallen due, private respondent sent a letter of demand
to the <span class="SpellE">Dulaps</span> at <span class="SpellE">Maysilo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, the address given
in the deed of mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A copy of the
letter was also sent to the same spouses at <span class="SpellE">Bagumbong</span>,
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
which was the address of the <span class="SpellE">Dulaps</span> appearing in the
transfer certificate or title.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
latter copy of the letter was received by the <span class="SpellE">Dulaps</span>,
who, knowing that they had not obtained a loan from private respondent, nor
mortgaged their land to it, ignored the same.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>What they did, instead, was to file a criminal complaint for forgery
against the person whom they believed had deceived them into delivering to him
their copy of TCT No.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">66821, </span>and was responsible for the
forged deed of mortgage.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the <span class="SpellE">Dulaps</span>' failure to
answer the letter of demand, Asian Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc. filed with
the Court of First Instance of Manila an action for fore­closure of the
mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed as
Civil Case No. 52415 and assigned to Branch XVII.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon private respondent's request, summons
was issued through publica­tion in a newspaper.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Dulaps</span> failed
to file an answer, hence were declared in default.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After trial <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u>,
de­cision was rendered by the court on <st1:date year="1963" day="9" month="5">May
 <span style="">9, </span>1963</st1:date>, ordering
the <span class="SpellE">Dulaps</span> to pay the Asian Surety &amp; Insurance
Co., Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">the</span>
sum of P10,000.00 with interest, as well as attorney's fees and costs.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The judgment having become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, a writ of execution was issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sheriff's sale took place on <st1:date year="1963" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1963</st1:date>, at which herein private respondent was
declared the highest bidder with its bid of P12, 500.00.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A sheriff's certifi­cate of sale was issued
on the same date, and, thereafter, private respondent filed a motion <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> for confirmation of the sale and issuance of a
writ of possession.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Dulaps</span>, learning of the said motion, filed an opposition
there­to, expressing their surprise over the judgment and alleging that they
had never executed a deed of mortgage in favor of private respondent, nor had
they been properly summoned in the foreclosure suit, as the summons therein
issued was im­proper.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They also alleged
that the only paper which they had received in connection with the action was
the notice of the sheriff's sale, and that upon receipt thereof they began
preparing a draft of a complaint for annulment <span style="">of </span>the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
court, in its order of <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="2">February <span style="">7, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>de­nied the opposition to the
confirmation of the sale and granted the writ of possession prayed for by
private res­pondent, without prejudice to the filing by the <span class="SpellE">Dulaps</span>
of their projected suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1964</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Dulaps</span> filed an action for an­nulment of the
judgment in said Civil Case No.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>52415,
on the ground that the said judgment was void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span> for want of jurisdiction over their
persons as defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was
docketed as Civil Case No.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">56528 and assigned to Branch III of the same court of first
instance.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1965</st1:date>, the court rendered a decision
annulling the judg­ment in Civil Case No.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">52415 on the ground that the decid­ing court (Branch
XVII) did not acquire jurisdiction over the persons of the defendants therein
for want of proper service of summons.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court (Branch III) was of the <span style="">opinion
that service </span><span style="">of summons by
publication </span><span style="">requires that a copy
of the summons and the order of publication be deposited in the post office,
postage prepaid, direct­ed to the defendant by registered mail at his last
known address; but that in this case the same were sent to the defendants by
registered mail at <span class="SpellE">Maysilo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, which was the address alleged in the
complaint, although the undisputed fact was that the <span class="SpellE">Dulaps</span>
had always been residing at <span class="SpellE">Deparo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Asian Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc. appealed the de­cision to
the Court of Appeals, which, as stated at the beginning of this opinion,
reversed the decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch
III.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this petition for review by <i>certiorari</i>
filed by the <span class="SpellE">Dulaps</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In concluding that one
branch of the Court of First Instance of Manila has </span><span style="">no </span><span style="">jurisdiction to annul the judg­ment of another branch of the same
court, respondent Court of Appeals relied on the decision of this Court in <span class="SpellE">Mas</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Dumara-og</span>,
G.R.No.L-16252, September 29, 1964 (12 SCRA 34), where this Court held that
"the power to open, modify or vacate a judgment is not only possessed by,
but is restricted to the court in which the judgment was rendered”.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners contend that the doctrine in <span class="SpellE"><u>Dumara-og</u></span> finds</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">no application in this
case, because while there the judgment sought to be annulled was rendered by
the Court of First Instance of Iloilo and the action for annulment was filed
with another court (the Court of First Instance of Antique), although belonging
to the same judicial district, here both Branches XVII and III belong to the
same Court of First Instance of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But then <span class="GramE">came</span> the case of J.M.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Tuason</span></span><span class="GramE"> &amp; Co., Inc. vs. Torres, etc et al., G.R.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>No.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>L-24717, December </span>4, 1967 <span style="">(21
SCRA 1169), where this Court, holding that "the jurisdiction to annul a
judgment of a branch of the Court of First Instance belongs solely to the very
same branch which rendered the judgment," en­joined the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <u>sitting at <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></u>,
from taking cognizance of, or acting in, </span>a <span style="">suit to annul a judgment rendered by the Court of First In­stance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Branch IV, <u>sitting at <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City</u>, That case was followed by Sterling Investment Corporation, et al. vs.
Ruiz, etc, et al., G.R.No.L-30694, October 31, 1969 (30 SCRA 318), where this
Court likewise enjoined Branch XV of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> from taking cognizance of an action filed with it to
an a judgment of Branch VI of the same court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In all three cases, the underlying philosophy is, as expressed in
the <span class="SpellE"><u>Dumara-og</u></span> case, the "policy of
judicial stability," to the end that the judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction may not be interfered with by any <span style="">court of concurrent jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court feels that this is as good an occasion as any to re-examine
the doctrine laid down in the aforementioned cases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In an action to annul the
judgment of </span>a <span style="">court, the plain­tiff's
cause of action springs from the alleged nullity of the judgment based on one
ground or another, particularly fraud, which fact affords the plaintiff a right
to judicial inter­ference in his behalf.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In such a suit the cause of action is entirely different from that in
the action which gave rise to the judgment sought to be annulled, for a direct
attack against a final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment is not
incidental to, but is the main object of, the proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The causes of action in the two cases being
distinct and separate from each other, there is no plausible reason why the
venue of the action to annul the judgment should necessarily follow the venue
of the previous action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rules on
venue pro­vided in Section 2, Rule </span>4 <span style="">of the Revised Rules of Court, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>Venue in Courts of First
Instance.-(a) Real actions</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-
Actions affecting title to, or for recovery of possession, or for partition or
condemnation of, or foreclosure of mortgage on, real property, shall be
commenced and tried in <span style="">the province where
the property or any part there­of lies.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Personal actions</u><span class="GramE">.-</span>
All other actions may be commenced and tried where the defendant or any of the
defendants resides or may be found, or where the plaintiff or any of the
plaintiffs resides, at the election of the plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Actions against nonresidents</u><span class="GramE">.-</span> If any of the defendants does not reside and is not found
in the Philippines, and the action af­fects the personal status of the
plaintiff, or any property of the defendant located in the Philippines, the
action may be commenced and tried in the province where the plaintiff resides
or the property or any portion there­of, is situated or found,"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE"><span style="">should</span></span><span style=""> not be
disregarded simply to prevent one court of first instance or one branch thereof
from taking cogni­zance of an action to annul the judgment of another court of
concurrent jurisdiction or of another branch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The present doctrine
which postulates that one court or one branch of a court may not annul the
judgment of ano­ther court or branch, not only opens the door to a viola­tion
of Section 2 of Rule </span>4, but also limits <span style="">the opportu­nity for the application of said rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, for instance, the action is a personal
one under Section 2, paragraph (b), </span>under the prevailing doctrine the
action can only be com­menced and tried in the place where the first action was
tried, regardless of "where the defendant or any of the de­fendants
resides or may be found, or where the plaintiff or any of the plaintiffs
resides." This can very well result in the difficulties precisely sought
to be avoided by the rules; for it could be that at the time of the filing of
the second action for annulment, neither the plaintiff nor the defendant
resides in the same place where either or both of them did when the first
action was commenced and tried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
present doctrine likewise unduly deprives the parties of the right expressly
given them under Rule 4, Section <span style="">3, </span>to
change or transfer venue from one province to another by written agreement
? a right conferred upon them for their own convenience and to minimize
their expenses in the litigation – and renders innocuous the provision on
waiver of improper venue in Section 4.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, Section <span style="">5 </span>ex­plicitly
provides that Rule 4 "shall not apply in those cases where a specific rule
or law provides otherwise." In none of the three (3) cases under
consideration is any <u>specific rule or law</u> pointed to, providing that an
action for annul­ment of a judgment should be commenced and tried in the same
court or branch that tried the action which gave rise to the judgment sought to
be annulled.</p>

<p class="BODY">The cases of <span class="SpellE"><u>Dumara-og</u></span>, <u>J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, &amp; Co., Inc.</u> and <st1:city><st1:place><u>Sterling</u></st1:place></st1:city><u>
Investment al</u>., <u>supra</u>, would give the impression that when a suit to
annul the judgment of a court of first instance or of a branch thereof is filed
with another court of first instance or another branch of the same court, the
question of jurisdiction inevitably comes up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This question was squarely ruled upon by this Court in the decision
penned by Mr. Justice (now Chief Justice) Roberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
<span style="">in </span><span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
<span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Ursua</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Pelayo</span>, G.R.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>L-13285, <st1:date year="1960" day="18" month="4">April 18, <span style="">1960</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>(107 Phil., 622), some four <span style="">(4) </span>years before the <span class="SpellE"><u>Dumara-og</u></span> decision, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"It would seem from this order that the lower court considered
itself devoid of authority or ju­risdiction to annul an order issued or
decision rendered by a judge of another branch of the same court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This view is untenable, for the jurisdiction
of all courts in the Philippines, insofar as the <span style="">authority </span>thereof depends upon the nature of the litigation, is
defined in the Revised Judicia­ry Act, pursuant to which courts of first
instance shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over civil cases the
subject matter of which are not capable of pecuniary estimation, and an action
for <span style="">the annulment </span>of a judgment and
an order of a court of justice belongs to this category.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case cited in the order appealed from (<span class="SpellE">Montesa</span> vs. Manila Cordage Co., <u>supra</u>) is not point,
for the issue involved therein was whether the <span style="">Court of First Instance of Manila, may <u>indi­rectly</u> - not in an
action for the specific purpose of annulling a judgment - and by <u>interlocutory</u>
order, or a writ of preliminary injunction, set aside an attachment levied in
pursuance of an order issued in another case pending before another branch of
the same </span>court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is not <span style="">the nature of the proceeding before </span><span style="">us."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">To hold that a court or a branch thereof
has no authority or jurisdiction to annul a judgment simply because that
judgment was rendered by another court of concurrent ju­risdiction or by
another branch, would, therefore, prac­tically amount to judicial legislation,
affecting, as it will, the provisions of the Revised Judiciary Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an action to annul a final judgment or
order, the choice<span style=""> </span>of which court
the action should be filed with is not left to the parties; by legal mandate
the action should be filed with the court of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question is in what place (with what
particular court of first instance) the action should be commenced and tried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question, as discussed above, is actually
one of venue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present case venue
was properly laid, because it is averred in the complaint, which was filed with
the Court of First Instance of Manila, and it is not disputed, that the
defendant cor­poration has its principal place of business and office address
in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In support of the
principle of judicial stability, <span class="SpellE"><u>Dumara-og</u></span>
cites the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The power to open, modify, or vacate a judgment is not only
possessed by, but is res­tricted to the court in which the judgment was rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is regarded as an elementary prin­ciple of
high importance in the administration of justice that the judgment of a court
of com­petent jurisdiction may not be opened, modified, or vacated by any court
of concurrent jurisdic­tion." (30-A, American Jurisprudence 605)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Assuming that the principle is soundly
supported by the au­thority cited above, the said authority might suffice to
support the ruling in <span class="SpellE"><u>Dumara-og</u></span>, for there two
distinct courts of first instance were involved.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the sub­sequent cases of <u>J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc.</u> and <u>Sterling In­vestment
Corporation, et al</u>., were different: in each of them, one branch of a court
of first Instance was acting on a suit to annul the judgment of another branch
of the same court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently having in
mind the above-quoted authority, this Court, in the said two subsequent cases,
applied with equal force the doctrine in <span class="SpellE"><u>Dumara-og</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But the citation as quoted above, while it
may be valid in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Dumara-og</u></span> case, may not
find application in the present case, for it is further stated that:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">This</span> rule does not apply, how­ever, to different departments
of the same court." (<st1:state><st1:place><u>Id</u>.</st1:place></st1:state>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The authority itself, therefore, cited in
<span class="SpellE"><u>Dumara-og</u></span>, ex­cludes the different branches of
the same court from the application of the principle that "the judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction may not be opened, modified, or vacated by
any court of concurrent jurisdiction." Hence, there is no parallelism
between the <span class="SpellE"><u>Dumara-og</u></span><u> </u>case on one hand,
and the <u>J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc. and Sterling
Invest­ment Corporation, et al</u>. cases on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With parti­cular reference to the different
branches of a court of first instance, the correct view is that expressed in <span class="SpellE">Ba­calso</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Ramolete</span>,
etc., et al., L-22488, October 26, 1967 (21 SCRA 519), to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The
various branches of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
under the Fourteenth Judi­cial District, are a coordinate and co-equal courts,
and the totality of which is only one Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nor may it be said that the question herein raised in­volves
interference on the part of Branch III with the judg­ment rendered by Branch
XVII, both of the same Court of First Instance of Manila, since the latter
court, in con­firming the foreclosure sale and denying the opposition thereto
interposed by herein petitioners, had expressly reserved unto them the filing
of their projected action for annulment of judgment.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That, precisely, was what petitioners did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not a case where one branch of the same
court has sought to interfere in the exercise of jurisdiction by another branch
of the same court over a case still under consideration by the latter; it is
simply one where, after a case had been finally termi­nated in one branch, an
action to annul judgment was filed in another branch.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The cause of action in one is different from
that obtaining in the other.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our conclusion must therefore be that a court of first instance
or a branch thereof has the authority and jurisdic­tion to take cognizance of, and
to act in, a suit to annul a final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
judgment or order rendered by another court of first instance or by another
branch of the same court.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The policy of
judicial stability, which underlies the doctrine laid down in the cases of <span class="SpellE"><u>Dumara-og</u></span>, <u>J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
&amp; Co., Inc</u>. and <u>Sterling Investment Corporation, et al</u>., <u>supra</u>,
should be held subordinate to an orderly administra<span style="">tion of justice based on the existing rules of procedure and the
law.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apposite is what this Court said
in <span class="SpellE">Garchitorena</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Sotelo</span>,
74 Phil., 25, 32, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Petitioners vehemently invoke reasons of public policy which
favor the stability of ju­dicial decisions.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Suffice it for us to say that such reasons are mute in the presence of
fraud, which the law abhors."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It may be argued that the abandonment of the doctrine in <span class="SpellE"><u>Dumara-og</u></span><u>,</u> etc. may lead to chaos, nay, even
enmity, among the judges of the different courts whose judgments or orders
become the subject of annulment proceedings be­fore other courts of concurrent
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The matter should,
however, be viewed academically and objectively.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, it may be said that to
limit the au­thority to annul a judgment to the very branch that ren­dered the
same, may, in some cases, result in a failure of justice, for if the branch
that tries the annulment case is presided over by the same judge who penned the
decision sought to be annulled, the tendency might be for the said judge to
uphold the validity of his judg­ment regardless of the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This consideration, however, is not one
among those that have led this Court to arrive at the new doctrine, for we have
great and abid­ing faith in the sense of justice and responsibility of the
members of the judiciary.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The next question which
we should now proceed to de­termine is whether the judgment rendered by Branch
III is correct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In arriving at the conclusion that Branch XVII did not acquire
jurisdiction over the persons of the <span class="SpellE">Dulaps</span>, the
court (Branch III) held that there was no proper service of summons upon the
defendants.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The pertinent provision of
the Revised Rules of Court in connection with service of summons by publication
is found in Rule 14, Section 21, which requires as proof, among others,
"an affidavit showing the deposit of a copy of the summons and order for
publication in the post office, postage prepaid, directed to the defendant by
registered mail to his last known ad­dress." It is not disputed that copy
of the summons and order for publication were directed to the defendants ­<span class="SpellE">Dulaps</span> by registered mail to <span class="SpellE"><u>Maysilo</u></span><u>,
<span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span></u>, and
that the said address is the one appearing in the complaint filed by Asian
Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc. against the <span class="SpellE">Dulaps</span>,
which address was in turn copied from the deed of mortgage purportedly executed
by the <span class="SpellE">Dulaps</span> in favor of the plaintiff; that the
defendants had - even previous to the filing of the case against them - always
been residing at <span class="SpellE"><u>Deparo</u></span><u>, <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City</u>; and that the said defendants did not
receive said copy of the summons and order for publica­tion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the circumstances, we
must uphold the judgment of Branch III.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It will be recalled in this connection that sometime before the filing
of its complaint, the plain­tiff had sent two letters of demand to the <span class="SpellE">Dulaps</span>: one addressed to <span class="SpellE">Maysilo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, and the
other to <span class="SpellE">Bagumbong</span>, </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Caloocan</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">, the latter being the <span class="SpellE">Dulaps</span>
address as appearing in their duplicate certificate of title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first was not received by the addressees;
the second was received by them.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
only goes to show: (a) that the <span class="SpellE">Dulaps</span> were - even at
that time - already residing in <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City and not
in <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>; and </span>that
although the plaintiff obviously knew this, it chose to use the said <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> address in its complaint, with the consequence that
copy of the summons and the order for pub­lication were sent thereto, which
address now turns out to be fictitious, because it was merely used in the deed
of mortgage precisely disowned by the <span class="SpellE">Dulaps</span> as a
forgery piece.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Copy of the summons and
the order for publication not having been directed to the defendants to their
last known address, which in the premises should be <span class="SpellE">Deparo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ca­loocan</span> City, <span style="">or,
</span>at the very least, <span class="SpellE">Bagumbong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City, but certainly not <span class="SpellE">Maysilo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, there was,
as the trial court held, a fatal defect in the service of summons.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Cf. <span class="SpellE">Dy</span>
