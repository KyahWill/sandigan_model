<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that at about 5:30 o'clock in the after­noon of
February 19, 1969, while Dionisia Sing and her husband, Francisco Sing, were in
the ground floor of their house located at Barrio Lurogan, Valencia, Bukidnon,
four (4) men armed with firearms came towards them shouting:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Civilians do not come near because we
are PC Rangers, we are after the Chinese only."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
When they were sufficiently near, one of the armed men, the fat one, ordered
them:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Do not move as we are PC
Rangers," while his companions went up to the house of Francisco Sing,
firing shots into the air as they went.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fat man then grabbed Francisco Sing by his undershirt, "on the
neckside" and brought him a few meters away from his house towards the
near­by bodega owned by one Vicente <span style="">Lim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The man holding Francisco Sing
demanded:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Where is your
money?" and Francisco Sing replied:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"I have no money." When Francisco Sing answered that he had no
money, he was slapped and kicked on the back and <span style="">then shot.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Upon seeing her husband shot, Dionisia Sing

scattered on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her money
amounting to P60.00 and her wrist watch valued at P30.00 were taken by
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While she was lying on<span style=""> </span>the floor, she heard the men demanding
money from Tita Sing and Tan Pao Sing in the other room.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Tita Sing, the sister of Francisco Sing, who was cooking supper
at the kitchen when the armed men arrived, went up­stairs, upon hearing a shot,
thinking that the children of Dionisia Sing were playing with a toy gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching the second floor, she was met
by an armed man who ordered her to <span class="GramE">lie</span> flat, face
downward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She obeyed him because the
armed man kicked her on the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was then brought to a bedroom where she and her mother, Tan Pao Sing, were
divested of their money, neck­laces, earrings and watch, at gun point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After an hour, the arms of Tita Sing and her
mother were tied behind their backs and they were brought downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, Tita Sing was brought by the armed men
to the house of Adolfo Pechora, about 30 meters away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four armed men then went upstairs leaving
Tita Sing in the yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She managed to
untie herself and flee to a nearby creek, where she hid until the robbers left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she returned to their house at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="20">8:00 o'clock p.m.</st1:time> she saw her brother,
Francisco Sing, already dead and her other brothers and sisters crying.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>

saw one of the robbers and pointed him out to the PC saying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"That's the man who killed my

the PC arrested him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man was Protacio

at Lurogan; and "Natong Tejada" of Binggo and Bangka Mayor, Poblacion,
Valencia, Bukidnon, who drove the jeep they used in going to Barrio

his wife first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He advised Jose Can­tillo
to come back the next day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose Cantillo
did return the next day and did buy his two pigs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1969</st1:date>,
he was in the market place of Ma­simag (now called Barrio New Nonongan) selling

same day, while he was in the store waiting for transportation in order to go
home, two PC jeeps arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>PC Sgt. Tihon
approached him and told him that the PC captain was calling for him (accused).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, he went to the PC captain, who ordered
him to raise his hands, and poked a pistol at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he was handcuffed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Capt. Reyes did not allow him to talk as he
(Capt. Reyes) wanted to ask him some­thing.<span style="">&nbsp;

dagger and slapped his shoulder with it.<span style="">&nbsp;

 <st1:country-region>Valencia</st1:country-region></st1:place>, Bukidnon where
he was ordered to identify the dead Chinaman.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to the accused, "When we were inside the house, I told
everybody that I did not know or recognize the dead Chinese and I even told the
dead man that if you have a soul you must let your relatives know if I am the
one who killed you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, the relatives
of the dead man placed the dead person before me and since there is nothing
they could do, the persons outside shouted:<span style="">&nbsp;
