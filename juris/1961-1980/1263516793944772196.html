First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> rendered in favor of private
respondent Martin <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span> as therein plaintiff
against petitioners, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Siayngca</span> and Julio <span class="SpellE">Siayngco</span> as

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
background of the case follows:-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Respondent Martin <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span> as plaintiff in the trial court originally sought
the annulment on the ground of extrinsic fraud of a decision of the Justice of
the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Dagami</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>,
<span style="">in Civil
Case 46 thereof, wherein the <span class="SpellE">Siayngco</span> spouses had
obtained a money judgment against said <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span> by
virtue of a confession of judgment entered by <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span>
in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Siayngco</span> spouses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to <span class="SpellE">Costibolo's</span>
complaint in the trial court, he had con­fessed judgment in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Siayngco</span> spouses in the Justice of <span style="">the Peace Court case, on the representation, promise and assur</span></span><span style="">ance of the latter that they would not ask
for a writ of execution of the judgment within five years from the date of the
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span>
further alleged in his complaint that as soon as he had confessed judgment in
favor of the <span class="SpellE">Siayngco</span> spouses and had lost the right
to appeal from the judgment or to seek relief <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
the <span class="SpellE">Siayngco</span> spouses had secured from the Justice of
the Peace </span><span style="">Court a writ of execution of the judgment, pursuant to which his
properties were attached and advertised for sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further averred that he had filed a
petition for relief from judgment under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court but his
petition was denied because it had been submitted after the <span class="SpellE">reglamentary</span>
six-months period; the case involving this petition for relief, which appears
to have been first erroneously filed as a motion with the Justice of the Peace
Court in Civil Case 46, was appealed to and docket­ed as Civil Case 1935 of the
Court of First Instance which like­wise denied the petition for the same
reason.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span> finally
asked for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span><u>

sheriff's sale of his properties, which was granted by the trial court, and for
P5,500.00 by way </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">actual and moral damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In due course, the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Siayngco</span></span><span style=""> </span>spouses, represented by peti­tioner
Julio <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Siayngco</span></span><span style="">, </span>a member of the bar, filed an Answer to <span class="SpellE">Costibolo's</span>
complaint, denying the alleged fraud, pleading <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">adjudicata</span></u></span>
by virtue of the judgment of the Justice of the Peace Court in Civil Case 46 as

<p class="BODY">Hearing was conducted by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span> had
submitted his evidence and rested his case, the <span class="SpellE">Siayngco</span>
spouses orally moved for dismissal of the complaint on the ground that since
the supposed fraud was committed in 1955 and the original complaint had been
filed by them against <span class="SpellE">Cos­tibolo</span> in the Justice of
the Peace Court on March 4, 1954 and the judgment of said Court had been
rendered two months later on May 31, 1954, the fraud alleged by <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span> could not have <span class="SpellE">possbily</span>
influenced the said judgment and make out a case for its annulment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Siayngco</span>
spouses expressly reserved their right to present their evidence should their
motion be denied by the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial
court however informed them that it <span style="">could not grant such
reservation and announced that it would reserve </span><span style="">its resolution so that it would have time to
peruse and study their motion for dismissal or demurrer to evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court thereafter rendered its
judgment denying the <span class="SpellE">Siayngcos</span>' motion to dismiss and
at the same time annulling the judgments of the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Dagami</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, in Civil Case 46,
and of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> <span style="">in </span>Civil Case No. 1935, in favor of
the <span class="SpellE">Siayngcos</span>; it sentenced the <span class="SpellE">Siayngco</span>
spouses furthermore to pay to <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span> the amount of
</span><span style="">P4,</span><span style="">000.00 in actual
and moral damages and attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

plaintiff Martin <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span> and his wife <span class="SpellE">Constancia</span> <span class="SpellE">Pasagui</span> obtained on
August 29, 1950, a loan of TWO HUNDRED PESOS (P200. 00) from defendant <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Siayngco</span> at 14%
interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1952, they <span style="">paid fully that
debt including interests, in the total amount of P312.00, the first payment of
P100.00 having been made by the plaintiff Martin <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span>
himself and his wife <span class="SpellE">Constancia</span> <span class="SpellE">Pasagui</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They asked for a receipt for that payment but
defendant <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Siayngco</span>
told that there was no need for it, as they were relatives and there was
confidence between them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All what was
done was to write a note on the back of the receipt of the said loan, stating
that P100.00 was paid by the plaintiff and his wife on that occasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next payment was in another amount of
P100.00 handed to defendant <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Siayng­co</span> by the said <span class="SpellE">Constancia</span> <span class="SpellE">Pasagui</span> who was accompanied by her brother <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pasagui</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similar note was written on the back of the
aforementioned receipt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third
payment was still another P100.00 by the same last two persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the latter insisted in having a receipt
for the said payment, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Siayng­co</span> repeated that
there was no need because they were relatives and they trusted each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the third payment was again annotated on
the back of the said receipt like the two previous ones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the annota­tions were signed by <span class="SpellE">Constancia</span> <span class="SpellE">Pasagui</span>, <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pasagui</span> saw the
annotations written on the back of the receipt far the first, second and third
payments of P100.00 each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last
payment in the amount of P12.00 was made </span>by <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Isabelo</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span>, brother of the herein plaintiff All these
payments were made during the year 1952.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When asked by the Court why </span><span style="">did they not require the defendant <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span>
M. <span class="SpellE">Siayngco</span> to sign the annotations on the back of
the said receipt, witness <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pasagui</span> answered that they did not like to press too much
the defendant <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Siayngco</span>,
because she was hold­ing fast to the fact that they were relatives and there
should be no mistrust between them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
they res­pect her and her husband, their uncle Atty. <span class="SpellE">Siayngco</span>,
they were ashamed and afraid to insist further.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Inspite</span> of the payments made, the
defendants filed a complaint for the collection still of the same debt, with
the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Dagami</span> on March 1,
1954, praying for the payment of the said loan of TWO HUNDRED PESOS (P200.00),
NINETY-EIGHT PESOS (P98.00) as agreed <span style="">inter­</span>ests
from August 29, 1950 up to March 1, 1954, plus the interests from the latter
dated until it is fully paid, and ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY PESOS (P120.00), as
damages together with the costs, making a total sum of FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTEEN
PESOS (P418.00), exhibit 'A', page 1 of civil case No. 1935.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff herein who was defendant in
that case, answered the complaint stating that he had already paid fully the
said loan, exhibit 'B’, page 2 of civil case no. 1935.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meantime, plaintiff sent his brother-in-law <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pasagui</span> to the herein
defendants, who were plaintiffs in that case in the Justice of the Peace Court,
to settle amicably the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While he
had already overpaid their debt, but being a teacher and his wife is related to
herein defendant Atty. Julio <span class="SpellE">Siayngco</span> who is their
uncle, he wanted to avoid litigation which would be more costly for them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pasagui</span>
conferred with both defendants and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Siayngco</span>
told him that if his brother-in-law, the herein plaintiff Martin <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span>, would just confess judgment, he would not ask
for the execution thereof within five years, thereby giving <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span>
that same period to pay gradually the said amount of FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTEEN
PESOS (P418.00).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pasagui</span>
returned and informed his brother-in-law <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span> of
the proposal of the defendants, and <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span> agreed,
so he submitted a confession of judgment in that case, marked exhibit 'C', page
10 of the record civil case No. 1935.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the Justice of the Peace of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Dagami</span></span><span style=""> </span>rendered a decision for the payment of the said amount of P418.00
by the def­endant, page 11, same <span class="SpellE">expediente</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meantime <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pasagai</span></span><span style=""> </span>went to Manila he was away and after
the judgment became final, Atty. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Siayngco</span></span><span style="">, in violation of
his promise and the agree­ment between the parties in that case, requested the
execution of the judgment, exhibit ‘E', </span><span style="">page 12.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Execution was issued by the Justice of the
Peace on </span><st1:date year="1954" day="21" month="9"><span style="">September 21, </span><span style="">1954</span></st1:date><span style=""> exhibits </span><span style="">'F' </span><span style="">an</span><span style="">d 'F-1’, pages 13
and 15.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Sheriff complied with the
writ of execution, back of page 14 and exhibit 'G', page 16.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the execution was levied by the sheriff,
Martin <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span> was surprised, so he wrote to his
brother-in-law <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pasagui</span>
in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> about the last
development of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the
latter's return to <span class="SpellE">Dagami</span>, </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Leyte</span></span></st1:place><span style="">, he filed a
motion to set aside judgment which was denied by the Justice of the Peace as
his decision has long become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
case was brought to this Court on Appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court also denied the appeal for lack of jurisdiction as the same
was filed <span class="SpellE">longafter</span> the judgment of the Justice of the
Peace had become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, the
present case, civil No. 1993, was filed for the annulment of judgment of the
Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Dagami</span>, </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Leyte</span></span></st1:place><span style="">.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“In his desperation the plaintiff filed the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He even wrote a complaint to the Secretary of
justice against Atty. Julio <span class="SpellE">Siayn­gco</span> for
misconduct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A copy of that complaint was
marked as exhibit “E”.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"During the
presentation of </span>the evidence by the plaintiff, his attorney demanded the
pro­duction <span style="">of the receipt for </span>the
aforecited loan by the defendants, but <span style="">Atty.
Julio <span class="SpellE">Siayngco</span> </span>denied <span style="">their having it </span>in their possession and its annotations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"From the facts <span style="">above related, it is clear that the
misrepresentations proved had induced defendant Martin <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span>
in </span>civil case no. 1935 of this.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Court, now plaintiff in the present case, to confess judgment in the
Justice of <span style="">the
Peace Court </span>of <span class="SpellE">Dagami</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>, on the agreed condition that it shall
not be executed within five <span style="">years </span>so as to afford time to the <span style="">defendant to pay the amount of P418.00 within
that period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the evidence
that promise was given because <span class="SpellE">Constancia</span> <span class="SpellE">Pasagui</span>, </span>wife of <span style="">plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span>
is closely related to the def­endants herein, being a niece of defendant Atty.
Julio </span><span class="SpellE">Siayngco</span>, and <span style="">because </span>Martin <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span> is a teacher<span style=""> <span style="">with a modest salary, he preferred to pay
that amount gradually and avoid litigation which would be more costly,
according to him, although he had already paid </span>fully the original loan
of P200.00 with its interests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
payments in the total <span style="">amount </span>of
P312.00 having been established by the plaintiff and his witness
brother-in-law, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pasagui</span>,
in the absence of evidence disproving them, are facts <span style="">considered duly proven.</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The plaintiff only came to know the misre­presentations made
by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Siayngco</span> that he would not ask for the
execution of judgment of <span style="">the Justice of
the Peace Court within five years, when the sheriff levied execution upon the
properties </span>of <span style="">the </span>plaintiff sometime in 1954 and <span style="">for that reason his brother-in-law <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pasagui</span>, who was then already an attorney, </span>filed a
motion to set <span style="">aside </span>judgment on
April 9, 1955, page 20, record of civil case No. 7935, <span style="">founded on fraud 'committed by inducing defendant Martin <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span> to confess judgment.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This misrepresentations which has not been </span>disproved
constitute fraud.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The period within which to file an action <span style="">based on </span>fraud is four years according
to Art. 1146, No. 1 of the New Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since the <span style="">misrepresentations made by the defendant Julio <span class="SpellE">Siayngco</span>,
according to the evidence, was only discovered </span><span style="">after he had requested the levy of <span style="">execution against the defendant Martin <span class="SpellE">Costi­bolo</span>
in 1954 and this case was </span>filed <span style="">on
August </span>30, 1955, the action involved herein was presented within the
legal period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the motion to <span style="">dismiss must be, as it hereby is denied.<o:p></o:p></span></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"From the nature of the transaction as gleaned from the
original complaint, exhibit 'A', filed by the defendants in civil case No. <span style="">46 </span><span style="">of the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Dagami</span>, civil No. 1935 of <span style="">this Court, and considering its terms and conditions there must have
neces­sarily been a receipt or memorandum evidencing such loan and the </span>Court
is inclined to believe the evidence of the plaintiffs herein who were
defendants then, that such receipt was really executed and actually existed
with all its </span><span style="">mentioned annotations on the back.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But regardless of the demands made by the plaintiff upon the defendants
to produce the receipt with its annota­tions on its back, the defendants denied
the exis­tence of such receipt nor that they have it in their possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For purposes of their own, the def­endants
did not deem it proper to produce the re­ceipt, undoubtedly, in order not to
disclose the </span><span style="">annotations
repeatedly mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But its
non-production merely confirmed the more its execu­tion and existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The heavy preponderance of evidence,
therefore, proved that the original loan of P200.00 was already more than fully
paid to the defendants herein.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"But the question may be raised that if the original loan of
P200.00 was fully <span style="">paid, </span>why did
Martin <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span> agree to the payment of the addi<span style="">tional amount of P418.00?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He answered that he wanted to avoid
litigation between relatives which would have been more costly for him because
he is a teacher of meager salary and with a big family to support, and also out
of respect to the defendants who are his elder relatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So he preferred paying it gradually or
precisely within five years in order not to destroy their family </span><span style="">relationship.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It may be argued also that if plaintiff Martin <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span> was willing to pay P418.00 demanded by the
defendants in civil case No. 46 of the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Dagami</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>,
civil case No. 1935 of this Court, is there any ground or necessity to annul
said judgment of the Justice of the Peace for that amount?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated above, the payment of the original
loan of P200.00 was already made in 1952 together with the interests amounting
in all to P312.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this amount was
really paid to the defendants, as the evidence showed without any contradiction
nor refutation, then such willingness on the part of the plaintiff to pay the
additional amount of P418.00 would be absurd and illegal and the Court cannot
be made a tool for, and cannot sanction, such illegality.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, it is not correct, as the plaintiffs
herein testified, that the defen­dants were asking high rates of interests on
the original loan of P200.00, because the complaint in the Justice of the Peace
Court praying for the payment of P418.00 or more breaks that amount into P98.00
interests from August 29, 1950 to March 1, 1954, at the rate of 14% interest
yearly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, as the original loan of
P200.00 <span style="">was
fully paid, as proved, with P312.00 including inter­ests, the paid amount of
P418.00 would be a dupli­cation of the payment of the aforecited P200.00 plus
P98.00 as its interest, over and above the original payment of P312.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this sense the complaint in the justice of
the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Dagami</span> may be considered as
requiring not only over payment, but also excessive interests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But since the defendants did not deem it
proper for them to present their proofs in the present case, the Court refrains
from making any pronouncement as regards the amount represent­ing interests or
the rate thereof.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The plaintiff has proved that he had suffered humiliation and
pan and anguish because of the case filed against him by the herein defendants
who were plaintiffs then and, as a teacher in the public service, he was
ashamed and humiliated, suffering moral damages in the amount of FIVE THOUSAND
PESOS (P5,000.00) and actual damages for expenses incurred in maintaining the
previous case and the present in the amount of FIVE HUNDRED PESOS (P500.00),
plus attorney's fees of FIVE HUN<span style="">DRED PESOS (P500.00).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering all attending circumstances and
the facts of the case, the Court believes that the plaintiffs are entitled to
THREE THOUSAND PESOS (P3,000.00) moral damages, FIVE HUNDRED PESOS (P500.00)
actual damages and FIVE HUNDRED PESOS (P500.00) attorney's fees, making a total

to plaintiff's evidence, they should have been granted the right to present
their evidence in accord­ance with their express reservation; and <u>second</u>,
that in actions for relief under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court as well as in
act­ions to annul judgment on the ground of fraud, the procedure established by

is that two hearings should be conducted by the trial court, (1) a hearing to
determine whether the judgment or order complained of was rendered through
fraud and should therefore be set aside; and (2) if the decision thereon is in
the affirmative, a second hearing on the merits of the principal case.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. This Court in the case of <u>Director of Lands vs. Hon.
Patricio V. <span class="SpellE">Ceniza</span></u>, G. R. No. L-18527, <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="6"><span style="">June </span>29,
 1963</st1:date>, <span style="">already had occasion,
in an analogous case, to restate the rule governing judgments on demurrers to
evidence, by way </span>of collation and cla­rification of the doctrines
enunciated <span style="">in earlier cases, as now em­bodied
in Rule </span>35 of the new Rules of <span style="">Court,
which provides in </span>its sole section, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Rule 35</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Judgment on Demurrer
to Evidence</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Section 1. <u>Effect of judgment on demurrer to evidence</u>. --
After the plaintiff has completed the presentation of his evi­dence, the
defendant without waiving his right to offer evi<span style="">dence in the event the motion is not
granted, may move for a dismissal on the ground that upon the facts and the law
the plaintiff has shown no right to relief.<span style="">&nbsp;

on appeal, the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> loses his right to present

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In the cited case, applying the rule on
demurrer to evidence as thus restated, this Court held that the trial court
after denying the motion to dismiss for insufficiency of plaintiff's evidence
or demurrer to <span style="">the evidence, should permit the defendant to
present his own evidence and give </span><span style="">him his day in court, regardless of <span style="">whether or not the </span>def<span style="">endant has made </span>a reservation of his
right to <span style="">present his evidence in the </span>event
of denial of his motion <span style="">or demurrer.</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>We </span><span style="">reaffirm the

evident that the res­pondent court, in the case at bar, after denying the
motion to dismiss, for insufficiency of evidence, (demurrer to the evidence),
should have permitted the petitioner-defendant to present his own evidence,
notwithstanding its failure or omission to make a reservation to that effect;
more so, as in this parti­cular case, when the petitioner-defendant had asked
to be given a day in court, in order to defend the government's title to a 78
hectare parcel of land."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">2. The rationale behind the rule and doctrine is simple and
logical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant is <span style="">permitted, </span>without waiving his right
to offer evidence in the event that his motion is not granted, to move for a
dismissal (<span class="SpellE">i</span>. e. demur to the plaintiff's evidence)
on the ground that upon the facts as thus established and the applicable law,
the plaintiff has shown no right to relief.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the trial court <u>denies</u> the dismissal motion, <span class="SpellE">i</span>. e., finds that plaintiff's evidence is sufficient for an
award of judgment in the absence of contrary evidence, the case still remains
before the trial court which should then proceed to hear and receive the
defendant's evidence so that all the facts and evidence of the contending
parties may be properly placed before it for <span class="SpellE"><span style="">judication</span></span><span style=""> as well as before
the appellate courts, in case of <span style="">appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Nothing is lost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This doctrine is but in line with the
established procedural precepts in the conduct of trials that the trial court
liberally receive all proffered evidence at the trial to enable it to render
its decision with all possibly relevant proofs in the record, thus assuring
that the appellate courts upon appeal have all the material before them
necessary to make a correct judg­ment, and avoiding the need of remanding the
case for retrial or reception of improperly excluded evidence, with the possibi­lity
thereafter of still another appeal, with all the <span class="SpellE">concommitant</span>
delays.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule, however, imposes the
condition by the same token that if his demurrer is </span><u><span style="">granted </span></u><span style="">by the trial
court, and the order of dismissal is </span><u><span style="">reversed on appeal</span></u><span style="">, </span><span style="">the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> loses his right to present evidence in his behalf
and he shall have been deemed to have elected to stand on the insufficiency of
plaintiff's case and evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such
event, the appellate court which reverses the order of dismissal shall <span style="">proceed to render judgment on the merits on
the </span>basis of plaintiff's evidence.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Simply restated, a defendant who presents a demurrer to
plaintiff's <span style="">evidence retains </span>the
right to <span style="">present his own evidence, <u>if
the </u></span><u><span style="">trial court disagree</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">with
him; but </span><u><span style="">if </span></u><u><span style="">the trial court agrees</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">with
him, and on appeal, </span><u><span style="">the
appellate court </span></u><u><span style="">disagrees</span></u><span style=""> with both of them and reverses the dismissal
order, he has lost the right to present his own evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">3. The case before the trial court was <span style="">one </span>for annulment of judgment on the ground of fraud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="">earlier
</span>stated, private respondent <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span> as
defendant in the original case filed by the <span class="SpellE">Siayngcos</span>
before the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Dagami</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>, where he entered a confession of
judgment had <span style="">unsuccess­</span>fully
tried to secure relief from said <span style="">judgment
under Rule </span>38 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sections 6 and 7 of Rule 38 govern the pro­ceedings for setting aside or
annulment of judgments on the grounds of fraud, accident, mistake or excusable
negligence, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 6. <u>Proceedings after answer is filed</u> -- <span style="">Once </span>the <span style="">an</span>swer is filed, or the time for its filing has expired, the court
shall hear the petition and if after such hearing, the court finds that the
allegations thereof are not true, the petition shall be dismissed; but if it
finds said allegations to be true, it shall order the judgment, order or other
proceedings complained of to be set aside, upon such terms as may be just, and
thereafter the case shall stand as if the judgment, order or other proceeding
set aside had never been issued or taken. "</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SEC. 7. <u>Procedure where a judgment is set aside</u>. -- ­Where
the judgment set aside is that of a Court of First Instance, such court shall
proceed to hear and determine the case as if timely motion for a new trial had
been granted therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the judgment
set aside is that of an inferior court, the case shall be tried in the Court of
First Instance as if the same had been regularly brought up by appeal, and the
judge of the inferior court may be required by the Court of First Instance to
attend and produce at the trial all the papers in the original case. "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Here while the
complaint filed by <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span> for the annulment of the
Justice of the Peace Court judgment against him on the basis of extrinsic fraud
was a separate action independent of Rule 38 for relief from judgment, still we
hold that the above quoted provisions of Rule 38 should govern the procedure to
<span style="">be followed by the trial court in such
separate action for annul­ment of the judgment of an inferior court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of First Instance would be
exercising its appellate jurisdiction, as con­templated in Rule 38, section 7,
which expressly provides that where the judgment set aside is that of an
inferior court, the case shall be tried in the Court of First instance as if
the same has been regularly brought up by appeal. "<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court, speaking through the now Chief Justice, has already
laid down in <u>Villanueva v. <span class="SpellE">Alcoba</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
the procedure to be followed in such proceedings, which contemplates two hear­ings:
<u><span style="">first</span></u><span style="">, a hearing to determine whether the
judgment or order complained of should be set aside, for as provided in Rule
38, section 6, if the court finds that the allegations of fraud are not true,
the petition shall be dismissed and the en­tire proceedings terminate; and <u>second</u>,
if the court finds the allegations to be true, however, then the same rule
provides that it shall set aside the judgment complained of and shall proceed
to hear and determine the case on its merits, for the case will then stand as
if the judgment set aside had never been issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, this Court pointed out in the cited
case: -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is clear from these provisions
that in pro­ceedings for relief from judgment under said Rule 38, <u>there may
be two (2) hearings</u>, namely: (1) a hearing to determine whether the
judgment or order complained of should be set aside, and (2) if the decision
thereon is in the affirmative, a hearing on the merits of the Principal case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Referring to the present case, it is obvious that, at the
hearing held on <st1:date year="1953" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1953</st1:date>,
the court was not supposed to receive evidence on the truth of petitioners'
allegations <u>relative to the alleged debts of respondents herein</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This matter affects al­ready the merits of
the principal case, which is not to be inquired into until the Court has
decided, <u>after</u> the first hearing, to set aside the judgment or order
complained of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the second
hearing above referred to would be useless.”<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(at <span style="">p. </span>285)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The procedure thus laid down is but national.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As petitioners correctly contend in their
brief, the trial court in allowing res­pondent <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span>
to present simultaneously at the first hearing his evidence relating to the
merits of the principal case, subject of the judgment which was yet to be
annulled, in effect already prejudged or erroneously assumed that the alleged
fraud <span style="">which was the very basis </span>of
<span class="SpellE">Costibolo's</span> action for <span style="">annulment </span>of judg­<span style="">ment </span>was
already duly proven and that said judgment had been set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out by this Court in the
Villanueva case, <u>supra</u>, the merits of the principal case, subject of the
judgment sought to be annulled, should not be inquired into until the court has
decided, <u>after the first hearing</u>, to set aside the judgment complained
of.</p>

<p class="BODY">So it is that even if we were to apply in the case at bar the
rule in earlier doctrines already discarded that a defendant who moves to
dismiss or presents a demurrer to plaintiff's evidence <span style="">must be deemed to have waived his right to submit his own evi­dence in
the went </span>of the court's denial of <span style="">his motion or demurrer, the outcome here would not be affected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this case is one to set aside a judgment
on the ground </span>of fraud, which involves two hearings, as already
stated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such waiver would properly apply
only to the first hearing, <span class="SpellE">i</span>. e., the hearing to
determine whether the judgment complained of should be set aside on the ground
of <span style="">fraud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But petitioners could not be deemed to have
also waived the right to present their evidence at the second hearing on the </span>merits
of the case, <u>after</u> the Court shall have <span style="">denied their mo­</span>tion to dismiss and therefore shall have <span style="">accordingly set aside the judgment </span>sought
to be annulled; for it <span style="">is only then
that the second hearing on the merits of the case would be called and held for
the reception </span>of plaintiff's evidence as well as of defen­dant's
evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">But under the rule of demurrer to evidence now formally
incorporated in Rule 35, <u>supra</u>, since the trial court denied the
petitioners' motion to dismiss or demurrer, petitioners could not be held to
have waived their right to present their own evi­dence, to refute respondent <span class="SpellE">Costibolo's</span> evidence, both on <span style="">issue of the alleged fraud as well as on the merits of the principal
case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">WHEREFORE</b><span style="">, the decision appealed </span>from is <span style="">hereby reversed and another one is hereby
entered, directing the remand of the case to the Court </span>of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> for further proceed­ings in accordance with

<i>vs</i>. Court of Appeals</u> G. R. No. L-18682, June 30, 1965, this Court
upheld the lower court's judgment of December 27, 2958 and ruled that "a
defendant who filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's evidence <u>without
reservation</u> in effect submitted the case for decision and if the result be
adverse to him he could not claim, as a mat­ter of right, that the decision be
vacated so that he might adduce his own evidence." This Court in said
decision, expressly noted that "by way of advertence to the bench and the
bar, it need only be added that similar questions arising after the
promulgation of the revised Rules of Court are expressly governed by Rule 35,
Section 1" thereof. Said case is easily differentiated from the case at
bar in that here, the petitioners, as defendants in the trial court, expressly
reserved the right to submit their evidence in the event of the denial of their
demurrer to plaintiff's evidence.</p>
