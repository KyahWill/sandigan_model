submitted the case for decision on the sole legal issue of "whether or not

in the Management Contract."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In its decision of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="3"><span style="">March 8,
 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Court of
First Instance found that the filing of the provisional claim on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="22" month="7"><span style="">July 22,
 1960</span></st1:date><span style=""> was in full compliance
with the terms of the Management Contract.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Management Contract provides that a claim must be filed with­in 15 days from
the date of last discharge, and there is no doubt that this claim was filed
beyond the 15-day period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, our
Supreme Court has modified the severity of this Contract by counting the 15-day
period, not from date of last discharge, but from date of actual delivery to
the consignee (<span class="SpellE">Chiok</span> Ho v. <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> G. R. No. L-20553; <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1965</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span style="">very </span>exhibits of
Defendant particularly Exhibit 4 (permit to deliver goods) and the Gate Passes
(Exhibits 5 and 6) show that the broker of the Importer first had <span style="">know</span>ledge
of the short delivery on the date of the permit to deliver goods (Exhibit <span style="">4) - </span>this Exhibit is dated July 22,
1960 and on that same date the broker filed the <span style="">Provisional claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This </span><span style="">is full compliance </span>with the terms of
the Management Contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, judgment was rendered in favor of <span style="">the plaintiff as set forth in the first part
of this deci­sion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unable to obtain <span class="GramE">a reconsideration</span>, the </span><span style="">defendants </span><span style="">appealed
directly to this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellants insist
that no cause of action accrued against them since the requirement that a claim
must be filed within the 15-day period prescribed in Section 15 of the
Management Contract had not been com­plied with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They contend that the filing of the
provisional claim on July 22, 1960 was beyond the 15-day period counted from
the discharge of the goods from the carrying vessel on June 23, 1960, and prior
to the time the consignee first had knowledge of the short delivery, which was
on August 22, 1960, when the last delivery to the consignee's broker was
effected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the date July 22, 1960
appearing at the upper and left portions of the Delivery Permit (Exhibit 4),
the appellants explain that it refers to the date when the Import Entry was
filed with the Bureau of Customs pur­suant to Section 1301 of Republic Act No.
1937 </span><span style="">and
</span><span style="">not to the time when the
consignee's broker first had knowledge of the short delivery, no part of the
goods having yet been delivered as of that date.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Confronted with the above
explanation, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> has abandoned its original
stand in the lower court.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">+</span></span></a><span style=""> Instead, it now claims that the consignee
first learned of the loss only on October </span><span style="">7, </span><span style="">1960, when the
appellant Manila Port Service issued a certification to the effect that out of
the eight (8) cases consigned to <span class="SpellE">Leelin</span> &amp; Co.,
"only seven (7) cases appear (s) in our record to have been delivered as
of this date," and contends that since the formal claim was filed an
October 19, 1960, which was within the 15-day period from October </span><span style="">7, </span>1960,
there was compliance with the terms of the Management Contract.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appeal should be
sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question that the
filing of the provisional claim on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="22" month="7"><span style="">July 22, 1960</span></st1:date><span style=""> was not within the 15-day period from </span><st1:date year="1960" day="23" month="6"><span style="">June 23,
 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, when the goods
were discharged from the carrying vessel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even under the ruling of this Court in several cases,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> namely, that the 15-day period may be
counted not from the discharge of the last package from the carrying vessel but
from the date the consignee learned or could have learned of the loss, damage, <span class="SpellE">misdelivery</span> and/or non-delivery, the provisional claim here
cannot be considered as filed on time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is admitted that the consignee's broker took delivery of five (5) </span><span style="">cases </span><span style="">on August 17, 1960 and two (2) cases on
August 22, 1960, or a total of seven (7) out of the manifested quantity of
eight </span><span style="">(8) </span><span style="">cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Inasmuch as there had yet been no delivery on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="22" month="7"><span style="">July 22,
 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
provisional claim filed on that date was premature and speculative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is difficult to see how the consignee
could have knowledge of the short-delivery of one case even before the delivery
was actually <span class="GramE">effected</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> itself now claims that
the consignee first learned of the loss not on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="22" month="7"><span style="">July 22, 1960</span></st1:date><span style=""> but on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="7" month="10"><span style="">October 7, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, when the appellant Manila Port Service
issued the Certificate of Delivery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This new stand of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, however, is equally untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, the consignee must have
had prior knowledge of the short-delivery even before the Certificate of
Delivery was issued on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="7" month="10"><span style="">October </span><span style="">7, </span><span style="">1960</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be denied that when the last
delivery of two (2) cases was <span class="GramE">effected</span> on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="22" month="8"><span style="">August
 22, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
consignee was already aware that there was a short-delivery of one case, since
eight (8) cases appeared on the face of the delivery </span>permit <span style="">while </span><span style="">a total </span><span style="">of only seven (7) cases were delivered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If anything, the Certificate of Delivery merely confirmed </span>a <span style="">fact already known to the consignee at the
time of taking the last delivery - that out of the eight cases only seven were
delivered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, while the formal
claim is dated </span><st1:date year="1960" day="19" month="10"><span style="">October 19, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, there is no evidence to show when it was
actually received by the appellant Manila Port Service so as to have a basis in
computing the 15-day period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse, the
appellants deny having received said formal claim at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the new stand of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> involves a change of its theory pursued in the
lower court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The provisional claim not
having been filed within the 15-day period prescribed in paragraph 15 of the
Management Contract, the appellants are relieved of any liability for the
non-delivery of the goods in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
