"Petition to Sur­render Lawyer's Certificate of Title," filed on
September 25, 1967, in protest against what he therein asserts is "a great
injustice com­mitted against his client by this Supreme Court." He indicts
this Court, in his own phrase, as a tribunal "peopled by men who are
calloused to our pleas for justice, who ignore without reasons their own
applicable decisions and commit culpable violation of the Cons­titution with
impunity." His client, he continues, who was deeply aggrieved by this
Court's "unjust judgment," has become "one of the sacrificial
Victims before the altar of hypocrisy." In the same breath that he alludes
to the classic symbol of justice, he ridicules the members of this Court,
saying "that justice as administered by the present members of the Supreme
Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">not
only </span>blind, but also deaf and dumb." He then vows to argue the
cause of his client "in the people's forum," so that "the people
may know of the silent injustices committed by this Court," and that
"whatever mistakes, wrongs and injustices that were committed must never
be repeated." He ends his petition with a prayer that</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Atty. <span class="SpellE">Almacen</span>

the resolution denying the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">moti</span>on

issued on <st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1962</st1:date>,
which was much earlier than the date of promulgation of the decision in the

 1965</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Fur­ther, the

issued it 'without prejudice to <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> restoring
the point in the brief.' In the main decision in said case (Rep. vs. <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span>), the Supreme Court passed upon the issue <u>sub</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>silencio</u></span> presumably because of its prior
decisions contrary to the resolution of <st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1962</st1:date>, one of which is that in the Manila
Surety and Fidelity case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore
Republic vs. <span class="SpellE">Ventu­ranza</span> is no authority on the
matter in issue."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Atty. <span class="SpellE">Almacen</span> then appealed to this
Court by <u>certiorari</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We refused
to take the case, and by minute resolution denied the appeal. Denied shortly
thereafter was his motion for reconside­ration as well as his petition for
leave to file a second motion for reconsideration and for extension of time.
Entry of judgment was made on <st1:date year="1967" day="8" month="9">September
 8, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the second
motion for recon­sideration filed by him after the said date was ordered
expunged from the records.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was at this juncture that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Almacen</span>
gave vent to his disappointment by filing <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">his </span>"Petition to Surrender Lawyer's Cer­tificate of
Title," already adverted to - a pleading that is interspersed from
beginning to end with the insolent, contemptuous, grossly disrespectful and
derogatory remarks hereinbefore reproduced, against this Court as well as its
individual members, a behavior that is as unprecedented as it is
unprofessional.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless we decided by resolution dated <st1:date year="1967" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1967</st1:date> to withhold action on his
petition until he shall have actually surrendered his certificate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Patiently, we waited for him to make good his
proffer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No word came from him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So he was reminded to turn over his
certificate, which he had earlier vociferously offer­ed to surrender, so that
this Court could act on his petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To
said reminder he manifested "that he has no pending petition in con­nection
with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Case </span>G. R. No. L-27654, <span class="SpellE"><u>Calero</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span></u>,
said case is now final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>;" that this
Court's September 28, 1967 resolution did not require him to do either a
positive or nega­tive act; and that since his offer was not accepted, he
"chose to pursue the negative act."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the exercise of its inherent power to discipline a mem­ber of
the bar for contumely and <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">gross </span>misconduct,
this Court on November 17, 1967 resolved to require Atty. <span class="SpellE">Almacen</span>
to show cause "why no disciplinary action should be taken against
him." Denying the charges contained in the November 17 resolution, he
asked for permission "to give reasons and cause why no discipli­nary
action should be taken against him x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> in an open and public hearing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"This Court resolved (on December 7)
"to require Atty. <span class="SpellE">Almacen</span> to state, within five
days from notice hereof, his reasons for such request, otherwise, oral argument
shall be deemed waived and incident submitted for decision." To this
resolution he mani­fested that since this Court is "the complainant,
prosecutor and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Judge," </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">he </span>preferred to be heard and to answer
questions "in person and in an open and public hearing" so that this
Court could ob­<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">serve <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">his </span>sincerity </span>and candor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also asked for leave to file a written
explanation "in the event this Court has <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">no </span>time to hear him in person." To give him the <span class="SpellE">ampliest</span> latitude for his defense, he was allowed to file a
written explanation and thereafter was heard <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">in </span>oral argument.</p>

<p class="BODY">His written answer, as undignified and cynical as it is <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">un</span>chastened</span>
offers no apology.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Far from being
contrite, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Almacen</span> unremittingly repeats his
jeremiad of lamentations, this time embellishing it with abundant sarcasm and
innuendo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

proceed to make an assessment of whether or not the utter­ances and actuations
of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Almacen</span> here in question are pro­perly the
object of disciplinary sanctions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">proferred</span> surrender of his lawyer's
certificate is, of course, purely <span class="SpellE">potestative</span> on
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Almacen's</span> part.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Unorthodox though it may seem, no statute, no law stands in its
way.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Beyond making the mere offer,
however, he went farther.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In haughty and
coarse language, he actually availed of the said move as a vehicle for his
vicious tirade against this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
integrated entirety of his petition bristles with vile insults all calculated
to drive home his contempt for and disrespect to the Court and its
members.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Picturing his client as "a
sacrificial victim at the altar of hypocrisy," he categorically denounces
the justice administered by this Court to be not only blind "but also deaf
and dumb." With unmiti­gated acerbity, he virtually rakes this Court and
its members with verbal talons, imputing to the Court the perpetration of
"silent in­justices" and "short-cut justice" while at the
same <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">time branding its </span>members
as "calloused to pleas of justice." And, true to his announced threat
to argue the cause of his client "in the people's forum," he caused
the publication in the papers of an account of his actuations, in a calculated
effort to startle the public, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">stir up </span>public
indignation and disrespect toward the Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Called upon to make an explanation, he expressed no regret, offered no
apo­logy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, with characteristic
arrogance, be rehashed and re<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">iterated
his vituperative attacks and, alluding to the Scriptures, virtually tarred and
feathered the Court and its members as in­veterate hypocrites incapable of
administering justice and unwor­thy to impose disciplinary sanctions upon him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The virulence so blatantly evident in Atty. <span class="SpellE">Almacen's</span>
peti­tion, answer and oral argumentation speaks for itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The vicious language used and the scurrilous
innuendoes they carried far trans­cend the permissible bounds of legitimate
criticism.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They could never serve any
purpose but to gratify the spite of an irate <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">attor­</span>ney, attract public attention to himself and, more important
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of all, </span>bring this Court and its
members into disrepute and destroy public confidence in them to the detriment
of the orderly administration of justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Odium of this character and texture presents no re­deeming feature, and
completely negates any pretense of passionate commitment to the truth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not a whit less than a classic example
of gross misconduct, gross violation of the lawyer's oath and gross transgression
of the Canons of Legal Ethics.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As such,
it cannot be allowed to go <span class="SpellE">unrebuked</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The way for the exertion of our disciplinary
powers is thus laid clear, and the need <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> is
unavoidable.</p>

<p class="BODY">We must once more stress our explicit disclaimer of immunity from
criticism.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Like any other Government
entity <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>a viable democracy,
the Court is not, and should not be, above cri­ticism.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But a critique of the Court must be
intelligent and discri­minating, fitting to its high function as the court of
last resort.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And more than this, valid
and healthy criticism is by no means synonymous to obloquy, and requires
detachment and disinterest<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">edness, real
qualities approached only through constant striving to attain them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any criticism of the Court must possess the
qua­lity of judiciousness and must be informed by perspective and in­fused by
philosophy.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is not accurate to say, nor is it an obstacle to the exer­cise
of our authority in the premises, that, as Atty. <span class="SpellE">Almacen</span>
would have it appear, the members of the Court are the "com­plainants,
prosecutors and judges" all rolled up into one in this instance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is an utter misapprehension, if not a
total distor­tion, not only of the nature of the proceeding at hand but also of
our role therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accent should be laid on the fact that disciplinary proceed­ings
like the present are <span class="SpellE"><u>sui</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>generis</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither purely civil nor purely criminal,
this proceeding is not - and does not <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">involve
-</span>a trial of an action or a suit, but is rather an <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">investigation by the </span>Court into the conduct
of its officers.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Not </span>being intended to inflict
punishment, it is in no sense a criminal prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, there is neither a plaintiff <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">nor a prosecutor therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>It may be initiated by the Court <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> Public interest </span>is its primary
objective, and the real question for <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">determination
</span>is whether or not the attorney is still a fit <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">person to </span>be allowed the privileges as such.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, in the exercise of its disciplinary powers,
the Court merely calls upon a member of the Bar to ac­count for his actuations
as an officer of the Court with the end in view of preserving the purity of the
legal profession and the pro­per and honest administration of justice by
purging the profession of members who by their misconduct have proved
themselves no longer worthy to be entrusted with the duties and
responsibilities pertaining to the office of an attorney.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
In such posture, there can thus be no occasion to speak of a complainant or a prosecutor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Undeniably, the members of the Court are, to a certain degree,
aggrieved parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any tirade against
the Court as a bo­<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">dy </span>is necessarily and inextricably as much so against the indivi­dual
members thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But in the exercise of
its disciplinary pow­ers, the Court acts as an entity separate and distinct
from the individual personalities of its members.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consistently with the intrinsic nature of a
collegiate court, the individual members act not as such individuals but only
as a duly constituted court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their
distinct individualities are lost in<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>the
majesty of their office.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
So that, in a very real sense, if there be any complainant in the case at bar,
it can only be the Court itself, not the individual members thereof - as well
as the people themselves whose rights, fortunes and properties, nay, even l<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:21.0pt">i</span>ves, would be placed at grave hazard
should the administration of justice be threatened by the retention in the Bar
of men unfit to discharge the solemn responsibilities of membership in the legal
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">f</span>raternity.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Finally, the power to
exclude persons from the practice </span>of law is but a necessary incident of
the power <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">to admit persons </span>to
said practice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By constitutional
precept, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">this power is vested </span>exclusively
in this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This duty it cannot abdicate
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">just as </span>much as it cannot
unilaterally renounce <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">jurisdiction
legally in</span>vested upon it.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
So that even <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">if it </span>be conceded
that the members collectively are in a sense the aggrieved parties, that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">fact alone </span>does not and cannot
disqualify them from the exercise of that power because public policy demands
that they, acting as a Court, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">exercise
the power in all cases which call for disciplinary action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The present is such a case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the end, the imagined anomaly of </span>the
merger in one entity of the personalities of complainant, prosecutor and judge
is absolutely inexistent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Last to engage our attention is the nature and extent of the
sanctions that may be visited upon Atty. <span class="SpellE">Almacen</span> for
his transgressions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As marked out by the
Rules of Court, these <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">may range </span>from
mere suspension to total removal or disbarment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
The <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">dis</span>cretion to assess under
the circumstances the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">imposable
sanction </span>is, of course, primarily addressed to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">sound discretion of the </span>Court which,
being neither arbitrary and despotic nor motivated by personal animosity or
prejudice, should ever be controlled by the imperative need that the purity and
independence of the Bar be scrupulously guarded and the dignity of and respect
due to the Court be zealously maintained.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the misconduct committed by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Almacen</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is of con</span>siderable gravity
cannot be overemphasized.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
heeding the stern injunction that disbarment should <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">never be decreed where </span>a lesser sanction would accomplish the end
desired, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">and believing </span>that it
may not perhaps be futile to hope that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in
</span>the sober light of some future day, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Almacen</span>
will realize that abrasive language never fails to do disservice to an advocate
and that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>every effervescence
of candor there is ample room for the added <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">glow of </span>respect, it is our view that suspension will suffice under
the circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His demonstrated
persistence in <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">his misconduct </span>by
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">nei</span>ther manifesting repentance
nor offering apology <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> leave us no way of
determining how long that suspension should last and, accordingly, we are
impelled to decree that the same should be indefinite.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This, we are empowered to do not alone
because jurisprudence grants <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">us </span>discretion
on the matter<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn33" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
but also because, even without the comforting support of precedent, it is
obvious that if we have authority to completely exclude a person from the
practice of law, there is no reason why indefinite <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">suspension, </span>which is lesser in degree and effect, can be regarded
as falling outside of the compass of that authority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The merit of this <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

Atty. <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Almacen</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span>to determine for himself how long or
how short that suspension shall last.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>For, at any time after the suspension becomes <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

resume the practice of law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, IT <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">IS

<p class="FOOTNOTES">In B<u>ridges v. California,</u> 86 L. ed 192, Mr. Justice
Black, speaking for the majority, said: "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> an enforced silence, however, limited, solely in the name
of preserving the dignity of the bench, would probably engender resentment,
suspicion, and contempt much more than it would enhance respect." Mr.
Justice Frankfurter, who wrote the mi­nority opinion, said: "Judges as
persons, or courts as institutions, are entitled to no greater immunity from
criticism than other persons or institutions. Just because the holders of
judicial office are identified with the interest of justice they may forget
their common human frailties and fallibilities. There have sometimes been
martinets upon the bench as there have sometimes been wielders of authority who
have used the paraphernalia of power in support of what they call<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ed their dignity. Therefore judges must be
kept mindful of their limitations and of their ultimate public responsibility </span>by
a vigorous stream of criticism expressed with candor however blunt. 'A man
cannot be summarily laid by the heels because his words may make public feeling
more unfavorable in case the judge should be asked to act at some later date,
any more than he can for exciting public feeling against a judge for what he
already has done.' x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Courts and judges must take their share of the gains and pains of discussion <u>Which
is unfettered except by laws of libel</u>, <u>by self-restraint, and by good
taste.</u> Winds of doctrine should freely blow for the promotion of good and
the correction of evil. Nor should restrictions be permitted that cramp the
feeling of freedom in the use of tongue or pen <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">re</span>gardless of the temper of the truth of what may be
uttered."</p>
