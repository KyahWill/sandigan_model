<p class="BODY">But in a manifestation dated August 17, 1971, followed by a
supplemental manifestation dated Septem­ber 13, 1971, herein respondents
informed the Court that respondent Judge rendered a decision dated August 25,
1971 in Civil Case No. 82244, ordering therein defendant and herein private
respondent Lim Chi to vacate the premises and to pay the plaintiff or
petitioner herein a monthly rental of P2,700.00 from July 1, 1964 until Lim Chi
vacates the premises and to pay the costs, annexing thereto as Annex
"B" a copy of said decision of respondent Judge and praying that this
petition be dismissed with costs against petitioner on the ground that the
appealed decision of the municipal court cannot be executed as it ceases to
exist after the rendition of the judgment by the Court of First Instance in exercise
of its appellate jurisdiction (pp. 187-­188, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">In its comment filed on and dated October 18, 1971 (p. 201,
rec.), herein petitioner confirmed the rendition of the decision by the
respondent Judge from which petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals before
which the case is now pending, and submits to the sound discretion of this
Court whether to consider this case as moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is an established principle that an appealed decision of the
municipal court cannot be executed after the rendition of the judgment by the
Court of First In­stance, which supersedes and renders the municipal court
decision <span class="SpellE"><u>functus</u></span><u> officio</u> and
inexistent. Consequently, it is now the decision of the Court of First Instance
that prevails and may be executed pending appeal. <a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>
