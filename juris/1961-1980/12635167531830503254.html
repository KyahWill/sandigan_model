				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal, taken by Julio <span class="SpellE">Tapec</span>, from a
decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>
Norte, convicting him and Felipe <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span> of the crime
of murder and sentencing both to life imprisonment, to jointly and severally
indemnify the heirs of the deceased Andrea <span class="SpellE">Cabotaje</span>
in the sum of P6,000, as well as to pay the costs, and acquitting their
co-defendant, <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span>,
with the propor­tionate part of <span style="">the
costs </span><u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">oficio</span></u></span><span style="">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The victim Andrea <span class="SpellE">Cabotaje</span> was, at the
time of her death, single and about 28 years of age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her mother's sister was married to appellant,
Julio <span class="SpellE">Tapec</span>, then about 40 years old, <span style="">who, </span>accordingly, was her
uncle-in-law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This notwithstanding,
Julio had extramarital relations with her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When, after a while, their affair became known, <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span>,
Leonora and Pablo <span class="SpellE">Cabotaje</span>, the sisters and brother
of An­drea, became angry at her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Andrea
had to leave the house of the family, in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Masintoc</span>,
<st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Paoay</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>
Norte, in which she stayed with <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> and Pablo <span class="SpellE">Cabotaje</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Andrea
first moved to the house of her other brother, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Cabotaje</span>,
but, soon later, appellant brought her to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
where he supported her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For reasons not
clearly appearing in the record - although, seemingly, after having a rift with
appellant - she eventually re­turned to her hometown and lived once more with
her sister and brother <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> and Pablo <span class="SpellE">Cabotaje</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
sister Leonora, mar­ried to <span class="SpellE">Alejo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cueva</span>,
lived in another house, about five (5) meters away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently desirous to resume his affair with
Andrea, whom he found difficult to contact, owing, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, to the animosity of the members of her family,
apart from her seeming determina­tion to turn a new leaf in life, appellant
used to peep under her house, but her sisters would invariably drive him away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of her death, the true nature of
Andrea's feelings must be deduced merely from her overt acts.</p>

<p class="BODY">While grazing his <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> in the field,
on <st1:date year="1954" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1954</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacod</span> heard a feminine
voice crying for help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> approached the place from whence the scream had
come, and saw appellant pull Andrea by the shoulder, as well as throw her down
to the ground, face upward, and try to ravish her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As she resisted him, <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span>
shouted for help, whereupon <span class="SpellE">Tapec</span> ran away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, Andrea, whose dress was torn at one
shoulder, stood up and asked <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> to be her
witness, stating that appellant had tried to abuse her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon thereafter, Andrea, <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span>
and one <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sador­ra</span>
- who, likewise, claimed to have witnessed the occurrence - reported the same
to Lucas D. <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span>, Justice of the Peace of <span class="SpellE">Paoay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter
took their respective affidavits,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
which were subscribed and sworn to before him on <st1:date year="1954" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1954</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Owing to the fact that it was long past <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time>
when they finished this task and that Andrea had expressed the wish to file a
formal complaint, Judge <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span> bade her to come back <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> at some other time; but, she never did so, owing
to subsequent events.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that, being aware of her former illicit relations with
appellant, Judge <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span> found himself wondering about
her complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span>
wrote, therefore, a note to appellant informing him of the action taken by
Andrea and inquiring about the truth concerning her charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next morning, while Andrea was fetching
water from a well, appellant asked her why she had complained against him and
begged her forgiveness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reply, she
upbraided him, adding, "You had been fooling me." In this connec­tion,
it appears that appellant had, also, had illicit relations with another woman,
who became pregnant in consequence thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1954" day="30" month="4"><span style="">April
 30, 1954</span></st1:date><span style="">, at about
dusk, appellant walked to and fro, past Andrea's house, holding an unsheathed
bolo and looking angrily at said house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later, that evening, Andrea and <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabotaje</span> took their dinner in the house of their sister,
Leonora.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span>
returned, thereafter, to her house, their neighbors, Felipe <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span>
and Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span>, came.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The former remained at the door, holding
something behind him, as the latter inquired about Pablo <span class="SpellE">Cabotaje</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon being informed that he had gone out for
a walk, Benjamin and Felipe departed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> followed them to the door and noticed that Felipe
carried a gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Presently, An­drea left
the house of her sister, Leonora; but, as soon as she (Andrea) descended the
stairs thereof, two shots rung in succes­sion from under said stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When, thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span>
and Leonora looked towards the place where the shots had come, they </span><span style="">saw </span><span style="">An­drea sprawled on the ground near the
stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">dead with two bullet wounds on the back of
the head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The next day, Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gamayo</span>, of the Philippine Con­stabulary, went to the scene
of the occurrence and proceeded to investigate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Having learned o<span style="">f </span>the
previous affair between Andrea and appellant and of the complaint for attempted
rape filed by the former against the latter, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
interviewed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant denied having
had anything to do with Andrea's assassination and claimed to be fishing, some
distance away, at the time of the occur­rence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant added, however, that Felipe <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span>
had a .45 caliber gun and that <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span>, who used to go with him, could probably tell him
when he (Felipe) was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The relatives of
Andrea had, also, informed <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> that Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span> and Felipe <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span> had been
in her house, inquiring about Pablo <span class="SpellE">Cabotaje</span>, shortly
before the occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> sent for Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span>, both of
whom revealed that the assas­sin was Felipe <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span>,
who had gone to the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Masisip</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Sanchez Mira</st1:placename></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>, after concealing, under a pile of hay stored in a
given place, the gun used in the commis­sion of the offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benjamin and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
brought <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> to said place, where he found said
gun under a stack of hay.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 3, 1954, <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span> subscribed and swore, before Judge <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span> of <span class="SpellE">Paoay</span>, to a statement,
Exhibits D and D-1, stating that, while Benjamin and he were in the ground
floor of the house of <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabian</span>,
in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Callaguip</span>, <span class="SpellE">Paoay</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, on April 30, 1954, at about dusk,
Felipe <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span> came, carrying the submachine gun .45,
later marked as Exhibit H, and invited them to take a walk; that Felipe led
them to their own barrio (<span class="SpellE">Masintoc</span>), where
appellant's house is; that, posting himself near the stairs thereof, Felipe
whistled, where­upon appellant came down, spoke in whispers to Felipe and gave
him some money; that, thereafter, Felipe invited Benjamin and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> to go westward, leading towards the house of
Andrea; that Felipe then bade <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> to wait near
the stairs thereof, as he (Felipe) and Benjamin went up and inquired about
Pablo <span class="SpellE">Cabo<span style="">taje</span></span><span style="">; that, a few moments later, Felipe and
Benjamin came down, and the three (3) of them - <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>,
followed by Benjamin and then Felipe - moved westward, but Felipe stopped in
front of the house of Leonora; that, after walking away about 15 meters, <span class="SpellE">Pas­cual</span> heard two (2) shots in succession; that, as <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> turned his head, he saw Felipe running from under
said house of Leon­ora; that, thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> and
Benjamin fled southward; that, when they were already far away from the scene
of the occurrence, Felipe, who was following them, bade them to wait for him;
that, as they did so, and Felipe overtook them, he warned them not to squeal on
him, because, otherwise, he would kill them, adding that he had killed Andrea
because appellant had told him to do so and paid him P100 <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>;
that, later on Felipe concealed the gun inside a bodega, in the northern part
of the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Calla­guip</span>; and that, thereafter,
Felipe proceeded eastward, stating that he was going to <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>,
whereas <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> and Benjamin went their own way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date, Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span>
executed a similar affidavit (Exhibits C and C-1) before Judge <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span>, adding that, when Felipe and he (Benjamin) went up
the house of Andrea, he (Benjamin) inquired about Pablo <span class="SpellE">Cabotaje</span>;
that, upon being informed that Pablo was away, Felipe and he (Benjamin) went
down; and that, as the three (3) of them (Benjamin, <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
and Felipe) passed in front of the house of Leonora, they noticed that Andrea
was there.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gamayo</span>
filed the corresponding com­plaint for murder against Felipe <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span> and Julio <span class="SpellE">Tapec</span>, which was
amended on <st1:date year="1954" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1954</st1:date>,
and re-amended on <st1:date year="1954" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1954</st1:date>,
to include Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span> as one of the defend­ants.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, or on <st1:date year="1954" day="6" month="5">May 6,
 1954</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gamayo</span>
and ano­ther PC soldier, accompanied by Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span>, had
gone to <span class="SpellE">Masisip</span>, Sanchez Mira, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>,
where Felipe <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span> was apprehended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon investigation, the latter confirmed
substantially the stories set forth in the affidavits of Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span>, and stated that the sub-machine gun, Exhibit H, had
been given to him (Felipe <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span>) by appellant for
use in killing Andrea, with the understanding that he (Felipe) could keep it thereafter,
as part of the consider­ation<span style=""> for his
services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Brought back to <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, Felipe
executed, before Judge <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span>, on May 10, 1954, the
affidavit Exhibit F, stating therein that it was he (Felipe) who had shot
Andrea <span class="SpellE">Cabotaje</span> in <span class="SpellE">Masintoc</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Paoay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, in the
evening of April 30, 1954; that, in the afternoon of April 29, 1954, he met
appellant east of the place where their houses are located; that appellant
urged him to kill Andrea for a price; that he was, at first, afraid to do so,
but, appellant allayed his fear, stating that he (appellant) would take care of
him and furnish the gun with which to carry out his mission; that he demurred,
saying that he did not know how to use a gun; that appellant bade him to wait
and, fetching the sub-machine gun, later marked as Exhibit H, taught him how to
handle it; that appellant then left the gun in his possession, stating that it
was already his, as well as promising to pay him P100, apart from assuring him
that, if caught, he (appellant) would see to it that he (Felipe) was released;
that, that evening, he went home, bringing the gun with him; that, in the
evening of April 30, 1954, shortly before the occurrence, he invited <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Ma­coco</span> and Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span> to come with him; that they proceeded to the place
where appellant's house is located; that, while <span class="SpellE">Pas­cual</span>
and Benjamin were a few paces away, although within his (Felipe's) view,
appellant gave him P100, consisting of one 50-peso bill, two 20-peso bills and
one 10-peso bill; that, thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>,
Benjamin, and he went to Andrea's place; that, after waiting for Andrea under
the stairs of Leonora's house, he fired at her (Andrea) as she went down said
stairs; that Benjamin and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> were then about ten
(10) meters away; that, forthwith, Benjamin, <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
and he fled southward, until they reached the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Callaguip</span>;
that he concealed the gun in a hay stack, in side a <span class="SpellE">camarin</span>
in that barrio; that, thereafter, he went to the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span>
and the next morning proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>; and that,
of the sum of P100 given by appellant, he (Felipe) had already spent P70 when <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gamayo</span> apprehended him in
<span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>, thereby leaving a balance of P30, which he
turned over to <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Felipe <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span> and Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span> were the only persons charged in the original
information, which, after a re-investiga­tion, was amended to include therein
Julio <span class="SpellE">Tapec</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span>, as defendants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later, however, Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span> was discharged
from the information, to testify as witness for the prosecution, which he did,
reiterating what is stated in his affidavit Exhibit C.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span>, likewise, confirmed, on the witness stand, the
story set forth in his affidavit Exhibit D.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their testimonies were corroborated by those of <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bacud</span>, Leon­ora and <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabotaje</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gamayo</span>, Judge Lucas <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span> and
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span>, the
health officer who had made a post-mortem examination of the body of Andrea <span class="SpellE">Cabotaje</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appel­lant
Julio <span class="SpellE">Tapec</span> stuck to his plea of innocence and
alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claimed to be fishing, about 1
kilometer from Andrea's house, when he and his companions heard the report of
gunshots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense, likewise, placed
Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Alegado</span> and Benito <span class="SpellE">Labasan</span>
on the witness stand, to corroborate appellant's alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, testifying in his own defense, Felipe <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span> gave the following modified version:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While he was in the house of his uncle, <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span>, in the barrio
of <span class="SpellE">Masintoc</span>, <span class="SpellE">Paoay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, on <st1:date year="1954" day="30" month="4">April
 30, 1954</st1:date>, after supper, Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span>
came and invited him to go to <span class="SpellE">Callaguip</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Felipe was reluc­tant to do so, but Benjamin
insisted and he (Felipe) eventually accepted the invitation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before proceeding to <span class="SpellE">Callaguip</span>,
they passed by the house of <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span>, who joined them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After consuming a bottle of <span class="SpellE">basi</span>, in the store
of <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabian</span>, in <span class="SpellE">Cal­laguip</span>, they returned to <span class="SpellE">Masintoc</span>
and passed by Benjamin's house, where he got a submachine gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, Benjamin proposed that they go to the
house of Andrea <span class="SpellE">Cabotaje</span>, in order to rob, stating
that she had just sold several pigs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Felipe
begged to be excused, but Benjamin pointed the gun at him, and said that he
(Benjamin) would shoot him (Felipe) if he did not come along.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching Andrea's house, Benjamin went
up the same, but soon came down and then posted himself near the stairs of the
house of Leonora <span class="SpellE">Cabotaje</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Andrea <span class="SpellE">Cabotaje</span>
went down the same, Benjamin fired at her twice in succession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then Felipe and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
ran away, followed by Benjamin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the
latter overtook them, he compelled them to receive money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amount he gave to Felipe was P30.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Felipe slept that evening in the house of his
brother <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span>,
about 400 meters from that of Andrea.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Before dawn, the next morning, he left for Sanchez Mira, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>, and stayed in the house of his brother, Andres <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span>, married to Maria <span class="SpellE">Davalos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">About a week later, <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span> came and persuaded him to admit that it was he who
had assassinated Andrea <span class="SpellE">Cabotaje</span>, arguing that he was
still a minor, and that "we" (?) would raise money to engage a lawyer
and secure his acquittal, as well as adding that, otherwise, "we will kill
you." Then, <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> left, but, soon thereafter,
he came back with two (2) PC soldiers, <span class="SpellE">Teo­filo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gamayo</span> and one Mr. <span class="SpellE">Partido</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> inquired
whether he was Andrea's killer, Felipe answered "No".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, securing permission to talk to him,
Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span> took him aside and advised him to say
that Andrea had been killed by him (Felipe) upon the behest of appellant Julio <span class="SpellE">Tapec</span>, apart from warning him that, otherwise, "we
will kill you." Owing to this threat, Felipe agreed to admit his
guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This notwithstanding, he still
pleaded innocence when he was investigated in the Constabulary barracks in <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span> came, soon later,
and the investig­ator asked him (Felipe), once more, whether Andrea had been
killed by him, this time, out of fear, he answered affirmatively, and said that
appellant had paid him P100 <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> was
then affixed on a document, the contents of which he did not know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, however, swore to the truth of said
contents before Judge <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span> visited
him from time to time, and gave him small sums of money (P10, P2 and P1) on
each occasion, as well as renewed their promise to engage the services of
counsel. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>They, likewise, <span style="">threatened to kill him should he not abide by
their agreement, but they failed to keep their promise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, he testified as he did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted, however, that the questions and
answers appearing in his affidavit Exhibit F were actually propounded to and
given by him, and explained that he gave said answers in accordance with the
instructions of Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The defense introduced,

 1954</span></st1:date><span style="">; and 2) <span class="SpellE">Godofredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Galeng</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Mijares</span>, Felipe <span class="SpellE">Puri­sima</span> and Esteban <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span>, to
contradict the testimony of Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trial court did not
believe, however, the witnesses for the defense, and accepted the version of
the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, its
aforementioned decision convicting Julio <span class="SpellE">Tapec</span> and
Felipe <span class="SpellE">Ag­deppa</span>, but acquitting <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
<span class="SpellE">Macoco</span>, upon the ground of insuffi­ciency of the
evidence against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only defendant
Julio <span class="SpellE">Tapec</span> has appealed from said decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appeal hinges on he
sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence to establish that appellant had
induced Felipe <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span> to kill Andrea <span class="SpellE">Cabotaje</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
going over the voluminous transcript of the stenographic notes and the scores
of exhibits introduced in evidence, which His Honor, the trial Judge, had
analyzed carefully in his 44-page decision, We find ourselves fully in
agreement with the conclusions reached therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although the direct evidence against appellant consists mainly of the
extrajudicial confessions of Felipe <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span>, who gave
another story on the witness stand, We are satisfied that appellant's guilt, as
author by inducement, has been duly established. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">1. Indeed, said
extrajudicial confession was corroborated in so many respects as to leave no
room for doubt about the truth thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">(a) <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
<span class="SpellE">Macoco</span> and Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span>
were <u>admittedly</u> with Felipe <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span> at the
time of the commission of the crime charged, as well as sometime before and
subsequently thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> and Benjamin testified that, shortly before the
occurrence, they were in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Callaguip</span>,
where Felipe, who then car­ried the submachine gun Exhibit H, joined them;
that, thereafter, they returned to their own barrio of <span class="SpellE">Masintoc</span>
and passed by appel­lant's house; that, as Felipe approached the stairs thereof
and whistled, appellant came down and spoke to Felipe; that <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
and Benjamin were then about five (5) meters away from them; that, although the
first two (2) did not hear the conversation between Felipe and appellant, the
former (<span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> and Benjamin) saw </span>appellant
deliver some money bills to Felipe; that <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> even
heard the name of Andrea mentioned in the course of said conver­sation; that,
immediately thereafter, the trio proceeded to the house of Andrea; that
Benjamin and Felipe went up said house and inquired about Pablo <span class="SpellE">Cabotaje</span>, while <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> waited at
the foot of the stairs; that, presently, Benjamin and Felipe came down, and,
together with <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>, they passed by the stairs of
Leonora's house, where Andrea was; that, Felipe posted himself beside or
under<span style="">&nbsp; </span>said stairs, as Benjamin and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> walked some 15 me­ters away; that when, soon later,
Andrea came down from Leon-era's house, Felipe fired twice in succession; that,
as the trio ran away immediately thereafter, Felipe bade his companions not to
squeal on him and told them that he had killed Andrea by order of appellant,
who had paid him P100 <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, as well as gave him
the aforementioned gun; and that Felipe, subsequently, concealed it inside a
storehouse in <span class="SpellE">Callaguip</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">(b) Felipe's extrajudicial confession was also corrobora­ted by
the fact that the gun was found by <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gamayo</span> in the place mentioned in said confession.</p>

<p class="BODY">(c) The same was, likewise, confirmed by the fact that, when
Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span> and Felipe <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span>
left the house of Andrea, after inquiring about Pablo <span class="SpellE">Cabotaje</span>,
and <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabotaje</span>
followed them to the door, she noticed that Felipe was holding said gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apart from corroborating the testimony and
the affidavits (Exhi­bits C and D) of Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span>, to the
ef­fect that it was Felipe <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span> who carried said
gun and killed Andrea, the aforementioned testimony of <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span>
refutes that of Felipe, who said that the gun belonged to Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span> and that it was he who brought it to the scene of the
occurrence and shot Andrea, as well as belies, not only the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Godo­fredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Galeng</span>, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Alejado</span> and Felipe <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>, who
would have Us believe that they had heard Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span> admit
that the gun Exhibit H belonged to them, but, also, the testimony of Esteban <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span>, father of Felipe <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span>,
who affirmed that he had seen Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span> engage in target
practice.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is worthy of notice,
also, that <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> had no possi­ble reason to thus
suggest that the assassin was Felipe <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span>, not
Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span>, if the gun was really held by the
latter, for she and the members of her family <span style="">we</span>re in the friendliest of terms with
Felipe, Benjamin and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, she could not im­plicate an
innocent person, without thereby exonerating the mur­derer of her own
sister.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, too, her testimony as
regards the possessor of the gun in the evening of the occurrence was further
bolstered up by the fact that, upon being investigated by <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gamayo</span>, on <st1:date year="1954" day="1" month="5">May
 1, 1954</st1:date>, <u><span style="">appellant </span>told
him that Felipe <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span> had </u><u><span style="">a .45 caliber gun</span></u><span style="">, the caliber of Exhibit H.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The information thus supplied by appellant,
in turn, confirms the statement in Felipe's extrajudicial confession (Exhibit
F) to the effect that the gun had been furnished by appellant, </span><span style="">so </span><span style="">that he (Felipe) could use it to kill Andrea
and then keep it, as part of his reward <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Godofredo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Galang</span> and Felipe <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>,
municipal policemen of <span class="SpellE">Paoay</span>, to the effect that,
while they were investigating Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span>, he
(Benjamin) suggested to them that Felipe <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span> be
named as Andrea's killer, inasmuch as he (Felipe) was not around at that time,
is, to say the least, manifestly incredible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is highly inconceivable that alleged criminals would suggest to the
very peace officers investigating them, and whose duty is to prosecute them,
that somebody <span style="">else
b</span>e blamed for the crime in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Felipe's testimony
about the circumstances under which he claims to have been induced to make a
false extrajudicial confession and then to swear to the truth thereof before
Judge <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span>, is evidently unworthy of credence.</p>

<p class="BODY">(a) He declared that, one week after the occurrence, <span class="SpellE">Pas­cual</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span> urged him, in
Sanchez Mira, to admit that he was Andrea's killer, he (Felipe) being then a
minor, thereby intimating that he would, if convicted, get a light penalty, at
the same time assuring him that money would be raised to engage the services of
counsel, in order to secure his release and acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records show, however, that Felipe was<span style=""> </span>born on <st1:date year="1930" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1930</st1:date>, so that he was over 23 years of age at
the time of the occurrence, and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span> could not have made the statement imputed to him by
Felipe.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">(b) Again, had Andrea
been actually shot by Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span>, why should <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span> be interested in
shifting the blame to Felipe <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span>?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">(c) Felipe testified, also, that Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span>
later per­suaded him to admit his guilt and name appellant herein as the in­stigator
of the crime charged, apart from warning him that, other­wise, "we will
kill you." Felipe did not explain, however, who were these "we",
apart from Benjamin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, Benjamin
had no possible motive, either to kill Andrea, or to involve appellant herein
in her assassination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary,
Benjamin, <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> and Felipe were in the most cordial
relations with Andrea's family, for which reason <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span>
sensed nothing unusual when Benjamin and Felipe went up her house shortly
before the fatal shooting.</p>

<p class="BODY">(d) Neither does the record show why the threat allegedly made,
either by <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span> or
by Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span> or by both, to kill Felipe, should
he not assume responsibility for Andrea's death, would suffice to induce him to
agree thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
and Benjamin were not armed, when the alleged threats were made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is not the slightest indication that
any of them had money, power or influence, to exert any pressure upon Felipe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three (3) of them belonged to the same
humble social station, and, being of about the same age and having grown up in
the same barrio, they were close friends and had been hanging around together
for many years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, when <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gamayo</span> sought to
ascertain the where­abouts of Felipe <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span>,
appellant suggested that <span class="SpellE">Gamayo</span> inquire about it from
<span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">(e) We should not overlook the fact that the conversation between
<span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> and Felipe, in Sanchez Mira, took place in
the house of the latter's brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
difficult, therefore, to con­ceive that <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> would
have dared to threaten Felipe precisely where he must have felt a sense of
security.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, Felipe was in the
Constabulary barracks in <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>
Norte, when the second threat was allegedly made to him (Felipe), this time by
Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Being under the custody of the Constabulary, which could protect him,
Felipe had no reason to fear Benjamin in that place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Significantly, <u>it has not even been
intimated that any member of the Constabulary or public officer had, at any
time, exerted undue pressure or influence upon Felipe</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">(f) As if this were not enough, Felipe admitted on the wit­ness
stand, that the questions and answers appearing in his affidavit Exhibit F had
actually been propounded to and given by him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is more, Judge <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span>, before whom Felipe
had sworn to the truth of said statement, was, evidently, a friend of appellant
here­in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, Judge <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span> and appellant <span style="">were
</span>together in the house of Andrea, while her body was lying in state
therein, shortly after the occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, soon after Andrea had reported appellant's alleged attempt to
ravish her, two (2) days before, Judge <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span> wrote a
note informing him of her intention to file a formal com­plaint, thereby giving
him an opportunity, of which he availed, to try to appease her, which he did,
although unsuccessfully, the next day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly, Judge <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span> would not have
attested to said extra­judicial confession had there been the slightest indicia
that Felipe was not acting freely in connection therewith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">(g) Felipe's extrajudicial confession contains many details that
only he could have supplied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides,
said details dovetail with the facts set forth in the affidavits made by <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span> and Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span> a week before.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, some of those details were unknown to them (<span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
and Benjamin) and do not appear in their affidavits.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While Felipe was in the house of his brother, in Sanchez Mira, <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> came - according to Felipe - and urged him to
assume responsibility for the death of Andrea, because, otherwise, “we will
kill you." When, soon thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Garnayo</span> came and asked Felipe whether he was Andrea's
killer, he answered in the negative.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, Benjamin took Felipe aside and repeated the advice and threat
allegedly given and made before by <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time, Felipe agreed to follow said
advice, only to deny his guilt, once more, when <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gamayo</span> began to investigate him formally in <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon, however, as <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
<span class="SpellE">Macoco</span> showed up, Felipe made the extrajudicial
confession, Ex­hibit F.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In none of the
foregoing occasions was either <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> or Benjamin
alone with Felipe long enough to instruct him about the details of said
confession.</p>

<p class="BODY">Needless to say, the story thus given by Felipe on the wit­ness
stand, was refuted by that of <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gamayo</span>, who declared that Felipe readily admitted his guilt
in Sanchez Mira, and even gave therein some important details, which he
elaborated in <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>, in his extrajudicial confession,
Exhibit F.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Felipe's testimony does not
even suggest that either <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gamayo</span>
or Judge <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span>, be­fore whom Exhibit F was sworn to,
had exerted any pressure upon him or allowed anybody to do so, in their
presence.</p>

<p class="BODY">(h) The fact that it was Felipe, not Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span>,
who went in hiding immediately after the occurrence and that Felipe has not
appealed from the judgment of conviction rendered against him, despite his
claim that it was Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span>, not he, who had
killed Andrea, suggests strongly that he was really her assas­sin.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of particular
significance in this case is appellant's testimony to the effect that he did
not believe his illicit relations with his own niece, Andrea, had
"lowered" his "prestige and char­acter" in the eyes of the
community and that he intended to "take her with" him <u>"as
soon as</u>" his "wife died", the latter having been sick for
quite some time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, he admitted
that, meanwhile, he had, also, had extramarital relations with one <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Cac</span>, in consequence of
which she bore him a child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even more
typical­ly illustrative of appellant's frame of mind <span style="">is </span>the reason given by him, on the witness stand, to explain, if
not justify, his affair with Andrea:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> I saw
her to be a beautiful woman in <span style="">full
bloom, and <u>I did not want any man to get ahead of me in making her </u></span><u><span style="">fall</span></u><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>because if I postpone my love
making to her, <u>she might belong to another man afterwards</u>."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A person with such a sense of moral values can hardly be expected
to stop at nothing to attain his purpose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In his own words, he did not want Andrea to "belong to another man
afterwards."</p>

<p class="BODY">We are, therefore, of the opinion and so hold that appellant is
guilty beyond reasonable doubt, as author by inducement, of the crime of
murder, qualified by evident premeditation, with the generic aggravating
circumstances of treachery and nighttime, in view of <span style="">which the maximum of the penalty prescribed for said offense, or death,
should be meted out, except that the number of votes neces­sary <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> are not present.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This notwithstanding, the indemnity of P6,000.00 imposed in the decision
appealed from should be in­creased to P12,000.00.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With this modification as to the indemnity, said decision is,
accordingly, affirmed, in all other respects, with costs against appellant Julio
<span class="SpellE">Tapec</span>.</p>
