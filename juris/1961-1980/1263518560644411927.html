naturalization of Felipe de Jesus <span class="SpellE">Dy</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1962</st1:date>,
petitioner Felipe de Jesus <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> filed his petition for
naturalization together with the requisite affidavits of his witnesses <span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Tubio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Enardecido</span> in the Court

<p class="BODY">Only the notice of the petition for Philippine citizenship, not
the petition itself, was posted on the Bulletin Board of the Court of First

 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental</st1:placename></st1:place>,
and in the Official Gazette once a week for three consecutive weeks as required
by law (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. C, E, F, F-1, F-2 and F-3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the notice of the petition for
Philippine citizen­ship, as posted and published as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>,
contained most of the allegations of the petition, it omitted especially the
important aver­ment in paragraph 12 of the petition concerning his belief in
the prin­ciples underlying the Philippine Constitution, his having conducted
himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during the entire period of his
residence in the Philippines, in his relation with the constituted government
as well as with the community in which he lives, his having mingled socially
with Filipinos, and his having evinced a sincere desire to learn and embrace
the customs, tra­ditions and ideals of the Filipinos (see <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
A, p. 2, rec. of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.).</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted also that his petition does not allege that he
is of good moral character as required by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the trial, he submitted his certificate of registration as

The notice as thus posted and published contained only a summary of some of the

omission militates against the approval of his petition; because we cannot
depart, as Justice Fernando opined speaking for this Tribunal, from “the basic

its benefits can be enjoyed."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

store assisted by his uncle's houseboy; because he does not know the name of the
alleged store helper, or whether he had a payroll or not, or whether his
business was registered with the Social Security System.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is his claim that he capitalized his
store with his savings of P1,000.00 in 1950, credible; because he did not even
state the source of his alleged savings or how he saved such an amount when he
was only about 18 years old.</blockquote>

support his alleged income for 1960, 1961, and 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His <span class="SpellE">salesbooks</span> for
1958 until the first quarter of 1963, should have been submitted to show not
only that he had such an income but also that he owned and was actually opera­ting
the store, which should be corroborated by the business licenses, permits,
books and income tax returns of his father or mother to prove that they have
separate businesses.</blockquote>

<blockquote>To prove his alleged ownership of thirty heads of large cattle,
petitioner submitted only a certification of the municipal treasurer attest­ing
to such ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The best evidence of
such ownership are the certificates of ownership of large cattle themselves or
certified true <span class="SpellE">photo­stats</span> thereof, which contain the
description of the individual cattle owned by him, its sex, age, cowlicks,
brands, etc. and the source and mode of acquisition thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The certification issued to him by the
municipal treasurer does not even identify the alleged thirty heads of large
cattle he allegedly owns, whether cows, bulls, <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span>,
or horses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has not submitted any
proof to show that he had income from the sale of such large <span class="SpellE">cattles</span>.</blockquote>

</span>Being a novice in the practice, he could not possibly earn in his town
P200 a month or P2,400 that year 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even
if he did, the said income is insufficient to qualify him for naturalization,
although he is a bachelor.</blockquote>
