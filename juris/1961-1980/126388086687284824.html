and <st1:date month="11" day="9" year="1968">November 9, 1968</st1:date> and
other related Orders in Civil Case No. V-3064, entitled "Rafael A. <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span>, et al. vs. Lee Bun Ting, et al.", with
prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The antecedent facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="6" day="27" year="1956">June 27, 1956</st1:date>,
this Court rendered judgment in <span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. <span style="">No. </span>L-5996, entitled "Rafael <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span>, et al. vs. Lee Bun Ting, et al.<span class="GramE">".</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
In that case, <span class="GramE">We</span> found that:</p>

<blockquote>"In the month of March, 1936, petitioners-appellants sold to
Lee <span class="SpellE">Liong</span>, a Chinese citizen, predecessor-in-interest
of respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, a parcel of land situated
on the corner of <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> Avenue and <span class="SpellE">Pavia</span>
Street, <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> (now <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
City), <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>, designated as lot 398 and covered by
Original Certificate of Title No. 3389.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The cost was P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and soon after the sale
Lee <span class="SpellE">Liong</span> constructed thereon a concrete building
which he used as a place for his lumber business and in part as residence for
himself and family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners had
contended that the sale was a conditional sale, or one with the right of
repurchase during the last years of a ten-year period, but both the trial court
and the Court of Appeals found that the sale was an absolute one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another contention of the
petitioners-appellants is that the sale is null and void as it was made in
violation of the provision contained in the Constitution (Article XIII, section
5), but the Court of Appeals found that the purchaser was not aware of the
constitutional prohibition while petitioners-appellants were because the
negotiations for the sale were conducted with the knowledge and direct
intervention of Judge Rafael <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span>, one of the
plaintiffs, who was at that time an assistant attorney in the Department of
Justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *" <span style="">(p. </span><span style="">429)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In reply </span>to <span style="">the contention of appellants </span>therein <span style="">that as the sale to Lee <span class="SpellE">Liong</span>
is prohibited by the Constitution, </span>title <span style="">to the land did not pass to said alien because the sale did not produce
</span>any <span style="">juridical effect in his
favor, and that the constitutional prohibition should be deemed self-executing
in character in order to give effect to the constitutional mandate, this Court
said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“* * * In answer we state that granting the sale to be null and
void and can not give title to the vendee, it does not necessarily follow <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> that the title remained in the vendor, who had
also violated the constitutional prohibition, or that he (vendor) has the right
to recover the title of which he has divested himself by his act in ignoring
the prohibition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such contingency
another principle of law sets in to bar the equally guilty vendor from
recovering the title which he had voluntarily conveyed for a consideration,
that of <span class="SpellE"><i>pari</i></span> <span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">delicto</span></i></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We</span><span style=""> </span>have applied this principle as a bar
to the present action in a series of cases, thus:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-size: 12pt;">* * *<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*
* *<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* * *<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'We can, therefore, say that even if the plaintiffs can still
invoke the Constitution, or the doctrine in the <span class="SpellE">Krivenko</span>
case, to set aside the sale in question, they are now prevented from doing so
if their purpose is <span style="">to </span>recover
the lands that they have voluntarily parted with, because of their guilty
knowledge that what they were doing was in violation of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They cannot escape the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court well said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A party to an illegal contract cannot come
into a court of law and ask to have his illegal objects carried out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law will not aid either party to an ille­gal
agreement; it leaves the parties where it finds them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule is expressed in the maxims:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'<i>Ex <span class="SpellE">dolo</span> <span class="SpellE">malo</span> non <span class="SpellE">oritur</span> <span class="SpellE">actio</span>’</i>,<i> </i>and<i> 'In <span class="SpellE">pari</span>
<span class="SpellE">delicto</span> <span class="SpellE">potior</span> <span class="SpellE">est</span> <span class="SpellE">conditio</span> <span class="SpellE">defendentis</span></i>.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * ’</p>

<blockquote>"It is not necessary for us to re-examine the doctrine laid
down by us in the above cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We must
add in justification of the adoption of the doctrine that the scope of our
power and autho­rity is to interpret the law merely, leaving to the proper
co-ordinate body the function of lay­ing down the policy that should be
followed in relation to conveyances in violation of the cons­titutional
prohibition and in implementing said policy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The situation of these prohibited conve­yances is not different from
that of homestead sold within five years from and after the issuance of the
patent, (Section 118, C.A. 141, otherwise known as the Public Land Law), for
which situation the legislature has adopted the policy, not of returning the
homestead sold to the original home­steader, but of forfeiting the homestead
and re­turning it to the public domain again subject to disposition in
accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Section 124, <st1:state><st1:place><i>Id</i>.</st1:place></st1:state>)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The doctrine of in <span class="SpellE"><i>pari</i></span> <span class="SpellE"><i>delicto</i></span> bars petitioners-appellants from recovering
the title to the property in question and renders unnecessary the consideration
of the other arguments present­ed in appellants' brief.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is one other cause why petitioners' remedy cannot be
entertained, that is the pres­cription of the action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the sale occurred in <span style="">March, 1936, more than ten </span>years had
already elapsed from the time the cause of action accrued when the action was
filed (1948)." (pp. 431-432)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Noting the absence of
policy governing lands sold to aliens in violation of the constitutional
prohibition, <span class="GramE">We</span> further said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"We take this occasion
</span>to <span style="">call the atten­tion of </span>the
legislature to the absence of a law or policy on sales in violation of the
Constitu­tion; this Court would have filled the void were we not aware of the
fact that the matter falls beyond the scope of our authority and properly
belongs to a co-ordinate power." (p. 432)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Accordingly,
the petition in the foregoing case was denied.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

be declared as the rightful and legal owners of the property in question; that
defendants be ordered to vacate the premises, to surrender possession thereof
to plain­tiffs and to receive the amount of P6,000.00 from the plaintiffs as
restitution of the purchase price; and that defendants be ordered to pay
damages to the plaintiffs in the amount of P2,000.00 a month from the time of

the costs of suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">A motion to dismiss, dated <st1:date month="9" day="23" year="1968">September 23, 1968</st1:date>, was filed by defendants-petitioners

</span>The court said:</p>

<blockquote>"A copy of the decision rendered in the case of Rafael <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span>, et al. vs. Lee Bun Ting, et al., <span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No. L-5996 is attached to the mo­tion to dismiss.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that both parties

its origin might have been.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration of the foregoing Order was filed by
defendants, alleging that their reply to plaintiffs' opposition to the motion
to dismiss was not even considered by the court <i><span style="">a quo</span></i><span style=""> </span>because
the Order was issued before said reply could reach the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, it was asserted that the <i>Philippine
Banking </i><i><span style="">Corporation vs. <span class="SpellE">Lui</span> She</span></i><span style=""> </span>case
had the effect of annulling and setting aside only the contracts subject matter
thereof "and no other con­tracts, certainly not contracts outside the
issues in said judgment as that in the instant case", and of ordering the
return only of the lands involved in said case, and not the land subject of the
pre­sent action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it was
averred that “Nowhere in the majority opinion nor in the concurring opinion in
said decision of Philippine Banking Cor­poration vs. <span class="SpellE">Lui</span>
She does there appear any statement which would have the effect of reopening
and changing previously adjudicated rights of parties and finally settled
cases" and that the principle enunciated in such case "should apply
after, not on or before, September 12, 1967”.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The motion for re­consideration was found to have not been well taken
and, consequently, was denied by respondent court on <st1:date month="11" day="9" year="1968">November 9, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants were given ten (10) days from
receipt of the Order within which to file their answer to the complaint, which
defendants complied with.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants' answer, dated <st1:date month="12" day="5" year="1968">December
 5, 1968</st1:date>, contained the following allegations, among others:</p>

<blockquote>“(<span class="GramE">a</span>)
The sale of the parcel of land in­volved was made in 1935 before the
promulgation of the Constitution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(b) Said conveyance

later a two-storey five-door <span class="SpellE">accessoria</span> with an
assessed valuation of P35<span class="GramE">,000.00</span><span style="">, </span>which said<span style="">&nbsp; </span>improvements were destroyed during the
Japanese entry into the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> in
April 1942; thereafter, the same improvements were rebuilt.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(d) In July
1947, the said Lee <span class="SpellE">Liong</span> being already deceased,
defendants as his legal heirs entered into an extrajudicial settlement of said
property, there being no creditors or other heirs, and by virtue of said
extrajudicial settlement, approximately two-thirds of said property was
adjudicated to defendant <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Chia</span>
and Lee Bing <span class="SpellE">Hoo</span> as co-owners and the remaining
one-third to defendant Lee Bun Ting.</blockquote>

alleging that plaintiffs will not suffer any irreparable injury or grave damage

<blockquote>"'The fundamental principle upon <span style="">which </span>the doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></i> rests is that parties ought not to be
permitted to litigate the same issue more than once; that, when a right or fact
has been <span class="SpellE">juridically</span> tried and determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction, or an opportunity for such trial has been given, the
judgment of the court, so long as is re­<span style="">mains

<blockquote>"This principle of <span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">res</span></i></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">judicata</span></i></span><span style=""> </span>is embodied in Rule 39, Sec. 49(b)
and (c) of <span style="">the </span>Rules of Court,
as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">'(b) In other cases
the judgment or order is, with respect to <span style="">the
mat</span>ter directly adjudged or as to any other matter that could have been
raised in relation thereto, conclusive between the parties and their succes­sors-in-interest
by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special proceeding,
litigating for the same title and in the same capa­city.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">'(c) In any other
litigation between the same parties or their suc­cessors-in-interest, that only
is deemed to have been adjudged in a for­mer judgment which appears upon its
face to have been so adjudged, or was actually and necessarily included therein
or necessary thereto.'</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 49(b) enunciates that concept of <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i>
<span class="SpellE">judicata</span></i> known as 'bar by prior judgment' while
Sec. 49(c) refers to 'conclusiveness of judgment.' There is 'bar by prior
judgment' when, between the first case where the judgment was rendered and the
second case which is sought to be barred, there is identity of parties, subject
matter and cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment
in the first case constitutes an absolute bar to the subsequent action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is final as to the claim or demand in
controversy, including the parties and those in <span class="SpellE">privity</span>
with them, not only as to every mat­ter which was offered and received to
sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible matter
which might have been offered for that purpose and of all matters that could
have been adjudged in that case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
where bet­ween the first and second cases, there is iden­tity of parties but no
identity or cause of act­ion, the first judgment is conclusive in the second
case, only as to those matters actually and directly <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
and determined and not as to matters merely involved therein." <span class="GramE">(pp. 76?78).</span></blockquote>
