				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition for review on certiorari filed by the Rizal
Cement Worker's Union (FFW), hereinafter referred to as the Union
seeking for a modification of the decision and resolution of the Court
of Industrial Relations in Case No. 1020-ULP, and to have the
respondent Rizal Cement Co., Inc., hereinafter referred to as the
Company, declared guilty of unfair labor practice and the 21
union-members involved in the case entitled to back wages from May 28,
1956.<p></p>
  <p> In connection with the unfair labor practice case
filed by the Union against the Company, resulting from the alleged
locking out of the 21 complainants, a decision was rendered by the
Court of Industrial Relations, after due trial, containing the
following findings of fact:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
"The Rizal Cement Workers Union, affiliated with the Federation of Free
Workers, heretofore referred to as tlio Union, is a legitimate labor
organization. The twenty-one complainant workers are members of the
Union and work at the Bodega Tangue, Paco, Manila * * *."</p>
    <p>
"The respondent Rizal Cement Co., Inc. is a corporation likewise
organized under the laws of the Philippines and is engaged principally
in the manufacture of cement. (Exh. 30-Rizal'). It operates a plant in
Binangonan, Rizal, where it manufactures cement. The bags of cement are
then sent in barges to the Bodega Tangue at Paco, where they are
unloaded by workers therein and sent either directly to customers on
trucks and pickups or stored in the warehouse for future deliveries.</p>
    <p>
"There is also no dispute as to the fact that on May 27, 1956, the
Union staged a strike at the plant of the respondent Rizal Cement Co.,
Inc. in Binangonan, Rizal. In the early morning of the following day,
that is, on May 23, 1956. Candida de Leon, warehouseman-encargado at
the Bodega Tangue, received a telephone call from one Johnny de Leon,
manager of the respondent, Rizal Cement Co., Inc., with the information
that the Union staged a strike against the company on the previous day,
May 27, 1956, in Binangonan, Rizal, De Leon further informed him that
he should take <i>precautionary measures in protecting the properties
of the company stored at the Bodega Tangue because of the strikers
caused damage to the factory in Binangonan</i> and sabotage might
occur. For this reason, he was advised by the manager to request the
members of the Union to stay meanwhile outside the premises of the
Bodega Tanque. What he did in the morning of May 28, 1956 was to
station himself at the gate of the compound. When the workers arrived
for work at 7:00 a.m., he did not allow the 21 complaining workers who
are members of the Union to enter the gate and allowed only those who
are not members of said Union. Upon refusal of Candido de Leon to allow
the complaining workers to work on that day, the Union, through Ramon
L. Kabigting Vice-president of the FFW, sent a letter addressed to the
Manager, Bodega Tanque, Rizal Cement, Co., Inc., which, for ready
reference is hereby quoted as follows:</p>

    <p>"On
May 30, 1956, the complaining workers formed a picket line in front of
the Madrigal Building on the Escolta, Manila, where the offices of the
respondent companies are located. The picket lasted up to April 1957.</p>
    <p>
"After the complaining workers were not allowed to work on May 28,
1956, the respondent Rizal Cement Co., Inc. hired substitutes in order
that the work in the Bodega Tanque, which consists mainly in unloading
and loading cement, may not be paralyzed." (Italics supplied).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
With the foregoing: facts, the Court of Industrial Relations resolved
in the negative the issue presented therein, i.e., whether the
Company's denial to the 21 complaining workers, of entrance to the
compound and work constitutes a lockout, for the reason that the said
act was resorted to to forestall any possible sabotage in the
warehouse. It was pointed out that although the strike was declared in
and confined to the factory in Binangonan, Rizal, the activities in the
Tanque warehouse in Paco, Manila, where the complainants work,
complement those at the plant. Also, in the letter of the Union dated
September 24, 1954, addressed to the management, and as found by the
lower .court, the Union made it clear that the set of demands
(presented to the Company and the denial of which led to the
declaration of the strike in question) covers all the employees of the
Rizal Cement Co., Inc., "including those workers at the Bodega Tanque"
(p. SI, decision of Dee. 14, 1961), and that in the notice of strike
filed by the Union (Exhs. 125-Rizal and 125-A-Rizal), it was
specifically declared that the establishment covered by the projected
strike covers the "factory, quarry and warehouse", the last place
obviously referring to Bodega Tanque. Thus, the court held that, under
the circumstances, the lockout was resorted to as a defensive weapon or
dictated by economic necessity and, consequently, did not constitute an
unfair labor practice. And, as in the decision rendered in the main
case (No. 14-IPA), the strikers were ordered reinstated to their former
positions without back wages, which decision became final and executory
on May 27, 1961 the court directed the Company in this case to
reinstate the 21 complainants with back wages only from May 28, 1961.
This decision was affirmed by the court <i>en banc</i> by resolution of January 27, 1962. Hence, the filing of the instant petition.</p>
  <p>
It is claimed by petitioner Union in this proceeding that the Company's
refusal to admit the 21 complainants to work in the warehouse, simply
because they belong to the same Union that staged the strike in the
factory, constituted a violation of Section 4 a (4) of the Industrial
Peace Act (Rep. Act 875). Consequently, it is argued, complainants
should have been awarded back wages from May 28, 1956 when the
discriminatory act commenced and not only from May 28, 1961 when the
decision in the main case became final.</p>
  <p>
    Republic Act 875, on unfair labor practices, provides:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "Sec. 4. <i>Unfair Labor Practices</i>—: (a) It shall be unfair labor practice for an employer:</p>
    <p align="center">
      * * * * * *</p>
    <p> "(4) <i>To
discriminate in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or
condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any
labor organization</i>: Provided, That nothing in this Act or in any
other Act or statute of the Republic of the Philippines shall preclude
an employer from making an agreement with a labor organization to
require as a condition of employment membership therein, if such labor
organization is the representative of the employees as provided in
section twelve.</p>
    <p align="center">
      * * * * * * *</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
It is not herein controverted that the complainants were locked out or
denied work by the respondent Company. Under Republic Act 875, however,
for the discrimination by reason of union membership to be considered
an unfair labor practice, the same must have been committed to
encourage or discourage such membership in the union. This cannot be
said of the act of the company complained of. As clearly established by
the evidence, its refusal to allow complainants to work and requirement
that the latter stay out of the premises in the meantime (perhaps while
the stike was still going on at the factory) was borne out of the
company's justified apprehension and fear that sabotage might be
committed in the warehouse where the products, machinery and spare
parts were stored, as has been the case in Binangonan. It has never
been shown that the act of the Company was intended to induce the
complainants to renounce their union-membership or as a deterrent for
non-members to affiliate therewith, nor as a retaliatory measure for
activities in the union or in furtherance of the cause of the union. As
the strikers were declared entitled to wages only from the finality of
the decision in the main case (No. 14-IPA) or from May 28, 1961, the
award of back wages to herein complainants also from said date, is
justified and reasonable. It may even be stated in support thereof that
on May 30, 1956, complainants actually joined the picket line formed in
front of the Company's office at Escolta, Manila.</p>
  <p>
    <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision and resolution appealed  from are hereby affirmed, without costs.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>SO ORDERED.</strong></p>
