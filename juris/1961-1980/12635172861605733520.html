<p class="BODY">The background facts are:</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 30, 1935, in the cadastral case just mentioned, the
cadastral court rendered judgment declaring Lot 46 with an area of about 165
hectares a public forest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Previous to said cadastral proceeding, however, the same Lot 46
was sold by one Jesus <span class="SpellE">Vaño</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>

said Lot 46,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>

on April 15, 1943, for and in consideration of one peso, <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Petrona</span> <span class="SpellE">Rallon</span>, as such
holders of ordinary timber license and campsite permit, transferred their
rights of possession to the land known as <span class="SpellE">Catagbacan</span>

specific areas for each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This notwithstanding,
the records of the Bureau of Forestry do not show the names of plaintiffs as
licensees or <span class="SpellE">permittees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record dis­closes that the license of <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> <span class="SpellE">Rallon</span> expired on June 30,

began when, at the instance of Vicente <span class="SpellE">Rallon</span>, the
Government of the Philippines sued them and/or their predecessors for illegal
occupancy of that forest land.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
They were required to restore to the Philippine Government the res­pective

which they served.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

for free patent in the Bureau of Lands, except defendant <span class="SpellE">Timoteo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bulilis</span> whose free patent application was dated
February 25, 1953.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only on May 3,
1954 that each of the plaintiffs lodged their simultaneous sales applications
in the same bureau for portions of Lot 46.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the same day, they protested the free patent applications of
defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">The initial hearing of the controversy between defendants on the
one hand and plaintiffs on the other was conducted by the Provin­cial Land
Officer of <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span> on December 20, 1954.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was to be con­tinued on August 16, 1955,
was later reset for September 6 and 7, 1955.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then came the present court cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 26, 1955, before the Provincial
Land Officer of <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span> could continue with the investi­gation,
the <span class="SpellE">Rallons</span> simultaneously filed <span style="">in </span>the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span> the present actions to recover possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Rallons</span>
complained of having been illegally dispossessed in March 1952 of their lands
(forming portions of Lot 46) by defendants in the portions set out in their
respective complaints.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The object of
these cases, according to the <span class="SpellE">Rallons</span>, was <u>to</u> <u>facilitate</u>
<u>the</u> <u><span style="">adjudication</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u><span style="">administrative</span></u><span style=""> <u>dispute</u> </span>as soon as the
question of priority of pos­session was settled.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Plaintiffs made it clear that they acquired their rights from their aunts <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> and <span class="SpellE">Petrona</span> <span class="SpellE">Rallon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also
averred possession at the time when the territory became alienable.</p>

<p class="BODY">In all of the four complaints, the Director of Lands was made
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On September 13, 1955, the
Director of Lands moved to dismiss the four complaints for lack of
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although plain­tiffs at
first opposed the motion, nonetheless, on October 1, 1955, they moved to
exclude the Director of Lands as defendant upon their claim that counsel for
the Director of Lands made the court to under­stand that the Director would
suspend hearing on plaintiffs' protests, would "respect the decision of
this Honorable Court and would take into account the same in the final award
and adjudication that he may make with reference to the public land in question."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The lower court, however, on October 17, 1955, dismissed the cases with res­pect
to the Director of Lands "on the ground that the plaintiff <span style="">has </span>absolutely no cause of action
against the latter."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Failing in their attempt to secure a similar dismissal as against
them, defendants filed their respective answers substan­tially along similar
lines. Their common ground was that they or their predecessors started
possession at various dates, since the early 1920s; that in 1932, they declared
the lands for taxation pur­poses; that they had not failed to pay the taxes
thereon; that after the contempt proceedings against them they went back to the
lands; that they brought their plight to the Secretary of Agriculture and
Natural Resources and to the President; that in 1940, they applied for
homestead covering their respective portions; that their appli­cations were
denied because the lands at the time were within the forest zone; that it was
at their own initiative and efforts that the lands were released from the
forest zone on February 27, 1952; that plaintiffs did not have actual
possession; that a license or permit does not carry the right of possession but
only the right to cut, collect and remove forest products; that said right was
revoked, or cancelled by the release of the lands into the disposable public
domain; that licenses or permits are non-negotiable and non-trans­ferable and
cease upon the death of the licensees or grantees; that plaintiffs have not
acquired any rights from <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> and <span class="SpellE">Petrona</span> <span class="SpellE">Rallon</span>; and that such
transfer, if any, from <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> and <span class="SpellE">Petrona</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rallon</span> to plain­tiffs did not have the consent or
approval of the Bureau of Forestry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
reiterated their averment of want of jurisdiction which was the ground of their
motion to dismiss.</p>

<p class="BODY">Back to the Bureau of Lands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On May 29, 1956, the Director of Lands ordered the <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span>
Provincial Land Officer to proceed with the investigation of the administrative
case between plaintiffs and defendants, The Director took the view that because
of the court's ruling that plaintiffs "have absolutely no cause of
action" against him, he entertained the belief that his office "may
now proceed independently of the judicial proceedings."</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 2, 1956, plaintiffs requested postponement of the
investigation by the Lands Office for the reason that the court cases had not
as yet been finally decided or determined.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because of the Director's directive, the Provincial Land Officer set the
continuation of the hearing for August 3, 4 and 6, 1956.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs chose not to appear thereat.
Defendants presented evidence ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 7, 1956, after formal hearing terminated, plaintiffs
appeared at the Provincial Land Office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There, they were apprised of the hearing which ended the day previous,
that is, the 6th.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were asked if
they were ready to present their evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They answered in the negative.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were then informed that an ocular inspection would be conducted on
the following day, <span style="">August </span>8, at
which they were requested to be present.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But at the ocular inspection, the plaintiffs likewise did not appear.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the face of the
foregoing, the Provincial Land Officer ren­dered his report on August 10, 1956
to the Director of Lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His findings
were that defendants were actual occupants of the lands they applied for,
entered the lands as early </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">1920, introduced considerable improvements
thereon; that the lands were converted into <span class="SpellE">ricelands</span>
and corn fields, planted to root crops, fruit trees, coconut trees, jackfruit
trees and bamboo; that houses were built thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">also the explicit
finding that plaintiffs had not occupied any portions of the lands in
controversy nor did they have any improvements on the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Provincial Land Officer's recommendation,
accordingly, was that the protests of plaintiffs be dismissed and the free
patent applications of defendants be given due course.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It was on <st1:date year="1957" day="11" month="5">May 11, 1957</st1:date>
when the Director of Lands entered an order dismissing plaintiffs claims and
giving due course to defendants free patent applications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs (protestants) moved to
reconsider.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Director of Lands issued
the denial order on <st1:date year="1957" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He there dwelt on the power of the Director
of Lands to investigate and proceed to dispose of public land to whomsoever has
a better right to acquire the same under the provisions of the Public Land
Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, independently of the
powers of the courts in deciding <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> questions
arising out of forcible entry, usurpation or similar acts of
dispossession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Director found that
plaintiffs herein "had persistently refused to submit to the investigation
[of his Office] with­out justifiable cause" and ordered that, upon the
facts established in the investigation, plaintiffs’ claims be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs herein appealed to the Secretary of Agriculture and
Natural Resources.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1958" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1958</st1:date>, Acting Secretary
Jose M. Trinidad rendered a decision reciting the facts and affirming the order
of the Director of Lands of <st1:date year="1957" day="11" month="5">May 11,
 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although plaintiffs
received copy of this decision on <st1:date year="1958" day="28" month="1">January
 28, 1958</st1:date>, they only moved to recon­sider on <st1:date year="1958" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On April 22, 1958, Secretary Juan de G. Rodriguez ruled that upon the
provisions of Section 12 of Lands Ad­ministrative Order No. 6, the decision of
his Office becomes final after the lapse a thirty (30) days from the date of
its receipt by the interested party, declared that plaintiffs motion for
reconsideration was beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period
and, accordingly, denied the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
appeal from the Secretary's decision to the Office of the President was taken
by plaintiffs.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon due process and </span><span style="">jurisdictional </span><span style="">grounds, plaintiffs went to the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span> on June 10, 1958 on
certiorari to annul the decisions and orders of the Director of Lands and the
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources just adverted to, On October 6,
1959, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span> rendered
judgment annulling the administrative decisions and orders aforesaid and
directing the Director of Lands to reinvestigate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It was defendants' turn

been deprived of their day in court, that the absence of the <span class="SpellE">Rallons</span> from the adminis­trative investigation was due to
their own fault and that they were thus not denied opportunity to be
heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More importantly, the Court of
Appeals pronounced that the decision of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources had already become "final and definite".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals' judgment of </span><st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="11"><span style="">November
 3, 1965</span></st1:date><span style=""> had also
become final.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It was only on April 18, 1963 - or over five (5) years after the
Secretary's decision in defendants' favor - that the trial court rendered
judgment in the present cases, mentioned earlier in this opinion. Plaintiffs
appealed direct to this Court on purely questions of law, and assigned the
following as errors: (1) "The lower court erred in dismissing the four
cases involved herein and in holding that it has no jurisdiction to decide the
same"; and (2) "The lower court erred in not granting the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> prayed for in the four com­plaints involved
herein."</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The power of executive control, administration, disposition and
alienation of public lands is lodged with the Director of Lands subject, of
course, to the control of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a rule set out in the

question by now that courts have jurisdiction over <span class="SpellE">possessory</span>
actions involving public lands, even if the same are involved in adminis­trative

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Pitargue</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Sorilla</u></span>,
92 Phil. 5, the question as set out by this Court is this: "Do courts have
jurisdiction to entertain an action of forcible entry instituted by a <u>bona</u>
<u>fide</u> applicant of public land, who is in occupation and peaceful
possession thereof and who has introduced improvements, against one who
deprives him of the possession thereof <u><span style="">before</span></u><span style=""> <u>award</u> <u>and</u> </span><u>pending</u>

entry may be pursued indepen­dently of the administrative case in the Bureau of
Lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We there expressed the rationale
of the rule, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The
vesting of the Lands Department with authority to administer, dispose, and
alienate public lands, therefore, must not be understood <span style="">as </span>depriving the other branches of
the Government of <span style="">the exercise of their
respective functions or powers thereon, such </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">the authority to stop
disorders and </span>quell breaches of the peace by the police, and the
authority on the part of the courts to take jurisdiction over <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> actions arising <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
not involving, directly or indirectly, alienation and disposition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Our attention has been called to a principle enun­ciated in
American courts to the effect that courts have no jurisdiction to determine the
rights of claimants to public lands, and that until the disposition of the land
has passed from the control of the Federal Government, the courts will riot
interfere with the administration of <span style="">matters concerning the same. (50 C.J. 1093-1094.) </span><span style="">We have no quarrel with this principle. The
determina­tion of the respective rights of rival claimants to public lands </span><u><span style="">is</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">different</span></u><span style=""> from the determination of who has the actual
physical possession or occupation with a view to protecting the same and
preventing disorder and breaches of the peace.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A judgment of the court ordering restitution of the possession of a parcel
of land to the actual occupant, who has been deprived thereof by another
through the use of force or in any other illegal manner, <u>can</u> <u>never</u>
<u>be</u> <u>prejudice</u></span><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">interference'</span></u><span style=""> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> </span><u><span style="">disposition</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">or</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">alienation</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">of</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">public</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">lands</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, if courts were deprived of
jurisdiction of cases involving conflicts of possession, that threat of
judicial action against breaches of the peace committed on public lands would
be eliminated, and a state of lawlessness would probably be produced between
appli­cants, occupants or squatters, where force or might, not right or
justice, would rule."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court overruled the lower
court and pronounced that: "x </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> an action for recovery of possession </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">an urgent matter which </span>must be decided promptly to forestall
breaches of peace, bodily injury to person, mayhem, or perhaps loss of
life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the duty of the Court to act
swiftly and expeditiously in cases of that nature."</p>

<p class="BODY">Recently, we made a categorical statement in <u>Molina</u> <u>vs.</u>
<u>De</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Bacud</u></span> (1967), 19 SCRA 956, 959,<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
that "[t]he authority given to the Lands Department over the disposition
of public lands' does not exclude the courts from their jurisdiction over <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> actions, the public character of the land
notwithstanding."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus it <span style="">is, </span>that the jurisdictional question raised below must be decided
in the affirmative:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>courts have
jurisdiction over <span class="SpellE">pos­sessory</span> actions involving
public lands to determine the issue of physical possession (in forcible entry
cases before inferior courts) or the better right of possession (in <span class="SpellE"><u>accion</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">publiciana</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>cases
before courts of first instance).<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
And this, because the issue of physical possession raised before the courts is
independent of the question of disposition and alienation of public lands which
should be threshed out in the Bureau of Lands.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. Withal, plaintiffs' cause still fails. <span style="">The <span class="SpellE"><span style="">possessory</span></span><span style=""> actions </span></span>before us have been
rendered moot and academic <span style="">by the <u>prior </u>decisions </span>of the Director of Lands and the
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources heretofore referred to.</p>

<p class="BODY">The validity of the proceedings leading to these administrative
decisions have been put to a test in certiorari proceedings initiated by
plaintiffs against defendants, the Bureau of Lands and the Secre­tary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources in the <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span> court.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals on appeal declared that said pro­ceedings
were not tainted with abuse of discretion which would call for the supervisory
power of the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, as the
Court of Appeals held, plaintiffs could only be blamed for their failure to
appear in the administrative proceedings and for allowing the deci­sion of the
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources to become "final and
definite".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot turn our back
on the judgment of the Court of Appeals, now final.</p>

<p class="BODY">No longer is it within the power of the courts of justice to
interfere with the Lands Department decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More so because plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative
remedies by not filing their motion for reconsideration with the Secretary of
Agri­culture and Natural Resources on time and by not appealing from said
decision to the Office of the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Long familiar is the precept that failure to
exhaust administrative remedies is fatal to any court review.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The reason then for <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> actions
in court, namely, to "facilitate adjudication's by the Lands Department of
a dispute over public land<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
no longer exists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, defendants'
applications are no longer pending investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants' possession of the lands disputed,
for purposes of the free patents, has been confirmed in the administrative
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The administrative branch of the
govern­ment has thus already spoken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its
action has lapsed into finality. Accordingly, plaintiffs' claim of possession <span style="">is </span>lost. Since plaintiffs' protests,
in reference to possession, has already been resolved adversely against them by
the Lands Department, nothing more is left for the courts to pursue.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case of <u>Hernandez</u> <u>vs.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Clapis</u></span>,
98 Phil. 684, cited in <span class="SpellE"><u>Nazal</u></span> <u>vs.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Belmonte</u></span> (May 23, 1968), 23 SCRA 700, 703, is in
point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>Hernandez</u> a forcible
entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case was decided in favor of
plaintiffs and against defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Execution of the judgment was objected to upon the ground that during
the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the appeal before the Supreme Court,
the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources had rejected the sales
application of plaintiffs and allowed the defendants to purchase the land in
dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reversing the order of
execution issued by the lower court, "in so far as the matter of
possession of the land in question is concerned," we said: "While the
decision in the forcible entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case <span style="">is </span>final, it can no longer be
executed at least in so far <span style="">as </span>the
possession of the land in question is concerned, because, under section 4 of
Commonwealth Act No. 141, the Director of Lands has direct executive control of
the survey, classification, lease, sale or any other form of concession or
disposition and manage­ment <span style="">of </span>the
lands of the public domain, and <u>his</u> <u>decisions</u> <u><span style="">as</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>to</u> <u>questions</u> <u>of</u> <u>fact</u> <u>are</u> <u>conclusive</u>
<u>when</u> <u>approved</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>Secretary</u> <u><span style="">of</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>Agriculture</u>; and because the latter had already
cancelled the right of plaintiff Maria L. Hernandez to administer the land in
question and rejected both her sales application and that of her husband,
plaintiff Antonio Hernandez, at the same time giving the defendants the
preferential right to apply for said land in virtue of the provisions of
Republic Act No. 65.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The correctness of
the final decision of the Secretary of Agriculture is not herein involved, but
it is valid and binding until reversed in a proper proceeding by the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The situation is not that the
judgment in the forcible entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case has <span style="">lost its </span><span class="SpellE">virtuality</span>,
but that the plaintiffs had subsequently <u>ceased</u> <u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>entitled</u>
<u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>relief</u> <u>awarded</u> <u>by</u> <u>said</u> <u>judgment</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Realiza</u></span> <u>vs.</u> <u>Duarte</u>
(August 31, 1967), 20 SCRA 1264, after <u>the</u> <u>entry</u> <u>of</u> <u>judgment</u>
in a forcible entry case, the homestead appli­cation of <st1:city><st1:place>Duarte</st1:place></st1:city>
was approved by the Director of Lands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In an action for revival of the forcible entry judgment, we ruled
"that the approval of his (<st1:city><st1:place>Duarte</st1:place></st1:city>'s)
homestead application <u>legalized</u> <u>his</u> <u>position</u>, and such
approval constitutes a <span class="SpellE"><u>justiciable</u></span> <u>defense</u>
against the action for revival of judgment as it <u>necessarily</u> <u>affects</u>
<u>the</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>appellee's</u></span> (Realiza’s) <u>right</u>
<u>of</u> <u>possession</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>land</u> from which <st1:city><st1:place>Duarte</st1:place></st1:city>

We, accordingly, reversed the decision against <st1:city><st1:place>Duarte</st1:place></st1:city>
"with respect to his possession of the land."</p>

<p class="BODY">Also on this point, we quote from our opinion in <u>De</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>los</u></span> <u>Santos</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Rodriguez</u>
(January 31, 1968), 22 SCRA 451, 457, thus: "At the time of the rendition
of the decision in CA-G.R. No. 18912-R, the question of whether or not said
portion was to be part of her homestead had not as yet been definitely settled.
Accordingly, it became necessary to determine in that case who shall <u>meanwhile</u>
be in possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aforementioned
question was finally decided in favor of Rodriguez, in the order of the
Director of Fisheries, dated <st1:date year="1959" day="27" month="2">February
 27, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Thereafter</u>
he is, therefore, the party entitled to said possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the decision in <st1:place><st1:city>CA-G.R.</st1:city>
 <st1:postalcode>18912</st1:postalcode></st1:place>-R may no longer be
executed, not because the decision in <st1:place><st1:city>CA-G.R.</st1:city> <st1:postalcode>32970</st1:postalcode></st1:place>-R
has annulled it, but because of events subsequent to the first decision, which
events have changed materially the situation between the parties."</p>

<p class="BODY">The only difference between the foregoing cases and the present
is that here, the administrative decisions came <u>before</u> the trial court
rendered judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Which closes the <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> actions at bar in their <span style="">entirety.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

affirmed, with costs against plaintiffs-appellants.</p>
