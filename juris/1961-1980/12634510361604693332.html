declaring protestant, <span class=SpellE>Nazario</span> <span class=SpellE>Nalog</span>,
elected vice-mayor of the <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>municipality</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName><span class=SpellE>Antipolo</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place>,
<span class=SpellE>Rizal</span>, with a plurality of ten <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>(10) </span>votes over his closest opponent, said
<span class=SpellE>Nemesio</span> de Guzman.</p>

<p class=BODY>During the general elections held on <st1:date Year="1963"
Day="12" Month="11">November 12, 1963</st1:date>, protestant <span
class=SpellE>Nazario</span> <span class=SpellE>Nalog</span> and <span
class=SpellE>protestee</span> <span class=SpellE>Nemesio</span> de Guzman were
candidates for the office of vice-mayor of <span class=SpellE>Antipolo</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On <st1:date Year="1963" Day="13" Month="11">November
 13, 1963</st1:date>, the municipal board of canvassers of <span class=SpellE>Antipolo</span>
proclaimed De Guzman elected to <span class=GramE>said</span> office with a
plurality of five (5) votes over <span class=SpellE>Nalog</span>, who,
accordingly, filed, with the aforementioned court – together with the
candidates for councilors of his party – the corresponding election protest No.
7921, on <st1:date Year="1963" Day="26" Month="11">November 26, 1963</st1:date>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After appropriate proceedings, said court, in
which said Election Case No. 7921 was heard jointly with Election Case No.
7918, involving the office of the Mayor of <span class=SpellE>Antipolo</span>,
rendered a joint <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>decision </span>in <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>both cases, finding, in Election Case No.
7921, that <span class=SpellE>Nalog</span> had obtained 2, 048 votes, as
against 2,038 votes tallied for De Guzman, and, accordingly, proclaiming the
former elected to the office in question, with costs against De Guzman.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>Hence, this appeal by the
latter.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The losing party in
Election Case No. 7918, likewise, appealed from said decision, but the appeal
therein had been taken to the Court of Appeals as CA-G. <span class=GramE>R.
No. 37001-R, to which Court the evidence was forwarded.</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hence, we could not have said evidence until
after the Court of Appeals had render­ed its decision, on </span><st1:date
Year="1967" Day="27" Month="4"><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>April

<p class=BODY><span class=SpellE>Nalog</span> assails the appeal upon the
ground that the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction over the same, because
&quot;from any final decision rendered by the Curt of First Instance in
protests against the eligibility or the election of provincial governors,
members of the provincial board, city councilors and mayors, the aggrieved
party may appeal to the Court of Appeals or to the Supreme Court, as the case
may be,&quot; pursuant to Section 178 of the Revised Election Code<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
thereby denying, by necessary implication, the right to appeal from said
decision in election protests involving the office office-mayor or councilor of
regular municipalities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is settled,
however, that whenever questions purely of law are raised, a review may be
sought from the Supreme Court, under Article VIII, Section 2, of the
Constitution.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class=BODY>In his first assignment of error, De Guzman maintains that the
lower court should not have credited to <span class=SpellE>Nalog</span> the
following eleven (11) ballots, namely, Exhibits NN-168, NN-171, NN-180, NN-185,
NN-188, NN-191, NN-192, NN-197, NN-206, NN-207 and NN-208.</p>

<p class=BODY>In Exhibits NN-171, NN-180, NN-185, NN-191, NN-192, NN-197 and
NN-206, <span class=SpellE>Nalog</span> was voted on one of the spaces for <u>councilor</u>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By express provision of law, these seven (7)
votes should be considered as stray.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3'
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
What is more, the name written on or, rather, across-the space for Vice-Mayor,
in <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Exh</span></span><span class=GramE>.</span>
NN-197, is &quot;Jose <span class=SpellE>Oliveros</span>,&quot; Hence, there
can be no possible justification to chalk this vote for <span class=SpellE>Nalog</span>.<span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span class=GramE><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>The
name written on the apace for Vice-Mayor in Exhibit NN-163 is &quot;<span
class=SpellE>Nalog</span>.&quot;</span></span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt'> The same was properly credited to <span class=SpellE>Nalog</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>Upon the other hand, the
name &quot;N. <span class=SpellE>Nalog</span>,&quot; originally written on the
space for the Vice-Mayor, in Exhibit NN-188, appears to have been crossed-out,
seemingly by the voter himself, thus indicating a change of heart on his
part.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This ballot should not be counted
for <span class=SpellE>Nalog</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>The <span class=GramE>voter</span> who filled Exhibit NN-207, is
a poor writer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He had written only two
(2) names one, on the space for mayor and, another, on the space for
vice-mayor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the latter space, he
seems to have originally written, &quot;NAM&quot; and then corrected it, by
continuing the last stroke downward of the letter &quot;M&quot; into a big
loop, so that the word written may now be read as &quot;NAMO,&quot; &quot;NANO,&quot;
or &quot;NARO.&quot; The members of this Court believe that the person voted
for vice-mayor is &quot;NARO,&quot; which <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>is </span><u><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>idem</span></u><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'> <span class=SpellE><u>sonams</u></span> </span>with
<span class=SpellE>Nalog</span>, and that the vote was properly counted for the
<span class=SpellE>appellee</span>.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4' href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class=BODY>Appellant assails Exhibit NN-208 as marked.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The objection is untenable.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What is written on the space for vice-mayor
may, at first glance, appear to- be &quot;<span class=SpellE>Walag</span> <span
class=SpellE>Nalog</span>,&quot; or &quot;<span class=SpellE>Walag</span> <span
class=SpellE>Narog</span>;&quot; but, upon further examination, it would seem
that, the first word written was really &quot;<span class=SpellE>Nalag</span>,&quot;
except that the voter had started to write the capital &quot;N&quot; with a
short stroke downward, which he tried to rectify by starting to write anew,
with a stroke upward, so that the &quot;N&quot; now looks like a somewhat
imperfect &quot;W.&quot; Hence, he again wrote the word &quot;<span
class=SpellE>Nalog</span>.&quot; The voter's intent to vote for <span
class=SpellE>Nalog</span> was thus merely made more manifest.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The vote was properly counted for herein <span
class=SpellE>appellee</span>.</p>

<p class=BODY>The second assignment of error involves several groups of ballots:
(a) one consists of sixteen (16) ballots (Exhibits NG-2, NG-6, NG-40, NG-41,
NG-42, NG-44, NG-45, NG-48, NG-52, NG-53, NG-54, NG-55, NG-71, NG- <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>124, </span>NG-125
and NG-131) in favor of <span class=SpellE>Nalog</span>, which, appellant
maintains, should be annulled, because of fingerprints allegedly appearing,
either on the face of the ballots, or on the back thereof; and (b) a group of
twenty (20) ballots (Exhibits NG-4, NG-16, NG-17, NG-18, NG-46, NG-49, NG-59,
NG-60, NG-93, NG-101, NG-112, NG-118, NG-123, NG-126, NG-128, NG-142-A, NG-144,
NG-145, NG-164, and NG-165) allegedly marked, because the names appearing
thereon were &quot;written, in extraordinarily big printed letters for the
purpose of marking them,&quot; in the language of appellant herein.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are other ballots not falling under
either of these two (2) categories.</p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>Suffice it to say that
some of the alleged fingerprints in the first batch are mere smudges; that,
although there are fingerprints in other ballots, there is nothing to indicate
that they are fingerprints of the voters who filled them; and that the general
appearance of these ballots suggests that the alleged marks were, probably,
accidental in nature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>Then again, it is not
true that the letters used in the second batch are extraordinarily big.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Although a few were written with letters somewhat
bigger than the ordinary, there is </span>nothing <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt'>therein to indicate more than a special interest for given
candidates.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At any rate, the question
whether or not certain ballots are marked is one of fact, which is beyond our
power of review in this case, in view of the provisions of the Revised Election
Code adverted to above.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>For this reason, the objection of herein appellant to Exhibits
NG-9, NG-10, NG-11, NG-15, NG-29, NG-65, NG-76, NG-84, NG-90, NG-94, NG-103,
NG-113, NG-149, NG-160, NG-162, NG-163, NG-166 and NG-177, upon the ground that
the same are marked – on account <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>of </span>specified
<span class=SpellE>pecularities</span> thereof – cannot be entertained.</p>

<p class=BODY>It is not disputed, however, that the name &quot;NALOG&quot;
appears printed on a sticker pasted on the space for vice-mayor in <span
class=SpellE>Exh</span>. <span class=GramE>NG-99.</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a marked ballot, and, as such, null
and void, by specific provision of law.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn5'
href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
It should not be counted for <span class=SpellE>Nalog</span>.</p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Under his </span>third
assignment of error, appellant impugns Exhibits NG-31, NG-64, NG-77, NG-97,
NG-176 and NG-<span class=GramE>327,</span> upon the ground that each had been
written by two (2) distinct persons.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This is, however, a question of fact, which we cannot review in the
present proceedings.</p>

<p class=BODY>Appellant's fourth assignment of error refers to <span
class=SpellE>Exhs</span>. <span class=GramE>NG-190, NG-194, NG-196, NG-199-A,
NG-199-B, NG-223, NG-229, and NG-230 in which his name appears on a space <u>other</u>
than that for the vice-mayor.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He
maintains that these votes should be counted for him.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This pretense contravenes a positive
statutory injunction and must, therefore, be overruled.</p>

<p class=BODY>The fifth assignment of error of appellant refers to <span
class=SpellE>Exhs</span>. NN-85 and NN-92, which had been invalidated by the
lower court as marked, because of a nickname written twice on Exhibit NN-85 and
of initials allegedly appearing at the foot of &quot;<span class=SpellE>Exh</span>.
<span class=GramE>NN-92.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These,
again, are questions of fact, which we cannot review in this protest.</p>

<p class=BODY>Under his sixth and last assignment of error, appellant alleges
that <span class=SpellE>Exh</span>- NG-198 had been omitted, perhaps,
inadvertently, from the computation, made by the lower court, of the votes cast
in his favor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This claim is untenable,
for his name was written, on <span class=SpellE>Exh</span>. <span class=GramE>NG-198,
<u>not</u> on the space for vice-mayor, but on the first space for <u>councilors</u>.</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Consequently, the lower court did not err in
not counting it for appellant.</p>

<p class=BODY>In short, the following nine (9) votes should be deducted from
the votes credited by the lower court to <span class=SpellE>appellee</span> <span
class=SpellE>Nazario</span> <span class=SpellE>Nalog</span>, namely:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Exhibits NG-99, NN-171, <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>NN</span>-180, NN-185, NN-188, <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>NN</span>-191, NN-192, NN-197 and NN-206,
thereby reducing the aggregate number of votes cast in his favor from 2, 048 to
2, 039, or a plurality of <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>one </span>(1)
vote over the 2, 038 votes credited by the lower court to appellant De Guzman.</p>

<p class=BODY>Hence, without considering the assignments of error made by
herein <span class=SpellE><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>appellee</span></span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>, </span><span class=SpellE>Nazario</span> <span
class=SpellE>Nalog</span>, the decision appealed from should be, as it is
hereby affirmed, with costs against appellant, <span class=SpellE>Nemesio</span>
