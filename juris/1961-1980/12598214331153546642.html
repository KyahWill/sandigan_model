				G.R. No. L-13976, April 29, 1961</h4>
				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. BERNARDO Z. OBALDO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appellant Bernardo Z. Obaldo was found guilty of "rape with murder", attended 
by the aggravating circumstances that the crime was committed with cruelty, at 
night time, in an uninhabited place, and after taking advantage of superior 
strength, and sentenced to suffer death penalty, to indemnify the heirs of the 
offended party in the sum of P3,000.00 and to pay the costs.
<p>From the evidence adduced by the prosecution, the following facts are 
gleaned:</p>
<p>At about 6:30 a.m., on October 30, 1957, Fernando Garcia, Jr. and his 12 year 
old sister, Marcela Garcia <em>alias</em> Mercy, went to gather slab at Fort 
McKinley, Rizal. At 9:00 o'clock a.m. Fernando returned home and told his mother 
that Marcela stayed behind to gather some more slab. When Marcela did not return 
home that day, her mother went to the Provost Marshal of Fort Wm, McKinley to 
inquire about her daughter whose picture (Exh. C) was brought along with her. 
Where Marcela was until the first week of November, 1957, the record does not 
disclose. About the first week of November, 1957, however, Marcela became a 
niaid of Sgt. Silvestre Alcasar and his wife at Riverside street, same fort, at 
P5.00 monthly pay. On December 22, 1957, at about 12:00 o'clock p.m. Marcela 
played with some children at the back yard of Sgt. Alcasar. It was the last time 
Sgt. Alcasar saw her alive and she was then, wearing a dress (Exh. F) and 
panties (Exh. F—1) made by Mrs. Alcasar herself.</p>
<p>At about 7:00 a.m. on December 24,1957, while working, at the construction 
job of the Del Pan Bridge, Tondo, Jaime Padilla, a carpenter, saw an army duffel 
bag (Exhibit E), with its open end tied with a belt, floating near the bridge. 
They opened the bag and a human foot protruded and in the presence of a 
policeman, they further opened the bag and found the body of a girl clad in her 
dress and panties Exhibits F and F-1, respectively. The following words, were 
found printed in white on the duffel bag: "B. Obaldo F Co 2nd BCT Peftoc, U. S. 
TAT. No. 1140203" (Exhibit E-1).</p>
<p>On December 25, 1957, three members of the 202 MP Company were given a 
"mission order" to apprehend the accused Obaldo who left his post for Balaoan, 
La Union, at 8:00 p.m. on December 24, 1957. The accused and his wife were taken 
to Camp Murphy. Captain Felicisimo Lazaro of the M.P.D. conducted an 
investigation on December 26, 1957, at which the accused professed ignorance of 
the killing. But after Capt. Lazaro had reminded him of his gallantry in Korea, 
the accused gave his statement Exhibit I. As a subsequent checking shows that 
some of the statements given in Exhibit I were false, Capt. Lazaro conducted 
another investigation of the accused on December 27, 1957. At this 
investigation, Obaldo gave and subscribed another statement Exhibit I-1, 
confessing authorship of the crime. Portions thereof are reproduced 
hereunder:</p>

<p>Dr. Mariano de Lara, Medico-Legal Examiner M.P.D., on December 27, 1957, 
performed an autopsy on the body of Mareela Garcia and rendered a report Exhibit 
H, with the finding that the hymen of Mareela was lacerated, the effect of 
possible sexual intercourse; that basing on the state of her legs, Marcela might 
have died only a day and a half before the autopsy; and that the cause of the 
death was asphyxiation, evidently from the combination of her body being placed 
in the bag, drowning and/or strangling.</p>
<p>The defense gave the following story:</p>
<p>That on December 23, 1957, the accused was on duty with the 1st Eng. Combat 
BCT, 1st Div. Ft. W. Mckinley from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., after which he went 
to the 3rd Eng. Const. Co. area, about a kilometer away to attend a Christmas 
party; that he stayed in the mess hall where he helped in serving the table; 
that at 8:00 p.m., he and Sgt. Gado took supper together, after which they saw 
the dance and the stage show; that at 10:00 o'clock p.m. he, Sgt. Lucas and Sgt. 
Ordinario went home together; that as he wanted to spend Christmas with his wife 
in Balaoan, La Union, he (accused) prepared a pass (Exhibit J) the next day and 
presented it to Sgt. Domingo Marquez, for the latter's signature; that after 
getting Sgt. Marquez signature, he (accused) placed the pass on the table of Lt. 
Oreta; and in the belief that Lt. Oreta had approved the pass, the accused left 
Manila at 10:00 p.m. of December 24, 1957 and arrived at 5:00 a.m. of December 
25, 1957 in Balaoan; that the MPs fetched him from his house in Balaoan, and 
once in Manila, he was brought to Secretary Vargas before whom he denied killing 
the child.</p>
<p>The defense further claims that the accused was taken to the MPD H.Q. at noon 
of December 26, 1957 and there interrogated continuously, without giving him 
lunch; he signed statement Exh. I, admitting ownership of the duffel bag at 
about 3:00 p.m. of Dec. 27, 1957; that the police continued the investigation 
until night time and was told that he would not be given any food, unless he 
admitted the killing; he developed fever and was given 2 cortal tablets; the 
interrogators held his ears and neck and pushed his head up and down; he was 
threatened with electrocution, if he would not admit the crime, as in fact, 
Capt. Lazaro had already ordered one of his men to get a piece of wire.</p>
<p>Explaining the matter of the duffel bag, the defense testified that when the 
accused went to Korea with the 2nd B.C.T., he had been issued a duffel bag Exh. 
Q, and while in Korea, he was again issued another duffel bag; on both of which 
he placed markings and printed his name; that after his return, he was assigned 
to the Heavy Mortar Company; but as he was reassigned to another company on 
February 1, 1956, accused returned one of the bags to Sgt. Gavino of said 
Company (Exhibit 10); that for the duffel bag (Exh. Q, the same as Exh. 5), 
which he retained, he. executed a memorandum receipt; that when he past 
reassigned to the company, the accused was required to turn in the second duffel 
bag (Exh. Q), but as he wanted to keep it as a souvenir, he bought a duffel bag 
in Manila and gave the latter to Sgt. Abad.</p>
<p>In his brief appellant assigned 15 errors which converge on four dominant 
propositions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) The validity and efficacy of the appellant's confession;<br><br>(2) The 
sufficiency of the evidence of record to warrant a conviction;<br><br>(3) The 
classification of the offense committed and the jurisdiction of the trial court 
over the subject matter;<br><br>(4) The correctness of the 
penalty.</p></blockquote>
<p>The appellant's extra-judicial confession Exhibit I-1, dated December 27, 
1957 (supra), vividly reveals the whole story. The defense, however, insists 
that Exhibit I-1 was not given and signed voluntarily, alleging that the 
appellant was kept in hunger at the MPD for'two days, without food or water, he 
was slapped, threatened with electrocution and was promised hospitalization, if 
he would only admit authorship of the crime, by the investigating officers. Both 
Major Santiago, P.C. who did not take part in the investigation and Capt. 
Lazaro, the one who took Exhibit I-1, denied the imputation. Exhibit I-1 was 
voluntarily given by the appellant and signed by him after having conferred with 
his wife and after having read the same in the presence of Major Santiago. Major 
Santiago and Sgt. Sanchez of the army were precisely sent by the Secretary of 
National Defense Vargas, to protect the rights of the appellant and to see to it 
that they were respected by the MPD. Exhibit I-1, was sworn before Major 
Santiago. The appellant could not have been so easily duped into signing Exhibit 
I-1 if the contents thereof were not true. The very wife of the appellant even 
remarked "Bakit mo ginawa iyan?" The lack of food was not also true. His wife 
and his uncle Sgt. Salvador Obaldo, were at hand to give him victuals, if 
needed. The appellant and Capt. Lazaro ate the same meal at a nearby canteen, 
during the investigation. It is incredible, says the trial judge, "that the 
accused who well impressed the court with his military bearing, and a veteran of 
the Korean war, trained as he was, to die under all odds, to suffer all kinds of 
adversities and inconveniences, to undergo privation and hardships like hunger 
and physical exhaustion, would sign a document that would incriminate himself in 
the commission of a very serious crime which he said he did not commit, simply 
because, as he alleged, he was not given food for 1 day and was threatened with 
death by electrocution by his investigator". Appellant or his wife did not 
denounce to anyone, much less to any public authority, the presence of any 
irregularity in the taking of Exhibit I-1.</p>
<p>The confession Exhibit I-1, was substantially corroborated by facts other 
than the contents thereof. In his confession, appellant states (1) That after 
raping the girl, the latter became unconscious and not knowing what to do, he 
placed her inside his duffel bag, which he left on the bank of the river; (2) 
that the duffel bag contained identification marks, written in white; (3) that 
when he heard of the recovery of the duffel bag containing the dead body, as 
broadcasted in the radio, he prepared a pass and left hurriedly for the 
province. The act of raping is corroborated by the findings of the medico-legal 
officer that Marcela was sexually attacked. The fact that a duffel bag and its 
contents were found by carpenter Jaime Padilla, corroborated the fact as stated 
by appellant, that from the place he had left the duffel bag, the same waa 
carried by the water. The duffel bag (Exhibit E), containing the body, was 
marked in white paint, with the words: "B. Ubaldo F Co 2nd BCT Peftoc U.S. Tat. 
No. 1140203" (Exhibit E-1). The fact that he had this duffel bag, Exhibit E, was 
also admitted by him in court. Of course, appellant, tried to explain that he 
had two duffel bags issued to him when he went to Korea, which bore his name and 
other identifying marks; one of which waa Exhibit Q; that he returned to Sgt. 
Gavino <em>one</em> of the bags when he was reassigned on February 1, 1956, to 
another company; that upon his reassignment, he yas required to return in 
Exhibit Q, but as he wanted to retain it, as a souvenir, he bought a duffel bag 
in Manila and gave it to Sgt. Abad on July 19, 1957, in the presence of Sgt. 
Labastida, thereby giving us the impression that Exhibit E (the floating coffin 
of Marcela), was the one returned on February 1, 1956, iiid he could not have 
used it in the perpetration of the crime. Sgt. Abad affirmed that duffel bag 
Exh. E, was not returned to him by the appellant, but a different duffel bag. 
Sgt. Labastida declared that it was not Exh. E that was returned, but a 
different one; that about the middle part of July 1957, he accompanied the 
appellant in Manila to buy a duffel bag, as he (appellant) would return the same 
to the army, in lieu of the duffel bag (Exhibit E).</p>
<p>We search the record to find out if there was any motive at all why the 
witnesses for the prosecution who are all officers of the law enforcing 
agencies, should testify in any way they did against appellant. Our efforts were 
in vain, and none was given by the defense. The alleged .inconsistencies in the 
testimony of two prosecution witnesses, cited by the defense in its brief, are 
so insignificant to destroy their credibility.</p>
<p>The defense of <em>alibi</em> is both weak and unconvincing in the face of 
appellant's confession and of facts proven in the case. Assuming that appellant 
really had been in the Christmas party, still he could have committed the crime 
prior to or after the party. The distance between the place where the party was 
held, and the bank of the Pasig River where the crime was committed, was so 
short that it could be negotiated within a matter of minutes by walking. It is 
specially to be noted that the witnesses presented by the accused to bolster his 
defense of alibi could even remember the exact places the appellant had been 
every hour of that evening and what he had been doing during the occasion, as if 
they had been alerted to watch his movements. And considering the fact that 
those witnesses were all soldiers and under the influence of Sgt. Salvador 
Obaldo, an uncle of the appellant, their testimony could not but be biased and 
unbelievable. Furthermore, there is a strong possibility that the crime was not 
committed on December 23, 1957, but on December 22, because the victim 
disappeared from the house of Sgt. Alcasar on December 23. Even the appellant 
himself, in his confession, was not very definite that he perpetrated the crime 
on December 23. And the prosecution has not presented any evidence fixing the 
exact hour of the commision of the crime. For someone now to establish hia 
whereabouts at a certain period, when there is no showing that the crime was 
committed during said period, engenders that impression that he knows the crime 
was committed within the said period. The masa of evidence presented by 
appellant was concentrated in trying to establish this defense. The circumstance 
that the appellant wanted his relatives to fix the ease amicably with the 
parents of the deceased, evinced a guilty conscience. In an effort to cast away 
suspicion, the appellant insinuated that other persons could have had as much 
opportunity to commit the crime as himself, mentioning Sgt. Alcaras with whom 
the victim lived as a housegirl and Sgt. Gavino to whom he allegedly turned over 
the duffel bag, Exhibit E. With his confession Exhibit I-1, however, the 
insinuations did not pass beyond a mere speculation, for he had pointed to 
himself as the perpetrator of the offense.</p>
<p>Moreover, the testimony of the appellant should not be believed at all. He 
alleged that he left his post at Ft. McKinley with leave on December 24; 1957, 
as in fact, according to him, he was given a pass Exhibit J. Sgt. MarQuez, 
incharge of recommending passes, was, however, surprised why the dates in the 
pass, found in appellant's possession (Exh. J), were altered by superimposing 
handwritten dates over the typewritten dates. Lt. Oreta, officer in charge on 
December 24, 1957, was positive that he could not possibly have approved said 
pass when appellant was on line of duty from 9:00 a.m. of December 24, 1957, to 
9:00 a.m. of December 25, 1957 (Exhibit P). In fact, Lt. Oreta's signature does 
not appear in the pass Exh. J. and he reported the appellant as an AWOL for not 
having reported 'for duty. Admitting the alterations, on Exhibit J,, appellant 
explained that he prepared it on December 24, 1957. This cannot be true, because 
Exhibit J bears the date of December 26, 1957. If the altered dates were the 
true effective dates of appellant's leave, there was no reason for him to leave 
Manila hastily at 10:00 o'clock p.m. on December 24, 1957. If, in an effort to 
justify his flight, he had to tamper or falsify documents, then appellant's 
testimony, nay, his <em>alibi</em> cannot be given credence.</p>
<p>Appellant contends that the trial court erred in holding that he is guilty of 
the alleged complex crime of rape and murder and that it has jurisdiction to try 
the case of rape with murder. The prosecution was able to establish the 
commission of both offenses. There is evidence that after the carnal assault, 
the victim lost consciousness and was in this condition when she was placed 
inside the duffel bag. Appellant admitted:—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * Nalibugan ako kung kaya ang batang babae ay aking ginamit duon sa 
lupa. <em>Pagkatapos kung magamit ang bata ay nawalan ng malay tao</em> at ako 
ay natakot. Ang ginawa ko ay inilagay ko sa loob ng aking dalang 'duffel bag' at 
iniwan ko sa tabi ng ilog".</p></blockquote>
<p>So it was not a complex crime, but two separate crimes were committed for 
which the appellant could be convicted. Being separate crimes, and the complaint 
for rape not having been signed by the parents, grandparents or guardian of the 
deceased, the trial court could not have acquired jurisdiction to take 
cognizance of the rape case (Art. 344 Rev. Penal Code; U. S. <em>vs</em>. de La 
Sonta, 9 Phil., 22; People <em>vs</em>. Palubao, G. R. No. L-8077, Aug. 31, 
1954). Appellant, therefore, cannot be convicted of the crime of rape, but only 
for the crime of murder, with the aggravating circumstances of <em>en 
despoblado</em> and abuse of superior strength. The penalty for murder should be 
imposed in its maximum period which is death and the amount of indemnity should 
be increased from P3,000.00 to P6,000.00. As there is no sufficient number of 
votes to support the imposition of the death penalty, the same is reduced to 
<em>reclusión perpetua</em>. The case of rape is dismissed.</p>
<p>Modified as indicated above, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed in 
all other respects. With costs.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, 
J.B.L., Barrera,</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
