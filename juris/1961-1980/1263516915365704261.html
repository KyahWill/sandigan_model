				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF JOSE MARIA CARLOS TARRAGA

 JOSE MARIA CARLOS
TARRAGA BULL ZABALETA, PETITIONER-APPELLEE, VS.

				<BR><STRONG>CAPISTRANO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by the Republic from the decision of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental in Civil Case No.276
granting the <span class="GramE">petition</span> of Jose Maria Carlos <span class="SpellE">Tarraga</span> Bull <span class="SpellE">Za­baleta</span>, a citizen
of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Spain</st1:place></st1:country-region>, to be
admitted a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are of the opinion that the lower court erred in granting the
petition in view of the fact that the peti­tion was fatally defective in that
it failed to comply with the requirement in Section 7 of the Revised Natu­ralization
Law that the petitioner should state in his petition his "present and
former places of residence." Petitioner alleged in his petition "that
his present place of residence is <st1:place><st1:city>San Carlos City</st1:city>,
 <st1:country-region>Philippines</st1:country-region></st1:place>, having
stayed in said place since his transfer two years ago from <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
his former place of residence." In the following cases the petition was
held fatally defective because it did not state the present and all the former
places of residence of the petitioner even though in the same city:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chi vs. Republic, L-18207, June 20, 1966,
where the petition alleged that petitioner's present place of residence was at
1028-G Benavides St., Manila, but failed to state that he had formerly resided
at 1078 Padre <span class="SpellE">Algue</span> St., Manila; Wayne Chang vs.
Repub­lic, L-20713, April 29, 1966, where the petition alleged that petitioner
resided at 270 P. <span class="SpellE">Casal</span> St., San Miguel, Manila, but
failed to state that he had also resided at 1242-A <span class="SpellE">Abreu</span>
St., 1950 Arellano St., 747 Padilla St. and 242 P. <span class="SpellE">Casal</span>
St., Manila; Go vs. Republic, L-20558, March 31, 1965, where the petition
alleged that petitioner's former place of residence was at 465 <span class="SpellE">Tanduay</span> St., Manila, but failed to state that petitioner
had also resided at 250 T. <span class="SpellE">Pinpin</span> St., Manila; <span class="SpellE">Gaw</span> <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> vs. Republic, L-19419,
September 30, 1964, where the petition alleged that peti­tioner's present place
of residence was at 599 Asuncion St., Manila, but omitted mention of the fact
that petitioner had also resided at 512 Asuncion St., Manila; and Ngo vs.
Republic, L-18319, May 31, 1963, where the petition alleged that petitioner
resided at 505 Magdalena St., Manila, but failed to state that petitioner had
previously resided at 528 T. <span class="SpellE">Pinpin</span> St. and Magdalena
St., Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In these cases it was also
held, in effect, that the failure of the petition to give specific addresses of
the present and former places of residence of the petitioner even if in the
same city did not confer jurisdiction upon the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of Koa <span class="SpellE">Heng</span> vs. Republic,
L-21079, <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1966</st1:date>,
this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"* * * It is settled that failure of the pe­titioner to
specify in his petition all the differ­ent places of his residence in this
country, as re­quired by Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law, is a
serious flaw which results in the denial of his petition for
naturalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason be­hind the
requirement is to facilitate the checking on the different activities of
petitioner bearing on his petition for naturalization, especially as to his
qualifications and moral character, either by private individuals or government
agencies, by indicating to them the localities or places in which to make
appropriate inquiries or investiga­tions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>* * *."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">To the same effect did this Court hold in
Cheng vs. Repub­lic, L-20013, <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="3">March
 30, 1965</st1:date>; Ng vs. Republic, L-19646, <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1965</st1:date>; Yu Ti vs. Republic, L-19913, <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1965</st1:date>; Chan <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> <span class="SpellE">Huat</span> vs. Republic, L-19579, <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1966</st1:date>; and <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> vs. Republic, L-20152, <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="2"><span class="GramE">February</span> 28, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hereby expressly rule that the requirement in Section 7 of the
Revised Naturalization Law that the petitioner shall state in his petition his
"present and former places of resi­dence" means that in a city or
town where the streets have names and the buildings are numbered, the petition
must state the present place of residence of petitioner by giving the name of
the street and the number of the building thereon, and his former places of
residence, by giving the names of all the streets and the numbers of all the
buildings thereon where he had resided.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In case of towns or barrios where streets have names but the buildings
thereon are not numbered, the present residence of petitioner shall be stated
by giv­ing the name of the street and the location thereon of the building
where he is residing; and his former places of re­sidence shall be stated by
giving the names of all the streets and the locations thereon of all the
buildings where he had resided.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having reached the conclusion that the judgment of the lower
court should be reversed on the ground that the peti­tion was fatally defective,
we deem it unnecessary to take up other apparent grounds for reversal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the judgment appealed from is
reversed and the instant petition for naturalization is denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Without special
pronouncement as to costs.</span></p>
