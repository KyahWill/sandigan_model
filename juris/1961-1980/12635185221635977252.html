				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from the order of the Court <span style="">of </span>First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> of <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="2">February
 8, 1964</st1:date>, in civil case 6190, denying the petitioner-appellant Primo
<span class="SpellE">Zuñiga's</span> petition for a writ of possession over a
residential lot he purchased at an <span style="">extrajudicial
</span>foreclosure sale.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Zuñiga</span> was the mortgagee and buyer at <span style="">an </span>extrajudicial foreclosure sale of
a parcel of land located in <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title 94479 of
the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in the name of Enrique
<span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>, Jr.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During the period for redemption, <span class="SpellE">Zuñiga</span> filed
with the lower court a petition praying that a writ of possession over the said
property issue in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
petition, unopposed by <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>, was granted, and on <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="5"><span style="">May </span>24,
 1963</st1:date> a writ of possession <span style="">was
</span>issued in <span class="SpellE">Zuñiga's</span> favor.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Enforcement of this writ was however stayed by a preliminary
injunction issued by the <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City Branch of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in civil case 477-R,
filed by the spouses Pablo Marquez and <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Quiogue</span> (<span class="SpellE">oppositors-appellees</span>
herein) against <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zuñiga</span>,
for the annulment of a contract of sale with mortgage as well as a deed of
cancellation of mortgage over the above-mentioned property executed by the said
spouses in favor of Enrique <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>, Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The injunction was, however, subsequently
lifted, and on <st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1963</st1:date>
an <u>alias</u> writ of possession was, upon motion of <span class="SpellE">Zuñiga</span>,
issued by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, on August 27, <span style="">1963, the </span><span style="">spouses </span><span style="">Marquez </span>moved
to dissolve or suspend the writ of possession issued on May 24, 1963, alleging
that they are the owners of the property registered in the name of Enrique <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>, Jr. and that the latter succeeded in registering
in his name the said property through his and <span class="SpellE">Zuñiga's</span>
fraudulent acts and misrepresentations.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On</span> <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1963</st1:date> the spouses Marquez
executed a letter authorizing <span class="SpellE">Zuñiga</span> to take
possession of the property <span style="">in </span>question,
and the latter accordingly assumed possession thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 19, 1963, however, the spouses
Marquez filed with the court below a "Motion to Admit Memorandum" in
which they (1) alleged that they left the property only to avoid harassment
against members of their family, and (2) argued that third persons in honest
adverse possession of a piece of property may not be dispossessed by a writ of
possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court below at first denied
the motion, but subsequently reconsidered and granted it on February 8, 1964,
over the vigorous objection of <span class="SpellE">Zuñiga</span> who, invoking
the provisions of sections 6 and 7 of Act 3135, as amended by Act 4118,
contended that the writ of possession having already been executed, the lower
court no longer had jurisdiction to can­cel the writ (or, for that matter,
issue another writ of possession) because the one-year period of redemption had
expired on January 31, 1964.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1964</st1:date>
<span class="SpellE">Zuñiga</span> lodged the present appeal, failing twice to
secure reconsideration of the order of <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="2">February
 8, 1964</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <span style="">January </span>26,
1966, after this appeal was<span style=""> </span>submitted
for decision, a completely radical development ensued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Assisted </span>by counsel, Pablo Marquez, for
himself and as guardian of his two minor children (his wife <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span>
Marquez had died in the mean<span style="">time),
filed a motion with this Court praying (a) that the order <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
of February 8, 1964 and all orders related thereto be set aside, and (b) that
judgment be rendered declaring <span class="SpellE">Zuñiga</span> the absolute
and exclusive owner of the property in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion bears the conformity of <span class="SpellE">Zuñiga</span> and the latter's counsel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1966</st1:date>
<span style="">this Court issued </span>a resolution
granting the first prayer, but deferring <span style="">action on </span>the second until consideration on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">resolution
has </span>rendered moot and academic and purposeless a further discussion of
the merits of the orders issued<span style=""> </span>by
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the prayer that <span class="SpellE">Zuñiga</span>
be declared the owner of the property involved in this litigation cannot be
granted in this appeal, since it asks for <span style="">a
</span>judgment upon an issue not only not litigated below but as well
completely irrelevant to the orders of the lower court subject of this appeal.</p>

It was alleged that on December 19, 1961, the spouses entered into a
"Contract of Sale with Mortgage" with E. <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>,
Jr. for P40,000, 50% of which was to be paid upon the execution of the contract
and the balance within the year; that the checks tendered by <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> for the down payment were all dishonored; that <span class="SpellE">Zuñiga</span>, who <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> told them was
a bank investigator, assured the spouses that a loan being applied for by <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> at his bank would be a proved if the mortgage
annotation on the certificate of title was cancelled, for which reason they
executed a "Deed of Cancellation of Mortgage;" and that they learned
later that <span class="SpellE">Zuñiga</span> was not a bank investigator and
that <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> had never filed loan application.</p>

The first motion for reconsideration dated February 18, 1964 was denied on
March 18, 1964; the second motion for reconsideration dated April 16, 1964 was
denied on June 11, 1964.</p>
