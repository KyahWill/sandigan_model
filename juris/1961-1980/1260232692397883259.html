				<BR><STRONG>DE LEON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On November 8, 1957, when Criminal Case No. 2193 of the Court of First 
Instance of Pampanga was called for trial, Atty. Eusebio V. Navarro, counsel of 
record for one of the accused, failed to appear and forthwith the court issued 
an order, which is quoted <em>verbatim</em> as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"By virtue of the order dated October 8, 1957, the assignment of this case 
was set for today, November 8, 1957. Present were Fiscal Pedro S. David and 
counsel, Mr. Ahmed Garcia, for the accused Arsenio Ma√±gila.</p>
<p>"Attached to the record is an urgent motion for postponement filed by Mr. 
Eusebio Navarro, counsel, for the other accused Liberato Gagui, alleging that he 
cannot attend to this case, as he is engaged in a civil case in the Court of 
First Instance of Camarines Sur.</p>
<p>"The record clearly shows that when the trial was set for November 8, 1957, 
it was done in open court and after consultation with Mr. Navarro. As a matter 
of fact, the court ordered the detail of a Tagalog interpreter. The said 
interpreter is also present.</p>
<p>"The reasons given by Mr. Navarro are not satisfactory. Mr. Navarro is fully 
aware of the fact that this case has been pending for a considerable length of 
time. He should have, therefore, given priority to this case.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the Court hereby imposes a fine of P100.00 upon Mr. 
Navarro for delaying this criminal case. The court announces in advance that it 
will not reconsider this order.</p>
<p>"Reset the trial on January 7, 1958, at 9:00 o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p>"Let a copy of this order be served upon the Department of Justice for the 
detail again of the Tagalog interpreter on the said date."</p></blockquote>
<p>In another order issued on November 16, 1957, the above quoted order was 
amended by providing in the dispositive part thereof that "in the event that Mr. 
Navarro fails to pay the fine of P100.00 he shall suffer a subsidiary 
imprisonment not to exceed five (5) days." Subsequently, on December 2, 1957, 
the lower court issued still another order warning Atty. Navarro "that if he 
fails to pay the said fine on or before December 14, 1957, the Court will order 
his arrest and confinement."</p>
<p>From the three orders above referred to, Atty. Eusebio V. Navarro has 
interposed the present appeal.</p>
<p>It would appear that for the absence from court of appellant Atty. Navarro 
when Criminal Case No. 2193, in which he was counsel of record for one of the 
accused, was called for trial, the lower court summarily adjudged him guilty of 
direct contempt and sentenced him to pay a fine under penalty of imprisonment if 
he fails to do so within a given period.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the contempt supposed to have been committed by appellant is 
not a direct contempt so as to be summarily punishable under section 1 of Rule 
64, for it is not a misbehavior in the presence of or so near a court or judge 
as to interrupt the administration of justice. If any contempt occurred by the 
failure of said appellant to appear for trial under the circumstances mentioned 
in the order of November 8, 1957 complained of, it would be an indirect 
contempt, punishable only after written charge and hearing, under section 3 of 
the same Rule 64, paragraph (b) of which mentions "disobedience of or resistance 
to a lawful writ, process, order, judgment, or command of a court, or injunction 
granted by a court or judge." As held in the case of Rivera <em>vs</em>. 
Arellano (83 Phil., 744).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * failure or refusal of an accused or of his attorney to appear for 
trial comes closer to the definition of indirect contempt in paragraph (b) of 
section 3 (Rule 64) than to a misbehavior in the presence of or near the court 
contemplated in section 1.</p>
<p>"'In State <em>vs</em>. Winthrop, 148 Wash., 526, p. 793; 59 A.L.R., 1265, it 
was held that the unexcused absence of an attorney from the court when a case in 
which he was attorney of record for one of the parties was called for trial is 
not a contempt occurring in the presence or view of the court, so as to be 
summarily punishable, but contempt therein, if any occurred, away from, and out 
of, the presence of the court and he is not subject to discipline and punishment 
other than by a charge being first made against him substantially as required by 
statute. (Footnote, 12 Am. Jur. Sec. 11, p. 396.)</p>
<p>"In Finnick <em>vs</em>. Peterson, 6 Phil., 172, this Court said: 'A witness 
who fails or refuses to comply with a subpoena duces tecum is guilty of 
contempt. Such contempt is not committed in the presence of the court, even 
though, upon appearance of the witness, the court should make a verbal order 
commanding him to comply with the terms of the subpoena. Such a witness can not 
be punished summarily. He is entitled to the hearing provided for under sections 
232-240 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions." (See also Francisco 
<em>vs</em>. Enriquez, 94 Phil., 603.)</p></blockquote>
<p>It clearly appearing that no charge in writing for contempt has been filed 
against herein appellant, nor an opportunity given to him to be heard by himself 
or counsel, we find and so hold that the lower court acted in excess if not in 
grave abuse, of its jurisdiction in proceeding against and declaring said 
appellant guilty of contempt.</p>
<p>Sec. 3, Rule 64; Nava <em>vs</em>. Teodoro, et al., G. R. No. L-10074, April 
30, 1959.)</p>
<p>Having arrived at the above conclusion, we deem it unnecessary to pass upon 
the other questions raised by appellant.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the orders complained of are hereby set aside. So ordered without 
costs.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Barrera, Paredes, Dizon,</em> and <em>Natividad, JJ.,</em> concur.</div>
