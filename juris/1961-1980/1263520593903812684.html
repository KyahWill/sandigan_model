				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner in this <i>mandamus</i> and quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span>
suit seeks judicial relief from what he considers to be an illegal ouster from
his position as Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Obando</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, he was not sufficiently alert in the defense of his
rights before courts of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
notified of the cessation of his services as such as far back as <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He waited until <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1967</st1:date> before filing his petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He pro­crastinated too long.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such delay is fatal, the applicable Rules of
Court provision giving him only one year from his separation for the invocation
of the appropriate judicial remedy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Necessarily the lower court had no choice left but to dismiss his
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this appeal, which has
an air of futility that hangs around it, the state of law being what it
is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appealed decision, after setting forth the nature of the
action as one for quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> and <i>mandamus</i>
filed by petitioner with <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> C. Marquez, Mayor of
<span class="SpellE">Obando</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>; Leonardo
D. Serrano, Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Obando</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>; Ricardo Suarez, Municipal Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Obando</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>; and <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>, Commissioner of
Civil Service, as respondents, immediately referred to the decisive fact of the
late filing of this petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"One of the defenses alleged by the respondents,
Marquez, Serrano and Suarez, is that the present action was filed by the
petitioner three years after respondent Serrano had been appointed and assumed
the office of Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Obando</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, and, therefore, it has already prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This defense is well taken for it is expressly
alleged in paragraph 5 of the petition that on January 3, 1964, respondent <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> C. Marquez, Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Obando</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, terminated petitioner's service as Chief of
Police of said municipality by reason of his alleged lack of Civil Service
Eligibility and the present action was filed only on April 14, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Section 16, Rule 66 of the Rules
of Court, petitions for quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> must be filed
within one (1) year after the cause of the ouster or the right of petitioner to
hold office arose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the
consistent decisions of the Supreme Court, this one (1) year period begins to
run when the petitioner might lawfully have assumed office, and not from the
date the incumbent began to discharge the duties of the office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason for this limitation is that title
to public office cannot be left to continued uncertainty."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The lower court likewise found that on the merits petitioner could not make out
a persuasive plea for his reinstatement, lacking as he did the necessary civil
service eligibility when he was appointed, thus impressing the temporary
character to his tenure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an issue
need not be inquired into as the failure to institute the action within the
one-year period constitutes, as pointed out in the decision, more than a
sufficient basis for its dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The controlling Rules of Court provision constitutes an
insuperable obstacle to plaintiff's persistent efforts to regain the office of
Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Obando</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It explicitly provides that the action
arising from an ouster from office should "be commenced within one (1)
year after the cause of such ouster, or the right of the plaintiff to hold such
office or position, arose; * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Such a provision was formerly incorporated in the very same section but of Rule
68 of the 1940 Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Abeto</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Rodas</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
supplies an authoritative interpretation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"We note that this
action was commenced only on <st1:date year="1948" day="2" month="3">March 2,
 1948</st1:date>, or more than one year from <st1:date year="1946" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1946</st1:date>, when, according to his own theory, the
petitioner should have been reinstated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Actions for quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> are now governed by
Rule of Court No. 68, section 16 of which provides that 'Nothing contained in
this rule shall be construed to authorize an action * * * an officer for his
ouster from office unless the same be commenced within one year after the cause
of such ouster, or the right of the plaintiff to hold office, arose; * * *.' A
similar provision in the Code of Civil Procedure was given effect in Bautista
vs. <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>, 38 Phil., 624, wherein this Court
held:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'It cannot be supposed that the
Legislature intended that the right to a public office, when dependent upon
prescription, should be subject to continued uncertainty; and the public
interest clearly requires that such right should be determined as speedily as
practicable.' We would go farther by holding that the period fixed in the rule
is a condition precedent to the existence of the cause of action, with the
result that, if a complaint is not filed within one year, it cannot prosper
although the matter is not set up in the answer or motion to dismiss."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
As is made clear from the above excerpt, the doctrine goes back to Bautista v. <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> a
1918 decision, which interpreted the then applicable section of the Code of Civil
Procedure.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus apparent that plaintiff, by his failure to abide by
the controlling Rules of Court provision, did preclude the judiciary from
inquiring into the merits of his case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whatever sympathy might be enlisted by his firm and inflexible
determination to correct what in his opinion is a failure by respondents to
follow the governing legal norms cannot prevail as against a definite rule that
cautions a person who deems himself aggrieved by an illegal ouster to go to
court within the one-year period specified upon pain of losing what could have
been an appropriate judicial remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
lower court decision must be affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the lower court of February 8,
1968 is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

Section 16, Rule 66 of the Rules of Court reads as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Nothing contained in this rule shall be
construed to authorize an action against a corporation for forfeiture of
charter unless the same be commenced within five (5) years after the act complained

such office or position, arose; nor to authorize an action for damages in
