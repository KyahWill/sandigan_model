Instance of Manila denying its petition for cancellation of the certificate of
naturalization of <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Piek</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuy</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main facts are not disputed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1961</st1:date>,
the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered a decision granting <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> petition for naturalization as citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No appeal having, seemingly, been taken <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, on <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="4">April
 25, 1963</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed a motion to be
allowed to take his oath of allegiance, which, after due hearing, was granted
on <st1:date year="1963" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> took said
oath on <st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1963</st1:date>, on
which date the corresponding certificate of naturalization was issued to
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over two (2) years later, or on
March 16, 1966, the Solicitor General filed his aforementioned mo­tion for the
cancellation of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> certificate of
naturalization, upon the ground:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was not qualified to become a citi­zen
of the Philippines, because he had not enrolled his children of school age in
local public or private schools recognized by the Gov­ernment where Philippine history,
civics and government are taught or prescribed as part of the curriculum,
during the entire period of residence required of him in this country, prior to
the hearing of the petition for naturalization; (2) that he was not and is not
qualified to take the oath of allegiance as a Filipino, he having violated a
Gov­ernment announced policy at the time of the taking of said oath and the
issuance of the certificate of naturalization in his favor; and (3) that said
petition for naturalization was fatally defective, in that <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
certificate of arrival had not been attached thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon denial of this motion, the Government
brought the case to us by re­cord on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was born in Amoy, China, on October 13, 1926; that
he came to the Philippines on January 21, 1947; that in 1949, he went to Amoy,
China, to marry Chua <span class="SpellE">Pic</span> Luan, his present wife, and
stayed there for three (3) months; that in 1957, 1958 and 1960, he visited his
wife in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>, where she resided with their
children, namely, <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Hoc <span class="SpellE">Siong</span>,
born in Amoy, China, on April 16, 1950, and <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Siong</span>, born in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>, on October 10, 1958; that his aforementioned wife
and children were still residing in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> at the
time of the filing of his petition for naturalization, on June 26, 1960; and
that they were never in the Philippines until October 16, 1960, when they came
and were admitted as temporary visitors.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since October 10, 1957, <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Koc</span> <span class="SpellE">Siong</span>, <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
eldest son, had been of school age, and yet he (<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>)
allowed him to remain in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> and did not cause
him to be enrolled in any school re­cognized by our Government in which
Philippine history, civics and government are taught or prescribed as part of
the curriculum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, upon the
arrival of his family in the Philippines, on October 16, 1960, he caused <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Hoc <span class="SpellE">Siong</span> to be enrolled, for
the school-year 1960-1961, in the <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span>
Anglo-Chinese School, the bulk of the students of which consists of Chinese
citizens, thus evincing that he did not sincerely desire his children to
embrace the customs, traditions and ideals of the Filipinos.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
In other words, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had utterly failed to meet
the sixth requirement of Section 2 of Common­wealth Act No. 473, and falls
squarely within the purview of Section 4 (f) of the same Act, thereby lacking
one of the requisite qualifications to become a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and being disqualified <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
As a consequence, his certificate of naturalization was "obtained x <span class="SpellE">x</span> illegally," and should be cancelled.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
As forcefully stated in <st1:country-region><st1:place>U. S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. Ginsberg<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>:</p>

<blockquote>"No alien has the slightest right to naturali­zation unless
all statutory requirements are comply with; and every certificate of
citizenship must be treated as granted upon condition that the govern­ment may
challenge it, as provided in Section 15, and demand its <span class="SpellE">cancelation</span>
unless issued in accor­dance with such requirements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If procured when prescribed qualifications
have no existence in fact, it is illegally procured; a manifest mistake by the
judge cannot supply these nor render their exis­tence non-essential."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it appears that <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
wife (Chua <span class="SpellE">Pic</span> Luan) and two (2) children (<span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Koc</span> <span class="SpellE">Siong</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Siong</span>) came to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and were admitted thereto, as "temporary visitors", yet he did not
cause them to depart from the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
upon the expiration of the extended period of their authorized stay, on <st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse still, although his petition for
another extension of said period, up to 1963, had been denied by the Commissioner
of Immigration, on <st1:date year="1962" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1962</st1:date>,
he maneuvered and managed to keep them much longer, without the approval and
over the objection of said officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
steps taken by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> are set forth in our de­cision
in Vivo v. <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>, et al.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a>, from

<span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Siong</span>, arrived from <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> and were admitted in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Phi­lippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as temporary visitors on <st1:date year="1960" day="16" month="10">16 October
 1960</st1:date>, with an initial authorized stay of three (3) months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hus­band and father of these aliens, <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Piek</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuy</span>,
had ap­plied for naturalization, and the Court of First Instance of Manila (in
its Civil Case No. 43163) granted his peti­tion <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
only on <st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="4">11 April 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, said temporary visitors petitioned
for an indefinite extension of their stay.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Acting thereon, and purportedly in ac­cordance with a Cabinet Resolution
on 29 February 1956 granting them concurrent jurisdiction to act on petitions
for extension of stay of temporary visitors, the Secre­tary of Foreign Affairs,
<span class="SpellE">Felixberto</span> Serrano, on 16 May 1961, authorized the
change in category from temporary visitors to that of special non-immigrants
under Section 47(a) (2) of the Immigration Law for a period of stay ex­tending <u>up
to 11 April 1963</u>; and the Secretary of Justice, <span class="SpellE">Alejo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mabanag</span>, on 8 June 1961, approved the extension thus
authorized, <u>subject to the condition that Chua <span class="SpellE">Pic</span>

that they shall maintain their cash bonds filed with the Bureau of Immigration
and to pay the corresponding fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
the herein petitioner, <u>Commissioner of Immigration, refused to recognize the
said extension further than 16 June 1962</u>, and denied acceptance of payment
of the ex- tension fees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thereupon, the respondents, on <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="6">4 June 1962</st1:date>, requested the Office of the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to extend their stay up to <st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="4">11 April
 1963</st1:date> in order to coin­cide with their hoped - for the forthcoming
oath-taking of allegiance of <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Piek</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tuy</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
request was referred to the Immigration Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter, on 11 June 1962, informed the
respondents, through counsel, that the new Secretary of Justice, Jose <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>, had ruled in January, 1962 that the Cabinet
Resolution of 19 February 1956 had <u>no force and effect</u>, and forthwith <u>denied</u>
the request for extension of stay of the respon­dents and <u>advised them to
leave the country</u> voluntarily not later than 16 June 1962; otherwise, they
would be proceeded against, in accordance with law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The respondents did <u>not</u> leave the country on the date
specified, but <u>instead filed a petition for mandamus</u> with injunction,
docketed as Civil Case No. 50671 in the Court of First Instance of Manila, to restrain
the Com­missioner of Immigration from issuing a warrant for their arrest and
from confiscating their bond for their temporary stay and to order the
Commissioner to imple­ment the extension previously authorized and approved by
Secretaries Serrano and <span class="SpellE">Mabanag</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"His Honor, Judge Federico <span class="SpellE">Alikpala</span>,
to whose sale the case was assigned, <u>denied</u> the prayer for preli­minary
injunction for lack of a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> showing and set the case for
hearing on <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="7">13 July 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the said date, which was <u>pre-selected with
the conformity of pe­titioner's counsel</u>, said counsel did not appear but
ano­ther lawyer appeared to <u>ask for postponement</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Alikpala</span> <u>denied</u>
the postponement and <u>dismissed the case</u> without prejudice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="7">19 July 1962</st1:date>,
the herein respondents <u>re-filed</u> the same petition with the same court,
which was docketed as Civil Case No. 50993.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petition alleged three grounds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the extension of the stay of
the petitioners (herein respondents) up to 11 April 1963 was authorized and
approved by the Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and of Justice; (2) <u>they were
due for eventual con­version into Filipino citizens</u> by virtue of the
granting of <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Piek</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Tuy's</span> petition for naturalization,
which had not been appealed, and he was due to take his oath of alle­giance on
11 April 1962; and (3) their departure from the Philippines would work great
injury and injustice to them­selves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
before, the petition prayed for a preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time, the case was assigned to the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of herein co-respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>.</blockquote>

respondent judge, <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> and without
hearing, issued an order granting prelimi­nary injunction, and, on a bond of
P3, 000. <span class="GramE">00,</span> issued the writ on <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="7">24 July 1962</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On 3 August 1962, the Immigration Commis­sioner filed his
answer (as respondent therein) stating, in defense, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that the visitors' <u>authorized stay</u>
expired on 16 June 1962; that their change in category from temporary visitors
to special non-immigrants and the extension of their stay up to 11 April 1963
by the Sec­retaries of Foreign Affairs and of Justice were <u>invalid</u>, as
subsequently ruled by their successors in office, and that it is the
Commissioner of Immigration who is vested by law with power to grant extensions
of stay; that the petition filed was not the proper remedy; that the Soli­citor-General
will oppose the oath-taking of <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Piek</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tuy</span>; and that, <u>even if <span class="SpellE">Tuy</span>

herself, can be lawfully<span style="">&nbsp; </span>naturalized</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Three (3) years passed without the case having been heard.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">"Then, on 14 September 1965, the Commissioner filed a <u>motion
to dismiss</u> the case for the <u>unreasonable length of time that the
petitioners had failed to prosecute their case</u>, and that even <u>the final
relief that they sought, which was to implement the extension up to 11 April
1963, had already expired</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, on
opposition of herein respon­dents, the court, on <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="10">26 October 1965</st1:date>, <u>denied</u> the motion to dismiss for
being 'not well taken'.</p>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1965" day="9" month="12">9 December 1965</st1:date>,
the Immigration Commis­sioner filed with the Supreme Court the present original
action of certiorari and prohibition with preliminary in­junction, contesting
the respondent court's order of <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="7">21
 July 1962</st1:date> granting preliminary injunction <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>, the writ of preliminary injunction of 24
July1962, and the order of <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="10">26 October
 1965</st1:date> denying the motion to dismiss.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This Court required the respondents to answer, and on <st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="12">16 December 1966</st1:date>, on motion of the
petitioning Commissioner, it restrained the private respondents from
representing themselves to be Filipinos and from exercising any of the rights
and privileges of Filipino citizens, until further orders from the Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The conclusions derivable from the foregoing chain of
uncontested facts are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that herein
private respondents secured admission to the Philippines <span style="">as </span><u>temporary visitors</u> by <u>falsely
pretending to come for a visit</u> but, <u>actually, with the intent to stay
permanently</u>; that, knowing that their authorized stay would expire on 16
June 1962, private respondents filed their petition in court for injunction,
then delayed its adjudication, <u>the better to prolong their stay</u> in the
country <u>even be­yond the date that they had originally sought and asked for</u>,
which was 11 April 1963, upon the respondent court's compounded abuse of
discretion, inaction and excess of jurisdiction." <a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Our appraisal of the legality, propriety and connotations of the
acts thus performed, to extend the stay of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
wife and children, was lucidly articulated by Mr. Justice J. B. L. Reyes, in
this vein:</p>

<blockquote>"Which was, in law, the expiry date of the re­spondents'
stay:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="6">the 16th of June 1962</st1:date>, as fixed by the Immigration

as autho­rized and approved by the Serrano-<span class="SpellE">Mabanag</span> <span class="SpellE">indorse­ments</span>? <span class="GramE">This question, as well as
the question of whether temporary visitors may change their status to special
non-immigrants without first departing from the country, were</span>
specifically answered by this Court in Lim <span class="SpellE">Chiok</span>, et
al., vs. Vivo, L-20513, <st1:date year="1963" day="26" month="12">26 December
 1963</st1:date>, in the fol­lowing manner:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">' ...</span>The so-called Cabinet Resolution of <st1:date year="1956" day="29" month="2">February 29, 1956</st1:date> did not
specifically authorize the Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and of Justice to
extend the stay of tempo­rary visitors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It
could not legally do so</u> be­cause under the <u>express</u> provisions of the
Im­migration Law, <u>it is the Commissioner of Im­migration who is vested with
the power and authority to grant such extensions</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, the Cabinet has <u>no power to amend or

<span class="SpellE">Tiao</span> Bing vs. Com­missioner of Immigration (28
September 1956), 99 Phil. 1021, we ruled:</blockquote>

as stated in our previous decision, en­courage aliens to enter the Islands on
false pretenses; every alien, so permit­ted to enter for a limited time, might
then claim a right to permanent admis­sion, however flimsy such claim should
be, and thereby compel our government to spend time, money and effort to exam­ining
and verifying whether or not every such alien really has a right to take up
permanent residence here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>In the mean­while,
the alien would be able to prolong his stay and evade his return to the port
whence he came, contrary to what he pro­mised to do when he entered</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dam­ages inherent in such ruling are
self-evident.'</p>

<blockquote>"That the Cabinet Secretaries acted as

made directly to him, did <u>not</u> affirm the acts of the Secre­taries but <u>referred</u>
the matter to the Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The
respondents knew that said Secretaries did not act as</u> <u>alter</u> <u>egos

insisted upon private respondents departing from the </u><st1:place><u>Is­lands</u></st1:place><u>,
they did not dare ask the President for relief.<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The other reason given by the respondents to support their petition
filed with the court below is their expectation to follow the citizenship of <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Piek</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuy</span>

respondent <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Siong</span> cannot, under Arti­cle 363 of the Civil Code, be

resi­dence of the family (Article 110), to the company of his wife (Article
109) and those of his minor children (Arti­cle 316), and said wife and children
are obliged to obey and live with him (Articles 109, 311, 357); and that to
make said wife and children depart from the Philippines is destructive of
family solidarity (Articles 218-221).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These arguments are beside the point.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said laws govern the relations between husband and wife <u>inter</u> <u>se</u>
or bet­ween private persons, <a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">11</span></span></a> <u>not
the relations between visit­ing aliens and the sovereign host-country</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents seem to have forgotten that they

provisions of the Civil Code of the Philippines, for that Code cleaves to the
principle that family rights and duties are governed by their personal law, <span class="SpellE">i</span>. e., the laws of the nation to which they belong even
when staying in a foreign country (of. Civil Code, Article 15).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The date insisted upon by the Commissioner as the terminal
date of stay of the respondents (<st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="6">16

of preliminary injunction (<st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="7">24 July
 1962</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact should have
cautioned him to issue notice to the Immigration Commissioner and hold a
hearing before issuing the writ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
respondent judge never did hold a hearing, either on the preliminary injunction
or on the merits, so that it is mild to say that his <u>ex­</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> preliminary injunction was improvidently is­sued.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The date insisted on by the respondents as their terminal
date of stay (<st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="4">11 April 1963</st1:date>)
had, like­wise, long expired when the Commissioner filed his motion to dismiss
(<st1:date year="1965" day="14" month="9">14 September 1965</st1:date>) in the
court below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plainly, the case had by
then become moot and academic, <a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">13</span></span></a> and the
court was left with no fur­ther controversy to adjudicate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the respon­dent, Judge <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>, whimsically and arbitrarily denied the motion, in
open disregard of the public interest and of the national policy expressed in
the Immigration Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thus, the respondent judge, by refusing to dismiss the case,
allowed these alien visitors to re­main in the country for as long as the case
remained pending in his docket; in effect, he abusively arro­gated unto himself
the power to grant extensions of stay to temporary visitors, a faculty that,
under the law, belongs to the Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, respon­dent judge, instead of applying and interpreting the law,
has effectively disregarded the same and vio­lated its policy." <a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The introduction in evidence of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>

is "mandatory" and non-compliance therewith is "fatal",

arrival," as required by law "is an <u><span style="">essential prerequisite</span></u><span style="">

require­ment is to provide a "natural starting point" for the
