the enforcement of a final judgment, <span class="SpellE">executory</span> in
character, by raising an objection that at best hardly rises to the level of a
technicality is not likely to elicit the sympathy of this Court or of any court
for that matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, in effect, that is
what the move taken by defendants in this case amounted to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court as was but proper did not
lend its approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still undeterred,
they would appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They ought to have
known better.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no reason to
refuse <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> to the order of the lower court comÂ­plained
of, appointing appellants as legal representatives of the deceased defendant
and substituted in his place pursuant to the Rules of Court in order that the
execution that ought to have taken place long since could at long last be
effected.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute as to the antecedents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 14, 1965, the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, Branch II through its clerk
issued a writ of execution reciting that as far back as March 31, 1958, it
rendered a decision in favor of plaintiffs,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
now <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, requiring one of the defendants
therein, Segundo <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span>, to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span>
one-fourth (1/4) pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span> of the property in
litigation to <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, and to pay the latter the
amount of P300.00 yearly beginning with the year 1955.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was an appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision was affirmed by the Court of
Appeals on <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was further set forth therein that on <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1965</st1:date>, a motion for its
execution was granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence the writ of
execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 13 of the same
year, one <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span>
filed an urgent ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> manifestation and motion to
quash such writ of execution based primarily on the allegation that defendant
Segundo <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span> died on <st1:date year="1959" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1959</st1:date> during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of such appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was an opposition
to such motion on February 25, 1965, inviting attention to Sec. 16, Rule 3 of
the Rules of Court to the effect that in the event of the death of a party to a
pending case, it is the duty of his attorney to give the name and residence of
his executor, administrator, guardian, or their legal representative and
alleging that there was a failure on the part of counsel to comply with the
above provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prayer was for the
denial of the motion of <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span>
and for an order requiring counsel for the defendants to furnish the court the
names as well as the residences of the heirs or legal representatives of the
deceased in order that they could be substituted in his stead so as not to
render nugatory a decision, final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> in
character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1965</st1:date>, the lower court, then presided by
the Hon. Ricardo C. <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>, gave counsel of record up
to <st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1965</st1:date> within
which to submit the name and residence of the executor, administrator, guardian
or other legal representative of the deceased Segundo <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aforesaid counsel in turn merely
manifested on March 23, 1965 that he had ceased to be such as of May 31, 1956,
and that such a pleading be considered sufficient compliance with the aforesaid
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the turn of events,
plaintiffs, in order that such a decision in their favor be not rendered
nugatory by the above technicality, had no choice but to ask the court in a
motion of April 7, 1965 to have the heirs of the deceased Segundo <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span>, defendants <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span>, <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> and Domingo,
all bearing the surname of <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span> being the
legitimate children, and one <span class="SpellE">Felicitas</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagawisan</span>, a granddaughter, substituted as defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 5, 1965, the lower court, this
time presided by Judge Andres Sta. Maria, granted the aforesaid motion and
substituted defendants in place of the deceased Segundo <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this appeal to the Court of Appeals, which in turn by
resolution of <st1:date year="1969" day="17" month="2">February 17, 1969</st1:date>
certified the matter to this Court, the question involved being one of
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted at the outset, we find for
<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be the height
of unreason to impute error to the lower court precisely for embodying in the
order complained of what is set forth in the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Whenever a party to a pending case dies, becomes incapacitated or
incompetent, it shall be the duty of his attorney to inform the court promptly
of such death, incapacity or <span class="SpellE">incompetency</span>, and to
give the name and residence of his executor, administrator, guardian or other
legal representative."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Had the defendant, thereafter deceased, seen to it that a new counsel was
appointed, then upon his death there could be compliance with the above
provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To cause plaintiffs to suffer
for such neglect of duty is to cast an undeserved reflection on the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is equally vital to remember that the
judgment had become final and the stage of execution reached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants cannot be heard to allege that it
is much too late now to apply the above rule.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That would be to set at naught the principle consistently adhered to by
this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was succinctly put in <span class="SpellE">Amor</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Jugo</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
in these words:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"And with more
compelling reason the respondent court cannot refuse to issue such writ, or
quash it or order its stay, when the judgment had been reviewed and affirmed by
an appellate court, for it cannot review or interfere with any matter decided
on appeal, or give other or further relief, or assume supervisory jurisdiction
to interpret or reverse the judgment of the higher court."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
What was said by us in Li Kim <span class="SpellE">Tho</span> v. Sanchez<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
is worth recalling:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Litigation
must end and terminate sometime and somewhere, and it is essential to an
effective and efficient administration of justice that, once a judgment has
become final, the winning party be not, through a mere subterfuge, deprived of
the fruits of the verdict.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Courts must
therefore guard against any scheme calculated to bring about that result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Constituted as they are to put an end to
controversies, courts should frown upon any attempt to prolong them."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
An excerpt from <span class="SpellE">Villaflor</span> v. Reyes<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
is equally relevant:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"There should
be a greater awareness on the part of litigants that the time of the judiciary,
much more so of this Court, is too valuable to be wasted or frittered away by
efforts, far from commendable, to evade the operation of a decision final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, especially so, where, as shown in this case, the
clear and manifest absence of any right calling for vindication, is quite
obvious and indisputable."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">2. This appeal, moreover, should fail, predicated as it is on an
insubstantial objection bereft of any persuasive force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants had to display ingenuity to
conjure a technicality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From Alonso v. <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> a
1910 decision, we have left no doubt as to our disapproval of such a
practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aim of a lawsuit is to
render justice to the parties according to law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Procedural rules are precisely designed to accomplish such a worthy objective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily, therefore, any attempt to
pervert the ends for which they are intended deserves condemnation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have done so before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do so again.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1965</st1:date> is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This decision is immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Treble
