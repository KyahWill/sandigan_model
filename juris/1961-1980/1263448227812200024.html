* * *.<br><br>"The graduated fixed tax provided in this ordinance shall be paid at the Office of the Mu­nicipal Treasurer quarterly, on or before the twentieth of January, April, July and Octo­ber; * * *. Provided further, That as regards businesses already operating at the time this ordinance takes effect, the tax for the initial quarter shall be paid pursuant to the provisions of this ordinance and shall be based on the gross value in money during the quarter immediately pre­ceding, * * *.<br><br>"Within the time fixed for the payment of the license taxes herein imposed, the taxpayers shall prepare and file with the Municipal Treasurer, a sworn statement of the gross value in money during the preceding quarter on the basis of which the tax shall be assessed and collected. * * *".</blockquote>The basic Ordinance was No. 88,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> which took effect on September 25, 1962, but this was amended by Ordinance No. 23 (Janua­ry 1, 1967), and by Ordinance No. 25 (January 1, 1968).<br><br>Petitioner, a domestic corporation engaged in the business of manufacturing beer and other products with a subsidiary manufacturing plant in Mandaue, Cebu, since December, 1967, paid the taxes prescribed in the aforesaid ordinance, under protest thus: P309.40 on January 22, 1968 and P5,171.80 as of July 18, 1968, computed respectively "on the basis of 70,412 and 2,203.070 cases of beer manufactured and removed from said Mandaue plant, multi­plied by P7.60 which is the prevailing market price (wholesaler's price) per case of beer at the time of the removal".<br><br>Claiming that it is adversely affected by the ordinance, which in its view was beyond the power and authority of the municipality to enact, petitioner brought an action in the Court of First Instance of Cebu, Branch VI, for the annulment of said ordinance.<br><br>Petitioner contends that (1) the phrase "gross value in mo­ney or actual market value" employed in the questioned ordinance clearly referred to "sales or market price" of the articles or commodities manufactured thereby indicating a manifest intent to impose a tax based on sales, and (2) that to impose a tax upon the privilege of manufacturing beer, when the amount of the tax is measured by the gross receipts from its sales of beer, is the same as imposing a tax upon the product itself.<br><br>Respondents upon the other hand insist that the tax im­posed in the questioned ordinance (1) is not a percentage tax or a tax on the sales of beer but is a tax on the privilege to engage in the business of manufacturing beer, and the phrase "actual market value" was merely employed as a basis for the classification and graduation of the tax sought to be imposed; (2) that it is not a specific tax because it is not a tax on the beer itself, but on the privilege of manufacturing beer; and (3) that with the conversion of Mandaue into a city on June 21, 1969, the appeal has become moot, because the prohibition against the imposition of any privilege tax on sales or other taxes in any form based thereon, is applicable only to municipalities.<br><br>While We have heretofore announced the doctrine that the grant of power to tax to chartered cities and municipalities under Section 2 of the Local Autonomy Act is sufficiently ple­nary,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> it is, however, subject to the exceptions and limitations contained in the two (2) provisos of the same statute. In other words, the municipal corporation should not transcend the limitations imposed by the statute on the basis of which the power to tax is sought to be exercised. Thus, We held in the Marinduque case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> that an ordinance providing for a gra­duated tax based on either "gross output or sales" violates the prohibition on municipalities against imposing any percentage tax on sales, or other taxes in any form based thereon, as the only standard provided for measuring the gross output is its peso value, as determined from true copies of receipts and/or invoices that the taxpayer is required to submit to the muni­cipal treasurer.<br><br>We are thus confined to the narrow issue of whether or not the challenged ordinance has transcended the exceptions and limitations imposed by section 2 of Republic Act 2264.<br><br>Section 2 of the aforecited statute provides:<br><blockquote>"Provided, That municipalities and municipal districts shall, in no case, impose any percent­age tax on sales or other taxes in any form based thereon nor impose taxes on articles subject to specific tax * * *."</blockquote>Section 1 of Ordinance No. 88 of the Municipality of Man­daue, as amended by Ordinances Nos. 23 (1967) and 25 (1968), specifically provides that the graduated quarterly fixed tax shall be "based on the <i>gross value in money or actual market</i> value at the time of removal, of the manufactured products * * * from their factories * * * during the preceding calen­dar year * * *."<br><br>Well settled is the rule that in the absence of legis­lative intent to the contrary, technical or commercial terms and phrases, when used in tax statutes, are presumed to have been used in their technical sense or in their trade or commercial meaning. Thus, the phrase "gross value in money" has a well-defined meaning in our taxes. For instance, the term "<i>gross value in money</i>" of articles sold, bartered, exchanged or transferred, as used in Sections 184, 185 and 186 of the National Internal Revenue Code, has been invariably used as equivalent to "gross selling price" and has been construed as the total amount of money or its equi­valent which the purchaser pays to the vendor to receive or get the goods.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> It must be noted that the ordinance specifical­ly provides that the basis of the tax is the "gross value in money or actual market value" of the manufactured article.<br><br>The phrase "actual market value" has been construed as the price which an article "would command in the ordinary course of business, that is to say, when offered for sale by one willing to sell, but not under compulsion to sell, and purchased by another who is willing to buy, but under no ob­ligation to purchase it,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> or the price which the property will bring in a fair market after fair and reasonable efforts have been made to find a purchaser who will give the highest price for it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The "actual market value" of property, for purposes of taxation, therefore means the selling price of the article in the course of ordinary business.<br><br>Considering that the phrase "gross value in money" is followed by the words "or actual market value", it is evident that the latter was intended to explain and clarify the pre­ceding phrase. For the word "or" may be used as the equiva­lent of "that is to say" and gives that which precedes it the same significance as that which follows it. It is not always disjunctive and is sometimes interpretative or expository of the preceding word.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Certainly We cannot assume that the phrase "or actual market value" was a mere surplus age, for it serves to clarify and explain the meaning and import of the preceding phrase. In any event, it is the duty of the courts, so far as reasonably practicable, to read and interpret a stat­ute as to give life and effect to all its provisions, so as to render it a harmonious whole.<br><br>It is also significant to note, that there is a set ratio between the amount of the tax and the volume of sales. Thus if the "gross value in money or actual market value" of the beer removed from the factory exceeds P37,500.00 per quarter, the taxpayer is required to pay a quarterly license tax of P160.00 plus P0.30 for every P1,000.00, or fraction of the excess. In other words in excess of P37,500.00, the taxpayer will pay to the municipality a certain amount of tax measured by a percent­age of the sales. It is therefore evident that the challenged ordinance was a transparent attempt on the part of the munici­pality to impose a tax based on sales.<br><br>Although section 2 of the ordinance in question provides in a vague manner that the tax shall be assessed and collected on the basis of the sworn statement of the manager of a firm or corporation "of the gross value in money during the preceding quarter," in actual practice the quarterly tax levied upon pe­titioner, was computed on the basis of the total market value of the beer, per quarter, as shown by the shipping memorandum certified to by the storekeeper of the Bureau of Internal Revenue assigned to the brewery. Thus the taxes amounting to P309.40 and P5,171.80, paid by petitioner on January 22, 1968 and July 18, 1968, were actually determined respectively on the basis of 70,412 and 2,203.070 cases of beer manufactured and removed from the Mandaue plant, multiplied by P7.60 which is the prevailing market price (wholesaler's price) per case of beer.<br><br>In Laoag Producers' Cooperative Marketing Association, Inc. vs. Municipality of Laoag,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> We held that the challenged ordi­nance imposed a tax based on sales, although the ordinance merely imposed a "municipal tax or inspection fee of one-half (1/2) centavo on every kilo of Virginia leaf tobacco, garlic and onion on all wholesale dealers and vendors" because, in its application, it does impose a tax based on sales, as it is based on the number of kilos sold and purchased by him and when the wholesaler or vendor accumulates his stock, he does so for only one purpose, to sell the same at the appropriate time, and "he cannot by its very nature, carry on his business unless he sells what he has bought." Similarly, in the case at bar, the circumstance that the tax is imposed upon petitioner at the time of removal from the factory of the manufactured beer, and not on the date of actual sale, is not of important consequence since petitioner will, in the end, sell the beer removed from the fac­tory, because by the nature of its business, it has no alterna­tive but to sell what it has manufactured.<br><br>We therefore hold that the questioned ordinance imposed a tax based on sales and therefore beyond the authority of the municipality to enact.<br><br>Having reached this conclusion, it becomes unnecessary to pass upon the additional question posed, i.e., whether or not the challenged ordinance imposes a tax on a product subject to specific tax.<br><br>Respondents however claim that with the conversion of Mandaue into a city pursuant to Republic Act No. 5519, which was approved on June 21, 1969, the issue has already become moot, since the prohibition contained in section 2 of Republic Act 2264 applies only to municipalities and not to chartered cities. The same contention has been rejected in City of Naga v. Court of Appeals,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and Laoag Producers' Cooperative Marketing Association, Inc. v. Municipality of Laoag, supra, where We ruled that the legality of an ordinance depends upon the power of the municipality at the time of the enactment of the challenged ordinance. Since the municipality of Mandaue had no authority to enact the said ordinance, the subsequent approval of Republic Act No. 5519 which became effective on June 21, 1969, did not remove the original infirmity of the ordinance. Indeed there is no provision in the aforecited statute which invests a curative effect upon the ordi­nances of the municipality which when enacted were be­yond its statutory authority.<br><br><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF,</b> the appealed judgment is hereby reversed and Ordinance No. 23, series of 1966, as amended by Ordinance No. 25, series of 1967, which became effective on January 1, 1968, of the Municipality of Mandaue, Cebu, is hereby declared null and void. Res­pondents are also ordered to refund the taxes paid by Petitioners under the said ordinance with legal inte­rest thereon.
