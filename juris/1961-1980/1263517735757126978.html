				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">An appeal from the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals, dated August
9, 1961, in CTA Case No. 553, reversing the decision rendered by the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue on May 2, 1958, and ordering said Commissioner
to refund to the National Power Corporation the amount of P2<span class="GramE">,582.96</span>
representing advance sales tax paid on certain articles said corporation had
imported in 1955.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime on March 30, and April 1, 3, 6 and 20, 1955, five cases
containing diamond drill bits, non-coring diamond bits, reaming shells, and
parts for drilling machines, consigned to the Philippine Engineers' Syndicate,
Inc., sent by a Swedish supplier, arrived at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>International</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Airport</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Advance sales tax, customs duties and
surcharge in the aggregate amount of P6<span class="GramE">,749.57</span> were
assessed upon these shipments, but as they were not covered by a bank release
certificate they were subjected to seizure proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the shipments were released to
the Philippine Engineers' Syndicate, Inc., when it filed a surety bond in the
sum of 734,990.91 and paid, on <st1:date year="1955" day="5" month="5">May 5,
 1955</st1:date>, under protest, the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,749.57</span>
as advance sales tax, customs duties and surcharge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the latter sum, P4<span class="GramE">,156.66</span>
were for customs duties and P2,582.96 were for advance sales tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Philippine Engineers' Syndicate, Inc.
made payments for the National Power Corporation which claim­ed to be the real
importer of the shipments.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1955" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1955</st1:date>
the hearing on the seizure proceedings (Seizure Identification No. 2975)
commenced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incidentally, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the seizure proceedings, the National Power
Corporation filed with the Bureau of Customs, on September 17, 1955, a claim
for the refund of the amount of P6<span class="GramE">,749.57</span> paid as
customs duties and advance sales tax, for the reason that the National Power
Corporation is exempt from the payment of taxes, duties, imposts, etc. as
provided in Republic Act No. 358.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1957" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1957</st1:date>
a decision was rendered by the Collector of Customs of Manila finding that the
Philippine Engineers' Syndicate, Inc. was an agent of the National Power
Corporation, that the importations in question belonged to the National Power
Corporation, and that the importations were free from all taxes, duties and
imposts in accordance with Republic Act No. 358.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 2 of said Republic Act 358 provides that
“the National Power Corporation shall be exempt from the payment of ail taxes,
except real property tax, and from all duties, fees, imposts, charges and
restrictions of the Republic of the Philippines, its provinces, cities and
municipalities."</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the Bureau of Customs actually refunded to the National
Power Corporation only the amount of P4<span class="GramE">,156.66</span> paid as
customs duties, for the reason that it did not have the authority of the Bureau
of Internal Revenue to refund the amount of P2,582.96 paid as advance sales
tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Bureau of Customs suggested
that the claim for refund of the amount paid as sales tax be directed to the
Bureau of Internal Revenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting on
this suggestion, the Gen­eral manager of the National Power Corporation, on <st1:date year="1958" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1958</st1:date>, wrote the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue requesting said official to authorize the
Bureau or Customs to refund to the National Power Corporation the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,582.96</span> that had been paid as advance sales tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a letter dated May 21, 1958, and received
by the National Power Corporation on June 11, 1958, the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue, through its Regional Director, denied the request for refund
or said taxes upon the ground that such request was not made within two years
from the time said taxes were paid, as required in Section 306 of the National
Internal Revenue Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1958" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1958</st1:date>,
the National Power Corporation filed a petition for the review of the decision
of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue before the Court of Tax Appeals, and
said petition was docketed as CTA Case No. 553.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1958" day="28" month="7">July 28, 1958</st1:date>,
the Commissioner or Internal Revenue filed a motion to dismiss the case upon
the ground that the Court of Tax Appeals had no jurisdiction to entertain said
petition for review because the same had been filed beyond the two-year period
prescribed in Section 306 or the National Internal Revenue Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The National Power Corporation filed its
opposition to the motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
a resolution, dated <st1:date year="1958" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1958</st1:date>,
the Court of Tax Appeals denied the motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1958" day="14" month="10">October
 14, 1958</st1:date>, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue filed his answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1960</st1:date>,
the National Power Corporation submitted an amended petition for review, which
was admitted by the Court of Tax Appeals on <st1:date year="1960" day="4" month="8">August 4, 1960</st1:date> over the objection or the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1960</st1:date>, the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue filed his answer to the amended petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 9, 1961, after due hearing, the Court of Tax Appeals
rendered a decision reversing the decision of the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, and ordering the refund to the National Power Corporation of the
amount of P2,582.96.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this appeal of the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue before this Court.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue contends that the Court of
Tax Appeals erred in holding that the action instituted by the National Power
Corporation to recover advance sales tax had not prescribed; and that the Court
of Tax Appeals, consequently, erred in holding that the National Power
Corporation is entitled to refund.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue maintains that inasmuch as
the advance sales tax was paid on <st1:date year="1955" day="5" month="5">May
 5, 1955</st1:date> and that the National Power Corporation brought the action
with the Court of Appeals on <st1:date year="1958" day="11" month="7">July 11,
 1958</st1:date>, the action was already barred pursuant to the provisions of
Section 306 of the National Internal Revenue Code, which reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 306.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Recovery of tax erron­eously or illegally
collected</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- No suit or proceeding
shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any national internal revenue
tax hereafter alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected,
or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority, or of any
sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected, until
a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the Collector of Internal
Revenue; but such suit or proceeding may be maintained, whether or not such
tax, penalty, or sum has been paid under protest or duress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any case no such suit or proceeding shall
be begun after the expiration of two years from the date of payment of the tax
or penalty."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In the case of Gibbs vs. Collector of Internal
Revenue, G. R. No.</span> L-13453, February 29, 1969; 107 Phil. 232, this
Court, construing the provisions of Section 306 of the National Internal
Revenue Code together with Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125, held:</p>

<blockquote>"In fine, a taxpayer who has paid the tax, whether under
protest or not, and who is claiming a refund of the same, must comply with the
requirements of both sections, that is, he must file a claim for refund with
the Collector of Internal Revenue within 2 years from the date of his payment
of the tax, as required by said Section 306 of the National Internal Revenue
Code, and appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals within 30 days from receipt of the
collector's decision or ruling denying his claim for refund, as required by
said Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If, however, the Collector takes time in deciding the claim, and the
period of two years is about to end, the suit or proceeding must be started in
the Court of Tax Appeals before the end of the two-year period without awaiting
the decision of the collector.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
so because of the positive requirement of Section 305 and the doctrine that
delay of the Collector in rendering decision does not extend the peremptory
period fixed by the statute."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear in the provisions of Section 306 of the National
Internal Revenue Code that the suit for the recovery of taxes which must be
filed within two years from the date of payment refers to taxes that have been
erroneously or illegally assessed or collected.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In applying the provisions of this section, therefore, it must be shown
that the tax was erroneously or illegally collected, and that the tax was paid,
or considered paid, as of a certain date in order to determine when the
prescriptive period or two years had commenced to run.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has ruled that when a tax was originally collected
legally the running of the prescriptive period of two years provided for in
Section 306 of the National Internal Revenue Code should commence not from the
date the tax was paid but from the happening of the supervening cause which
entitled the taxpayer to a refund; and the claim for refund with the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the subsequent action before the Court of
Tax Appeals regarding the refund should ail be done within the said period of
two years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Thus, in
the case of Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Insular Lumber Co., etc., G.
R. No.</span> L-24221, <st1:date year="1967" day="11" month="12">December 11,
 1967</st1:date><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>,
this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"In fine, when the tax sought to be refunded is illegally or
erroneously collected, the period of prescription starts from the date the tax
was paid; but when the tax is legally collected, the pres­criptive period
commences to run from the date of the occurrence of the supervening cause which
gave rise to the right of refund.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
ruling in <u>Muller &amp; Phipps</u> is accordingly modified." '</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case now at bar, it is undisputed that the Bureau of
Customs assessed the import duties and advance sales tax upon the imported
articles that were consigned to the Philippine Engineers' Syndicate, Inc., and
collected the import duties and the sales tax from that entity on the
assumption that it was the importer and owner of the imported articles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The National Power Corporation claimed that
it was, the importer of the articles, but the claim of the National Power
Corporation was not granted by the Bureau of Customs because the question as to
who was the real importer had to be decided first in the seizure proceedings
that were instituted by said Bureau against the imported articles.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is Our view, therefore, that when the sum of P2,582.96 was
paid as advance sales tax on May 5, 1955 by the Philippine Engineers'
Syndicate, Inc., along with the sum of P4,156.66 as customs duties, the
collection of that amount as advance sales tax was correct and legal because
the assessment was made on the basis, or on the assumption, that the importer
of the articles that were taxed was the Philippine Engineers' Syndicate, Inc.,
and this entity did not enjoy any tax exemption privilege.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then a supervening circumstance
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1957" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1957</st1:date> a decision was rendered by the
Collector of Customs in the seizure proceedings, and the Collector declared
that the importation in question belonged to the Nation­al Power
Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Collector of Customs
further declared - and correctly too - that the importations were free from all
taxes, duties and imposts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can be
said, therefore, that as of <st1:date year="1957" day="15" month="10">October
 15, 1957</st1:date> when the Collector of Customs declared that the real
importer was the National Power Corporation, which was tax-exempt under
Republic Act 358, the collection from the National Power Corpora­tion of the
customs duties and advance sales tax would be erroneous and illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as payments had already been made,
under protest on <st1:date year="1955" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1955</st1:date>,
then, it should be considered that as of <st1:date year="1957" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1957</st1:date> the collection of the customs duties and
advance sales tax became erroneous and illegal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, the illegal, or the erroneous, collection of the tax
took effect on <st1:date year="1951" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1951</st1:date>,
and the right of the National Power Corporation to a refund of the tax accrued
as of that date.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the observation of the Court of Tax Appeals that
"the tax (advance sales tax) was originally collected /legally and the
question of the illegality, of the payment of the tax became known only upon
the rendition of the decision of the seizure case on <st1:date year="1957" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus by reason of the supervening circumstance
(i.e. the government's determination that the real importer of the goods was
the National Power Corporation which was exempt from tax) petitioner (National
Power Corporation) was entitled to the refund of the tax previously paid
...."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Collector of Customs refunded to the National Power
Corporation the sum of P4<span class="GramE">,156.66</span> corresponding to
customs duties thus illegally collected, but he did not refund the sum of
P2,582.96 that was collected as advance sales tax, stating that only the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue had the authority to order the refund of that
amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1958" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1958</st1:date>, the National Power Corporation requested
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to order the refund.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have declared that as of October 15, 1957 when the Collector
of Customs decided that the National Power Corporation was the real importer,
the collection of the advance sales tax from the National Power Corporation had
become illegal, and because the taxes had been paid previously the payment of
the illegal tax should also be reckoned as of that date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It follows that when the National Power
Corporation made a claim with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for the
refund of the amount paid as advance sales tax, on <st1:date year="1958" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1958</st1:date>, it had made the claim within
the period of two years from the date of payment, as required in Section 3.06
or the Nation­al Internal Revenue Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1958" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1958</st1:date>,
the National Power Corporation received the letter of the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue denying his request for <span class="GramE">refund,</span> and
so on <st1:date year="1958" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1958</st1:date> the
National Power Corporation began a suit in the Court of Tax Appeals; by way of
an appeal from 'the denial of its claim by the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Power Corporation had thus
brought the appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals within 30 days from the date of
notice of the denial by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear, therefore, that the National
Power Corporation had made its claim for refund with the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue, and it had began suit in the Court of Tax Appeals, well
within the period of two years from the time of payment of the disputed advance
sales tax<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
and had thereby complied with the requirements provided for in both Section 306
or the National Internal Revenue Code and Section 11 of Republic Act 1125.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find, therefore, that the Court of Tax Appeals did not err in
holding that the action instituted by the National Power Corporation had not
prescribed and that said Corporation is entitled to the refund or the advance
sales tax that it sought to recover from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
in the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the decision appealed from is affirmed,
without costs.</p>
