dismissed the <span style="">appeal </span>of herein
petitioners in CA-G.R. No. UDK 2045-R, for their failure to pay on time the
corresponding docket fee in the total sum of P53.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners, who are represented by the Citizens Legal Assistance
Office (CLAO) of the Department of Justice, now seek a review on <i>certiorari</i>
the following resolutions of the respondent Court of Appeals:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Resolution dated January
22, 1976, dismissing petitioners' appeal from the Court of First Instance of
Davao in Civil Case No. 417, entitled "Crisostomo Rosales, et al.,
plaintiffs, versus Emperatriz Vestal Lopez, et al., defendants," for the
reason that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"Since January 8, 1976 was expiry date to pay docket fees but
motion <span style="">was filed January 13, 1976 -­DENIED,
APPEAL </span>DISMISSED."</p>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Resolution dated
February 2, 1976, denying -- for <span style="">lack </span>of
merit petitioners' motion dated January 26, 1976 for reconsideration and to
admit the docket fee;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Resolution dated
February 24, 1976, denying petitioners' motion for reconsideration dated
February 17, 1976 on the ground that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"The return card attached to p. 17 clearly shows that notice
to pay docket fee was received from Post Office on December 24, 1975; therefore
last day to pay was January 8, <span style="">1976;
and motion </span>for <span style="">extension to pay
was filed on January 13, 1976, </span>when <span style="">there was </span>no more <span style="">period
</span>to extend;"</p>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Resolution dated
March 25, 1976, denying petitioners' motion for <span style="">reconsideration </span>dated March 16, 1976, thus --</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"As a preliminary point, movants have <span style="">not </span>shown that dismissal of appeal is not yet final and <span style="">can </span>still be reconsidered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason at least, reconsideration
should be denied, as it is hereby DENIED"; and</p>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Resolution of April
27, 1976, denying petitioners' motion for leave to file second motion for
reconsideration to reinstate appeal, dated April 14, 1976.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners' main
complaint is embodied in paragraph 7 of their undated petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>,
reproducing, among other things, their motion for reconsideration, dated March
16, 1976 (Annex H-Petition), as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That she filed a
Motion for Extension of Time to Pay Docket (Fee) on January 13, 1976;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That she based
the computation of time within which to pay the docket on the date stamped on
the Motion to Pay Docket Fee which clearly show that the office received it on
December 29, 1975, which was already submitted to this Court for Appreciation;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That from December 30, 1975 to January 13,
1976, it will give us a total number of 15 days;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the Motion
for Reconsideration of the herein appellant was denied for the reason that the
Registry Return Received from the Post Office showed that the office received
it on December 24, 1975.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However the Motion
to Pay Docket Fee clearly show that the office received the Notice to Pay
Docket Fee on December 29, 1975.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Motion which was stamped received on December 29, 1975, was the very notice and
communication indorsed to the undersigned for action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no other date appearing on the
aforesaid letter indicating that it was received prior to the aforesaid date;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That in view of
the fore­going circumstance, undersigned most respectfully inform this Honorable
Court that she could not be expected to use the date appearing in the registry
return receipt as basis in the computation of the period considering that such
date, December 24, 1975 does not appear on the face of the Notice to Pay Docket
Fee and considering further that it is the Record Division of this Office which
received communica­tion; and that she could not be expected to know things
which does not appear in the record;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"8.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the said
date December 24, 1975 might have been erroneously written by the messenger
considering that it is of judicial notice that December 24, 1975 is a busy day
being a Christmas Eve.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is likewise of
judicial notice that the succeeding days after Christmas were declared as a
Special Holidays by the President of the Philippines and it was only on
December 29, 1975 when offices resume works; x x x." (Pp. 4-5, Petition;
pp. 14-15, rec.).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Copy of the undated
petition was received by counsel for private respondents on July 26, 1976, who
eventually filed his COMMENT thereon on November 20, 1976 (received by this Court
on December 2, 1976), only after he received the Court's resolution of October
2, 1976 on November 10, 1976, requiring him to SHOW CAUSE why he should not be
disciplinarily dealt with for his failure to file his comment within the period
which expired August 16, 1976.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their
comment, private respondents, while adopting the stand of the Court of Appeals
in dismissing petitioners' appeal, added that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The Court of Appeals have (sic) more knowledge on the facts
surrounding the dismissal of the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The herein respondents have no other recourse but to adopt the stand of
the Court of Appeals and its finding on the facts surrounding the dismissal of
the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the herein respondents
have no way of verifying the facts alleged by the herein petitioners by reason
of the distance between this Honorable Court, where the records of the case
are, and the office of the undersigned counsel which is at Tagum, Davao."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After considering the
circumstances obtaining in the case and the prevailing atmosphere of liberality
which has swept this Court in similar matters since the case of Berkenkotter
vs. Court of Appeals (L-36629, Sept. 28, 1973, 53 SCRA 228), followed by
Pimentel, et al. vs. Court of Appeals (L-39423 &amp; L-39684, June 27, 1975, 64
SCRA 476) and lately by Maqui and Maqui vs. Court of Appeals, et al. (L-41609,
Feb. 24, 1976), WE vote to grant the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Section 1, Rule 50 of the
Revised Rules of Court, on dismissal of appeal, provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Grounds for
dismissal of appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- An appeal may be
dismissed by the Court of Appeals, on its own motion or on that of the
appellee, on the following grounds:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure of the appellant to pay the docketing
fee as provided in section 5 of Rule 46; x <span style="">x."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It was grave abuse of
judicial discretion on the part of respondent Court of Appeals to dismiss
petitioners' appeal for the latter's alleged failure to file a motion for
extension of time to pay the appeal docket fee on or before January 8, 1976,
the expiry date to pay the docket fee, if the notice to pay such fee was
actually delivered on December 24, 1975 by the postal employee to the Records
Division of the CLAO, as claimed by respondent Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But there is evidence to show that CLAO
actually</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">received the same notice on December 29,
1975.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the counsel assigned by the
CLAO to handle the appeal of petitioners had every reason to rely on
"December 29, 1975" as the date of receipt of the notice to pay, We
find merit in her contention that under the circumstances she could not be
expected to know "January 8, 1976" as the expiry date, because
fifteen days from December 29, 1975 would be January 13, 1976.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence, to dismiss
appellants' appeal, as the Court of Appeals did, and to deny the various
subsequent motions for reconsideration filed thereafter would be unjust and
unwarranted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Not only this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is the undeniable fact that December 24
is traditionally a very busy day for everyone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the Supreme Court itself, the employees are dismissed after noon of
December 24th to enable them to go home and avoid the Christmas rush and
traffic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Added to this is the fact that
the three days after Christmas day in 1975 were all non-work days, Friday,
December 26, having been declared a special public holiday by the President of
the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it was only on
December 29 that work in the government, including the CLAO, counsel for petitioners,
was resumed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, four more
non-work days followed until January 5, 1976, when work in public and private
offices returned to normal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To these
incontrovertible facts, We cannot close Our eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Again, there is no
dispute that the appeal docket fee was eventually paid (Annex B-Petition, p.
27, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The payment of the appeal
docket fee is not a requirement for the protection of the prevailing party, and
non-compliance therewith within the time prescribed causes no substantial
prejudice to anyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is patent that
the delay in the payment was not due to <u>laches</u> or to a desire to delay
or defeat the ends of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To apply
to petitioners the legal requirements strictly, would not only tend to block
the right of review to which a party is entitled under the law, but also would
amount to a complete departure from what We said in the cases of Philippine
National Bank vs. Philippine Milling Co., Inc., et al. (26 SCRA 712, 715) and
reiterated in Maqui &amp; Maqui vs. Court of Appeals, et al. (L-41609, Feb. 24,
1976) that the provision of Section 1, Rule 50 of the </span>Revised Rules of
Court, which provides specific grounds for dismissal of appeal "manifestly
confers a power and does not impose a duty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is more, it is <u>directory</u>, not <u>mandatory</u>." Hence,
it should be exercised with a great deal of circumspection, considering all the
attendant circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS' RESOLUTIONS
HEREINABOVE ENUMERATED ARE ALL SET ASIDE, AND THE APPEAL FILED BY PETITIONERS
IN CA-G.R. NO. UDK 2045-R IS ORDERED REINSTATED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>NO COSTS.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I concur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment
once more applies the basic rule that failure to pay the appeal docketing fee
within the 15-day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
confers a directory, not mandatory, power to dismiss the proposed appeal and
that such power will be used in the exercise of the Court's sound discretion
"in accordance with the tenets of justice and fair play, having in mind
the circumstances obtaining in each case."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It cannot be over-emphasized, however, that the members of the
bar should exert every effort to observe strictly such <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
periods fixed in the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> periods are essential for
the effective and orderly administration and disposition of the cases and
incidents before the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure to
comply with such <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> periods is fatal in the
matter of taking an appeal, for the judgment sought to be appealed becomes
final if the appeal is not perfected within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure to keep other
non-jurisdictional deadlines or periods needlessly mul­tiplies the paper work
in the courts and consumes the time and attention of the appellate courts
(which they should normally and properly devote to the principal task of
adjudicating appeals on their merits) in determining in each case whether such
lapses could be justifiably excused on the basis of compelling reasons and
considerations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court reiterates the basic ground rule as affirmed in <span class="SpellE">M<u>aqui</u></span><u> vs. Court of Appeals</u><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
that "(A) rigid adherence to the technical rules of procedure disregards
the fundamental aim of procedure to serve as an aid to justice, not as a means
for its frustration, and the objective of the Rules of Court to afford
litigants just, speedy and inexpensive determination of their controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, excusable imperfections of form and
technicalities of procedure or lapses in the literal or rigid observance of a
procedural rule or non-jurisdictional deadline provided therein should be
overlooked and brushed aside as trivial and indecisive in the interest of fair
play and justice when public policy is not involved, no prejudice has been
caused the adverse party and the court has not been deprived of its authority
or jurisdiction."</p>

<p class="BODY">But it must be borne in mind by would-be appellants that their
failure to observe the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> periods and other
requirements throws the burden on them to show not only that it would be in
consonance with the exercise of sound discretion and the tenets of justice and
fair play to excuse their lapses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More
than this, where the appeal is manifestly frivolous or obviously for dilatory
purposes - such as one presenting no <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>
question or one so readily recognizable as devoid of merit on the face of the
record that there is little, if any, prospect it can ever succeed<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
- it would be against sound discretion to excuse such lapses and dismissal of
the appeal will be sustained in the interest of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">The cardinal rule remains that the discretionary power to dismiss
appeals or not must always be exercised "wisely and prudently, never
capriciously, with a view to substantial justice."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>
