				<BR><STRONG>ANTONIO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Philippine Metal Foundries, Inc. (now dissolved and merged
with <span class="SpellE">Shriro</span> [<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>]
Inc.) is seeking in this case a review of the decision of the Court of
Industrial Relations in Cases Nos. 3932-ULP and 3941-ULP.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, in its complaint dated November 21, 1963 (Case No.
3941-ULP), charged the Regal Manufacturing Employees Association (<span class="SpellE">FTUP</span>) and its members (herein private respondents), with
unfair labor practice for declaring a strike on October 5, 1963 and picketing
the company's premises without filing a notice of strike in spite of the
existence of a no strike, no lockout clause and grievance procedure in the
collective bargaining agreement entered into between the petitioner and the
Union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their answer to this
complaint, the Union and its members denied the charge and, as affirmative
defense, alleged that on October 3, 1963, the Union requested the management
for a grievance conference, stating in its invitation the time and place of
meeting, but the company, through its General Mana­ger, refused and instead
handed the Union's Presi­dent a memorandum dismissing him from work and told
the Union members not to report for work, which is in violation of the no
lockout and no strike clause of the contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, petitioner Philippine Metal Foundries, Inc.
and its General Manager, in Case No. 3932-ULP, were charged by private respond­ents
on July 21, 1964 with unfair labor practice for the dismissal of <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>, President of
the Union, on October 3, 1963, allegedly due to his union activities in
representing and protecting the Union members in their relations with the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this complaint,
petitioner and its manager filed an answer denying the material allegations and
al­leged as affirmative defenses, among others, that on October 3, 1963, the
company was constrained to terminate the services of <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>
by reason of the fact that he had, in spite of repeated notices and warnings
from the company, frequently and repeatedly absented himself from his work as
foundry worker and by reason of said dismissal he, as President of the Union as
well as an officer of the <span class="SpellE">FTUP</span>, encouraged and
abetted the staging of a strike on October 5, 1963, without prior notice to the
company or any of the latter's officials, in gross violation of a stipulation
provided in their Collective Bargaining Agreement, establishing pickets and
blocking ingress and egress to and from the company's premises, causing
interruption of the work and/or business of the company to its serious damage
and prejudice.</p>

<p class="BODY">After holding joint trial on these two cases, the Court of
Industrial Relations rendered its deci­sion, finding that <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>,
as Union President, was discharged for his union activities and that the
employees declared a strike because they believed in good faith that the
dismissal of their President was an unfair labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court declared res­pondents Philippine
Metal Foundries, Inc. and <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Relunia</span>, in Case No. 3932-ULP, guilty of unfair labor
practice in dismissing complainant <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>; ordered respondents to reinstate <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> to his former
position with all the rights and privileges formerly appertaining thereto, with
one (1) year back wages computed from October 3, 1963; and dismissed the
petitioner's charge in Case No. 3941-ULP.</p>

<p class="BODY">Its motion for reconsideration having been de­nied by the Court
of Industrial Relations <i>en banc,</i> petitioner filed the present petition
which was considered by this Court as submitted for decision without
respondents' brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
whether <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>
was dismissed due to his absences or to his union activities as Union
President; and (2) whether the strike declared by the Union on October 5, 1963,
is legal or not.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the first issue, it is argued by petitioner that
according to the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Union and the
company "one absent for a period of one week who fails to give notice
thereof shall be dropped automatically" and under its Disciplinary
Policies and Procedures, dated and enforced since March 1, 1963, absence of an
employee without permission for a period of seven (7) consecutive calendar days
is a ground for imme­diate dismissal, upon establishment of guilt; that since
the Court of Industrial Relations found that <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>
incurred numerous absences from January to September 1963, broken down as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for the month of January, one
(1) unexcused absence; March, one (1) unexcused absence and twelve (12) consecu­tive
absences without permission; April, four (4) consecutive absences without
permission; May, two (2) absences without permission; and September, five (5)
unexcused absences, the said court erred in holding that in Case No. 3932-ULP, <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> was dis­missed not because of his absences but
rather due to his being Union President and union activities.</p>

<p class="BODY">In determining whether a discharge is discri­minatory, the true
reason for the discharge must be established.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It has been said that while union activity is no bar to a discharge, the
existence of a lawful cause for discharge is no defense if the employee was
actually discharged for union activity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no question that <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> incurred numerous absences from January to September
1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had the company wanted to
terminate his services on the ground of absences, it could have done so,
pursuant to Article V of the Collective Bargaining Agreement as early as March
1963 when he incurred twelve (12) consecutive absences without permission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Its failure to do so shows
that the infractions committed by <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> were
disregarded.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of
Industrial Relations found that <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> went to the
company on <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1963</st1:date>,
but did not work as he was very sleepy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When he reported for work on <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="10">October
 1, 1963</st1:date>, he submitted a written explanation for his absences which
was received by the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two (2)
days later, as President of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>, he invited the
General Manager of the company for a grievance conference to thresh out union
problems at the D &amp; E Restaurant at <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00</st1:time>
p. m. of <st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The letter of invitation was received by the
company at almost <st1:time minute="45" hour="12">12:45</st1:time> <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1963" day="3" month="10">October
 3, 1963</st1:date>. At <st1:time minute="45" hour="14">2:45</st1:time> p. m.
of the same day, <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> was in turn handed his
termination letter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the attendant
circumstances, <span class="GramE">We</span> believe the Court of Industrial
Relations was justified in concluding that:</p>

<blockquote>"In 1963, <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> had been a habitual
absentee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His excused absences for
causes other than sickness, sick leave and vacation leave, total two (2) in
January; nine (9) in February; eleven (11) in April; ten (10) in May; nine (9)
in June; eleven (11) in July; and five (5) in August (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
<span class="GramE">'5' and '5-A').</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"This record, plus his numerals tardiness and half-day work,
and the aforesaid unexcused absences, show how little work for the employer <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> had been doing as an employee (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span><span class="GramE">. 'EE' and '6-A').</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His last unexcused absence in Septem­ber must have been just enough on
the part of the company to withdraw its special treatment of <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> as union president (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">'EE').</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"This Court believes, however, that it was the aforementioned
letter of invitation to a grievance conference sent by <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>
to the general manager (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span><span class="GramE">. '</span>DD'
and '7'), coming at the heels of his last unexcused absences, that broke the
proverbial camel's back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His dismissal
under the foregoing circumstances, being ultimately triggered by his union
activity, is therefore not without some taint of unfair labor practice."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The question of whether an employee was dis­charged because of
his union activities is essen­tially a question of fact as to which the
findings of the Court of Industrial Relations are conclusive and binding if
supported by substantial evidence considering the record as a whole.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
This is so because the <st1:street><st1:address>Industrial Court</st1:address></st1:street>
is governed by the rule of substantial evidence, rather than by the rule of
preponderance of evidence as in any ordinary civil cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Substantial evidence has been defined as such relevant evidence as a reasonable
mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
It means such evidence which affords a substantial basis from which the fact in
issue can be reasonably inferred.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Examining the evidence on hand on this matter, <span class="GramE">We</span> find
the same to be substantially sup­ported.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although a man's motive, like his intent, is, in the words of
Lord Justice Bowen, "as much a fact as the state of his digestion",
evidence of such fact may consist both direct <span class="GramE">testimony</span>
by one whose motive is in question and of inferences of probabi­lity drawn from
the totality of other facts.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is admitted by petitioner that it accepted the invitation of <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> for a grievance conference on <st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Yet, two hours after it accepted the letter of invitation, it dismissed <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> without prior notice and/or investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such dismissal is undoubtedly an unfair labor
practice committed by the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
these facts and cir­cumstances, <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> and the
members of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> had valid reasons to ignore the
scheduled grievance con­ference and declared a strike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> dec­lared
a strike in the belief that the dismissal of <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>
was due to union activities, said strike was not illegal.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
It is not even required that there <span class="GramE">be</span> in fact an
unfair labor practice committed by the employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It suffices, if such a belief in good faith
is entertained by labor, as the inducing factor for staging a strike.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The strike declared by the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> in this case cannot be
considered a violation of the "no strike" clause of the Collective
Bargain­ing Agreement because it was due to the unfair labor practice of the
employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, a no strike clause
prohibition in a Collective Bargaining Agree­ment is applicable only to
economic strikes.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The strike cannot be declared as illegal for lack of notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In strikes arising out of and against a
company's unfair labor practice, a strike notice is not necessary in view of
the strike being founded on urgent necessity and directed against practices
condemned by public policy, such notice being legally required only in cases of
economic strikes.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the contention of petitioner that the griev­ance conference
which <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> requested to be held on <st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1963</st1:date> was not for the
purpose of dis­cussing union problems but of his dismissal, it is clearly shown
in the records that <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> received his termination
letter <i>after</i> he requested for a grievance conference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore, clear that when <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> requested for a grievance conference, he was not yet
aware of his dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> could not have requested for a grievance conference
on <st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1963</st1:date> if he
did not have demands to pre­sent on that date.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The records disclose that, as Union President, he used to make
representations and protestations in behalf of the members of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
against unfair acts committed by the company.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As early as <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1962</st1:date>,
he reminded the company of an agreement arrived at in a previous
labor-management conference that was violated when the management hired several
casual workers without giving preference to previously <span class="GramE">laid</span>
off employees and without notifying the Union President (Exhibit
"P").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1962</st1:date>, he complained of the poor condition
of the toilet facilities in one of the buildings of the company and requested
the management for its improvement (Exhibit "Q").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 18, 1962, he called the attention
of the management regarding the plight of seventy-two (72) workers who were
supposed to be temporarily laid off for a period of two (2) months only as
agreed upon between the Union and the management, but were not re-hired after
the lapse of the period so he requested for the payment of their separation pay
(Exhibit "R").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1962</st1:date>, he requested for
the payment of a claim for compensation of a worker prior to the scheduled
hearing of the same (Exhibit "U").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1962</st1:date>,
he worked for the payment of the accrued vacation and sick leave of a
terminated worker (Exhibit "V").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1963</st1:date>,
he in­terceded for the payment of the two months separa­tion pay of another
terminated worker (Exhibit "W").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1963</st1:date>,
he worked for the payment of separation pays of terminated workers found to be
physically unfit (Exhibit "AA").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And on <st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1963</st1:date>,
he invited the General Manager of the com­pany for a grievance conference to
settle the complaints of several Union members regarding their vacation leaves
and other union problems (Exhibit "BB").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These exhibits show how <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>,
as President of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>, fought for the rights and
protection of his members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are
satisfied that the Court's <span class="GramE">finding, in the above regard, are</span>
supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.</p>
