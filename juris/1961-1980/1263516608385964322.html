				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">In these </span>two petitions
for certiorari, both filed <span style="">by </span>the
Philip­pine Association of Free Labor Unions, the jurisdiction of the
respondent Judge in both cases, the Honorable Joaquin M. <span style="">Salvador, in the second petition </span>speaking
for respondent Court <span style="">of Industrial
Relations <u>en</u> <u>ba</u></span><u>nc</u>, to issue the orders complained
of is <span style="">assailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is </span>the view of petitioner that
there being <span style="">no presidential certifi­cation,
</span>an urgent petition of August 29, 1968, filed <span style="">by the other </span>respondent, the Social Security System, to seek an
authoritative interpretation of a provision of a collective bargaining
agreement adopted as <span style="">a </span>formal
award of the Court of Industrial Relations of August 5, 1966, is beyond the
competence of <span style="">respondent Judge to </span>pass
upon.</p>

<p class="BODY">On such a basic assumption, petitioner could with plausibility
assert that the order of August 29, 1968, enjoining "[petitioner] Union
not to declare any strike and [respondent] Management not to dismiss nor
suspend any of its employees nor to declare any lockout";<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
the order of September 3, 1968, ordering petitioner "to immediately
lift" the pickets in the premises of the Social Security System and its
branches and to show cause why it and its members in the Social Security System
should not be declared in contempt of court;<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and the order of September 5, 1968, directing "all the striking employees
of the Social Security System * * * to return to work on or before 5:00 o'clock
in the afternoon of Friday September 6, 1968" and the management "to
admit them under the same terms and conditions as of the date of the
strike," and the <span style="">investigation </span>by
the prosecution division of the Court of Industrial Relations of the contempt
charges filed by respondent Social Security System would be devoid of support
in law and could be stricken down.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>

where the Court of Industrial Relations itself likewise was made respondent,
the resolution of September 6, 1968 by the court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> <span style="">dismissing </span>the motion for the
reconsideration of the order of August 29, 1968 on the ground that such motion
was filed one day beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period,
with Associate Judge <span class="SpellE">Bugayong</span> dissenting, was
likewise impugned as having been issued beyond the jurisdiction of respondent
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Social Security System met the issue squarely with
the allegation that the absence of a new presidential certifi­cation is not
necessarily fatal, <span style="">there being a
previous one as a result </span>of which the formal award of the respondent
court embodying a collective bargaining agreement reached by the parties was
issued on <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would follow that the appropriate
provisions of the Court of Industrial Relations Act<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
if utilized render manifest the undeniable power of such court during the <span style="">effectiveness of such </span>award,
ordinarily covering a period of three years, after due hearing <span style="">to "alter, modify in whole or in part,
or set aside any such award, order or decision, or reopen any question"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> that may be involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It likewise possesses authority under the
succeeding section to determine the meaning or interpretation of an award,
order, or decision.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find the above contention persuasive and sustain the juris­diction
of respondent Judge Salvador.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, the petitions are dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We likewise register our emphatic disapproval
of the conduct pursued by petitioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place> in its
failure to obey the above orders complained of, even on the assumption that it
enter­tained no doubt at all that in the issuance thereof, respondent Judge and
thereafter the respondent Court of Industrial Relations, acted without
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no controversy about the facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was shown in both petitions that
petitioner and respondent Social Security System were parties to a collective
bargaining agreement lasting from July 1, 1966 to June 30, 1969, an agreement
adopted as the formal award of respondent Court of Industrial Relations on
August 5, 1966, in a pending case <span style="">before
</span>it that was certified.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Lately, a dispute has arisen between the parties regarding an <span style="">implementation of some of its
provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner alleged that
respondent Social </span>Security System instead of complying with its <span style="">obligation </span>filed on <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1968</st1:date>, with the Court of
Industrial Relations, an urgent petition asserting, among other things, that
there was allegedly a controversy with <span style="">respect
to the interpretation of certain provisions </span>of such agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It considered the matter as forming part of
the previously certified case, a view that found favor with respondent Judge
Salvador of the Court of Industrial Relations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the first order challenged was issued on August 29,
1968, it being expressly provided therein:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the current
dispute as outlined in said petition, the parties, for the <span style="">sake </span><span style="">of industrial peace and pursuant to the
provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 103, as amended, are hereby enjoined to
maintain the <u>status</u> <u>quo</u> - the Union not to declare any strike and
the Management not to dismiss nor suspend any of its employees nor to declare
any lockout. * * *”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The other orders challenged
in the first petition were issued by respondent Judge Salvador as petitioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
did not comply with the Orders of <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="8">August
 29, 1968</st1:date>, presumably due to its firm belief that there being no new
presidential certification, respondent <span style="">Judge
</span>was absolutely devoid of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the other petition,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
reference was made to the additional facts that on September 9, 1968,
respondent Court of Industrial Relations adopted the resolution complained of
denying the motion for reconsideration,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
such resolution<span style=""> being</span> assailed
as having been issued without jurisdiction resulting in its being "a
nullity and in legal contemplation * * * inexistent.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

ore <st1:date year="1968" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hearing on both petitions took place on <st1:date year="1968" day="17" month="9">September 17, 1968</st1:date>, and thereafter
the case was submitted for decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1968</st1:date>, a resolution was
issued by us dismissing both <span style="">petitions,
without prejudice to an extended </span>opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is it.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The issue <span style="">is </span>thus
clear-cut and well-defined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
whether a presidential certification in 1963, resulting in an award in 1966,
embodying a collective bargaining agreement arrived at by disputants sufficed
to vest jurisdiction on respondent Judge to act on a petition filed on <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1968</st1:date> by the respondent
Social Security System, in effect seeking an interpretation of Article 23 of
such collective bargaining agreement?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
thus put, the answer cannot be in doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As was made clear
earlier, it must be in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It cannot be otherwise if deference be paid to the appropriate
provisions of the Court of Industrial Relations <span style="">Act,</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the compulsory arbi­<span style="">tration </span>aspect of which is unavoidable whenever there is a

interested party may petition the Court </span>to determine such meaning or <span style="">interpretation </span>and
the Court, upon receiving such petition, shall <span style="">se</span>t a date for the hearing of the case

provision, the power of the Court of Industrial Relations goes farther, for at
any time "during the effectiveness of an award, order or decision, the
Court may, on application of an interested party, and after due hearing, alter,
modify in whole or in part, or set aside any such award, order or decision, or

absence of such specifi­cation, any party or both parties to a controversy may

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this particular
instance, there is no question that under the collective bargaining agreement
which was embodied in the award of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="8"><span style="">August 5, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, the period of <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>

period of three years.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The power of the Court of Industrial Relations which, as thus
phrased, is comprehensive in character, has been given an inter­pretation by us
consistent with the well-nigh sweeping reach of its language.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has never been construed in a niggardly <span style="">sense; </span>the recognition of such
authority has been full and sympathetic, never grudging.</p>

<p class="BODY">So it has been from the earliest case decided in 1939, <span class="SpellE">Goseco</span> v. Court of Industrial Relations.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Such an approach was mani­fested there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner landowner in that decision contended that there being a
decision of respondent court of December 28, 1937, copy of which was furnished
other respondents on January 20, 1938, it had become final and definite as of
January 25, 1938, from which the conclusion was that respondent court exceeded
his jurisdiction when, acting on a motion for reconsideration dated February
13, 1938, the court granted the same on February 28, 1939.</p>

<p class="BODY">Why such a contention should be rejected was explained by Justice
Laurel:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The narrow construction
suggested by the petitioner is perhaps justified if we adopt but a fragmentary
view of the law.”<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Such should not be the case, according to the opinion, as it did not take into
consideration the provision empowering the Court of Industrial Relations"
'on application of an interested party, and after due hearing, [to] alter,
modify in whole or in part, or set aside any such award, order or decision, or
reopen any question involved therein.’"<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
From which, the conclusion follows:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"If the re­spondent court may, at any time, alter, modify or set
aside an award, order or decision, then the reconsideration of its decision of
December 28, 1937, upon application, in the form of a motion for
reconsideration filed by the respondents Roman <span class="SpellE">Belleza</span>
and others, and after due hearing, was in compliance almost to the letter with
the proviso just quoted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would appear
idle, therefore, to contend that in so doing, the respondent court overstepped
its jurisdiction."<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, Section 18 of the Act was likewise cited in the opinion from which
the valid inference was drawn "that, since no time is fixed within which
the said court may clarify or unravel the meaning or interpretation of an
award, order or decision, it may do so at any time, thus inducing the further
conclusion that no such award, order or decision is meant to be definitive in
the sense that it is beyond recall."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To such a spirit, fealty has been shown in subsequent decisions.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
As was stated by this Court in Church v. La Union Labor Union:<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
"The clear object of thee provisions is un­doubtedly to give to the court
a continuing control over the case, in the interest of management and labor, as
long as it remains under its control and jurisdiction, in order to accord
substantial justice to the parties * * *, in line with the liberal policy of
the law which enjoins that 'the Court shall act according to justice and equity
and the substantial merits of the case, without regard to technicality or legal
forms and shall not be bound by any technical rules of legal evidence but may
inform its mind on such manner as it may deem just and equitable * * *."</p>

<p class="BODY">Also, to the same effect, this excerpt from Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Luisita</span> v. National Labor Union:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"As the time for authority to change is
thus expressly fixed by law at three years, it stands to reason that in the
absence of any other agreement to the contrary, and for reasons of justice and
equity, any party to an agreement may change or modify the same upon the
expiration of the period of three years from the date thereof."<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">Then, </span><span style="">too, "the industrial </span>court <span style="">can at any time during the effectiveness </span>of an award alter and
modify in whole or in <span style="">part </span>said
award or reopen any question involved therein under <span style="">Section </span><span style="">17 </span>of <span style="">Commonwealth Act No. 103, and such is what
said Court has done when it made the award extensive to the new employees, * *

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We do not go as far </span><span style="">as </span>to hold that <span style="">once there is a
presidential certification under </span><span style="">Section
10 of the Industrial Peace Act, the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 103
necessarily apply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is it necessary.
For the purpose of passing upon these two petitions, it suffices to declare
that there being a previous presidential certification resulting in an award,
the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of which continues up to the present,
respondent Judge could appropriately rely on the two above sections for the
purpose of considering the merit or lack of it of the urgent petition filed by
respondent Social Security System.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As
to the power of respondent Judge, once there is a presidential certification to
require the parties to maintain the <u>status</u> <u>quo</u>, the Union not to
go on strike and the management not to declare a lockout, that is a settled
matter.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is in the light of the
above considerations that the juris­diction of respondent Judge to issue the
challenged orders is sustained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 36.9pt; text-indent: -15.3pt;">2. One other
matter. The failure to abide by the orders and <span style="">processes </span>of judicial and quasi-judicial agencies like the Court
of Industrial Relations gives rise to a serious concern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It engenders at the very least the
well-founded suspicion that such an attitude betrays an absence of good
faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is indicative of a belief at
war with all that adjudication stands for.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">No one may be permitted
to take the law into his own hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
one, much less the party immediately concerned, should have the final say on
the validity or lack of it of one's course of conduct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Centuries of reliance on the judicial process
repel such a notion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As </span><span style="">was so aptly stated in <span class="SpellE">Gompers</span>
v. Buck's Stove &amp; Range Company:</span><a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
"If the party can make' himself a judge of the validity of orders which
have been issued, and by his own act of disobedience set them aside, then are
the courts impotent, and what the Constitution now fittingly calls the
'judicial power of the United States' would be a mere mockery."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Nor is this all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such refusal to accord due respect and yield
obedience to what a court or administrative tribunal ordains is fraught with
much graver consequences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Today, it may
be only petitioner Union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If such a
conduct were not condemned, some other group or groups emboldened by the
absence of any reproof or disapproval may conduct <span style="">themselves </span>similarly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
injury to the rule of law may well-nigh be irreparable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Law stands for order, for
the peaceful and systematic adjust­ment of frictions and conflicts unavoidable
in a modern society with <span style="">its
complexities and </span>clashing interests.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The instrumentality for such balancing or harmonization is the judiciary
and other <span style="">agencies exercising
quasi-judicial powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When judicial or
quasi-judicial tribunals speak, what they decree </span>must be obeyed, what
they ordain must be followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A party
dissatisfied may ask for a reconsideration and, if denied, may <span style="">go </span>on to a higher tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As long as the orders stand unmodified,
however, they must, even if susceptible to well-founded doubts on
jurisdictional grounds, be faithfully complied with.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Such is the way of the law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So it has been in the past.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it
should continue to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were
otherwise, the intellect no longer holds sway, the dictates of moderation are
ignored, and passion takes over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
words of Dean Pound come to mind:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Civilization involves subjection of force to reason, and the
agency of this subjection is law."<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is well that petitioner's counsel during the hearing of this
case affirmed in unequivocal language the absence of any intent to defy the
rule of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There should have been,
however, a greater realization on the part of petitioner that law, to borrow
the language of Justice Frankfurter, "alone saves a society from being
rent by internecine strife or ruled by mere brute power however
disguised."<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">He was careful to note of course:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Only when a court is so obviously traveling outside its orbit as
to be merely usurping judicial forms and facilities, may an order issued by a
court be disobeyed and treated as though it were a letter to a newspaper."<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
That <span style="">does </span>not
help the cause of petitioner at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
would be the height of unreason to consider the actuations of respondent Judge
as outside the orbit of a court and a mere usurpation of judicial power.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is here no "indisputable want of authority."
There could have been doubts as to its competence, it is true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is equally well-settled, however, that a
tribunal, whenever confronted with a particular question, is not devoid of the
authority to pass precisely on the existence or non-existence of its power to
act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether, therefore, the urgent
petition of respondent Social Security System is proper for respondent Judge to
pass upon is not for petitioner itself to decide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The remedy, if need there be for such, may be
supplied by a higher tribunal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even if, therefore, the good faith of petitioner be conceded, the
failure to abide by the commands of the orders herein challenged finds no
justification if the rule of law has any meaning at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it must be even if petitioner in all
sincerity is of the belief that the failure to assert its claim as to the lack
of jurisdiction may imperil the gains of labor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It does not mitigate
such defiance of law <span style="">to urge </span>that hard-won liberties of collective action by workers
were at stake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The most prized liberties
themselves pre-suppose an in­dependent judiciary through which these liberties
may be, as they often have been, vindicated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When in a real controversy, such as is now here, an appeal is made to
law, the issue must be left to the judgment of courts and not the personal
judgment of one of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
principle is a postulate of our democracy."<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be admitted of <span style="">course </span>that labor has not always found
things easy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is understandable that
management to protect its own interest may fail to yield its assent however
justly founded the claims of the former may be.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor is the power that capital commands to be underestimated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely, for that reason, the framers of
our Constitution saw to it that the rights of labor are expanded and protected.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
The statutory implementation of such constitutional intent has been
impressive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judicial decisions have
invariably displayed a similar solicitude for the welfare of labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When, however, as unfortunately did happen
here, it engages in conduct at war with the fundamental postulate of the rule
of law, it cannot and should not expect judicial approval or sympathy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it is in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for certiorari and prohibition
with a plea for preliminary injunction, L-29471, and the other petition for
certiorari with preliminary injunction, L-29487, both filed by the Philippine Association
of Free Labor Unions, are dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp;
