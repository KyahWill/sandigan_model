				<BR><STRONG>DE LEON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Negros 
Occidental dismissing a petition for the cancellation of a homestead patent.
<p>There is no dispute as to the main facts. It appears that on November 26, 
1956, the Director of Lands filed with the Court of First Instance of Negros 
Occidental a petition seeking to annul and cancel Homestead Patent No. V-28407 
covering a parcel of land identified as Lot No. 2644, portion of Lot No. 2290 of 
the Himamaylan Cadastre, that province. Named respondent in the petition was 
Lelita Jugado to whom the homestead patent was issued on May 4, 1954, and the 
ground relied upon was that the patent aforesaid was fraudulently issued in 
favor of said respondent because the land is covered by a prior and subsisting 
approved homestead application of one Conrada Villavera.</p>
<p>On October 25, 1957, the Philippine National Bank, claiming to be a mortgagee 
in good faith of the property subject of the petition, moved to intervene in the 
proceedings, and after its motion was granted, the said entity filed an answer. 
This was soon followed by a motion to dismiss filed by the same intervenor, 
alleging as ground therefor that inasmuch as the petition to cancel was filed on 
December 5, 1956, more than one year had already elapsed since the issuance of 
the patent and the certificate of title in favor of respondent, and that, 
therefore, the said title had already become perfect, absolute and 
indefeasible.</p>
<p>After the usual responsive pleadings had been filed by both parties, the 
trial court, finding merit in the intervenor's motion, issued an order 
dismissing the petition. From the order of dismissal, the Director of Lands has 
appealed to this Court insisting that the provision of law (section 38 of Act 
496), which limits to only one year the period within which to contest the 
validity of a certificate of title, is inapplicable in the instant case where a 
homestead patent is involved.</p>
<p>The main issue to be determined is whether or not the appellant's petition to 
cancel or annul Homestead Patent No. V-28407 issued to Lelita Jugado could 
prosper under the circumstances.</p>
<p>It has already been laid down as a doctrine in this jurisdiction that after 
the registration and issuance of the certificate and owner's duplicate 
certificate of title of a public land patent, the land covered thereby 
automatically comes under the operation of Act 496 and subject to all the 
safeguards provided therein (See El Hogar Filipino <i>vs</i>. Olviga, 60 Phil., 
17; Aquino <i>vs</i>. Director of Lands, 39 Phil., 850; Manalo <i>vs</i>. Lukban 
and Liwanag, 48 Phil., 973). Section 38 of Act 496, otherwise called the Land 
Registration Act, prohibits the raising of any question concerning the validity 
of a certificate of title after one year from entry of the decree of 
registration. And the period of one year has been construed, in the case of 
public land grants, to begin from the issuance of the patent (Sumail <i>vs</i>. 
C.F.I. of Cotabato, <i>infra</i>; Nelayan <i>vs</i>. Nelayan, 109 Phil., 183). 
It is not disputed that the patent in this case was issued way back in May, 
1954, and that the petition to have it annulled was filed only on December 5, 
1956, more than two years thereafter. Under the circumstances, therefore, the 
Director of Lands has no longer any right to contest the validity of the patent 
issued to Lelita Jugado. It may be well, in this connection, to quote the 
opinion of this Court in a similar case to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Well settled is the rule that once the patent is registered and the 
corresponding certificate of title is issued, the land ceases to be part of the 
public domain and becomes private property over which the Director of Lands has 
neither control nor jurisdiction. (Sumail <i>vs</i>. Judge of the Court of First 
Instance of Cotabato, et al., 96 Phil., 946; 51 Off. Gaz., [5] 2413; Republic 
<i>vs</i>. Heirs of Ciriaco Carle, 105 Phil., 1231. And a public land patent 
when registered, is a veritable torrens title (Dagdag <i>vs</i>. Nepomuceno, 105 
Phil., 216) and becomes indefeasible as a Torrens title (Ramoso <i>vs</i>. 
Obligado, 70 Phil., 86), upon the expiration of one year from the date of the 
issuance thereof (Lucas <i>vs</i>. Durian, G. R. No. L-7886, Sept. 23, 1957). As 
such it can no longer be cancelled and annulled." (Dir. of Lands <i>vs</i>. De 
Luna, G. R. No. L-14641, November 23, 1960).</p></blockquote>
<p>There is, however, a section in the Public Land Law (sec. 101 of Commonwealth 
Act 141), which affords a remedy whereby lands of the public domain fraudulently 
awarded may be recovered or reverted back to its original owner, the Government. 
But the provision requires that all such actions for reversion shall be 
instituted by the Solicitor General or the officer acting in his stead, in the 
proper courts, in the name of the Republic of the Philippines (See Director of 
Lands <i>vs</i>. De Luna, <i>supra</i>). As the party in interest in this case 
is the Director of Lands and not the Republic of the Philippines, the action 
cannot prosper in favor of the appellant.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the order appealed from is hereby affirmed, but 
without prejudice to the Government's right to institute the proper action for 
reversion. Without special pronouncement as to costs.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., 
Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Paredes, 
Dizon,</i> and <i>Natividad, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
