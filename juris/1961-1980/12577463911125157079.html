				G.R. No. L-16836, January 30, 1962</h4>
				<H3>J. M. TUASON & CO., INC., REPRESENTED BY ITS MANAGING PARTNER, THE GREGORIO ARANETA, INC., AND HON. NICASIO YATCO, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL (QUEZON CITY, BRANCH V) PETITIONERS, VS. BIENVENIDO SANVICTORES, RESPONDENT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Application for review of a decision of the Court of Appeals (Sixth 
Division), in its Case No. 26805-R, setting aside the orders of execution and 
demolition issued by the Court of First Instance of Quezon City in its Civil 
Case No. Q-3519, and ordering said Court to hold in abeyance such execution 
until final judgment is rendered in Civil Case No. 4809, pending before the 
same. We granted certiorari on July 26, 1960.
<p>The following facts appear of record: Respondent Bienvenido Sanvictores 
occupies, a portion of the so-called Tatalon Estate, of which petitioner J. M. 
Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. is the registered owner holding a Torrens certificate 
covering it Said portion is designated as Lot 49 of the Veteran's Subdivision 
plan, and appears to have been purchased in 1949 by Sanvictores from one Pedro 
Deudor, who claimed title to the estate as against the registered owners. 
Sanvictores had been in possession since then, and erected a house and made 
other improvements estimated at P20,000, more or less.</p>
<p>Litigation between the Tuasons, as registered owners, and Deudor culminated 
in a deed of compromise executed on March 16, 1953, wherein Deudor recognized the 
title of Tuason over the estate, and the latter agreed to pay certain 
compensation. The agreement expressly mentioned the rights of the previous 
vendees of Deudor, the latter agreeing to make them recognize the Tuason 
ownership and sign new contracts of purchase of their respective lots at the 
current prices and terms specified by the Tuasons in selling lots of their Sta. 
Mesa Heights Subdivision.</p>
<p>On November 20, 1958, Tuason &amp; Co. filed in the Court of First Instance 
an ejectment action (<i>accion publiciana</i>) against Sanvictores to reeover 
Lot 49 (Case No. Q-3519). After due trial, judgment was rendered on March 30, 
1959, declaring Sanvictores without right to the possession of the lot and 
ordering him to vacate.it. No appeal was taken, hence the judgment became final 
and executory. On July 29, 1959, a writ of execution was issued.</p>
<p>Upon motion of defendant (now respondent) Sanvictores, the Court of First 
Instance, by order dated September 26, 1959, suspended execution of its 
judgment, granting Sanvictores 60 days within whichâ€”
</p><blockquote>
<p>"to voluntarily remove his house and other constructions therefrom as well as 
to make proper negotiations with the plaintiff in connection therewith, after 
which period the correspondent writ of demolition will be accordingly 
issued."</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems that since May of 1959, Sanvictores had been bargaining for the 
purchase of Lot 49, but no contract was ever concluded because the parties could 
not agree as to the price. Wherefore, on November 20, 1950, six days before the 
suspension period expired, Sanvictores filed another case (Q-4809) in the same 
Courts asking that a fair and equitable price be fixed for Lot 49, and that 
Tuason &amp; Co. be compelled to convey the lot to him, as preferential 
purchaser under the Deudor-Tuason compromise of 1953. Five days later, the same 
party moved in the ejectment ease (No. Q3519) for indefinite suspension of the 
execution. This motion was denied on December 2, 1959. Thereupon, Sanvictores 
sought out a writ of certiorari in the Court of Appeals, and the latter, after 
due hearing, granted it as noted at the beginning of this opinion.</p>
<p>Not satisfied with the decision, Tuason &amp; Co. resorted to this Court.</p>
<p>We find the appeal meritorious.</p>
<p>Assuming, without deciding, that the Tuasons had really bound themselves to 
recognize the alleged preferential rights of the vendees of Deudor, it is more 
than remarkable that appellee Sanvictores, one of the vendees, did not take 
steps to enforce his supposed preference until after the adverse decision of the 
Court of First Instance in the possessory action had become final and executory 
in 1959, six years after the Deudor-Tuason compromise was made. This inaction of 
Sanvictores is all the more strange when we consider that he could have set up 
such preferential rights as a defense against the suit filed by appellant Tuason 
&amp; Company against him. If he really was entitled to purchase the contested 
lot, the claim was in the nature of a compulsory counterclaim under section 6 of 
Rule 10, since it was necessarily connected with the right of possession 
asserted by the Tuasons, and did not require the presence of third parties for 
its adjudication. Both under section 6 of Rule 10, as well as section 10 of 
Rule, 9, the failure to set up such rights resulted in a waiver thereof, and 
they became barred after the judgment in the possessory action became final. It 
was, therefore, error on the part of the Court of Appeals to consider that the 
determination of appellee's alleged preferential right constituted a prejudicial 
question to the execution of the final judgment of ouster against appellee.</p>
<p>And if it be considered that the action of Sanvictores to compel Tuason &amp; 
Company to sell him the lot is completely independent of the possessory action 
filed by the Tuasons, because it concerned title and not possession, then with 
greater reason will the pendency of the first action be irrelevant to the 
execution of the final judgment of ouster.</p>
<p>It is also worthy of note that the compromise between Deudor and Tuason, upon 
which Sanvictores predicates his right to buy the lot he occupies, has been 
validly rescinded and set aside, as recognized by this Court in its decision in 
Deudor vs. Tuason. 112 Phil., 63,. 59 Off. Gaz, 217,</p>
<p>Finally, no questions of fact were raised in connection with the execution of 
the final judgment of the Court of First Instance of Quezon City in G. R. No. 
Q-3519 of that Court. The only question was one of law, whether or not execution 
should be further suspended because of the pendency of Sanvictores' suit for 
specific performance (Case No. Q-4809). No appeal, therefore, could have been 
taken thereon to the Court of Appeals; and as the writs of certlorari, 
prohibition, etc. can only be issued by that Court <i>in aid</i> of its 
appellate jurisdiction, it becomes plain that the Court of Appeals had ho 
jurisdiction to entertain Sanvictores' petition for certiorari wherefore, the 
decision of the Court of Appeals, now under review, was null and void (Tuason 
&amp; Co,. Inc,. etc, vs. CA. and Republic vs. Tuason. et al,. both decided 
jointly and reported in 113 Phil,. 673. and cases therein cited),</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed 
and set aside. Costs against appellee, Bienvenido Sanvictores.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista, Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, 
Dizon, </i>and <i>De Leon, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
