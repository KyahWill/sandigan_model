				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The crux of this appeal lies in the question, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for purposes of discharge of a bondsman from
his liability under a bail bond, is it sufficient that he produces the accused
before the court for the promulgation of the judgment without need of his filing
a motion or verbally moving for discharge and without the court expressly
relieving the bondsman from further liability on his bond?</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Surety &amp; Insurance
Co. answers the query in the affirmative and avers that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
erred in holding the contrary and declaring it liable under its bail bond of
Twelve Thousand Pesos (P12,000.00) filed in Criminal Case No. 4066 of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts follow:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1963</st1:date>,
Elmo D. Celeste was charged with frustrated murder in an Information filed with
the <st1:place><st1:placename>Municipal</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Court</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename>of</st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
  de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A warrant for his arrest was issued and a
bail bond for his provisional release was fixed at P12,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused filed the required bond of
P12,000.00 with the <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Surety &amp; Insurance
Company as his bondsman, the bail bond having been approved on <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused waived his right to a preliminary
investigation and the record of the case was forwarded to the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental for trial on the merits.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After the trial was completed, the case was set for promulgation
of judgment and on <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1964</st1:date>,
the decision was read to the accused in open court whereby he was found guilty
and sentenced accordingly for the crime of frustrated homicide.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1964</st1:date>,
the accused, through counsel, filed a notice of appeal, hence, on the same date
the trial court issued an order fixing the bail bond on appeal at P12,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Because of the failure of the accused to file the required bail bond, the court
ordered the arrest of the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime the record of the case had been forwarded to the
Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="21" month="4">April 21, 1965</st1:date>, the Appellate Court
dismissed the appeal of accused Celeste for failure to file the appellant's
brief within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The case was then remanded to the trial court which set the promulgation
of the Resolution of the Court of Appeals sending notice thereof to the <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Surety as bondsman of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For non-appearance of the accused, the
Presiding Judge, Hon. Benjamin K. <span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span>, issued in
open court on <st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1965</st1:date>,
an order for the arrest of the defendant and the confiscation of his bail bond.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant herein in a motion dated <st1:date year="1965" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1965</st1:date>, moved for 30 days extension of time to
produce the accused in court and this was granted.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, another motion dated November 5, 1965, was filed
praying that the order of confiscation be lifted and that the bail bond be
cancelled and the bondsman released under said bond, alleging <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> that conscious of its undertaking under the
bond, <span class="SpellE">movant</span>-appellant notified and caused the
appearance of the accused in court for the reading of the sentence, that the
record shows that the judgment was promulgated in the presence of the accused
and consequently, the bonding company was relieved of its obligation, having
faithfully complied with its undertaking, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"NOW THEREFORE, the <span class="SpellE">RIZAL</span> SURETY

it may be tried, and will at all times hold himself/herself amenable to the

<p class="BODY">Appellant's foregoing motion was denied for lack of merit in an
order dated <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="11"><u>November 13, 1965</u></st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A second motion dated November 26, 1965, was filed praying for
another 30-day extension to produce the accused which was granted by the court
counted from November 27, 1965 with warning however of no further extension.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In a motion dated <st1:date year="1965" day="24" month="12">December
 24, 1965</st1:date>, appellant moved for a reconsideration of the <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="11">November 13, 1965</st1:date> order which denied
its motion to lift order of forfeiture, praying, in the alternative, for
another extension of 30 days within which to produce the accused counted from <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for reconsideration was denied in
an order dated <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="1"><u>January 5, 1966</u></st1:date>,
although the surety was given another extension of 30 days from <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1965</st1:date> to surrender the
accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this appeal from the Orders of <st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1965</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="11">Novem­ber 13, 1965</st1:date>, and <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant in its assignment of errors poses the following
questions:</p>

<blockquote>"1. <span style=""> </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Whether
or not it has fully complied with its undertaking under the bond;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. <span style=""> </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Whether
or not it has been relieved of its liability; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not its bail bond would still
answer for the presence of the accused before the Court for the promulgation of
the judgment of conviction rendered by the Court of Appeals." (pp. 6-7,
Appellant's brief)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant submits that
its liability under the bail bond extended "only up to the promulgation of
the judgment of conviction" and inasmuch as it had produced the accused in
court during the pro­mulgation, it is now relieved from its obligation under
the bond; that to hold otherwise would be to extend the liability of the surety
beyond that stipulated in the bail bond and to impose an additional obligation
to the bondsman, contrary to Article 1231 of the Civil Code which provides that
obligations are extinguished, among others, by payment or <u>performance</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's assertion is unfounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The very terms of the bail bond provide that
the surety undertakes that the accused will at all times hold himself amenable
to the order and processes of the court and <u>if convicted will appear for
judgment and render himself to the execution thereof</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Here, the criminal proceeding in the trial court consisted mainly
of three stages:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the trial, the
promulgation of judgment, and the execution of the sentence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The surety's liability covered all the three
stages - appearance of the accused at the trial, appearance during the
promulgation of judgment, and service by the accused of the sentence imposed
upon him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This undertaking of the surety
is derived from Section 2, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court which sets forth the
conditions of bail in criminal cases, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Condition
of the bail</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The condition of the
bail is that the defendant shall answer the complaint or information in the
court in which it is filed or to which it may be transferred for trial, and
after conviction, if the case is appealed to the Court of First Instance upon
application supported by an undertaking or bail, that he will surrender himself
in execution of such judgment as the appellate court may render, or that, in
case the cause is to be tried anew or remanded for a new trial, he will appear
in the court to which it may be remanded and submit himself to the orders and
processes thereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">2. To effect the discharge of appellant surety from its undertaking,
it was not enough that it produced the person of the accused at the time of
promulgation of the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Section
16, Rule 114 sets forth a procedure for discharge of sureties which was not
followed by herein </u><u><span style="">appellant</span></u><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the early case of <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Lorredo</span>,
1927</u>, the Court, speaking through Justice Antonio Villa-Real, explicitly
ruled that the mere presentation or presence of an accused in an open court is
not sufficient in itself to cause the discharge of a bond, for the attention of
the court must be called to his presence and the intention to surrender the
body of the accused must be clearly and definitely stated and understood by the
Court, and that a surety who desires to produce and surrender the body of the
accused is <u>not relieved from<span style="">&nbsp; </span>further
liability upon his bond until the court accepts said surrender</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The ruling in <span class="SpellE"><u>Lorredo</u></span> was
reiterated in <u>People vs. Valle</u>, <u>defendant, Alto Surety &amp; Insurance
Co., bondsman-appellant</u>, through then Justice, later Chief Justice, Roberto
<span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> where the Court stated <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> that the appellant surety's liability continued
until after the accused had been surrendered and <u>the court had ordered the
cancellation of its bond</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Again in <span class="SpellE"><u>Mabuhay</u></span><u> Insurance
&amp; Guaranty, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, et al</u>., the Court, this time
through Justice Claudio <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>, adhering to the
pronouncements made in <span class="SpellE"><u>Lorredo</u></span> and following
Sec. 16, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court, held that a bondsman who wishes to be
relieved from its undertaking <u>should petition the court for his discharge as
a surety</u>, and inasmuch as petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mabuhay</span> did
not avail itself of Sec. 16, Rule 114 and ask for its discharge as a surety nor
did it manifest to the trial court at the promulgation of sentence its wish to
be relieved of its responsibility for the custody of the accused, its liability
under the bond continued to exist.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The circumstances present in the instant case are not of course
exactly the same as those in <u>Valle</u> and <span class="SpellE"><u>Mabuhay</u></span>,
nonetheless, the princi­ples enunciated therein given above are equally
applicable to now appellant <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Surety who as
stated earlier did not petition the trial court that it be discharged from its
bond upon the appearance of the accused Celeste during the promulgation of the
court's decision for which reason there was no order of the court <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> said bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">3. It is the contention of appellant <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
Surety that when the accused Celeste filed on February 7, 1964, that is, seven
days after the promulgation of judgment, a notice of appeal, it was relieved
from its undertaking considering that the trial court ordered the accused to
file a new bond on appeal for P12,000.00, and that consequently there is no
legal basis for holding appellant liable for the non-appearance of the accused
at the promulgation of the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">At first blush there appears to be some merit to appellant's
plea, but again We cannot dissociate the situation from the <span class="SpellE"><u>Lorredo</u></span>
Decision to which We are bound to adhere based as it is on existing law and
authoritative jurisprudence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sureties in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Lorredo</u></span> case
were even in a more pathetic situation, We may say, than <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
Surety. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>There the accused was pre­sented
by the sureties in open court for the promulgation of the judgment and upon the
decision being read which imposed a fine of Fifty Pesos (P50.00) on the <span style="">accused, the l</span>atter's counsel offered
a guaranty that the accused would comply with the judgment within the period of
ten <span style="">days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Forthwith, the sureties filed a motion
stating that they were surrendering the body of the accused and asking that
they be relieved of all liability in connection with their bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record of the case did not show that
their motion was acted upon by the court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The 10-day period expired without the accused paying the fine as
promised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On motion of the fiscal the
trial court ordered the execution of the judgment, directed the sureties to
produce the body of the accused and at the same time issued warrants of
arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sureties then explained to
the court that they were relieved from their undertaking with the acceptance by
the court of the guaranty of the lawyer that the accused would comply with the
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This explanation was not found
satisfactory and an order of forfeiture of the bonds was issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal, this Court, as <span style="">earlier </span>indicated, sustained the
liability of the sureties, and We quote further from the decision as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"From what has been said it follows that the mere filing of a
motion stating the surrender of the person of the accused and asking for their
release from liability upon the obligation contracted by virtue of a bond for
temporary release, where it does not appear that the attention of the court had
been called to said surrender and that the latter had so understood it, and
without an express order accepting said surrender and relieving the sureties
from all <span style="">liability, does not relieve
them from </span>the same, notwithstanding the fact that the court granted the
accused the period of ten days within which to comply with the judgment under a
verbal guaranty of his attorney." (supra, p. 218)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Lorredo</u></span> the accused
promised to comply with the judgment in ten days, while in this case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Rizal</u></span><u> Surety</u>, the accused filed a notice of
appeal on the seventh day; in <span class="SpellE"><u>Lorredo</u></span> the
accused failed to comply within the promised period, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Rizal</u></span><u>
Surety</u> the accused failed to file a bond on appeal and his appeal was
eventually dismissed; in <span class="SpellE"><u>Lorredo</u></span>, the sureties
filed a motion to be discharged, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Rizal</u></span><u>
Surety</u> no such motion was ever filed by the sureties; in <span class="SpellE"><u>Lorredo</u></span>, the accused eventually appeared and paid
his fine, while in <span class="SpellE"><u>Rizal</u></span><u> Surety</u>, the
accused remains at large; in both, there was no court order <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span>
the bonds.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under these circumstances, We cannot but hold <span class="SpellE"><u>Rizal</u></span><u>
Surety</u> liable under its bond which through its own inaction it allowed to
remain <span class="SpellE">uncancelled</span> by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legal question posed at the opening of
this Decision calls therefore for a negative answer as correctly asserted by
the Solicitor General.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To restate, for a surety to be discharged it is necessary that he
petitions the court for relief from liability and that the court grants the
petition and cancels the bond.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, We find this appeal without merit and
We hereby affirm the appealed order of Hon. Benjamin K. <span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span>
