Workmen's Compensation Unit, a special ap­pearance and motion for
reconsideration, questioning the jurisdiction of respondent Workmen's
Compensation Unit over the petitioner on the ground that he never received
summons in WCU Case No. 12756, that he did not know he was a respondent in said
case, and that the lawyers who appeared in said case representing themselves as
appearing for petitioner were never hired by him because he did not know of the
existing case against him until a copy of the writ of execution in the already
decided case was served upon him in October of 1968, and thereby asking
respondent Workmen's Compensation Unit to set aside the decision in WCU Case

<blockquote>(7) That petitioner's special appearance and motion for
reconsideration was not acted upon and resolved by respondent Workmen's
Compensation Unit, and instead respondent Provincial Sheriff of Iloilo showed
his determination to enforce the writ of execution issued in WCU Case No.
12756, 'by levying upon the properties of petitioner and advertising the sale

and Carlos Cordova (Cordova as petitioner in this case denied that he hired
those lawyers to represent him and he did not know of the existence of WCU Case
No. 12756 at that time) filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision
which was denied by respondent Workmen's Compensation Unit in its order dated
August 10, 1968, on the ground that although at the rehearing granted only <span class="SpellE">Antero</span> <span class="SpellE">Edrosolano</span> appeared to
testify and petitioner Carlos Cordova did not appear (supporting petitioner's
allegation that <span style="">he did not know of WCU
Case No. 12756 at that time), and <span class="SpellE">Edrosolano</span>
testified that petitioner Carlos Cordova had nothing to do with the operation
of the "<span class="SpellE">Ame</span>" taxi, the respondent Workmen's
Compensation Unit believed that the deceased <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dejando</span> was really hired as driver by <span class="SpellE">Edrosolano</span>, and hence the motion for reconsideration was
denied and the decision of June 26, 1968 revived completely.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

petitioner filed Civil Case No. 7960, for injunction, with the Court of First
Instance of Iloilo on June 5, 1969 trying to stop the execution of the decision

of First Instance of Iloilo, Branch I (Judge <span class="SpellE">Emigdio</span>
V. <span class="SpellE">Nietes</span>), in its order dated March 9, 1970,
dismissed the petition on the ground that the Court of First instance did not

<p class="BODY">As to the principal issue of whether or not petitioner received
summons issued by the respondent Workmen's Compensation Unit in WCU Case No.
12756, a close scrutiny of the record of this case unmistakably shows a clear
preponderance of evidence in favor of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The summons issued by the respondent
Workmen's Compensation Unit, on <st1:date year="1967" day="11" month="4">April
 11, 1967</st1:date>, was directed to "Mr. <span class="SpellE">Antero</span>
<span class="SpellE">Edrosolano</span> and/or Carlos Cordova, c/o Atty. <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> Y. <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span>, <st1:address><st1:street><span class="SpellE">Isnart</span> Street</st1:street>, <st1:city>Iloilo</st1:city></st1:address>

It is immediately noticeable that such summons was not directed to the address
of petitioner Carlos Cordova, whose address ap­pearing in the Notice and Claim
For Compensation in <span style="">Death Cases,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> is "</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">La <span class="SpellE">Granja</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">La Paz</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">Iloilo</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This notice and claim was signed by private respondent <span class="SpellE">Roseminda</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Dejando</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
respondent <span class="SpellE">Dejando's</span> claim that on March 10, 1967, a
registered letter with registry receipt No. 14284 was sent by respondent Workmen's
Compensation Unit to petitioner at La <span class="SpellE">Granja</span>, La </span>Paz,
Iloilo, informing him of the notice for accident and sick­ness filed by
respondents <span class="SpellE">Dejandos</span> and that no employer's report of
accident was ever made by the petitioner, is of no moment to the issue of
failure to serve summons on the petitioner in WCU Case No. 12756, because there
certainly is a great difference between the Notice And Claim For Compensation
In Death Cases executed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Dejandos</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
and the summons issued on April 11, 1967 by respondent Workmen's Compensation
Unit in WCU Case No. 12756.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
That no employer's report of accident was ever made by petitioner is
understandable in view of his <span class="SpellE">unrefuted</span> claim that
"<span class="SpellE">Ame</span>" taxi company was owned by Manuel <span class="SpellE">Bellosillo</span> of Iloilo City since October 9, 1966,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
and at the time of the death of driver <span class="SpellE">Dejando</span> on
February 16, 1967, petitioner had never been the owner nor operator of the
"<span class="SpellE">Ame</span>" taxi, and, therefore, had never been
the employer of <span class="SpellE">Dejando</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, therefore, there is no evidence that
petitioner received the summons issued by the respondent Workmen's Compensation
Unit in WCU Case No. 12756, because the address given in the summons was that
of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span>, and not that of petitioner and petitioner
denied under oath that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span> was authorized to
represent him in WCU Case No. 12756.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Another convincing circumstance in the resolution of this issue is that
petitioner never appeared before the respondent Workmen's Compensation Unit, at
the original hearing, in Case No. 12756, and not even during the hearing that
was granted by respondent Workmen's Compensation Unit after a motion for
reconsideration of the decision promulgated in said case, when the respondent
Workmen's Compensation Unit in its order dated August 30, 1968, categorically
stated that petitioner never appeared and it was only <span class="SpellE">Antero</span>
<span class="SpellE">Edrosolano</span> who appeared and testified that petitioner
had nothing what<span style="">soever to do with the
operation of the "<span class="SpellE">Ame</span>" taxi.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We therefore hold that respondent Workmen's Compensation Unit
never acquired jurisdiction over the person of petitioner for failure to serve
the latter with the required summons.</p>

of the deceased taxi driver,</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Demetrio</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">Dejando</span>.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Cordova
was not the employer.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>He was a
silent partner.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Cordova was notified of the claim for workmen's compensation by
means of registered mail as shown in receipt No. 14284 dated <st1:date year="1967" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1967</st1:date> sent to his address at
<st1:city><st1:place>La <span class="SpellE">Granja</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
<st1:city><st1:place>La Paz</st1:place></st1:city>, <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>
(p. 91, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The summons addressed to his lawyer, <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span>
Y. <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span>, is apparently in conformity with the rule
that a notice of hearing may be sent to the party's counsel (Sec. 2, Rule 11 of
the Workmen's Compensation Commission).</p>

<p class="BODY">Cordova's payment of P450 as the undertaker's bill for the
funeral of the deceased driver (p. 16, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) may be
construed as an admission that he has some moral obligation in connection with
the death of the cab driver who, however, <u>was directly employed by his
partner, <span class="SpellE">Edrosolano</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems that there was no <span class="SpellE">privity</span> of contract between Cordova and the deceased
driver.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Hence, Cordova was not his employer and,
therefore, was not liable to pay workmen's compensation to his heirs who
entered into a compromise with the killer, Luis <span class="SpellE">Jimenea</span>,
by accepting from him P4<span class="GramE">,750</span> as settlement of the <span style="">criminal </span>case for homicide through
reckless imprudence against <span class="SpellE">Jimenea</span> (p. 19, Cordova's
brief herein).</p>
