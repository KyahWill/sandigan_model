				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from the judgment of the Court of First In­stance of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> in favor of plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 956.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 25, 1958, plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging that
defendants entered a portion of their land situated at San <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, made copra out of the coconuts gathered from
the land, and that, claiming to be owners thereof, the defendants refused to
vacate the land in spite of plaintiffs' demands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs prayed, among others, that they be
declared the lawful owners of the land; that defendants <span class="GramE">be</span>
ordered to vacate the pre­mises occupied by them and to pay plaintiffs P50.00
as monthly rental value for the use and occupation of the portion occupied by
the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants' answer
denied the material allegations of <span class="GramE">the</span> complaint, and,
as affirmative defense, alleged that they were the law­ful co-owners of the
land mentioned in the complaint, of which the portion occupied by them was
part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They prayed, among others, that
the complaint be dismissed and that plain­tiffs be ordered to respect their
ownership of the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">After plaintiffs had rested their case, defendants filed a motion
to dismiss on the ground of insufficiency of plaintiffs' evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court denied the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs then moved that defendants be
denied the right to present evidence on the ground that their motion to dismiss
did not contain a reservation of their right to present evidence in event their
motion would be denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the
parties had filed their res­pective memoranda, the court, in an order dated
July 15, 1959, denied plaintiffs' motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, before defendants could present their evidence, the court, on
July 28, 1959, revoked its order of July 15, 1959, and granted plaintiffs'
motion not to allow defendants to present evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 30, 19591 judgment was rendered by the court on
plaintiffs' evidence declaring one of the plaintiffs the ab­solute owner of the
land described in the complaint, and or­dering defendants to vacate the portion
of land occupied by them and to pay P30.00 as monthly rental value from July 1,
1951, until said portion was vacated by them, P300.00 as at­torney's fees, and
the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants appealed to the
Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said court, however,
certified the case to this Court on the ground that it involves only questions
of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants-appellants contend that the lower court erred in not
allowing them to present their evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The conten­tion is meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In Director of Lands vs. <span class="SpellE">Ceniza</span>, etc., et
al., G.R. No.</span> L-18527, June 29, 1963 (cited with approval in the recent
case of <span class="SpellE">Siayngco</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span>,
et al., G.R. <span class="GramE">No</span>. L-22506, February 28, 1969), in
setting aside the or­der of March 23, 1961 disallowing the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>
to submit his evidence after his motion to dismiss on the ground of insuffi­ciency
of petitioner's evidence had been denied, Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>,
speaking for the Court, said:</p>

<blockquote>"At the time the present controversy was be­ing ventilated,
the rule governing the subject-mat­ter, which was a clarification of the
doctrines on earlier cases (Arroyo vs. <span class="SpellE">Azur</span>, 76
Phil., 495, Ap­ril 13, 1946; Guido vs. <span class="SpellE">Castelo</span>,
L-1613, May 24, 1948, 81 Phil., 81; <span class="SpellE">Ocum</span> et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span>, et al., L-8018, Oct. 26, 1955; <span class="SpellE">Montelibano</span>,
et al, vs. <span class="SpellE">Ba­colod</span> Murcia, etc., L-15092, Sept. 29,
1962), was -</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘After the plaintiff has completed the presentation of his
evidence, the defendant without waiving his right to offer evidence in the
event the motion is not granted, may move for a dismissal on the ground that
upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, if the motion is granted and the
order of dismissal is re­versed on appeal, the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
loses his right to present evidence in his behalf.'</p>

<blockquote>This rule is now embodied in the Revised
Rules of Court, section 1, Rule 35, captioned Judgment and Demurrer to
Evidence, which will take effect on January 1, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore, evident that the respondent
court, in the case at bar, after denying the motion to dismiss, for
insufficiency of evidence, (demurrer to the evidence), should have permitted
the petitioner-defendant to pre­sent his own evidence, notwithstanding its
failure or omission to make a reservation to that effect; more so, as in this
particular case, when the petitioner-defendant had asked to be given a day in
court, in order to defend the government's title to a 78 hectare parcel of
land."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Rule 35, Revised Rules of Court, provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 1.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Effect of judgment on
demurrer to evidence</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- After
the plaintiff has completed the presentation of his evidence, the defendant
with­out waiving his right to offer evidence in the event the motion is not
granted, may move for a dismissal on the ground that upon the facts and the law
the plaintiff has shown no right to re­lief.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, if the motion is granted and the order of dismissal is reversed
on appeal, the <span class="SpellE">mov­ant</span> loses his right to present
evidence in his be­half."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Under this rule, what extinguishes
defendant's right to pre­sent evidence is the waiver or renunciation
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Re­servation by the defendant
of the right to present evidence is not necessary because the rule itself
reserves such right to the defendant.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the defendant moved to dismiss on the ground
of insufficient evidence but did not waive his right to present evidence in
event his motion would be de­nied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
therefore had the right to present his evidence after his motion to dismiss had
been denied, because the rule itself reserved his right to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not ne­cessary for him to make the
reservation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rationale of Rule 35, Revised Rules of Court, is given in <span class="SpellE">Siayngco</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span>,
et al., <u>supra</u>, where this Court, speaking thru Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>, said:</p>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rationale behind the rule and doctrine is
simple and logical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant is
permitted, without waiving his right to offer evidence in the event that his
motion is not granted, to move for a dismissal (i.e. demur to the plaintiff's
evidence) on the ground that upon the facts as thus estab­lished and the
applicable law, the plaintiff has shown no right to relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the trial court <u>de­nies</u> the
dismissal motion, i.e., finds that plain­tiff's evidence is sufficient for an
award of judg­ment in the absence of contrary evidence, the case still remains
before the trial court which should then proceed to hear and receive the defendant's
evidence so that all the facts and evidence of the contending parties may be
properly placed before it for adjudication as well as before the appel­late
courts, in case of appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing is
lost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This doctrine is but in line with
the established procedural precepts in the conduct of trials that the trial
court liberally receive all <span class="SpellE">proferred</span> evidence at the
trial to enable it to render its decision with all possibly relevant proofs in
the record, thus assuring that the appellate courts upon appeal have all the
material before them ne­cessary to make a correct judgment, and avoiding the
need of remanding the case for retrial or reception of improperly excluded
evidence, with the possibility thereafter of still another appeal, with all the
<span class="SpellE">concommitant</span> delays.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rule, however, im­poses the condition by the same token that if his
demurrer is <u>granted</u> by the trial court, and the order of dismissal is <u>reversed
on appeal</u>, the <span class="SpellE">mov­ant</span> loses his right to present
evidence in his be­half and he shall have been deemed to have elected to stand
on the insufficiency of plaintiff's case and evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such event, the appellate court which
reverses the order of dismissal shall pro­ceed to render judgment on the merits
of plain­tiff's evidence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Simply restated, a defendant who presents a demurrer to
plaintiff's evidence retains the right to present his own evidence, <u>if the
trial court disagrees</u> with him; but if <u>the trial court agrees</u> with
him, and on appeal, <u>the appellate court disagrees</u> with both of them and
reverses the dismis­sal order, he has lost the right to present his own
evidence."</blockquote>
