<p class="BODY"><span style="">As early as in 1956, a
great number of inmates confined in the national penitentiary at <span class="SpellE">Muntinglupa</span> arrayed themselves into two warring gangs, the
"<span class="SpellE">Sigue-Sigue</span>" and the "OXO," the
former composed predominantly of <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span> inmates, the
latter comprised mainly of</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">prisoners from the <span class="SpellE">Visayas</span>
and </span><st1:place><span style="">Mindanao</span></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since then the prison compound has been rocked time and time again by
bloody riots resulting in the death of many of their members and suspec­ted
sympathizers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an effort to avert
violent clashes between the contending groups, prison officials segregated
known members of the "<span class="SpellE">Sigue-Sigue</span>" from
those of the "OXO." Building 1 housed "<span class="SpellE">Sigue-Sigue</span>"
members, while a majority of the prisoners confined in Bldg. 4 belonged to the
"OXO." Even in Bldg. 4, which is com­posed of four brigades, namely,
4-A and 4-B (upper floor) and 4-C and 4-D (first floor), inmates from <span class="SpellE">Visayas</span> and Mindanao, from whom the "OXO" drew
most of its members, were confined in 4-A.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It was at about 7:00 a.
m. on February 16, 1958, while the inmates of the penitentiary were preparing
to attend Sunday mass, that a fight between two rival members of the "<span class="SpellE">Sigue-Sigue</span>" and "OXO" gangs occurred in the
</span><u>plaza</u> <span style="">where the prisoners
were assembled, causing a big commotion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fight was, however, quelled, and those involved were led away for
investigation, while the rest of the prisoners were ordered to return to their
respective quarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hardly had
conditions returned to normal when a riot broke out in Bldg. 1, a known lair of
the "<span class="SpellE">Sigue-Sigue</span>." The inmates thereof
tried to invade Bldg. 4, where many members and sympathizers of the
"OXO" gang were confined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
timely arri­val of the guards forced the invading inmates to retreat and return
to Bldg. 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moments later, another riot
erupted in Bldg. 4, as </span>the inmates of brigade 4-A destroyed the lock of
their door and then<span style=""> rampaged from one
brigade to another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The invading
prisoners from 4-A mostly “OXO” mem</span><span style="">bers
</span><span style="">and sympathizers, clubbed and
stabbed to death Jose <span class="SpellE">Carriego</span> an inmate of 4-B.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, they forcibly opened the door of
4-C, and killed two more inmates, namely, <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Barbosa</span> and Santos Cruz.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Rom</span><span style="">eo</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">Pineda, an inmate and first quarter-in-charge of brigade 4-B, testified
that while he was taking his breakfast with Jose <span class="SpellE">Carriego</span>,
who was at the time the representative of the prisoners confined in 4-B to the
inmate <span class="SpellE">carcel</span>, he "suddenly heard
commotion" near the door of their brigade; that his fellow prisoners
started shouting "<span class="SpellE">pinapasok</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span>
<span class="SpellE">tayo</span>," as the invading inmates from brigade 4-A
stampeded into 4-B; that he and <span class="SpellE">Carriego</span> t</span><span style="">ook</span><span style=""> held of their clubs and stood at the end of
the passageway; that he saw <span class="SpellE">Carriego</span> surrender his
club to </span><span style="">An</span><span style="">dres <span class="SpellE">Factora</span>, an
"OXO" member from 4-A; that as <span class="SpellE">Carriego</span> started
to walk away, <span class="SpellE">Factora</span> clubbed <span class="SpellE">Carriego</span>
on the nape causing the latter to fall; that <span class="SpellE">Factora</span>
turned up the face of his fallen victim and struck him again in the face; that
while <span class="SpellE">Carriego</span> was in this prostrate position, <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> Peralta and Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Dosal</span>,
</span><span style="">c</span><span style="">ompanions </span><span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Factora</span>, re­peatedly
stabbed him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The testimony of Pineda
was corroborated in all its </span><span style="">mate</span><span style="">rial
points by <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Marayoc</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sauza</span>, both
inmates </span><span style="">of 4-B.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These two prosecution witnesses identified <span class="SpellE">Factora</span>, Pe­ralta and <span class="SpellE">Dosal</span> as
the assailants of <span class="SpellE">Carriego</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">From 4-B, the invading inmates of 4-A went down and for­cibly
entered 4-C.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Oscar <span class="SpellE">Fontillas</span>, an inmate of 4-C, he saw the prisoners from 4-A
rushing toward their brigade; that among the invading inmates who forced open
the door of 4-C, with help from the inside provided by <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span>
prisoners confined in 4-C, were <span class="SpellE">Factora</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dosal</span>, Angel <span class="SpellE">Parumog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gervasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Larita</span>, Ernesto
Fernandez and <span style="">Jose </span><span class="SpellE">Tariman</span>; that he saw <span class="SpellE">Factora</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lari­ta</span> and Fernandez kill <span class="SpellE">Barbosa</span>,
while the rest of their companions instructed the <span class="SpellE">Visayans</span>
to leave their cell and ordered the "Manil<span style="">a boys" (<span class="SpellE">Tagalogs</span>) to remain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonio <span class="SpellE">Pabarlan</span>,
another inmate of 4-C, declared that he saw Peralta stab <span class="SpellE">Barbosa</span>,
as <span class="SpellE">Dosal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Larita</span>, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Luna, <span class="SpellE">Parumog</span> and <span class="SpellE">Factora</span> clubbed the hapless victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another inmate of 4-C, Jose <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>, not only corroborated the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Fontillas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pabarlan</span> but as
well added grim details.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared
that while <span class="SpellE">Barbosa</span> was trying to hide under a cot, he
</span><span style="">was </span><span style="">beaten and stabbed to death by <span class="SpellE">Dosal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Parumog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Fac­tora</span> and Fernandez, with Luna, <span class="SpellE">Larita</span>,
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Cogol</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eilel</span> <span class="SpellE">Tugaya</span> standing guard, armed with clubs and sharp
instruments, in readiness to repel any intervention from the <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span> inmates.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Carlos <span class="SpellE">Espino</span>, also confined in 4-C, declared
that he saw <span class="SpellE">Paru­mog</span>, Peralta, <span class="SpellE">Factora</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Larita</span> assault and kill <span class="SpellE">Barbosa</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The same witnesses for the prosecution testified that after
killing <span class="SpellE">Barbosa</span>, the invading "OXO" members
and sympathizers proceeded to hunt for Santos Cruz, another <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>
like <span class="SpellE">Carriego</span> and <span class="SpellE">Barbosa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Halili</span> testified
that he saw Peralta, <span class="SpellE">Larita</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cogol</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Tugaya</span> take Santos Cruz to 4-A from 4-C; that
Santos Cruz knelt down and pleaded for his life, saying, "<span class="SpellE">Maawa</span> kayo <span class="SpellE">sa</span> akin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Marami</span> <span class="SpellE">akong</span> <span class="SpellE">anak</span>;" that Luna and
Peralta were unmoved as they stabbed Santos Cruz to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pabarlan</span> declared
that after the death of <span class="SpellE">Barbosa</span>, Santos Cruz was
brought to 4-A by the in­vading inmates but Cruz was able to slip back to his
cell only to be recaptured by <span class="SpellE">Factora</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dosal</span> and Luna and brought to near the fire escape where he
was clubbed and stabbed to death by <span class="SpellE">Paru­mog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dosal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Factora</span> and Peralta.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fontillas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Espino</span> corrobo­rated the declarations of <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pabarlan</span> with respect
to the killing of Santos Cruz, and both mentioned <span class="SpellE">Larita</span>
as one of the assailants of Cruz.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial judge summarized the evidence for the prosecution,
thus:</p>

<blockquote>“. . . <span class="GramE">it</span> clearly appears that the three
killings in question were an offshoot of the rival<span style="">ry </span>between the two organizations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All those who were killed, namely, <span class="SpellE">Barbosa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Carriego</span> and Sant<span style="">os <span style="">Cruz, </span></span>were <span class="SpellE">Tagalogs</span>
and well known as members if not sympathizers of the <span class="SpellE">Sigue</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sigue</span>, <span style="">while </span>the
accused so charged with their killing were <span style="">mostly members if not sympathizers of the <span class="SpellE">Oxo</span>
organization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These three killings were
sparked by the commotion that happened in the plaza between </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="8"><span style="">8:00</span></st1:time><span style=""> and </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="9"><span style="">9:00</span></st1:time><span style=""> in the morning, while the prisoners were
preparing to go <span style="">the mass</span></span><span style="">. . . .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">evident that the clash that occurred in the plaza </span>produced a
chain reaction among the members and <span style="">followers
of </span>the two organizations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
inmates of <span style="">B</span>uilding No. 1, <span style="">known</span> lair of the <span class="SpellE">Sigue</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sigues</span>, bolted the door of their cells and tried to
invade Building No. 4 where a big number of the <span class="SpellE">Oxo</span>
members and their sympathizers were confined, but, however, were forced <span style="">too by </span>the timely arrival of <span style="">the guards who sent </span>them back to their
building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the members of the <span class="SpellE">Oxo</span><span style=""> in </span>Building
No. 4 learned about this, they went on a rampage looking for memb<span style="">ers of the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sigue</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Sigue</span> or their sympathizers who </span>were
confined with them in the same building.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the <span style="">evidenc</span>e of the
prosecution shows, the accused <span class="GramE"><span style="">who</span></span><span style=""> were confined
in Brigade 4-A of Building No. 4 led the attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They destroyed the lock of their dormitories
and with the help of their companions succeeded in bolting the door of the
different brigades, and once they succeeded in bolting the doors of the
different brigades, they went inside and tried to segregate the <span class="SpellE">Tagalogs</span> from their group; that as</span><span style=""> </span>soon as they discovered their enemies
they clubbed and stabbed them to death. . . .”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Admitting that he was</span><span style=""> one among</span><span style=""> several who killed Jose <span class="SpellE">Carriego</span>, Peralta
nevertheless claims self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
testified that on the morning of the riot he as attacked by <span class="SpellE">Carriego</span>
and</span><span style=""> J</span><span style="">uan <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> near
the door of 4-A while he was returning to his brigade from the chapel with some
companions; that <span class="SpellE">Carriego</span> clubbed him on the head;
that he was able to parry <span style="">the </span>second
blow of and then succeeded in squeezing <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Carriego's</span></span><span style=""> </span>a head with his bands; that forthwith
he whipped out </span><span style="">an </span><span style="">improvised ice pie and stabbed <span class="SpellE">Carriego</span> several times; that when he (Peralta) was already
dizzy due to <span style="">the head </span>wound he
sustained from the clubbing, <span class="SpellE">Carriego</span> man</span><span style="">aged </span><span style="">to slip away; that he then became unconscious, and when he regained
consciousness he found himself on a<span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>tarima</u></span>, with </span>his head bandaged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Peralta's declarations do
not inspire belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The impres­sive
array of prosecution witnesses who saw him actively participate in the killing
of the three victims pointed to him as the ag­gressor, not the aggrieved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pineda, <span class="SpellE">Marayoc</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Sauza</span> positively identified him as one of the
assailants of Carriego.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the <span style="">pretensions </span>of Peralta, <span class="SpellE">Carriego</span>, an alleged "<span class="SpellE">Sigue-Sigue</span>"
member, would not have attacked him, knowing fully well that Building No. 4 was
an "OXO" lair where the "<span class="SpellE">Sigue-Sigue</span>"
mem­bers were outnumbered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anent the
killing of <span class="SpellE">Barbosa</span> and Santos Cruz, Peralta failed to
offer any explicit defense to rebut the <span class="SpellE">in­culpatory</span>
declarations of prosecution witnesses <span class="SpellE">Pabarlan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Espino</span> who saw him participate in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Barbosa</span> and those of <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>, <span class="SpellE">Fontillas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Espino</span> who
identified him as one of the murderers of Santos Cruz.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Dosal</span> stated
that he killed Santos Cruz, but also claims self-defense in exculpation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared that Santos Cruz, Jose <span class="SpellE">Carriego</span>, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Espino</span>, Carlos <span class="SpellE">Espino</span> and Oscar <span class="SpellE">Fontillas</span> invaded 4-A where he was confined; that a
free-for-all forthwith ensued; that he then heard Santos Cruz call Carlos <span class="SpellE">Espino</span>, and advise the latter to go away as "I will be
the one to kill that person (<span class="SpellE">Dosal</span>);" that with
a sharp instrument, Cruz hit him on the head and then on the nose; that as Cruz
was about to hit him again, he got hold of<span style="">
</span>his ice pick and stabbed Cruz repeatedly until the latter fell.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Dosal's</span> avowal is clearly belied by the
positive testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Pabarlan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Espino</span> who saw him participate in the kill­ing of
Santos Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it is true that <span class="SpellE">Dosal</span> killed Santos Cruz in self-defense when the latter
together with his companions supposed­ly invaded <span class="SpellE">Dosal's</span>
brigade (4-A), why is it that the body of Santos Cruz was found at the fire
escape near the <span class="SpellE"><u>pasillo</u></span> between 4-C and 4-D of
the first floor of Bldg. 1 instead of in 4-A which is located in the upper
floor?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Dosal</span>
failed to explain why he was seen in 4-C, which he does not deny, since he was
an inmate of 4-A where he was allegedly attacked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the murder of <span class="SpellE">Carriego</span> and <span class="SpellE">Barbosa</span> with which <span class="SpellE">Dosal</span> was also charged, he did not offer any evidence in
his behalf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the testimonies <span style="">of </span>Pineda, <span class="SpellE">Marayoc</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Sauza</span> identifying him as one of the killers of <span class="SpellE">Carriego</span>, and those of <span class="SpellE">Pabarlan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> and <span class="SpellE">Espino</span> implicating him
in the death of Santos Cruz, stand <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Andres <span class="SpellE">Factora</span> declared that he clubbed
<span class="SpellE">Carriego</span> and San­tos Cruz under compulsion of his
co-accused who threatened to kill him if he disobeyed their order; that he did
not hit <span class="SpellE">Barbosa</span> anymore because the latter was
already dead; that it was his co-<span style="">accused
who actually killed the three victims.<span style="">&nbsp;

corresponding to the several violations of law should be imposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conviction for multiple felonies demands the
imposition of multiple penalties.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two conceptual exceptions to the foregoing rule are the
complex crime under article 48 of the Revised Penal Code and the special complex
crime (like robbery with homicide).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anent an or­dinary complex crime falling under article 48, regardless of
the multiplicity of offenses committed, there is only one imposable pe­nalty -
the penalty for the most serious offense applied in its ma­ximum period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, in special complex crimes, there
is but a single penalty prescribed by law notwithstanding the number of
separate felonies committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For

of the charges made in the information, <u>they can be found guilty thereof and

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The legal and statutory
justification advanced by the majo­rity in <span class="SpellE"><u>Balaba</u></span>
for imposing all the penalties (two deaths and one life imprisonment)
corresponding to the offense charged and proved was article 87 of the old Penal
Code which provided:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"When a person is found guilty of two or more felonies or
misdemeanors, all the penal­ties corresponding to the several violations of law
shall be imposed, the same to be simulta­neously served, if possible, according
to the na­ture and effects of such penalties, "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE"><span style="">in</span></span><span style=""> relation to
article 88 of the old Code which read:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"When all or any of the penalties corres­ponding to the
several violations of the law, can not be simultaneously executed, the
following rules shall be observed with regard thereto:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the imposition
of the penalties, the order of their respective severity shall be fol­lowed so
that they may be executed successively or as nearly as may be possible, should
a pardon have been granted as to the penalty or penalties first imposed, or
should they have been served out."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The essence and language, with some alterations in form and in
the words used by reason of style, of the <span class="SpellE">abovecited</span>
provi­sions have been preserved in article 70 of the Revised Penal Code which
is the product of the merger of articles 87 and 88 of the old Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 70 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"When the culprit has to serve two or more penalties, he shall
serve them simultaneously if the nature of the penalties will so permit;
otherwise, the following rules shall be observed:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the imposition of the penalties, the order of their
respective severity shall be followed<span style="">
so that they may be executed successively or as </span>nearly as may be
possible, should a pardon have been granted as to the penalty or penalties
first imposed, or should they have been served out."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Although article 70 does not specifically command, as the former
article 87 clearly did, that "all the penalties correspond­ing to the
several violations of law shall be imposed," it is unmis­takable, however,
that article 70 presupposes that courts have the power to impose multiple
penalties, which multiple penal sanctions should be served either
simultaneously or successively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This pre­sumption
of the existence of judicial power to impose all the penalties<span style=""> corresponding to the number and nature of
the offenses charged and </span><span style="">proved </span><span style="">is manifest in the opening sentence of
article 70:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<u>When the culprit </u></span><u><span style="">to serve </span></u><u><span style="">or more penalties</span></u><span style="">, he shall serve them simultaneously if the
nature of the penalties will so permit. . ." (Underscoring supplied)
Obviously, the two or more penalties which the culprit has to serve are those
legally imposed by the proper court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Another reference to the said judicial prerogative is found in the
second paragraph of article 70 which provides that "in the <u>imposition</u>
of the <u>penalties</u>, the order of their respective severity shall be
followed. . ." Even without the authority provided by article 70, courts
can still impose as many penalties as there are separate and distinct offenses
committed, since for every indivi­dual crime committed, a corresponding penalty
is prescribed by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each single crime
is an outrage against the State for which the latter, thru the courts of
justice, has the power to impose the appropriate penal sanctions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the imposition of multiple death penalties, there
is no statutory prohibition or jurisprudential injunction against it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, article 70 of the Revised
Penal Code presumes that courts have the power to mete out multiple penal­ties
without distinction as to the nature and severity of the penal­ties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, our jurisprudence supports the
imposition of multiple death penalties as initially advocated in <span class="SpellE"><u>Balaba</u></span> and thun­derously reechoed in <u>Salazar</u>
where the accused was sentenced on appeal to thirteen (13) death
penalties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Significantly, the Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Balaba</u></span> imposed upon the single accused mixed
multiple penal­ties of two deaths and one life imprisonment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The imposition of multiple death penalties is decried by some as
a useless formality, an exercise in futility.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is conten­ded, undeniably enough, that a death convict, like all
mortals, has only one life to forfeit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And because of this physiological and bio­logical attribute of man, it
is reasoned that the imposition of mul­tiple death penalties is impractical and
futile because after the ser<span style="">vice of one
capital penalty, the execution of the rest of the death pe</span>nalties will
naturally be rendered impossible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
foregoing op­position to the multiple imposition of death penalties suffers
from four basic flaws:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) it fails to
consider the legality of imposing multiple capital penalties; (2) it fails to
distinguish between impo­sition of penalty and service of sentence; (3) it
ignores the fact that multiple death sentences could be served simultaneously;
and (4) it overlooks the practical merits of imposing multiple death penalties.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span><u><span style="">imposition</span></u><u><span style=""> of </span></u><u><span style="">a penalty</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">and <u>the service of a sentence</u> </span>are
two distinct, though related, concepts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The imposition of the proper penalty or penalties <span style="">is </span>determined
by the nature, gravity and number of offenses charged and proved, whereas
service of sentence is determined by the severity and character of the penal­ty
or penalties imposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the imposition
of the proper penalty or penalties, the court does not concern itself with the
possibility or practicality of the service of the sentence, since actual
service is a contingency subject to varied factors like successful escape of
the convict, grant of executive clemency or natural death of the prisoner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that go into the imposition of the proper
penalty or<span style=""> penalties, to reiterate, are
the nature, gravity and number of the offenses charged and proved and the
corresponding penalties pres</span>cribed by law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Multiple death penalties
are not impossible to serve be­cause they will have to be executed
simultaneously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A cursory reading of
article 70 will show that there are only two modes of serving two or more
(multiple) penalties:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>simultaneously</u>
or <u>successively</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first rule
is that two or more penalties shall be served simultaneously if the nature of
the penalties will so permit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
case of multiple capital penalties, the nature of said penal sanctions does not
only permit but actually necessitates simulta­neous service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The imposition of
multiple death penalties, far from being </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">useless formality, has practical importance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sentencing of an accused to several
capital penalties is an indelible badge of his extreme criminal perversity, which
may not be accurately projected by the imposition of only one death sentence
irrespective of the number of capital felonies for which he is liable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Showing thus the reprehensible character of
the convict in its real dimensions, the possibility of a grant of executive
clemency is justifiably reduced in no small measure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the imposition of multiple death
penalties could effectively serve as a deterrent to an improvident grant of
pardon or commutation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Faced with the utter
delinquency of such a convict, the proper penitentiary authorities would
exercise judicious restraint in recommending clemency or leniency in his
behalf.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Granting, however, that the
Chief Executive, in the exercise of his constitutional power to pardon (one of
the presidential prerogatives which is almost absolute) deems it proper to commute
the multiple death penalties to multiple life imprisonments, then the practical
effect is that the convict has to serve the maximum of forty (40) years of multiple
life sentences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If only one death
penalty is imposed, and then is commuted to life imprisonment, the convict will
have to serve a maximum of only thirty years corresponding to a single life
sentence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

following incisive Observations of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> in this
respect:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Although, there is no direct evidence of conspiracy, the
Court can safely say that there are several circumstances to show that the
crime committed by the accused was planned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fol<span style="">lowing circumstances show
beyond any doubt the acts of conspiracy:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>First</u>, all those who were killed, <span class="SpellE">Barbosa</span>,
Santos Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Carriego</span>, were <span class="SpellE">Tagalogs</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although there were many <span class="SpellE">Tagalogs</span>
like them confined in Building 4, these three were singled out and killed
thereby showing that their killing has been planned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Second</u>, the accused were all armed
with</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">improvised weapons showing that they really
prepared for the occasion; <u>third</u>, <u>the accused accomplished the
killing with team work precision going </u></span><u><span style="">from on</span></u><u><span style="">e </span></u><u><span style="">bri</span></u><u><span style="">g</span></u><u><span style="">ad</span></u><u><span style="">e</span></u><u><span style=""> to an</span></u><u><span style="">other</span></u><u><span style=""> </span></u><u><span style="">and attacking the same men whom they have previously marked for
liquidation and lastly</span></u><span style="">, <u>almost
the </u></span><u><span style="">same p</span></u><u><span style="">eople took part in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Carriego</span></span></u><span style="">,
<span class="SpellE"><u>Barbosa</u></span><u> and Santos Cruz</u>."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">It
is also important to note that all the accused were inmates of brigade 4-A;
that all were from either the <span class="SpellE">Visayas</span> or Mindanao

they are equally guilty and collectively liable for <span style="">in conspiracy the act of one is the act of all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not indispensa­ble that a
co-conspirator should take a direct part in every act and should know the part
which the others have to perform.<span style="">&nbsp;

the method, time and means of executing the crime, the existence of evident
premeditation can be taken for granted.<span style="">&nbsp;

crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no proof how and when
the plan to kill <span class="SpellE">Melanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balancio</span>
was hatched, or what time elapsed before it was carried out; we are, there­fore,
unable to determine if the appellants enjoyed ‘sufficient time between its
inception and its ful­fillment dispassionately to consider and accept the
consequences.’ (cf. People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bangug</span>, 52 Phil. 91).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, there <span style="">is </span>no showing of the op<span style="">portunity
for reflection and the persistence in the criminal intent that <span class="GramE">characterize</span> the aggravating circumstance of evident
