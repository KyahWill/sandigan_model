				<H3>ESPERANZA ESPIRITU AND ANTONIA APOSTOL, PETITIONERS, VS. FRANCISCO VALERIO, RESPONDENT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Appeal taken by Esperanza <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> and her daughter, Antonia <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span>,
from the decision of the Court of Appeals affirming the one rendered by the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> in Civil Case
No. 13293 declaring <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Valerio</span>, to be the owner of the land described in his
complaint and enjoining defendants from molesting him in the peaceful
possession thereof.<o:p></o:p><p></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On September 15, 1955 <span class="SpellE">Valerio</span> filed an action to quiet title in the above
mentioned Court against appellants, alleging in his complaint that he was the
owner of a parcel of unregistered land containing an area of approximately
8,573 square meters situated in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Olo</span>,
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Mangatarem</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
and more particularly described in paragraph two thereof, having acquired the
same from the former owner, <span class="SpellE">Pelagia</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span>, as evidenced by a deed of sale executed by the
latter in his favor oh January 31, 1955 (Exhibit A); that appellants had been
asserting adversary rights over said land and disturbing his possession
thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellants' answer denied the
material allegations of the complaint and alleged, as affirmative defense, that
they were the owners of the land in question, having acquired it by inheritance
from the late Santiago <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span>, husband and father of
appellants <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> and <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span>,
respectively; that said deceased bought the property from Mariano <span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span> on June 3, 1934, as evidenced by the deed of sale
Exhibit 2, who, in turn, had acquired it from his niece, <span class="SpellE">Pelagia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span>, on May 26, 1932, by virtue of the deed of
sale Exhibit 1.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The present appeal depends entirely
upon the validity of the Deed of Sale Exhibit 1 allegedly executed by <span class="SpellE">Pelagia</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span> in favor of
Mariano <span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span>, and of the Deed of Sale Exhibit 2
allegedly executed by the latter in favor of Santiago <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span>.
If both are valid, appellants' contention that they have a better right than
that claimed by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> would seem to be meritorious
in the light of the facts of the case and the provisions of Article 1544 of the
New Civil Code, it not being disputed that the Deed of Sale in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was registered under the provisions of Act 3344 on
June 16, 1955, while Exhibits 1 and 2 were similarly registered eleven days
before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Regarding the genuineness of the
questioned documents, however, the Court of Appeals found as follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Upon motion of plaintiff, the
Court ordered the defendants to produce, for examination and inspection by
plaintiff, the two documents referred to. The plaintiff, after examining and
inspecting said documents, filed, on June 22, 1956, a supplemental complaint
alleging that the document dated May 26, 1932, ‘is fictitious and
a falsification,' and that the private document of June 3, 1934 is likewise
null and void, being without line necessary normal requisites, aside to its
being fictitious and the fact that the alleged vendor acquired no right whatsoever
in the land.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In view of these conflicting
claims of the plaintiff and the defendants, the trial court correctly stated,
'apparently, this case concerns the sales of one parcel of land by the same
vendor out in favor of two different vendees. If these were the only issues in
this case, there is no question that under Art 1544 of the New Civil Code,
Exhibit '1' would be considered to be effective as against Exhibit 'A', it
having been registered prior to Exhibit 'A'. But this is not the only question
at issue. Over and above the application of Art 1544 of the New Civil Code is
the determination of whether or not Exhibits '1’ and '2' have been falsified.
Having arrived at the conclusion that the two exhibits just mentioned had been
falsified, the trial court rendered decision on July 25, 1956, 'adjudging
ownership of the land described in the complaint in favor of the plaintiff and
hereby permanently and definitely enjoins the defendants to abstain and desist
from disturbing and molesting the plaintiff from the peaceful enjoyment and
possession of the parcel of land described in the complaint or in any way to
interfere personally or by agents in the said peaceful possession by the
plaintiff of the land in litigation; the defendants are hereby further ordered
to pay the costs of this suit.' "<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"It is principally contended
fey defendants-appellants that the trial court erred in deciding the case in
favor of the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and against
defendants-appellants, based upon the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Pelagia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span> and Mariano <span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span>;
the first, emphatically denying that she sold the land in question to Mariano <span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span>, and that she appeared before Notary Public <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Pine before whom the '<span class="SpellE">Escritura</span> de <span class="SpellE">Compraventa</span> <span class="SpellE">Definita</span>', Exhibit 1. was allegedly ratified; and the
second, denying that he bought the said land from <span class="SpellE">Pelagia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span>, and that he sold the same to Santiago <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span> as recited in '<span class="SpellE">Recivo</span>',
Exhibit 2. In giving credence to the testimony of the aforementioned two
witnesses, the trial court said: 'An examination of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'1' reveals the glaring fact that it cannot be determined whose <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> is the one appearing on said <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'1’ for the simple reason that it immediately precedes the name <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span> but it is under
the name <span class="SpellE">Pelagia</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span>.
Ordinarily, this <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> would be considered as the
<span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> of <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span> and not of <span class="SpellE">Pelagia</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span>. While the Judge presiding this Court does not
claim any knowledge of finger print, it is, however, apparent that the <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> appearing in <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. '1'
is different from the <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> appearing in <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'X’. Furthermore, it is also very clear' that
the one who wrote the name <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span> is the very one who wrote the name <span class="SpellE">Pelagia</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span>; and from said
Exh.'1' it is apparent also that <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span> could not have written the name <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span> in <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. ‘1'
for the simple reason that it has been certified by the Notary Public that said
<span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span> is
physically incapable (<span class="SpellE">inutil</span> <span class="SpellE">physicamente</span>)
and the other factor which leads this Court to believe that <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'1' has been falsified is the' apparent difference of the ink used in writing
the names of <span class="SpellE">Pelagia</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span> from
the ink used by the other persona who signed in <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'1' and the apparent fact that the names <span class="SpellE">Pelagia</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span> must have been written in a much later date than
the other names appearing in said <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">'1’. With respect to <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
'2', the denial of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span> as to his having
purchased the land in question from <span class="SpellE">Pelagia</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span> is enough for this Court to disregard <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. '2'. But this Court further takes into account the
fact that the names Mariano <span class="SpellE">Vegilia</span> and Jose B.
Aviles appearing in said <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. '2' must have been,
written by only one man."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Assuming that the above findings of
the Court of Appeals are <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span>, we find nothing
in the record sufficient to justify their reversal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs.</p>

<p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista, Angelo, Labrador,Concepcion, Reyes,
J.B.L., Barrera, Regala</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.</i>, concur.</p></div>
