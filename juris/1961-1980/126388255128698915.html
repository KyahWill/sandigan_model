<p class="BODY">By way of comment to the above complaint, respondent in a 2nd <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> dated March 2, 1974 averred that the complaint
"is devoid of the true facts x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" and explained that the decision was promulgated on
December 4, 1962, acquitting two of the accused and convicting three others,
namely, <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span>, Jose and Jacinto, all surnamed de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, who were committed to jail; that the decision
having been appealed to the Court of Appeals, the appellants were released on
bail; that subsequently the appeal was<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>dismissed and the records were received by respondent's office on
December 3, 1964; that the first notice of the execution of the judgment was
issued by respondent on December 9, 1964, or <span style="">six </span>days after receipt of the records;
that this notice was returned without having been served upon the accused and
their bondsmen; that the second notice for execution of the judgment was issued
on May 3, 1965; that the return of the notification showed that the accused
were not notified and only two out of nine bondsmen signed the notification;
that a third notice was subsequently sent out on <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1965</st1:date> and the same was received by the Chief of
Police of <span class="SpellE">Bobon</span>, <st1:place>Northern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>, through Pat. <span class="SpellE">Celespara</span>
on August 14, 1965; that again the return showed that the accused and the
bondsmen were not served; that on June 11, 1966, the fourth notice was issued
for the appearance of the accused and their bondsmen on July 2, 1966 for the
execution of the judgment; that this was received by the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Bobon</span> on the same day; that the return stated that the
accused were not contacted while only some <span style="">of </span>the bondsmen were served the notice; <span style="">that the fifth notice was issued on June 5, 1967, the same having been
received by the Chief of Police, through </span><span style="">Pat. </span><span style="">Ben <span class="SpellE">Esquillo</span> on the same day; that no return had been received
by the Office of the Clerk of Court since then up to the present, despite
personal reminder to the <span class="SpellE">Bobon</span> Police Force, whenever
a member thereof would be in the court </span><span style="">or </span><span style="">within the Capitol
premises; that on December 28, 1973, another notification was issued for the
execution of the judgment through the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Biri</span>,
the newly created municipality of Northern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> with
respect to the accused and another notice through the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Bobon</span> of the same province as regards the bondsmen and that
up to the time of the writing of the 2nd <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>
on March 2, 1974, no return had as yet been </span><span style="">received </span><span style="">regarding these
two sets of notices.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent denied in the same comment that the complainant had
repeatedly requested for the issuance of a warrant of arrest, the truth being
that she came to see him only in 1968 and on this occasion complainant was
shown the <span class="SpellE">unserved</span> fifth notice and that the
respondent explained to her that the Provincial Fiscal could not yet file the
motion for the arrest of the accused and the con<span style="">fiscation of their bonds in the absence of proof of service of the
notification.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no need for a formal investigation because the
respondent admits the allegation in the complaint that he failed to perform <span style="">his </span>duty to serve the notice of
execution of the judgment upon the bondsmen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He tries, however, to excuse himself totally from blame by pointing to
the circumstances of the continuing changes in the chief of police of the
municipality of <span class="SpellE">Bobon</span>, Northern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>
and the conversion of Barrio <span class="SpellE">Biri</span> of the same
municipality into a town.</p>

<p class="BODY">(The explanation of the respondent Clerk of Court of the Court of
First Instance of Northern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, Branch IV, that the
delay in the execution of the judg­ment cannot be attributed to him is not
satisfactory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 15, Rule 114 of
the Revised Rules of Court<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">does not require that service be made
upon the defendant or to all of the bondsmen at the same time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this particular case, there are nine
bondsmen and those upon whom service had been effected could have been
proceeded against and their respective undertakings confiscated had the herein
respondent not been remiss in the <span style="">dis</span></span>charge
of his duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The confiscation of the
bond could have expedited the issuance of warrants of arrest and thus expedited
the execution of the judgment in Criminal Case No. C-98 (1605))</p>
