<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">By deed entitled "Mutual

respective properties: the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Mindanao</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Academy</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> in <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span> and the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Misamis</span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Academy</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> in

The aggregate price stated in 
the deed was P100<span class="GramE">,700.00</span>, to be paid according to the 
terms and conditions specified in the contract.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Besides <span class="SpellE">Rosenda</span> and her son <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span>, Jr., 
both of whom signed the instrument, <span class="SpellE">Adelaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Dionisio-Nuesa</span> (a daughter of <span class="SpellE">Rosenda</span>) is also named therein as co-vendor, but actually 
did not take part either personally or through her uncle and supposed 
attorney-in-fact, <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> <span class="SpellE">Abuton</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">These three-<span class="SpellE">Rosenda</span> and her two children above named are referred to in 
the deed as the owners pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span> of the properties 
sold. The truth, however, was that there were other co-owners of the lands, 
namely, <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> D. Diaz, Ester Aida D. Bas, Rosalinda 
D. <span class="SpellE">Belleza</span> and Luz <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> D. 
<span class="SpellE">Dajao</span>, children also of <span class="SpellE">Rosenda</span> by her deceased husband <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>, Sr., and that as 
far as the school buildings, equipment, books, furniture and fixtures were 
concerned, they were owned by the Mindanao Academy, Inc., a corporation 
operating both the Mindanao Academy in <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span> and 
the <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Academy in <span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span> City.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The buyer, <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> D. Yap, obtained possession of the properties by 
virtue of the sale, took over the operation of the two schools and even changed 
their names to <span class="SpellE">Harvardian</span> Colleges. In view thereof 
two actions were commenced in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental. The first was for annulment of the sale 
and recovery of rents and damages (Civil Case No. 1774, filed May 3, 1955) with 
the Mindanao Academy, Inc., the five children of <span class="SpellE">Rosenda</span> <span class="SpellE">Nuqui</span> who did not take 
part in the deed of sale, and several other persons who were stockholders of the 
said corporation, as plaintiffs, and the parties who signed the deed of sale as 
defendants. The second action was for rescission (Civil Case No. 1907, filed 
July 17, 1956) with <span class="SpellE">Rosenda</span> <span class="SpellE">Nuqui</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>, Jr. and <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> D. Diaz 
(and the latter's husband <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span> Diaz) as plaintiffs, 
and <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> D. Yap as lone defendant. The other four 
children of <span class="SpellE">Rosenda</span> did not join, having previously 
ceded and quitclaimed their shares in the litigated properties in favor of their 
sister <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> D. Diaz.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The two actions were tried 
jointly and on </span><st1:date month="3" day="31" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 31, 
1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Ildefonso</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> D. Yap appealed from the 
foregoing judgment and has assigned five errors therein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">1. He first contends that the 
lower court erred "in clod siring that the mutual agreement dated 
</span><st1:date month="5" day="10" year="1954"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 10, 
1954</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. . . 
is entirely void and legally non-existent in that the vendors therein ceded to 
defendant-appellant not only their interest, rights, shares and participation in 
the property sold but also those that belonged to persons who were not parties 
thereto."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The lower court did not rule 
categorically on the question of rescission, considering it unnecessary to do so 
in view of its conclusion that the contract of sale is null and void. This 
conclusion is premised on two grounds: (a) the contract purported to sell 
properties of which the sellers were not the only owners, since of the four 
parcels of land mentioned in the deed their shares consisted only of 7/12, (6/12 
for <span class="SpellE">Rosenda</span> <span class="SpellE">Nuqui</span> and 1/12 
for <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span>, Jr.), while in the buildings, laboratory 
equipment, books, furniture and fixtures they had no participation at all, the 
owner being the Mindanao Academy, Inc.; and (b) the <span class="SpellE">prestation</span> involved in the sale was indivisible, and 
therefore incapable of partial annulment, inasmuch as the buyer Yap, by his own 
admission, would not have entered into the transaction except to acquire all of 
the properties purchased by him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">These premises are not challenged 
by appellant. But he calls attention to one point, namely, that the four 
children of <span class="SpellE">Rosenda</span> <span class="SpellE">Nuqui</span> 
who did not take part in the sale, besides <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> Diaz, quitclaimed in favor of the latter 
their interests in the properties; and that the trial court held that <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> as well as her husband acted in bad faith, because 
"having reasonable notice of defendants' having unlawfully taken possession of 
the property, they failed to make reasonable demands for (him) to vacate the 
premises to respect their rights thereto." It is argued that being herself 
guilty of bad faith, <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> D. Diaz, as owner of 5/12 
undivided interest in the properties (including the 4/12 ceded to her by her 
four sisters), is in no position to ask for annulment of the sale. The argument 
does not convince us. In the first place the quitclaim, in the form of an 
extrajudicial partition, was made on </span><st1:date month="5" day="6" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 6, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
after the action for annulment was filed, wherein, the plaintiffs were not only 
<span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> but also the other co-owners who took no part 
in the sale and to whom there has been no imputation of bad faith. Secondly the 
trial courts' finding of bad faith is an erroneous conclusion induced by a 
manifest oversight of an undisputed fact, namely, that on June 10, 1954, just a 
month after the deed of sale in question, <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> D. 
Diaz did file an action against <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> D. Yap and 
<span class="SpellE">Rosenda</span> <span class="SpellE">Nuqui</span>, among others, 
asserting her rights as co-owner of the properties (Case No. 1646). Finally, bad 
faith on the part of <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> would not militate 
against the nullity of the sale, considering that it included not only the lands 
in common by <span class="SpellE">Rosenda</span> <span class="SpellE">Nuqui</span> 
and her six children but also the buildings and school facilities owned by the 
Mindanao Academy, Inc., an entity which had nothing to do with the transaction 
and which could be represented solely by its Board of 
Trustees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The first assignment of error is 
therefore without merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">II. The second and third errors 
are discussed jointly in appellant brief. They read as follows: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"THE

1954</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">."</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The lower court correctly found 
that both vendors and vendee in the sale acted in bad faith and therefore must 
be treated, <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> each other, as having acted in 
good faith. The return of the properties by the vendee is a necessary 
consequence of the decree of annulment. No Part of the purchase price having 
been paid, as far as the record shows, the trial court correctly made no 
corresponding order for the restitution thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In regard to the rents the trial 
court found that prior to the sale the Mindanao Academy, Inc<span class="GramE">.,</span> was paying P300.00 monthly for its occupancy of the lands 
on which the buildings are situated. This is the amount the defendant has been 
ordered to pay to the plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 1907, beginning July 31, 
1956, when he filed his "first pleading" in the case. There can be no doubt that 
<span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> D. Diaz is entitled to recover a share of the 
said rents in proportion to her own interest in the lands and the interest of 
her four co-owners which she had acquired. <span class="SpellE">Rosenda</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Nuqui</span> and her son <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span>, it 
is true, acted in bad faith when they sold the properties as theirs alone; but 
so did the defendant Yap when he purchased them with knowledge of the fact that 
there were other co-owners. Although the bad faith of one party neutralizes that 
of the other and hence as between themselves their rights would be as if both of 
them had acted in good faith at the time of the transaction, this legal fiction 
of <span class="SpellE">Yap's</span> good faith ceased when they sold the 
properties as theirs alone; but so did the court's declaration of liability for 
the rents thereafter is correct and proper. A possessor in good faith is 
entitled to the fruits only so long as his possession is not legally 
interrupted, and such interruption takes place upon service of judicial summons 
(Arts. 544 and 1123, Civil Code).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In our opinion the award of 
attorney's fees to <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> D. Diaz and her husband is 
erroneous. Civil Case No. 1907, in which said fees have been adjudged, is for 
rescission (more properly resolution) of the so-called "mutual agreement" on the 
ground that the defendant </span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Yap</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> failed to comply with certain 
undertakings specified therein relative to the payment of the purchase price. 
<span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> Diaz was not a party to that agreement and 
hence had no cause of action for rescission. And as already stated, the trial 
court did not decide the matter of rescission because of the decree of annulment 
it rendered in the other case (Civil No. 1774), wherein the defendants are not 
only <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> D. Yap but also <span class="SpellE">Rosenda</span> <span class="SpellE">Nuqui</span> and her son <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span>. <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> D. Diaz could just 
as well have refrained from joining as plaintiff in the action for rescission, 
not being a part to the contract sought to be rescinded and being already one of 
the plaintiffs in the other action. In other words, it cannot be said with 
justification that she was constrained to litigate, in Civil Case No. 1907, 
because of some cause attributable to the appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The appellant claims 
reimbursement for the value of the improvements he allegedly introduced in the 
schools, consisting of new building worth P8.000.00 and a toilet costing 
P800.00, besides laboratory equipment, furniture, fixtures and books for the 
libraries. It should be noted that the judgment of the trial court specifies, 
for delivery to the plaintiffs (in Civil Case No. 1907), only "the buildings and 
grounds <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">described in the mutual agreement 
</span></em>together with all the permanent improvements thereon." If the 
defendant constructed a new building, as he alleges, he cannot recover its value 
because the construction was done after the filing of the action for annulment, 
thus rendering him a builder in bad faith <span class="GramE">who</span> is denied 
by law any right of reimbursement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In connection with the equipment, 
books, furniture and fixtures brought in by him, he is not entitled to 
reimbursement either, because the judgment does not award them to any of the 
plaintiffs in these two actions. What is adjudged (in Civil Case No. 1774) is 
for the defendant to restore to the Mindanao Academy, Inc. all the books, 
laboratory apparatus, furniture and other equipment "described in the Mutual 
Agreement and specified in the Inventory attached to the records of this case; 
or in default thereof, their value in the amount of P23,500.00." In other words, 
"whatever has been brought in by the defendant is outside the scope of the 
judgment and may be retained by him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">III. The appellant's fourth 
assignment of error refers to the nominal and exemplary damages, as well as the 
attorney's fees, granted to the stockholders of the Mindanao Academy, Inc. The 
trial court awarded no compensatory damages because the Mindanao Academy, Inc., 
had been operating the two schools at a loss before the sale in question, and 
the defendant himself was no more successful after lie took over. Are the 
stockholders of the said corporation who joined as plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 
1774 entitled to nominal and exemplary damages? We do not believe so. According 
to their second amended complaint they were joined merely <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">pro forma</span></em>, and "for the sole purpose of 
the <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">moral</span></em> damage which has 
been all the time alleged in the original complaint." Indeed the interests of 
the said stockholders, if any, were already represented by the corporation 
itself, which was the proper party plaintiff; and no cause of action accruing to 
them separately from the corporation is alleged in the complaint, other than 
that for moral damages due to "extreme mental anguish, serious anxiety and 
wounded feelings." The trial court, however, ruled out this claim for moral 
damages and no appeal from such ruling has taken. The award for nominal and 
exemplary damages should be eliminated <span style="font-style: italic;">in </span><span style="font-style: italic;" class="SpellE">toto</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The award for attorney's fees in 
the amount of P2,000.00 should be upheld, although the same should be for the 
account, not of the plaintiff stockholders of the Mindanao Academy, Inc., but of 
the corporation itself, and payable to their common counsel as prayed for in the 
complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">IV. Under the fifth and last 
assignment of error the appellant insists on the warranty provided for in Clause 
VI of the deed of sale in view of the claims of the co-owners who did not take 
part therein. The said clause provides: "if any claim shall be filed against the 
properties or any right, share or interest which are in the possession of the 
party of the First Part (vendors) which had been hereby transferred, ceded and 
conveyed unto the party of the Second Part (vendee) the party of the First Part 
assumes as it hereby holds itself answerable." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is unnecessary to pass upon 
the question posed in this assignment of error in view of the total annulment of 
the sale on grounds concerning which both parties thereto were at fault. The 
nullity of the contract precludes enforcement of any of its 
stipulations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the judgment appealed from is 
modified by eliminating <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the award of 
attorney's fees of P1000.00 in favor of <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> D. 
Diaz and her husband, plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 1907, and the award of 
nominal and exemplary damages in Civil Case No. 1774; and making the award of 
attorney's fees in the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> payable to 
counsel for the account of the Mindanao Academy, Inc. instead of the plaintiff
