vice-mayor of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, to enjoin the enforcement of
a writ of prohibitory injunction dated <st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="1">January
 22, 1968</st1:date> issued by the respondent judge Rafael de la Cruz of the
Court of First instance of <span class="SpellE">Camari­nes</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> in civil case 6504.</p>

<p class="BODY">The essential determinative facts are not disputed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 8, 1968, in a private conference held at the of­fice
of the petitioner Perez, with the seven city councilors and the vice-mayor of <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> present, the latter presiding thereat, the matter of
selecting the secretary of the municipal board of the said city as well as the
chairmen of the various Standing commit­tees of the said board came up for
discussion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the indication by the
four <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party councilors (the herein
private res­pondents Reynaldo P. <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>, Roberto R. <span class="SpellE">Ruelo</span>, Carlos G. del Castillo and <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span>
G. de <span class="SpellE">Asis</span>) of their desire to vote for a particular
person as secretary of the board and to hold the chairmanship of the committee
on markets for one of them, vice-mayor Perez expressed her intention to vote,
in the deliberation on such matters, to create a tie vote and thereafter to
exercise her power as presiding officer to break such deadlock.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1968</st1:date>,
in another conference held at the residence of the petitioner Perez, the latter
reiterated the same intention to vote twice, and such statement was radiocast
on <st1:date year="1968" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 15, 1968 the four aforesaid councilors filed with the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> a petition for prohi­bition with writ of preliminary
injunction, docketed as civil case 6504, to prevent Perez from casting her vote
in the selection of the secretary of the municipal board and in the choice of
chairmen arid members of the different standing committees thereof, except in
the event of a tie vote, and from voting on any legislative pro­posal or
measure or in any proceeding of the said board except when the members thereof
are equally divided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their petition,
the herein respondents alleged that the vice-mayor of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
is not a member of the municipal board but only its presiding officer; that
pursuant to par. "g" of Rule III of the Rules of Proce­dure of the
said board, the chairman of the board cannot vote ex­cept in case of a tie;
that in the choice of secretary of the board, the vice-mayor as presiding
officer of the board cannot vote ex­cept when the members of the board are
equally divided; that the vice-mayor had threatened to participate in the
election of the board secretary, in the choice of the chairmen of the various
com­mittees of the board and in other legislative matters, proposals and
proceedings, other than to break a tie vote.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The respondents claimed that they are entitled to the relief of
restraining the vice-mayor from voting on legislative matters and acts and
proceedings of the municipal board, because such proposed actuations, unless
restrained, would engender an anomalous situation which could cause great and
irreparable damage, work injustice, and trans­gress upon the rights, privileges
and prerogatives of the said respondents, as well as confuse the proceedings
and complicate pub­lic records to the detriment of public service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They, therefore, prayed for the issuance of a
writ of preliminary injunction against the vice-mayor.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, January 15, 1968, the respondent judge issued an
order directing the vice-mayor to show cause within 10 days why the writ should
not issue, at the same time setting the hearing on the petition for preliminary
injunction, for January 18, 1968.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1968</st1:date>
Perez moved for time to file a motion to dismiss and an opposition to the
issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, but her, motion was denied orally
in open court by the respondent judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1968</st1:date>
the respondent judge issued an order granting the prayer for a preliminary
injunction upon the applicants' posting a bond of P1,000, The writ of
preliminary injunction issued on <st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="1">January
 22, 1968</st1:date> recites:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, You, the City Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>
City or any of your lawful deputies is hereby commanded to restrain the
respondent from casting her vote in the selection of the Secretary of the
Board, the chairmanship and members of the different standing committees of the
Board except when there is a tie, and from voting and participating now and
henceforth in any legislative proposal, measure or proceedings of the Municipal
Board of the City of <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>, except when the members
thereof are equally divided and upon order of this Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"LIKEWISE, you respondent VIRGINIA F. PEREZ, desist and
refrain from casting your vote in the selection of the secretary of the board,
the chairmanship and membership of the different stand­ing committees of the
Board, except when there is a tie, and from voting-and participating now and
henceforth in any legislative proposal, measure or proceedings of the Municipal
Board of the City of <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>, except when the members
thereof are equally divided, and upon order of this court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1968</st1:date>
Perez filed a motion to dismiss and/or dissolve the writ of preliminary
injunction, assailing the juris­diction of the court over the subject-matter of
the action or the nature of the suit, and alleging that the complaint stated no
cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She further assailed
the issuance of the writ as undue interference in matters purely legislative in
character, at the same time that she denied the existence of a threatened
invasion of the rights of the four councilors; she finally prayed for the
immediate dissolution of the writ of prohibitory injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1968</st1:date>
the respondent judge issued an order denying the motion to dismiss the petition
and requiring the vice-mayor to answer within three days from receipt of his
order, thereby maintaining the injunction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the respondent judge had intima­ted to Perez that he would not
reconsider his order, Perez did not move to reconsider.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead she filed on February 15, 1968 a
petition for <u>certiorari</u> and prohibition with preliminary injunction with
the Court of Appeals, docketed thereat as G.R. 40789-R, naming the trial judge
and the four councilors as respondents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="20" month="2">Februa­ry 20, 1968</st1:date>
the appellate court issued, thru its Second Division, a restraining order
enjoining the enforcement of the writ of prohibi­tory injunction issued by the
respondent court on <st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 5, 1968, taking their cue from the issuance of the said
restraining order against the four respondents councilors, Perez and the
Liberal councilors in the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> municipal board (with
the four respondents councilors walking out of the session hall) passed an
amendment to the Rules of Procedure of the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>
municipal board granting the chairman thereof the right to vote as a member,
and as presiding officer the right to vote again in case of a tie vote.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1968</st1:date>
the Court of Appeals rendered a decision dismissing Perez petition for <u>certiorari</u>
and dissolving the res­training order issued by it, on the ground that the said
appellate court had no jurisdiction to entertain the same, there being no
factual issues involved in the main case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1968</st1:date>
Perez filed the present petition for <u>certiorari</u> and prohibition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We gave due course, and issued a writ of
preliminary injunction, upon the posting of a bond of P200, on <st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As matters now stand, the enforcement of the writ of pro­hibitory
injunction by the respondent judge in civil case 6504 has been stayed;
consequently, Perez has been allowed to sit in the municipal board both as a
constituent member and as presiding officer thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">To start with, we have the charter of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:place></st1:city>, Re­public Act 305, section
11 of which provides in part as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>Constitution and organization of he Municipal Board</u>; <u>Compensation
of Members thereof</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The Municipal
Board shall be the legislative body of the city and shall be composed of the <u>Mayor</u>,
who shall be <u>its presiding officer</u>, the city treasurer, the city
engineer and five councilors elected at large by popular vote during every
election for provincial and municipal officials in conformity with the
provisions of the Election Code." (underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Remarkably, the charter did not at all
provide for the position of vice-mayor; indeed, it explicitly provided that
"the City Treasurer shall perform the duties of the Mayor" "in
the event of sickness, absence or other temporary incapacity of the
Mayor."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1959</st1:date>,
upon approval of Republic Act 2259<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
mak­ing elective the offices of mayor, vice-mayor and councilors in chartered
cities, the position of vice-mayor, among others was created.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus section 3 of said law provides:</p>

<blockquote>"The position of Vice-Mayor is hereby created in chartered
cities which at present have no position for Vice-Mayor by provision of their
corporate charters:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>,
That the Vice-Mayor shall be the presiding officer of the City Council or
Municipal Board in all chartered cities."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Perez now contends that since under the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>
City charter the mayor was the presiding officer of the municipal board, and
since under Republic Act 2259 creating the position of vice-mayor who was made
the presiding officer, the vice-mayor simply re­placed the mayor as
"presiding officer" of the municipal board, the vice-mayor acquired
all the rights and prerogatives of the pre­siding officer under the charter,
one of which is "membership in the municipal board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To fortify her claim, Perez adverts to sec.
11 of Republic Act 537, as amended by Republic Act 1575,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>

where this Court held that "the presiding officer of the Municipal Board
of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:place></st1:city>
is a member thereof."</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's contention suffers from several grave
infirmities.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. There is absolutely nothing in Republic Act 305, also known as
the charter of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
which provides that the vice-mayor of the said city is a member of the
municipal board thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Forsooth, the
position of vice-mayor was not even pro­vided for, as the "acting
mayor" designated to take over in case of sickness, absence or other
temporary incapacity of the 'mayor was the "City Treasurer."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">True it is that upon the passage of Republic Act 2259, the
position of vice-mayor in <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> City, and in all other
chartered ci­ties whose corporate charters did not provide for the position of
vice-mayor, was created, but section 3 thereof simply provides that "the
Vice-Mayor shall be the <u>presiding officer</u> of the City Council or
Municipal Board in all chartered cities."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It does not decree that the vice-mayor is a <u>member</u> of the city council
or mu­nicipal board.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. <span class="SpellE"><u>Quiem</u></span><u> v. <span class="SpellE">Seriña</span>, et al</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
is cited, where this Court held that the silence of Rep. Act 2259 on whether
the vice-mayor, the presiding officer, is a member of the board, was not enough
ground for excluding the vice-mayor from membership in the board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the legal setting and premises in <span class="SpellE"><u>Quiem</u></span> are widely disparate from those in the case at
bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Quiem</u></span> we
found that "by express legal mandate, the vice-mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City is a member
of the board" because "that city's original charter<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
calls for an ap­pointive Vice-Mayor who 'shall be a Member of the Municipal
Board.'" In the case at bar, however, in contrast with sec. 11 of Republic
Act 521 creating the city of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> which explicitly made the vice-mayor a member of the
municipal board, sec­tion 11 of Republic Act 305 creating the City of <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> failed to pro­vide even for the position of
vice-mayor.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the second place, Republic Act 1325,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
particularly section 1 thereof, amending the <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> charter, expressly reiterated that the
vice-mayor "shall be a member of the Munici­pal Board;" no such
similar statutory basis can be cogently invoked for the petitioner Perez.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. <span class="SpellE"><u>Bagasao</u></span><u>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Tumangan</span>,</u> <u>supra</u>, which was decid­ed before the
enactment of Republic Act 2259 furnishes no prop to the petitioner's
position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There we held that the
vice-mayor "as the presiding officer of the Municipal Board of the City of
<span class="SpellE">Cabana­tuan</span> <u>is a member</u> thereof" and
"he may exercise his right to vote as a member on any proposed ordinance,
resolution or motion." But we so held because "both the <span class="SpellE">unamended</span> and amended provi­sions of section 11 of the
Charter of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:place></st1:city>
provide that the presiding officer of the Municipal Board is a member there­of."
And as we have repeatedly stated, there is no provision what­ever in Republic
Act 305 creating the City of <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> that provides for the
position of vice-mayor; and the amendatory provisions of Re­public Act 2259
making the vice-mayor the presiding officer of the municipal board does not
make him a constituent member thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">To paraphrase <span class="SpellE"><u>Quiem</u></span>, in the
absence of any statutory au­thority constituting the vice-mayor as a member of
the municipal board, in addition to being the presiding officer thereof, we can­not
read into the law something which is not there.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
For, as apt­ly put, differences in law beget differences in legal effects.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">4. Resort to the charter of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
would avail the petitioner none.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
under section 9 of the said charter, as amend ed, the vice-mayor is explicitly
made "a member of the City Coun­cil," and section 11 of the same law
expressly states that "there shall be a City Council composed of the Mayor
as Chairman, <u>Vice-Mayor</u> and eight <u>other</u> members." Clearly,
then, the vice-mayor of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City is a <u>member</u>
of the city council and, as such, is entitled to vote as a constituent member
thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further cutting the ground from under the petitioner's pre­tension
is paragraph (g) of Rule III of the Rules of Procedure adop­ted by the municipal
board of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, which recites:</p>

<blockquote>"(g) The chairman cannot vote, except in case of a tie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, a member of the Board acting as
chairman may vote as a member and as chairman to break a tie."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner insists, however, that the above provision was
amended by the 6th municipal board, headed by her, to read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"(g) The Chairman, as <u>member</u> of the Board can vote and
as a Presiding Officer may vote again in case of a tie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same manner, a, member of the Board acting
as Chairman, may vote as a member and as Chairman, to break the tie."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Such insistence is a sheer exercise in
futility because (1) the amen­ded rule presupposes that the chairman is a
"member of the Board" - an assumption that is without legal basis;
(2) the said amendatory, rule was passed on March 5, 1968, almost two months
after the filing on January 15, 1968, by the private respondents of their peti­tion
in civil case 6504, that is, <span class="SpellE"><u>pendence</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>; and (3) although on the date the said
amendment was passed, the restraining order da­ted February 20, 1968 of the

as the four respondents councilors had walked out of the session hall, leaving
only the three Liberal Party councilors and the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proposed amendment was, therefore, a

<p class="BODY">The petitioner posits the theory that since the mayor of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
who was a member of the municipal board under Rep. Act 305, was replaced by the
vice-mayor as presiding officer thereof, the vice-mayor must, perforce, be
deemed a member of the municipal board.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pressing her bid, she asserts that Republic Act 2259 effected a mere
change in the officer who will preside the meetings of the board, and since the
vice-mayor replaced the mayor as "pre­siding officer" thereof, the
vice-mayor acquired all the rights and prerogatives of the presiding officer,
one of which is membership in the board.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention finds no support either in law or logic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, section 3 of Rep. Act 2259 simply
installs the vice-mayor as the <u>presiding officer</u> of the board in all
chartered cities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not install
the vice-mayor as a member thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is especially true in the case of <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> where the
position of vice-mayor (whether appointive or elective) was originally not even
provided for in its charter - the official next-in-rank to the mayor being the
city trea­surer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In no manner does the
law, either in its original form under Rep. Act 305, or in its amendatory shape
under Rep. Act 2259, constitute the vice-mayor as a member of the Municipal
board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It simply says that "the
vice-mayor shall be the presiding officer of the City Council or Municipal
Board." Nothing more.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, <u>American Jurisprudence</u> has this to
say:<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"When the statutes provide that the
mayor shall pre­side at meetings of the municipal council, he is a constituent part
of the council for certain purposes, and he sits and acts therein, but he is
not in any pro­per sense a member of the council, unless the sta­tutes
expressly so provide."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This brings back to mind the ruling of
this <u>Court in Rivera, et al vs. Villegas</u>:<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>“It is our considered view, however, that
the Vice Mayor of Manila is not identically situated as the Vice-Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span> City, except insofar as each forms part of the
respective municipal board and presides the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The former is an integral part of the
Municipal Board of Manila, but only 'as presiding officer' thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, unlike the Vice-Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span> City, that of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
does not have either the status of a regular member of its municipal board or
the powers and attributes of a municipal councilor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, the Vice-Mayor of Manila possesses
in the Municipal Board of Mani­la no more than the prerogatives and authority
of a 'presiding officer' as such, and those specified by law (to vote in case
of tie, and to sign all ordi­nances or resolutions and measures directing the
payment of money or creating liability enacted or adopted by the Board.)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The mere fact, therefore, that the
vice-mayor was made the "pre­siding officer" of the board did not <u>ipso</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>jure</u></span> make him a member thereof; and even if he
"is an integral part of the Municipal Board" such fact does not
necessarily confer on him "either the status of a regular member of its
municipal board or the powers and attributes of a municipal councilor."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In sum, the vice-mayor of <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>
possesses in the municipal board of <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> no more than
the prero­gatives and authority of a "presiding officer" as such, and
no more.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not amiss to note that the Rules of Procedure of the 4th

 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> which were then in force prior

began to exercise their functions in January 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vice-mayor, prior to the petitioner's
term, had been presiding officer and chairman of the municipal board since
1959, upon the passage of Republic Pct No. 2259, and by the terms of the
board's rules of procedure, the vice-mayor as "chairman cannot vote,
except in case of tie." The chairman of the board - the vice-mayor was
therefore, bereft of a casting vote such as would empower him to vote to create
a tie, then vote again to break such tie.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Bagasao</u></span>, <u>supra</u>, this

<p class="BODY">It is true that in the later case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Quiem</u></span>,
we upheld the right of the vice-mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City to vote as a member of the municipal board,
underscoring the observations that the charter of the city of Manila "in
language indubitable, withheld from the Vice-Mayor the right to vote 'except in

legal mandate, either in the <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> city charter or in
the amendatory law, Rep. Act 2259, makes the vice-mayor a member of the board,
unlike in the case of the vice-mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> who by express legal mandate is a member of the board,

without vote except in the case of a tie as where he is merely the executive or

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Invocation of this ruling is completely

It is not dis­puted that the present proceeding for prohibition has for its
objec­tive to prevent the petitioner from "participating in the election
of Secretary of the Board, chairmanship of different committees and in voting
in other legislative matters, proposals and proceedings, other than to break a
tie." It is our view that the petitioner, in in­sisting to exercise the
right to vote twice in the municipal board, acted without jurisdiction and
power to do so, and may be validly prevented and restrained by a writ of
prohibition.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In reply to the petitioner's assertion that the acts sought to be
restrained are mere "probable individual actuations" beyond the reach

Withal, pe­titioner's threat of voting twice in the municipal board was not an
empty or meaningless gesture, for the record shows that on March 5, 1968, soon
after the writ complained of was lifted by the Court of Appeals through the
latter's restraining order of February 20, 1968, the petitioner proceeded to
act by voting twice for the appro­val of an alleged amendment to the rules of
procedure of the muni­cipal board.</p>
