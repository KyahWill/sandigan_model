				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A novel question, one of importance and significance, is before
this court in this petition for the review of decision of the court of Tax
appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the first time, the
Ordinance appended to the Constitution calls for interpretation, having been
invoked to justify a claim for refund of taxes by the estate of an American
national, who in his life-time was engaged in the air transportation
business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More specifically, the issue
is whether or not Section 142 of the National Internal Revenue Code allowing
Filipinos a refund of 50 <span class="SpellE">percentum</span> of the specific
tax paid on aviation oil, could be availed of by citizens of the United States
and all forms of business enterprises owned or controlled directly or
indirectly by them in view of their privilege under the Ordinance to operate
public utilities "in the same manner <span style="">as </span>to, and under the same conditions imposed upon, citizens of
the Philippines or corporations or associations owned or controlled by citizens
of the Philippines"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, now petitioner before this
court, denied the claim for refund in the sum of P2,441.93 filed by the
administrator of the estate of Paul I. Gunn, thereafter substituted by the
present respond­ent A. D. Guerrero as special administrator under the above s<span style="">ection of the National Internal Revenue Code.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The deceased operated an </span><span style="">air </span><span style="">transportation business under the business
name and style of Philippine Aviation Development; his estate, it was claimed,
“was entitled to the same rights and privileges as Filipino citizens operating
public utilities including privileges in the matter of taxation.” The Com­missioner
of Internal Revenue disagreed, ruling that such partial exemption from the
gasoline tax was not included under the terms of the Ordinance and that in
accordance with the statute, to be entitled to its benefits, there muse be a
showing that the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> of which the deceased was a citizen granted
a similar exemption to Filipinos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
refund as already noted </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matter was brought to the court of tax
appeals to a stipulation of acts, no additional evidence being introduced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Viewing them Ordinance differently, it
"ordered them petitioner to refund to the respondent the sum of P2,441.93
representing 50% of the specific taxes paid on 61,043.19 liters of gasoline
actually used in aviation during the period from October 3, 1956 up to May 31,
1957." Not satisfied with the above decision, petitioner appealed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We sustain the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue; accordingly, the court of Tax Appeals is
reverse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the extent that </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">refund is allowable, there is in reality a
tax exemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule applied with
undeviating rigidity in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">that
for a tax exemption to exist, it m</span>ust be so categorically declared in
words that admit of doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such
language <span style="">may
</span>be found in the Ordinance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
furnishes no support, whether express or implied, to the <span style="">claim </span>of respondent administrator for,

marketing of its gasoline product" is corollary to or incidental to its
industrial operations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this
contention runs smack against the familiar rules that exemption from taxation
is not favored, and that exemptions in tax statutes are never presumed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Which are but <span style="">s</span>tatements in adherence to the ancient rule that exemptions from <span style="">taxation are construed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>strictissimi</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>juris</u></span>

the exemptions to be considered, and no more. <span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>* * *."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In addition to Justice Tracey, who first spoke for this court in
the Hastings case in announcing "the cardinal rule of American
jurisprudence that exemption from taxation not being favored," and
therefore "must be strictly construed' against the taxpayer, two other
noted American jurists, Moreland and Street, who likewise served this court
with distinction, reiterated the doctrine in terms even more emphatic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to justice Moreland: "Even
though the complaint in this regard were well founded, it would have little
being on the result of the litigation when we take into consideration the
universal rule that he who claims an exemption from his share of the common
burden of taxation must justify his claim by showing that the legislature
intended to exempt him by words too plain to be mistaken"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
from Justice Street: "Exemptions from taxation are highly disfavored, so
much so that they may almost be sale to be odious to the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He who claims an exemption must be able to
point to some positive provision of law creating the right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be allowed to exist upon a vague
implication such as is supposed to arise in this case from the omission from
act <span style="">no. </span>1654
of any reference to liability for tax. The books are full of very strong expressions
on this point."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At the time then when the ordinance took effect in April, 1947,
the strict rule against tax exemption was undisputed and undisputable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the case, it would be <span style="">a ma</span>in departure from the terms of
the Ordinance to predicate a tax exemption where none was intended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well-settled is the prin­ciple * * * * that a
constitutional provision must be pre­sumed to have been framed and adopted in
the light and understanding of prior and <span style="">existing

to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counts are bound to presume
that the people adopting a constitution are familiar with the previous and
existing laws upon the subjects to which its provisions relate, and <span style="">upon </span>which they express their judgment
and opinion in its adoption.'”<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respect for and deference to doctrines of such undeniable force <span style="">and </span>cogency preclude an <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the decision of the courts of<span style=""> </span>Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not to <span style="">say </span>that the scope of the ordinance is to be restricted or
confined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What it promises must <span style="">be fulfilled.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There </span>must be recognition of the right t <span style="">of </span>the "citizens of the United States and to all forms <span style="">of </span>business
enterprise owned or controlled, directly or indirectly by citizens of the
United States" to operate public utilities "in the same manner as to,
and under the same conditions imposed upon, citizens of the Philippines or
corporations or associations owned or controlled by citizens of the
Philippines."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">If the language of the
ordinance applies to tax refund o</span>r exemption, then the court of Tax
Appeals should be sustained it does not however.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its terms are clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Standing alone, without any franchise to
supply that omission, it affords no warrant for the claim here made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While good faith, no <span style="">less than </span>adherence to the categorical wording of the ordinance,
requires that all the rights and privileges thus granted to Americans and
business enterprises owned and controlled by them be respected, anything
further would not be warranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing
less will suffice, but anything more is not justified.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This conclusion has
reinforcement that comes to it from another avenue of approach, the historical
background of </span><span style="">the </span>Ordinance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In public law questions, history many <span style="">a time </span><span style="">holds t</span>he key that unlocks the door to understanding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
would thus have courts "look to the history of the times, examine the <span style="">state </span>of things existing when the
constitution was framed and adopted, * * * and interpret <span style="">it in </span>the light of the law then in
operation,”<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Justice Laurel earlier noted that while historical discussion is not decisive,
it is valuable.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
A brief resume then of the events that led to its being appended to the
constitution will not be inappropriate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Early in 1945, liberation primarily through the efforts of the
American forces under general McArthur, assisted by Filipino guerrillas,
heralded the dawn, awaited so long and so anxiously, ending the dark night of
the Japanese occupation, which was only partly mitigated by a show of
cooperation on t<span style="">he part of some
Filipino leaders of stature and eminence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All throughout those years, the Japanese army in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> enforced repressive measures, severe in
character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was even more
regrettable, in the last few weeks, the few remaining Japanese troops in manila
and suburbs made a suicidal stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
scorched earth policy was followed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Guerrilla suspects p</span>aid dearly for theirs imaginary sins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were recorded cases, not few in number,
of the old and infirm, even those of tender years, not being spared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Americans shelled Japanese positions
unfortunately not always with precision, as would have been unavoidable perhaps
<span style="">in </span>any
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lot of the helpless civil­ians,
already suffering from acts born out of desperation of a cornered prey, became
even more unenviable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were caught
in the cross-fire.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The toll in the
destruction of the property and the loss of lives was heavy; the price the
Filipinos paid was high.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The feeling
then, and even now for that matter, was that it was worth it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For life during the period of the Japanese
occupation had become unbearable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was an intolerable burden on the spirit and the mind of man with all civil
liberties wantonly disregarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was likewise a well-nigh insupport­able affliction on </span><span style="">his </span><span style="">health and physical well-being, with food, what there was of it,
difficult to locate and beyond the means of even the </span><span style="">middle-income </span><span style="">groups.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Medicine was equally
scarce, what was available commanding prices unusually high.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A considerable portion of the population were
dressed in rags and lived under </span>the <span style="">most pitiable conditions in houses that had seen much better days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover </span><span style="">in a </span><span style="">garrison state with the Japanese </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">kempetai</span></u></span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">and
the contemptible spies and informers, there was ever present that fear of the
morrow, </span>the sense <span style="">of living at
the edge of an impending doom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">was </span>fortunate
that the Japanese Occupation ended when it did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Liberation was hailed by all, but the problems faced by the legitimate
government were awesome in their immensity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span style="">Philip</span>pine treasury
was bankrupt and her economy prostrate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were no dollar-earning export crops to speak of; commercial
operations were paralyzed; and her industries were unable to produce with
mills, factories and plants either destroyed or their machineries obsolete or
dismantled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a desolate and tragic
sight that greeted the victorious American a<span style="">nd </span>Filipino t<span style="">roops.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, particularly that portion south of the </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pasig</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, lay in ruins, its public edifices and
business building lying in a heap of rubble and numberless houses razed to the
ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was in fact, next to </span><st1:city><st1:place>Warsaw</st1:place></st1:city>,
the most devastated <span style="">city in t</span>he
expert opinion of the then General Eisenhower.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was thus a clear need of help from the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>American aid was forthcoming but on terms proposed by her government and
later on accepted by the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">One such condition expressly set forth in the Philippine Trade
Act of 1946 passed by the Congress of the United States was that: "The
disposition, exploitation, development, and utilization of all agricultural,
timber, and mineral lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal,
petroleum, and other mineral oils, all forces and sources of potential energy,
and other natural resources of the Philippines, and the operation of public
utilities, shall, if open to any person, be open to citizens of the United
States and to all forms of business enterprise owned or controlled directly or
indirectly, by United States citizens."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The above was embodied in an executive agreement concluded on <st1:date year="1946" day="4" month="7">July 4, 1946</st1:date>, the agreement being
signed by the president of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the plenipotentiary of the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The constitution being in the way, both the exploitation of natural
resources and the operation of public utilities having been reserved for
Filipino there <span style="">was </span>a need for
an amendment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an amendment was duly
forthcoming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It took the form of the
Ordinance now under consi­deration, which took effect on <st1:date year="1947" day="9" month="4">April 9, 1947</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Ordinance thus came into being at a time when the liberation
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
had elicited a vast reservoir of goodwill for the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, one that has lasted to this day
notwithstanding irritants that man ever so often the relation­ship even among
the most friendly of nations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
prestige was never so high.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
after hearing opposing views on the matter canceled parity rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She adopted the Ordinance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To that grant she is committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its terms are to be respected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the equally fundamental postulate
that legal concepts imperatively calling for application cannot be ignored,
however, it follow that tax exemption to Americans or to business owned or
controlled directly or indirectly by American citizens, based solely on the
language of the Ordinance, cannot be allowed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There in nothing in its history that calls for <span style="">a </span>different view had the parties been of <span style="">a </span>different mind, they would have employed words indicative of
such intention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was not there
includes whether by purpose or inadvertence, cannot be judicially supplied.</p>

<p class="BODY">One final consideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Ordinance is designed for <span style="">a
</span>limited period to allow what the constitution prohibits; Americans may
operate public utilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During its <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>, there should be no thought of whittling down
the grant thus freely made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
being of a<span style=""> limited</span> duration, it should
not be given an interpretation that would wrench further on the plain
constitutional mandate to limit the operation of public u<span style="">tilities to Filipino hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>That is to <span style="">show fealty to the fundamental law, which, in the language of Story
"was not intended to provide merely </span>f<span style="">or the exigencies of a few years" u</span>nlike the Ordinance
"but was to endure through a long lapse of ages, the events of which were
locked up in the inscrutable purposes of <st1:city><st1:place>Providence</st1:place></st1:city>."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
This merely to emphasize that the constitution unlike n ordinance appended to
it, to borrow from <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span> "states or ought to
state not rules for the passing hour, but principles for an expanding
future,"<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
what is tran­sitory in character then should not be given an interpretation at
war with the plain and explicit command of what <span style="">is </span>to continue far into the future,
unless there be some other principle of acknowledged primacy that compels them
contrary.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It would seem to follow from all the foregoing that the decision
of the court of Tax Appeals enlarged the scope and operation of the
Ordinance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It failed unfortunately to
abide by what the controlling precedents require, namely, that tax exemption is
not to be presumed and that if granted, it is to be most strictly construed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such grant was apparent on the face of the
Ordinance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such grant could be
implied from its history, much less from its transitory character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Tax Appeals went too far.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That cannot be done.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Wherefore</b>, the decision of the court of Tax Appeals is
reversed and the case is remanded to it, to grant respondent Administrator the
opportunity of proving whether the estate could claim the benefits of section
142 of the National Internal Revenue Code, allowing refund to citizens of
foreign countries on a showing of reciprocity.<span style="">&nbsp;

<span class="SpellE">Asiaric</span> Petroleum Co. <i>v.</i> Llamas (1926) 49
Phil. 46 (47-472.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He added: "As was
said by the Supreme Court of Tennessee in Memphis <i>v.</i> U. &amp; p. Bank
(91 Tenn., 646, 550), 'The rights of taxation is inherent in the State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is
a </span>prerogative essential to the perpetuity of the government; and he who
claims an exemption from the common burden, must justify his claim by the
clearest grant of organic or statute law.’ Other utterances equally or more
emphatic come readily to hand from the highest authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Ohio Life Ins. and Trust Co. <i>v.</i> <span class="SpellE">Debolt</span> (16 Howard, 416), it was said by Chief Justice
Taney, that the right of taxation will not be held to have been surrendered,
'unless the intention to surrender is manifested by words too plain to be
mistaken.' <span style="">In </span>the case of the
Delaware Railroad Tax (18 Wallace, 206, 226), the Supreme Court of the United
States said that the surrender, when claimed, must be shown by clear,
unambiguous language, which will admit of no reasonable construction consistent
with the reservation of the power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If <span style="">a </span>doubt arise as to the intent of the
legislature, that doubt must be solved in favor of the State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Erie Railway Company v. Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania (21 Wallace, 492, 499), Mr. Justice Hunt, speaking of exemptions,
observed that <span style="">a </span>state cannot
strip itself of the most essential power of taxation by doubtful word.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'It cannot, by ambiguous language, be
deprived of this highest attribute of sovereignty.” (at pp. <span style="">,472)</span></p>

<span style="">What is permanent </span>and enduring,
as long <span style="">as </span><span style="">the Consti­tution remains </span>what <span style="">it </span><span style="">is, </span><span style="">is the stress, both
un­mistakable and pronounced, on nationalism.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So it has been declared repeatedly </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We start with Justice Laurel, himself one of
the foremost architects of the Constitution, who authoritatively noted the
"nationalistic * * * traits" discoverable by "even a sudden dip
into a variety of the provisions" embodied in our charter framed under
"an intense spirit of nationalism." </span>(Gold <span style="">Creek Mining Co. <i>vs</i>. Rodriguez [1938]
66 Phil. 259, 270.) Justice Perfecto, another delegate, who gained deservedly a
reputation as a civil libertarian, would have the guarantees of due process and
equal protection yield to its nationalistic provisions, one of which
"reserves to Filipino citizens the operation of public services or
utilities." (Co <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> <i>v.</i> <span class="SpellE">Cuaderno</span> [1949] 83 Phil. 242, 251.) From still another
former member of the constitutional con­vention, who likewise sat on this
court, Justice Labrador: "it would do well to refer to the nationalistic
tendency manifested in various provisions of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * The nationalization of the retail trade
is only </span><span style="">a
</span><span style="">continuance of the nationalistic
protective policy laid down as a primary objective of the constitution. Can it
be </span><span style="">said
</span><span style="">that a law imbued with the same
purpose and spirit underlying many of the provisions of the Constitution is
unreasonable, invalid and unconstitu­tional?" (<span class="SpellE">Ichong</span>
<i>v.</i> Hernandez [1957] 101. Phil. 1155, 1136.)</span></p>
