				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">This is a petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> and prohibition with
preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seeks to set
aside the orders of the respondent Court of Tax Appeals dated </span><st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="4"><span style="color: windowtext;">April 15, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;"> and </span><st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="6"><span style="color: windowtext;">June 20, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;"> in CTA Case No. 1264 en­titled “Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue.” The first order
denied the Commissioner's motion to dis­miss the petition of Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> whereby he sought review of the decision rendered by
the Commissioner imposing upon Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> a certain
amount as deficiency income tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
second order denied the Commissioner's motion for recon­sideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">On <u>October 20, 1952</u>, the
then Collector (now, and hereinafter referred to as, Commissioner) of Internal
Revenue wrote respondent Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> demanding from
the latter payment of his deficiency income tax for the calendar year 1951
amounting to <u>P1,128,444.00.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
appears, however, that this letter of demand and the accompanying assessment
notice dated </span><st1:date year="1952" day="5" month="11"><span style="color: windowtext;">November 5, 1952</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;"> were not effec­tively served upon respondent Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> in due course by reason of the fact that he had
transferred his resi­dence from <span class="SpellE">Guiuan</span>, </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="color: windowtext;">Samar</span></span></st1:place><span style="color: windowtext;">, to </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="color: windowtext;">Cebu</span></span></st1:placename><span style="color: windowtext;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="color: windowtext;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="color: windowtext;"> without the know­ledge of the BIR Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite the fact that the letter of demand
and the assessment notice had not been ef­fectively served upon respondent
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>, he must have obtained personal knowledge
of the assessment levied against him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> must have already been informed of
this tax deficiency, when on December 18, 1952 the Commissioner of In­ternal
Revenue wrote the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> recom­mending
immediate prosecution of Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> for willful neg­lect
to file his income tax return for the year 1951 <span style="">in </span>vio­lation of Sec. 45 of the Internal Revenue Code penalized un­der
Sec. 73 thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of his
knowledge of the assess­ment levied against him, he retained the services of
tax con­sultant Juan G. <span class="SpellE">Mañiego</span> who in January, 1953
wrote the Bureau of Internal Revenue disputing the assessment and at the same
time requesting that he be authorized to consider the possi­bility of an
amicable settlement of the case and that the criminal charge be held in
abeyance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> was given 10 days to take up the case with the
BIR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1953" day="24" month="1"><span style="color: windowtext;">Ja­nuary 24, 1953</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, respondent Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>,
thru counsel, re­quested for an extension of time within which to reply to the
assessment letter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said request was
granted by a letter of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, dated </span><st1:date year="1953" day="27" month="1"><span style="color: windowtext;">January 27, 1953</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1953" day="10" month="2"><span style="color: windowtext;">February 10, 1953</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, respondent Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>,
thru counsel, again requested for an extension of time until </span><st1:date year="1953" day="15" month="3"><span style="color: windowtext;">March 15, 1953</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;"> to discuss the case with the BIR, which re­quest was
granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of his illness, Atty.
Juan G. <span class="SpellE">Mañiego</span>, counsel for respondent Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>, addressed a letter to the BIR Commissioner, dated </span><st1:date year="1953" day="18" month="3"><span style="color: windowtext;">March 18, 1953</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, re­questing for an extension of time until </span><st1:date year="1953" day="31" month="3"><span style="color: windowtext;">March 31, 1953</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This request
was denied by the Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view
of this denial, <span class="SpellE">Counsellor</span> Juan G. <span class="SpellE">Mañiego</span> sent a reply dated </span><st1:date year="1953" day="28" month="3"><span style="color: windowtext;">March 28, 1953</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;"> where he emphatically stated that the books and records
seized by the BIR from the establishment in <span class="SpellE">Guiuan</span>,
did not belong to his client Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>. <u>On April
29, 1953</u>, the Deputy Collector (now, and hereinafter referred to as, Deputy
Commissioner) of Internal Revenue wrote counsel for Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>
advising him that in the absence of documentary proofs to substantiate the
allega­tions contained in his letter, the BIR could <u>not reconsider its
decision holding, his client liable for the payment of the deficiency tax
mentioned therein</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1953" day="7" month="7"><span style="color: windowtext;">July 7, 1953</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, res­pondent, thru counsel, wrote another letter
addressed to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue reiterating that he did not
own the books and records seized from the store in <span class="SpellE">Guiuan</span>,
</span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="color: windowtext;">Samar</span></span></st1:place><span style="color: windowtext;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He contended
that he should not be made liable for the tax assessed against him based on
said docu­ments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">Meanwhile, a deportation case
against Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> was being tried before the
Deportation Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, or on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="14" month="6"><span style="color: windowtext;">June 14, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, the record of said deportation case was for­warded
to the President of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="color: windowtext;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="color: windowtext;">. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Based on the
re­commendation of the Deportation Board, the President issued an order
directing the deportation of respondent Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it appears that the order of
deportation was not released due to political influence exerted on behalf of res­pondent
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">On </span><st1:date year="1954" day="25" month="1"><span style="color: windowtext;">January 25, 1954</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, respondent Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>
personally received the letter of demand of </span><st1:date year="1952" day="20" month="10"><span style="color: windowtext;">October 20, 1952</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;"> and the assessment notice dated </span><st1:date year="1952" day="5" month="11"><span style="color: windowtext;">November 5, 1952</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">On </span><st1:date year="1954" day="27" month="9"><span style="color: windowtext;">September 27, 1954</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho's</span> new counsel,
Eddy Dean, by letter offered to compromise respondent's income tax case for the
sum of P15,000.00, which was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1956" day="23" month="3"><span style="color: windowtext;">March 23, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, respondent hired another lawyer, <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lobrin</span>, who wrote a letter to the BIR Commissioner
request­ing for a decision on the merits of the case, or, in the al­ternative,
a favorable action on his offer to settle the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was not acted upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="8"><span style="color: windowtext;">August 20, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, another lawyer for Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>,
Orlando V. Velasco, wrote a letter to the BIR Commissioner requesting for
reinvestigation of the case of his client, which request was not granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another law­yer acted for and in behalf of
respondent Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> in the person of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Remotigue</span> who made a similar request for reinvestigation of
the deficiency assessment tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This re­quest
was likewise denied for the reason that the assessment in question had long
become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> went to the Court of Tax Appeals and asked for the
reversal of the decision of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue im­posing upon
him deficiency income tax of P1,128,444.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner here, respondent below, filed a motion to dismiss the
case on the ground that the Court of Tax Appeals had no jurisdiction to
entertain the same by reason of the fact that the appeal had been filed out of
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Tax Ap­peals, in an
extended resolution, denied the motion to dis­miss stating that the records on
file with the Court were not clear whether the petition for review was filed
beyond the period of 30 days as contended by the Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for reconsideration was filed by the
Commissioner praying that the resolution be set aside and reiterating the
motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But said motion was
denied on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="20" month="6"><span style="color: windowtext;">June 20, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
Commissioner of Internal Revenue has come to this Court for relief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">The vital issue for resolution in
this case is whether or not the respondent Court gravely abused its discretion
in not dismissing CTA Case No. 1264, entitled "Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>
vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">It is not disputed that the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue sent a letter on </span><st1:date year="1952" day="20" month="10"><u><span style="color: windowtext;">October 20, 1952</span></u></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;"> to respondent Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>
demanding from him payment of the deficiency income tax for the calendar year
1951 in the amount of P1,128,444.00 and the amount of P3,300.00 as
administrative penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This letter of
demand was sent together with an assessment notice dated </span><st1:date year="1952" day="5" month="11"><span style="color: windowtext;">November 5, 1952</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We consider
the letter of the petitioner addressed to Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>
dated </span><st1:date year="1952" day="20" month="10"><u><span style="color: windowtext;">October 20, 1952</span></u></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;"> as the <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be observed that the
decision of the BIR Commissioner contem­plated by the statute may be in the
form of a letter ad­dressed to the taxpayer informing him of the final action
taken on his tax liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> should have been more diligent in
ascertaining the tenor of the letter-decision he received from the BIR
Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In­asmuch as said letter
finally determined or resolved <span style="">his tax </span>liability,
the 30-day period within which to appeal com­menced to run from the date said
letter-decision was re­ceived.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">In the instant case, respondent
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>, through his different lawyers at
different times, wrote the Com­missioner asking for extensions of the period
within which to file a motion for reconsideration of the assessment and/or
requested the reconsideration of the letter-decision. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Did the Commissioner finally act on the
motions for recon­sideration filed by respondent Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho's</span>
lawyers?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">The records show that on </span><st1:date year="1953" day="29" month="4"><u><span style="color: windowtext;">April 29, 1953</span></u></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;"> </span><span style="color: windowtext;">the Deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue wrote
counsel for Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> advising him that in the absence
of documentary proofs to substantiate the allegations contained in his letter,
"this office <u>cannot</u> <u>reconsider its decision</u> holding him
(Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>) liable for the payment of the said
sums." This letter of the Deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue constituted
the order denying the motions for reconsidera­tion filed by Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho's</span> lawyers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
denial-order was undoubtedly received by the respondent Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> because on </span><st1:date year="1953" day="7" month="7"><u><span style="color: windowtext;">July 7, 1953</span></u></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, his counsel wrote another letter addressed to the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue reiterating that he did not own the books and
records seized from the store in <span class="SpellE">Guiuan</span>, </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="color: windowtext;">Samar</span></span></st1:place><span style="color: windowtext;">, upon which the computations of the deficiency tax
were based.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This letter in no way tolled
the time for appeal to the Tax Court, it being <u>pro forma</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same ground had already been alleged in a
pre­<span style="">vious </span>letter by respondent
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho's</span> lawyer dated </span><st1:date year="1953" day="28" month="3"><span style="color: windowtext;">March 28, 1953</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It appears,
therefore, that there was a <u><span style="">decision</span></u><span style=""> </span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="color: windowtext;"> </span><span style="color: windowtext;">rendered by the petitioner Commissioner of Internal
Revenue and also an <u>order</u> </span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="color: windowtext;"> denying the motion for reconsideration of the
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> should have availed of the time provided by law to seek
relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our attention is invited to the
fact that Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> only received on </span><st1:date year="1954" day="25" month="1"><u><span style="color: windowtext;">January 25,
 1954</span></u></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;"> the decision of the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue demanding from him payment of the
P1,128,444.00 as deficiency income tax.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even so this afforded him an opportunity to have the decision of the BIR
Commissioner reviewed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Republic Act No.
1125 creating the Court of Tax Appeals took effect on </span><st1:date year="1954" day="16" month="6"><span style="color: windowtext;">June 16, 1954</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Tax Court
was formally organized on <u>July 21</u> of the same year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although it would seem that respondent
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> had lost his chance to appeal the
disputed assessment, with the enact­ment of Republic Act No. 1125 he was given
another chance to seek relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We held
in the similar cases of Sta. Clara Lumber Co., Inc. vs. Court of Tax Appeals,
G.R. No. L-9833, </span><st1:date year="1957" day="21" month="12"><span style="color: windowtext;">Dec. 21, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, and Lim <span class="SpellE">Tio</span> <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> Hong vs. Court of Tax Appeals, G.R. No. L-10681, </span><st1:date year="1958" day="29" month="3"><span style="color: windowtext;">March 29, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, that such appeal could still be perfected within 30
days from the formal organization of the Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, respondent Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> had until </span><st1:date year="1954" day="21" month="8"><u><span style="color: windowtext;">August 21, 1954</span></u></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;"> within which to perfect his appeal to the Tax Court
and petition for the review of the disputed 1951 deficiency income tax
assessment received by him personally on </span><st1:date year="1954" day="25" month="1"><u><span style="color: windowtext;">January 25, 1954</span></u></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>
did not, however, appeal to the Tax Court on or before </span><st1:date year="1954" day="21" month="8"><span style="color: windowtext;">August 21, 1954</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only
on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="8"><span style="color: windowtext;">August
 25, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;"> that Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This petition was clearly filed
out of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view thereof, the
respondent court had no jurisdiction to try and decide the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">The contention of the counsel for
respondent Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> that the petitioner has not as
yet acted on their motions for reconsideration has no merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner had long acted on their
motions requesting for a reconsideration of the petitioner's decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the action on their motions for
reconsideration was taken in the letter of the Deputy Commissioner of Internal
Revenue dated <u>April 29, 1953</u> where counsel for Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> was advised that in the absence of documentary proofs
to substantiate the allegations contained in his letter, "this office
cannot reconsider its decision holding him liable for the payment of the <span style="">said s</span>ums." It is therefore
incorrect to say that the Internal Revenue Commis­sioner has not finally acted
in case of respondent Vicente <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="color: windowtext;">PREMISES CONSIDERED</span></b><span style="color: windowtext;">, the petition is hereby granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The questioned orders of the respondent Court
