				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In the early evening of <st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="7">July
 3, 1961</st1:date>, as Antonio <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span>, lawyer and columnist-editor of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>'s
leading daily newspaper <u>The Republic News</u>, came out of the Esquire
Barber Shop along <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>
  street</st1:address></st1:street> in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
a man casually sidled alongside and greeted him courteously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acknowledging the greeting but without
changing his normal pace, <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span> proceeded towards
his car, which was parked nearby. He had already entered his car and was about
to start the motor when the same man suddenly whipped out a revolver and pumped
three bullets into him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At practically
point-blank range, all three bullets accurately found their mark:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>two of them penetrated the victim's heart and
death was instantaneous.</p>

<p class="BODY">The news of the <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span> killing spread
like wildfire not only in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> but throughout the
nation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The violent death of <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span>, who was regarded as a leading local citizen, one
whose credentials as a crusading newspaperman had been impressive, arrested the
concern of an awakened public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Local as
well as national police agencies joined hands in tracking down the
perpetrators.</p>

<p class="BODY">About a week after the occurrence, the police received a tip that
two laborers in the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
namely, <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> Mesa, might have had some participation in the
commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First to be
apprehended was <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> Mesa, who, after being duly
investigated, executed a sworn written statement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"GG") relating in detail the incidents of the killing and the extent
of his participation therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his
statement <st1:city><st1:place>Mesa</st1:place></st1:city> admitted that he was
the gunman's companion at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
acknowledged having witnessed the actual shooting and positively identified
Cesar <span class="SpellE">Roble</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
as the one who fired the gun, pursuant to the instruction of a certain
"Toto",<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
who had earlier supplied the fatal weapon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><st1:city><st1:place>Mesa</st1:place></st1:city> also admitted having
received P100.00 from <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span> to buy his
silence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Mesa</st1:place></st1:city>
further declared in his sworn statement that hours before the shooting he and <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span> were taken by Toto to the office of appellant <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>, where the murder plan was finalized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>“Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do
you know what is the true name of Toto and where he works?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
do not know the true name of Toto, but I can recognize him if I see him, and I
know that he is working at the City Hall.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why
do you know that Toto works at the City Hall?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
on July 3, 1961, at about 9:00 o'clock in the morning I and Cesar <span class="SpellE">Roble</span> (<span class="SpellE">Orongan</span>) were brought by
Toto to the Office of <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> at City Hall.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
what reason and object did Toto bring you and Cesar <span class="SpellE">Roble</span>
to the office of <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
did not know because it was only Toto and Cesar <span class="SpellE">Roble</span>
who were talking in whispers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
that morning when you arrived at the City Hall, did you see Cesar <span class="SpellE">Roble</span> and Toto enter the office of <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning
of <st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1961</st1:date>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
saw Toto and Cesar <span class="SpellE">Roble</span> enter the office of <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> and I was outside.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Who
is this whom you call <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> at the City Hall?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
do not know <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>, but at the Office which Toto and
Cesar entered, I saw a name '<span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>' and below 'Trea­surer'."
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "GG-1", p. 2)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Armed with this information, the police arrested <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When asked if he was the "Toto"
mentioned by <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> Mesa, <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span>
promptly denied that he was the same person.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, when brought before <st1:city><st1:place>Mesa</st1:place></st1:city>
for confrontation, <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> broke down and confessed
that he had been ordered by city treasurer Felipe B. <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>
to contact a killer who would shoot <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span> for a
reward of P400.00, because <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span> had been relent­lessly
attacking him (<span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>) in <u>The Republic News</u>
regarding the "garbage can scandal".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> also pointed to appellant <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> as the mastermind of the killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His disclosures were finally embodied in a
written sworn statement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "MM"), part
of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do
you know where Antonio <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span>
is now?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
know, he is already dead.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do
you know why Antonio <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span>
died?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
know, sir, because last May Mr. <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> started
ordering me to kill him that I could not do it, Sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Look for one of your friends', but I did not
look for anyone who could do it because I was afraid to be implicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then on June Mr. <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>
kept on scolding and insulting me because I did not look for anyone since I was
afraid to be implicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the end of
June he again reprimanded me because I did not look for anyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I told him 'Sir, please pity me; I may
be implicated and I have a family', and he said 'just tell them if they happen
to be apprehended they should just own the crime because they were mad at
someone, because if I am implicated who is going to spend during the trial. . .
' </blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do
you know the reason why Mr. <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> ordered you to
kill Antonio <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span> in
the month of May?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>
said that Mario Ortiz cannot also publish if it were not for that beast <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, he
was continuously attacked in The <u>Republic News</u>, regarding the garbage
can.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What Mr. <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>
said was 'what do I have to do with the garbage can since that came from <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
that <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span> is certainly crazy'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
you comply with the order of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> to look for
one of your friends who could kill Antonio <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>. . . "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> then proceeded to narrate, in
the same sworn statement, the events leading to the search for an assassin, how
the killing was to be subsequently carried out and the manner of its actual
execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also gave the information
that the gun used for the purpose came from <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>,
to whom he returned it after getting it back from <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A search was thereupon launched to locate the weapon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Properly armed with search warrants earlier
issued by <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City Judge <span class="SpellE">Maambong</span>,
a seven-men team composed of an agent of the National Bureau of Investigation
(NBI), city policemen and Philippine Constabulary soldiers, proceeded to the
house of <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were received by <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> himself, who did
not register any protest against the projected search.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the team leader, PC Captain <span class="SpellE">Bianzon</span>, suggested that the search be first conducted at
appellant's City Hall office, since at that early hour<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
there would be no employees and kibitzers to hamper them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> went along
and was cooperative enough to open his desk drawers as well as those of his
employees, and even the bigger one of his two steel safes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, because he said he could not
remember the proper lock combination of the smaller safe near his desk, the
search of the premises was temporarily suspended and the team repaired back to
his house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, the unopened safe
was sealed and guards were posted to keep watch over it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The search was continued at the house, after which the party
returned to his office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> was able to open the small safe after casually
consulting a memorandum notebook he took from his shirt pocket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among the articles found inside was a .32
caliber revolver COLT, SN-200425 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"O"), which the prosecution later on established as the gun used in
the killing.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, a combined force of police-PC<u>-</u>NBI men
went on a hunt for <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span>, finally locating and
arresting him on <st1:date year="1961" day="13" month="7">July 13, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They frisked him and found a wallet which
contained a piece of paper on which was written "<span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span>, c/o Treasurer's Office, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>."
<span class="SpellE">Orongan</span> told the arresting officers that <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> had given him that piece of paper so that he would
know where to get in touch with <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> should he, <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span>, ever be in need of money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inter­rogated by the NBI, <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span>
made a clean breast of his part in the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His sworn statements were reduced to writing and then duly signed (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "KK"), substantially corroborating
statements previously given by <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> and <st1:city><st1:place>Mesa</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that the .32 Caliber revolver he used
had been furnished him by <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span>; that he killed <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span> in consideration of the sum of P400.00; that he
received the money from <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> when the latter took
back the revolver from him; and that he shot <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span>
on orders of <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span>, who told him about having an
"understanding” with his boss.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do
you know any person here in the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> whose name is Toto <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why
do you know him?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
he was always in the pier riding boats.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
was that when you knew him in the pier?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
was quite a long time ago and possibly three or two years now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But his real name I did not know, yet.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
did you actually know his real name?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
was during the incident because he left me an address.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
do you mean during the incident?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
I shot because they ordered me.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Who
was that person shot and who ordered?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
person shot was Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span> and the one who
ordered me was <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span>
because he had an understanding with his boss.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Who
do you mean his boss?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
is <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Who
is that <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
boss of Toto in his office in the City Hall.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>. . . <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>. . .<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>.

<p class="BODY">Primarily on the strength of the foregoing written statements and
the other evidence so far obtained, Felipe B. <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> Mesa and <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span> were charged with the crime of murder in the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The information, dated July 24, 1961, al­leged
conspiracy "with the attendant qualifying circumstance of treachery, and
the aggravating circumstances of:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
evident premeditation, (2) <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span>, (3) taking
advantage of superior strength or employing means to weaken the defense, (4)
with the aid of armed men or persons to insure or afford impunity, and (5) in
consideration of a price, reward, or promise."</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment on <st1:date year="1961" day="4" month="8">August
 4, 1961</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span>
pleaded guilty and was accordingly sentenced, on the following August 11, to
"life imprisonment with all the accessories of the law, to indemnify the
heirs of the deceased Antonio <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span> in the sum of P6,000.00 and to pay his proportionate
share of the costs." <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span> has since been
serving his sen­tence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other defendants, <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>, <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> and <st1:city><st1:place>Mesa</st1:place></st1:city>,
pleaded not guilty and trial proceeded with respect to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case for the prosecution, as established
by the evidence, is graphically and accurately restated in the decision of the
trial court (Judge Amador Gomez, presiding) as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That as columnist editor
of <u>The Republic News</u>, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span> had been conducting a vigorous and relentless
crusade for clean government and official morality, and an uncompromising
indictment of all forms of official venalities, graft, corruption, abuses, and
excesses;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the accused Felipe
B. <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>, City Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
particularly was the butt of strong and vitriolic comments and editorials of <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span> in <u>The Republic News</u> covering the period from
September 13, 1960 up to July 1, 1961, or two days before he was shot to death,
as may be gleaned in the various issues and numerous articles, comments and
editorials in the said news­paper, . . .</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in those articles
and editor­ials <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span> in no uncertain terms put in
question the honesty of the accused Felipe B. <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>
as City Treasurer, and vehemently urged that he be both administratively and
criminally investigated</blockquote>

<blockquote>a) for . . . receiving substantial amounts in the form of
‘kickbacks' and thereby profiting personally in the anomalous transaction to
the detriment of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>b) for the overpricing of office supplies. . .; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>c) hospitalization loan anomalies,. . .;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That there were even
insinuations in the columns of <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span> that the money
thus acquired by <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> from those sources were used
in buying properties and registered in the name of Aurora B. <span class="SpellE">Reynoso</span>, allegedly an employee in the Office of the City
Treasurer with whom <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> maintained illicit
relations;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in the face of the
continuous and persistent blasts of <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span> against
him in the newspaper, the accused Felipe B. <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>
felt that <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span> was out to destroy him and would not
stop until he is removed from office and/or put to jail;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That exposed thereby
almost daily to public humiliation by <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span> in his
unrelenting campaign in the newspaper for his investigation and prosecution,
Felipe B. <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> finally arrived at the conclusion
that the elimination of <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span> was the only solution;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the accused Felipe
B. <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> had a confidant and a bodyguard in the per­son
of his co-accused <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span>,
who was employed in his office, and who had been enjoying his protection
despite the fact that he was a police character;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That since May, 1961
Felipe B. <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> has already been urging <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span>, to eliminate
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span>
himself, but the latter told him that he could not do it, where­upon <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> urged <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> to look for
one among his friends who would not be afraid to kill <span class="SpellE">Tor­mis</span>,
but <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> still declined because he was, afraid to
be implicated;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on June, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> kept on scolding and insulting <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span>
for not helping him eliminate <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span>, and so <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> contacted one Fernando <span class="SpellE">Frecillas</span>
alias <span class="SpellE">Pandot</span>, a notorious underworld character in the
waterfront and asked the latter point-blank whether he had the guts to kill
somebody for a reward, but <span class="SpellE">Pandot</span> declined, saying he
could not kill a man who is not his enemy; <span class="SpellE">Pandot</span>,
however, suggested that one Cesar, also a waterfront character, might be
disposed to do so;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <span class="SpellE">Pandot</span> further told <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> that Cesar could be contacted by <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> Mesa who happened to be near the two of them at the
time, and who allegedly was the constant com­panion of Cesar;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“11.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Mesa</st1:place></st1:city>
accompanied <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span>
to the house of Cesar at Villa-<span class="SpellE">Abono</span>, and once there <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> asked Cesar if
he had the guts to kill for a reward, and Cesar answered in the affirmative;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"12.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then that
Cesar <span class="SpellE">Roble</span> (whose true name is <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Orongan</span>) agreed to do the killing of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span> for the sum of

<p class="BODY">The question raised in the first assignment of error is
essentially factual:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>whether or not the
extrajudicial confessions of <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> Mesa, <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span> were voluntarily
given.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both Mesa and <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span>
testi­fied at the trial that they confessed because they were sub­jected to
physical maltreatment and torture.</p>

<p class="BODY">The general rule, based on logic and experience, is that the
findings of the judge who tried the case and heard the witnesses are not
disturbed on appeal, unless there are substantial facts and circumstances which
have been over­looked and which, if properly considered, might affect the
result of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to Mesa's extrajudicial confession, the following
observations of the trial court are both pertinent and convincing:</p>

<blockquote>"Actually there is hardly anything damaging to the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> Mesa in that
written statement, Exhibit "GG", except his having been in the
company of <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span> until shortly before the actual
shooting of <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span>, his having received P100.00 from <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span>, and his having been in possession of the hunting
knife, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "W", which was originally the
weapon inten­ded to be used in stabbing <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That statement of <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span>
Mesa is obviously too tame and too innocuous insofar as he himself is concerned
to make likely and credible the claim that he made during the trial of the case
when he testified that, to extort that statement from him, the Police, led by
no less than their Chief, <span class="SpellE">Higinio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacaña</span>,
and their assistant Chief, Major <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Arnejo</span>, had to punch him repeatedly at the solar plexus,
apply the so-called 'hi-fi' treat­ment of spurting into his nostrils the car­bonated
soft drink '7-Up', torturing him by squeezing his testicles, thereby causing
him to gasp laboriously for breath, threaten to kill him by putting the muzzle
of their guns in his mouth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
Police did resort to such brutality to secure a written statement from <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> Mesa, it does not stand to reason that they would
have been satisfied with the answers given by <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span>
Mesa which are evasive insofar as he is concerned,. . . it is evident that he
(Mesa) was exempting himself from any guilty knowledge of the plan and
conspiracy to kill <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The yield is too <span class="SpellE">disappoitingly</span>
meager for the </u>(alleged) <u>excessive display of brutality and inhumanity
on the part of the Police</u>,. . ."</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Obviously, <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> Mesa's imputation of
violence, maltreatment, threats, and intimi­dation against the police
authorities is not characterized by spontaneity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has allowed a period of almost one year to
lapse before making a revelation thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He has had four previous opportunities of appearing before judges in the
months of July and August in the year 1961, when the events were still fresh,
and yet he made no such charge or complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He first appeared before Judge Joaquin T. <span class="SpellE">Maambong</span>
on July 11, 1961 at 1:15 p.m.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on
July 20, 1961 he appeared be­fore Judge Jose Mendoza in connection with the Ha­beas
Corpus proceedings, Sp. Proc. No. 2172-R "RRR"), not only in open
Court but also in chambers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on July
24, 1961 at 2:55 p.m. he appeared before Judge <span class="SpellE">Maambong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fourth time was before the presiding
judge of this Court on the occasion of his arraignment on August 4, 1961."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The same observations also hold true with respect to <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had several opportunities, from the time
he was arrested to the day of the trial, to complain about the alleged physical
violence inflicted upon him, but he chose to wait for about a year before doing
so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said the Court:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span>
has executed and sworn to more documents than has co-accused <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> Mesa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He not
only executed the extrajudicial confessions, <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
'LLL' and 'MM', on July 11 and 16, 1961, respectively, and the request he made to
the PC Provincial Commander for protective custody, EXH. 'NNN', on July 11,
1961, but he also executed the deposition, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'KK',
on July 12, 1961 in connection with the application of the police authorities
for the issuance of a warrant for the search in the residential house of Felipe
B. <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> and in his office as City Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> at the City Hall for the revolver allegedly used in
the shooting of the late Antonio <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> has therefore
appeared four different times in the month of July 1961 before the Municipal
Judge, Hon. Joaquin T. <span class="SpellE">Maambong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Each time he confirmed the contents of the
documents which he in fact subscribed and swore to before the judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not once did he complain to him against the
police authorities for alleged maltreatment in securing any of those statements
from him</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then not long thereafter
during that same month of July, 1961, General Campo, Chief of the Philippine
Constabulary no less, came to <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> and visited <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> and Mesa in the PC stockade, and made direct in­quiries
from them about the treatment they had been receiving from the police author­ities,
and <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span>
testified before this Court that he told the General they had no complaint, and
that they had been receiving good treatment.+++ Then on August 4, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span>, like <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> Mesa, also appeared before this Court on the
occasion of his arraignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was then
told of his rights under the law to have the assistance of counsel to defend
him at every stage of the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> never complained to this Court then of any alleged
maltreat­ment that he has received from the police."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span>,
the confessed gunman, aside from executing his extrajudicial confession also
tes­tified during the trial, the question of the <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span>
of his extrajudicial confession has little relevancy under the first assigned
error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His part in the killing will be
more extensively dealt with later.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the main we see no valid reason to differ with the trial court
in its conclusions regarding the manner the extra-judicial confessions were
taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are replete with details
known exclusively to the <span class="SpellE">declarants</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The narrations reflect <span class="SpellE">spontaniety</span>
and coherence, and the response to every question is so fully informative, in
many instances going beyond what the question calls for, as to indicate that
the mind of the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span> was free from extraneous
compulsion or restraint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are thus
satisfied that the confessions, viewed objectively and in the light of the
testimony of the officers who took them and before whom they were signed, were
voluntary given.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People vs. Cruz, 73
Phil. 615.)</p>

<p class="BODY">One additional factor militates against <span class="SpellE">Monzolin's</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Besa's</span> claim of maltreatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Fe <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>, a
doctor in the Southern Islands Hospital, testified that in the early hours of <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1961</st1:date>, those two were brought
to her by the police, and in her capacity as the medico-legal officer on duty
she examined them physically.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She found
no traces of physical injury on their persons, nor did they complain of
any.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although another physician in the
same hospital, Ruben <span class="SpellE">Arquillano</span>, also testified and
said that the physical examination made by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>
was rather haphazard, not much weight can be accorded to his testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His opinion as to how Dr. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>
conducted the physical examination is at best subjective; and in any case even
a casual examination would have revealed signs of maltreatment, if there were
any, or at least elicited some complaint of pain and discomfort from the
persons being examined.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second error assigned touches on the admissibility of the
extrajudicial confessions of <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Mesa</st1:place></st1:city>
and <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span> as evidence against appellant <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is urged
that even granting that they were voluntarily made, they may not be used
against <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> because "x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> it is a fundamental rule of evidence that
confessions are admissible only against the makers".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be borne in mind, however, that the
said confessions, while not admissible as <u>proof in themselves of specific
acts</u> imputed to <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>, may be taken into
consideration as strongly indicative of the truth of the other evidence against
him, particularly the testimony of the confessed trigger-man, <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prevailing rule is that in the absence of collusion among the
<span class="SpellE">declarants</span>, their confessions should be read together
in order to form a complete picture of the whole situation and to consider them
collectively as corroborative or confirmatory of what evidence there is apart
from the confessions them­selves.</p>

<blockquote>"Extrajudicial confessions, independ­ently made without
collusion, which are identical with each other in their essential details and
are corroborated by other evi­dence on record, are admissible as circums­tantial
evidence against the person implicated to show the probability of the latter's
actual participation in the commission of the crime." (People v. <span class="SpellE">Condemena</span>, et al., L-22426, May 29, 1968; 23 SCRA 910)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The case against the appellant is largely based on the evidence
given by Cesar <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span> at the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His credibility is assailed with
understandable vehemence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it is that
credibility that finds strong support in his own previous extra-judicial
confession as well as in the confessions of <st1:city><st1:place>Mesa</st1:place></st1:city>
and <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Above all, <span class="SpellE">Orongan's</span> plea of guilt and
willingness to pay for his crime is a well-nigh conclusive proof of the truth
of his confession and, by the same token, of his testimony on the witness
stand.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Orongan's</span> testimony has been accurately
summarized by the trial court as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"(1) That it was a Friday, the end of the month of June, 1961
when he was first sought by <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> Mesa and <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> in his house at
Villa-<span class="SpellE">Abono</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) That <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> feted him to eats and
drinks that day and also the succeeding day;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) That it was on their second meeting that <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span>
first told him about his 'boss' in the City Hall having an enemy whom he wanted
to kill;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4) That <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> left that evening for <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place> and came back on Monday morning, <st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1961</st1:date>;</blockquote>

at the latter's house that day, and at <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 p.m.</st1:time>
they went to the City Hall;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(6) While they stood there waiting for <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span>
Mesa, an automobile arrived, and <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> told <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span> that the man in the car was his 'boss';</blockquote>

<blockquote>(7) <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> approached the car and
opened the door thereof, and the person who stepped out of it was the accused
Felipe B. <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>;</blockquote>

his 'boss', while <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span> remained out­side still
waiting for <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> Mesa;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(9) A short while after, <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> stepped
down, and the two of them proceeded to the waterfront, as <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span>
claimed he would look for his elder brother and a nephew in the boat DOÑA
REMEDIOS;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(10) Then at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o'clock</st1:time>
the two of them went back to the City Hall;</blockquote>

the arrival of <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> Mesa;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(12) After a short while, <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span>
stepped out again, and the two proceeded to a store in front of the City Hall,
where <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> ordered tuba and beer;</blockquote>

up and joined the two;</blockquote>

evening;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(15) <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span> hesitated for a while, but <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> urged him to go ahead and promised that he would
be given work and money;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(16) <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span> yielded, but he suggested
that instead of shooting he would just use a hunting knife in the projected
killing;</blockquote>

the City Hall;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the fourth assignment of error the appellant impugns the
testimonies of four witnesses for the prosecution:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City Police
Major <span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermosisima</span>,
an employee of the Treasurer's Office named <span class="SpellE">Lauro</span> <span class="SpellE">Cauba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City Police Captain <span class="SpellE">Nicomedes</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacalso</span> and City Judge
Joaquin T. <span class="SpellE">Maambong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Major <span class="SpellE">Hermosisima</span> declared that <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> was jittery and nervous when the search for the
fatal gun was being conducted in his office; <span class="SpellE">Cauba</span>,
that he had seen <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> carrying things for <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>; Captain <span class="SpellE">Bacalso</span>, that <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> inquired from him in an angry manner as to the
whereabouts of <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> after the latter was
arrested; and Judge <span class="SpellE">Maambong</span>, that he examined both <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> and Mesa in connection with their respective
confessions and that they voluntarily affirmed the same before him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no reason to brand the testimonies of
these witnesses as false.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts to
which they testified, although merely tangential to the main issue, render the
main evidence against appellant so much more entitled to credence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fifth and sixth errors assigned refer to the identi­ty of
Exhibit O - the gun found in <span class="SpellE">Pareja's</span> possession - as
the one used in the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The identification is challenged by the appellant on the strength of the
opinion of his expert witness<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
that the bullets recovered from the body of the victim fail to produce
"identifying marks sufficient enough (sic) to show that the same had been
fired from the barrel of the (alleged) fatal gun." This opinion is
contradicted by the ballistics expert for the prosecution, Attorney <span class="SpellE">Osmundo</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>, the chief
ballistician of the National Bureau of Investigation, who examined the same
bullets and came to the conclusion that two of them (the third one was deformed
beyond identification) came from the gun in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respective reports of the two experts are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>GALANG REPORT, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "YY"</blockquote>

exhibit bullets x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> in
relation to the exhibit firearm and the test bullets obtained <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> due to the insufficiency of consistent individual
characteristic identifying marks.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The exhibit .32 caliber lead re­volver marked "H-2" is
badly damaged beyond identification."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As correctly noted by the trial court, the main conflict in the
foregoing reports proceeds from a divergence of views as to what is necessary
for a positive finding that a certain bullet has been fired from a particular
gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lieutenant Molina would require the
striations on the evidence bullet to flow into or coincide with the striations
all around the circum­ference of the test bullet; Attorney <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>
disagrees, and maintains that the presence of at least eight (8) congruent
striations in the two bullets would justify the conclusion that the evidence
bullet and the test bullet have been fired through the barrel of the same
gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of his con­clusion,
Attorney <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> cites the following authorities:</p>

<blockquote>"Complete identity between all the <span class="SpellE">striae</span>
in any one rifling above groove of one bullet and all the <span class="SpellE">striae</span>
in the corres­ponding rifling groove of another bullet probably NEVER
OCCURS." (Forensic Chemistry and Scientific Criminal Investigation by A.
Lucas, 1946 Edition, p. 228)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Perfect correspondence between all <span class="SpellE">striae</span>
is not required for proof of iden­tity, and in fact is not to be expected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A correspondence between major <span class="SpellE">striae</span>, general gross contour, and a reasonable number of
finer <span class="SpellE">striae</span> will prove identity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No two bullets encounter precisely the same
conditions in passing through a bore, nor do the corresponding <span class="SpellE">striae</span> always appear at the same lengthwise position on
identi­cal specimens." (An Introduction to Tool Marks, Firearm and the <span class="SpellE">Striagraph</span> by John B. Davies, 1958 Edition, p. 146).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If a sufficient number of individual characteristics
correspond when comparing fatal bullets with test bullets, it is then possible
for the firearms identification technician to render an opinion in answer to
the question, 'Did this gun fire this particular bullet?'" (Homicide
Investigation by Le <span class="SpellE">Mayne</span> Snyder, 1959 edition, p.
161)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We are satisfied as to Attorney <span class="SpellE">Galang's</span>
qualifications as a ballistics expert, and accept, as did the trial court, his
conclusion with respect to the identity of the gun from which the fatal bullets
were fired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one thing, he was a
disinterested witness. Lieutenant Molina, on the other hand, was admittedly a
hired expert for the defense, who was paid P3,000 for his report, aside from
his expenses in attending the trial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Bias, therefore, could have conceivably colored his opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, while Attorney <span class="SpellE">Galang's</span>
opinion is positive and categorical, all that Lieutenant Molina can say is that
he cannot make a definite conclusion, one way or the other, because "there
are no identifying marks <u>sufficient enough</u> to show x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>" that the fatal bullets had been fired from
the evidence gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He does not make any
clear statement as to what identifying marks would be sufficient for a positive
finding, although apparently he would require a congruence of <u>all</u> the
striations of the test and evidence bullets in order to be able to arrive at
such a conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On a similar question
this Court had occasion to observe:</p>

<blockquote>"At this point, it may be well to refer to certain elementary
principles of ballistics.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The barrel of
a gun is bored with a cylindrical steel which leaves inside the bore a rifling
of spiral character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rifling
produces grooves - and lands on the bore which are impressed upon the bullet
that passes through the barrel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These impressions
or striations identify the gun from which a bullet is fired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To determine, therefore, whether or not a
bullet is fired from a certain gun, it is compared with test bullets that are
actually fired from that gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
striations appearing on the test bullets match or marry with the striations
appearing on the bullet in question the conclusion is that the latter bullet
has been fired from the said gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
stria­tions, being minute scratches, can be seen under a compound microscope
and may be reproduced in photographs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>If
eight or more scratches or <span class="SpellE">strations</span> coincide, they
are sufficient ground for identifica­tion</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"(People
v. <span class="SpellE">Timbol</span>, XI Lawyers Journal, pp. 109, 113)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Attorney <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>, by means of several
comparison charts, pointed to at least eight (8) striations in the fatal
bullets, running from one end to the other, which correspond to the striations
in the test bullets.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, whatever doubt there might still be, not­withstanding
the evidence given by said expert, is erased beyond peradventure by the
positive identification of the death gun by the confessed triggerman, <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the penultimate error assigned, the appellant vigorously
insists that the trial court erred in holding that there was conspiracy among
the accused in the killing of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We find this claim negated by the established facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">The acts of the accused, collectively and individually
considered, have clearly demonstrated the existence of a common design towards
the accomplishment of the same unlawful end.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> had the primary motive, and
was the instigator of the crime, who provided both the fatal weapon and
monetary reward to persuade <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span> to accept the role of executioner; <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span> acted as the
contact man between <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> and <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span>
and the one who took charge of the details as to how the killing was to be
effected; and <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> Mesa actively assumed the role
of look-out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their respective individual
participations were geared towards a unifying purpose - to kill <span class="SpellE">Tormis</span>, and so all of them were correctly held liable as
principals (see People v. <span class="SpellE">Jaravata</span>, et al., L-22029, <st1:date year="1967" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1967</st1:date>; 20 SCRA 1014).</p>

<blockquote>"Once an express or implied conspiracy is proved, all of the
conspirators are liable as co-principals regardless of the extent and character
of their respective active participation in the commission of the crime or
crimes perpetrated in further­ance of the conspiracy because in contempla­tion
of law the act of one is the act of all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The foregoing rule is anchored on the sound principle that 'when two or
more persons unite to accomplish a criminal object, whether through the
physical volition of one, or all, proceeding severally or col­lectively, each
individual whose evil will actively contributes to the wrong-doing is in law
responsible for the whole, the same as though performed by himself alone."
(People v. Peralta, et al., L-19069, October 29, 1968; 25 SCRA 759)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The commission of the crime was attended by two (2)
circumstances, namely, treachery and that the killing was committed in
consideration of a price or reward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of
these two circumstances, either would suffice to qualify the crime as murder
(Art. 248, RPC).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court appre­ciated
the latter as the qualifying circumstances but re­fused to consider treachery
even as a generic aggravating circumstances against appellant, on the ground
that he was not present when the crime was actually committed, and left the
means, modes or methods of its commission to a great extent to the discretion
of the others, citing People vs. De Otero, 51 Phil. 201,</p>

<p class="BODY">The citation is not in point.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It refers to a case where the accused was convicted as principal by
inducement <u>per</u> <u>se</u> under paragraph 2 of Article 17 of the Revised
Penal Code, without proof of conspiracy with the other accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, however, there was
conspiracy among the defendants, and the rule is that every conspirator is
responsible for the acts of the others in furtherance of the conspiracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Treachery - evident in the act of the gunman
in suddenly firing his revolver, preceded as it was by a false showing of
courtesy to the victim, thus insuring the execution of the crime without risk
from any defense or retaliation the victim might offer - should be appreciated
as a generic aggravating circumstance against appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court considered evident premeditation as an
aggravating circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except in the
sense that there is always some element of premeditation when reward is offered
for the commission of a crime, in which case the latter circumstance absorbs
the former, we do not feel justi­fied, for technical reasons, in considering
evident premeditation as a separate and independent aggravating circumstance
herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence in this respect
consists of the extrajudicial confession of <span class="SpellE">Monzolin</span>,
confidant and bodyguard of appellant, to the effect that for about a month before
<span class="SpellE">Tormis</span> was killed appellant had been giving orders to
<span class="SpellE">Mon­zolin</span> to look for someone to do the killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, as already pointed out, such confession
is not admissible to prove specific acts of appellant, and has been taken into
account, together with the confessions of the two other defendants, only as
corroborative and confirmatory of the testimony of Cesar <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span>,
which, however, is insufficient to establish evident premeditation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is this circumstance to be neces­sarily
deduced from the existence of conspiracy in this case, for the former is not
inherent in the latter (People vs. Peralta, 25 SCRA 759, 787; People vs.
Mendoza, 91 Phil. 58; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Iturriaga</span>, 47 O. G.
166; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Lesada</span>, 70 Phil. 525.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Strictly speaking, the trial court's appreciation of the
mitigating circumstance of passion and obfuscation, as a result of the
newspaper articles written by the victim assailing appellant's official
integrity, is an error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this
mitigating circumstance to exist the act producing the obfuscation must be so
proximate, in point of time, to the commission of the crime as to preclude a
sober realization of the wrongfulness of the course of action about to be
taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not true in the case of
appellant, for the publication of the offending articles covered an appreciable
period long enough for pause and reflection.</p>

<p class="BODY">The presence of one (1) aggravating circumstance without any
mitigating circumstance to offset it would justify the imposition of the
maximum of the penalty provided by law, which is <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>
in its maximum period to death (Art. 248, RPC).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, only seven members of this Court, which is one short of the
number required by law, voted affirmatively for that purpose.</p>
