result of the burning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The decision of the trial
court finding the appellant guilty of the crime charged in the information is
based mainly on the two extrajudicial confessions of the appellant, Exhibits A
and C.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present appeal, counsel
for the appellant contends that the lower court erred in finding the appellant
guilty on the basis of </span>those con<span style="">fessions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We have examined the
record very carefully, and <span class="GramE">We</span> find that the lower
court has not committed the error pointed to by appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Testifying in his own
behalf in the court below the appellant admitted that he had a grievance against
the owner of the apartment, but denied having set fire to the </span>apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He <span style="">claimed
in the court below, and he insists in this appeal, that he had to make and sign
the state­ments presented against him, and he had to reenact the crime, because
of the force and violence applied on him by the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the appellant, when he was turned
over to the arson division of the Manila </span>Police Department, the
investigators <span style="">slapped and kicked him;
that due to his sickness, and afraid that he might vomit blood it subjected to
further torture, he wrote his confession, Exhibit C, as dictated to him by
Captain <span class="SpellE">Giron</span>; that with regard </span>to <span style="">his statement, Exhibit A, all </span>that are
<span style="">stated therein, except his name and
personal circumstances, were supplied by the police investigators; that when he
sub­scribed and swore to said statement before Assistant Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> <span class="SpellE">Barbosa</span>, he affirmed the
truth of its contents because he was accompanied by one of the policemen; and
that he did not reveal the fact of his having been mal­treated to </span>the
newspaper reporters, nor to the <span style="">fiscal,
or to any one, because his idea was to expose the matter when he would testify
in court, as he would then be free from harm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the other hand, the
police investigators who testified for the prosecution denied having obtained
the con­fessions of the appellant through violence or intimidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These witnesses testified that the statements
of the appellant were given by him freely and voluntarily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimonies of the police investigators
were bolstered </span>by the testimony of Rodolfo T. Reyes, a reporter of <span style="">the </span>"Manila Times", who was
also presented by the appellant as his own witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rodolfo T. Reyes testified that he and other
newspapermen <span style="">saw
</span>the appellant write his confession (Exhibit C), without dictation from
Captain <span class="SpellE">Giron</span>; that he did not see any sign of injury
on the face, nor on any part of the body, of the appellant;<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
that the <span style="">appellant did not </span>complain
<span style="">to him, or to any of the </span>reporters
present, at the time when <span style="">he was
writing his confession </span>and during the reenactment of the crime, regarding
any maltreatment received by him from the police investigators; <span style="">and that </span>the appellant reenacted the
crime voluntarily <span style="">and without
hesitation.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We hold that </span>the lower
court did not err when it did not give credence to the <span style="">claim of appellant that his extra-</span>judicial confessions were
extracted from him through force or intimidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no reason to alter the <span style="">findings </span>of the lower court that the
confessions of the appellant were given by him voluntarily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a settled rule that the findings of
fact <span style="">by the trial court should </span>not
be disturbed on appeal unless it is shown that the trial court had overlooked
certain facts of weight and importance, <span style="">it
</span>being acknowledged that the court below, having seen and heard the
witnesses during the trial, is in a better posit<span style="">ion to </span>evaluate <span style="">their
testimonies.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>It is also <span style="">a settl</span>ed rule that a confession is admissible as evidence, and
it is presumed to be voluntary until the contrary is shown<span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Before a confession can be set aside,
both the confession and the reasons or motives given for its repudiation should
be carefully scrutinized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be an
unsound practice for the court to disregard the confession of an accused simply
because the accused repudiates it during the trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case now before <span class="GramE">Us</span>, except for
appellant’s testimony repudiating his confessions, no other evidence was
adduced to show that the statements in the confessions were obtained through
force or intimidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary,
appellant's claim of torture is belied by an abun­dance or evidence showing
that his confession, Exhibit C, was written by him under circumstances which
preclude any doubt as to the <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> of his
act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">More so, because
he wrote and signed the confession in the presence of reporters of the
metropolitan newspapers.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
other confession, Exhibit A, was subscribed and sworn to by the appellant
before an assistant city fiscal of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
and it was not shown at all that appellant ever hesitated or refused to sign
and swear to the same, much less did he protest to the fiscal regarding the way
he was investigated.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
We have noted that the statements of the appellant in answer to the questions
in Exhibit A are responsive and informative.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The statements mention details which only the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span>
could have furnished, and could not have been concocted by the investigators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, the appellant stated details
regarding his educational attainments; regarding the demolition of his
improvised room in the apartment as a result of which he lost P70.00 in cash
and P10.00 <span class="SpellE">owrth</span> of medicine; regarding his having
filed a complaint against Mrs. Tierra, the owner or the apartment, in the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> office; regarding the fact that due to his illness
he had not been drinking wine for almost 6 months because his doctor prohibited
him from doing so; and regarding the fact that after burning the apartment he
went to <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, thence to <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>,
aria thereafter to <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, where he surrendered to
the Municipal Mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot believe
that the investigators could fabricate those particulars, and that they are so
perverted and depraved as to conspire together to falsely impute to an innocent
man the commission of a very grave offense.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the observation of the trial court that appellant's
grievance against Mrs. Tierra must have driven him to burn the apartment, but
when overcome by remorse or conscience because those who perished in the fire
were his friends and acquaintances, he voluntarily confessed his criminal act;
and realizing later the grave implications of his confessions, it must have
occurred to him, as an afterthought, to repudiate the same and assert his
innocence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense contends that the appellant could not have committed<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
the crime because of the alleged impossibility for the appellant to enter the
building and set it afire, and that there was no eyewitness who pointed to him
as the one who set the building on fire.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This pretension of the defense deserves no consideration in the face of
clear evidence that the appellant had confessed voluntarily his commission of
the crime, and his confession is supported by the <u>corpus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicti</u></span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Well established is the rule that it is not necessary that an eyewitness should
testify on having seen the accused committing the crime, of had seen him under
circumstances indicating his having committed <span style="">the crime, </span>before the accused may be held liable under his own
confession.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We find the decision of the lower court to be in accordance with
law and the evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with
costs against defendant-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
