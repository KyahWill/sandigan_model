<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Original petition for a writ of <i style="">mandamus</i> to compel the General Manager of the Government Service
Insurance System (GSIS for short) to approve the application of Pablo R. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> for retirement and to order payment of P1,500.00
attorneys' fees plus costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The basic facts, so far as material, appear to be that while holding
the position of Chief Accountant II of the Central Luzon Agricultural College
(hereinafter termed CLAC for brevity's sake), petitioner <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
was charged by Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Saplaco</span>, Supply Officer of
the same institution, with dishonesty through misrepresentation of his
educational attainments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Board of
Trustees of the CLAC had Aquino investigated by a committee which reported as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Complainant also presented Exhibits "F" and
"G" re respondent’s Information Sheets, which clearly showed, that in
answer to item 6, respondent placed 4th year as the highest grade attained at
the Manila West High School and that for his college education said respondent
wrote BTCS as the college share he obtained his BSC (Bachelor of Science in
Commerce), Exhibit "G" which was an amendment of Exhibit
"F", likewise showed that respondent consistently maintained that he
was a graduate of the MWHS in 1926.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In support of his charges of dishonesty through misrepresentation
complainant presented Exhibit "H" respondents' application for
Examination for the first grade (C.S. Form I) dated <st1:date year="1950" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1950</st1:date>, filed under oath wherein
respondent stated that he was a high school graduate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No evidence was presented on the alleged
misrepresentation of the respondent for the 2nd grade examination.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Respondent for his defense claimed that he never
misrepresented himself to be a high school graduate nor a holder of a BSC
degree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He explained that he put 4th
year and BSC in his Information Sheet because that is the equivalent of his training
and experience in the government service and it is even equal to his being a
degree holder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent, however,
admitted during the investigation that he finished only the Third Year of high
school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He enrolled in the 4th year but
did not continue the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That he put
BSC as his educational attainment in Exhibit "F" and to his applica­tion
for examination in the belief that he is a BSC holder not by actual graduation
from school but merely because of experience in the government service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent said that was the very reason why
he filed a second Information Sheet (Exhibit "C").</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent's explanation is not satisfactory, in the face of
evidence and his virtual admission that he has not finished the high school nor
graduated from the college with any degree and taking into account his
consistent representation in various government records that he was a high
school graduate and a holder of a Bachelor of Science in Commerce degree, this
Committee finds him guilty of misrepresentation on three counts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Committee, however, finds no evidence of
mis­representation at the time respondent took the Civil Service examination
for the 2nd grade.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view of all the foregoing, the Committee respectfully
recommends that respondent be considered resigned effective his last day of
service with pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering, however,
the long service which the respondent has served in the government it is also
recommended that his resignation be considered without prejudice to whatever
retirement benefit he may be entitled. 'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Committee's report was approved by the Board of Trustees, and
accordingly, it resolved (Res. No. 1076, Aug. 26, 1962)</p>

<blockquote>"that Mr. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
be considered resigned effective his last day of service with pay and that his
resignation be considered without prejudice to whatever retirement benefits he
may be entitled, subject to the availability of funds."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> then
applied for retirement with gratuity under Commonwealth Act 188 and Republic
Act No. 1616, with the GSIS, and his applica­tion was endorsed by the President
of the Agricultural College, stating that "this Office has no objection to
the retirement of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> under Republic Act No.
1616" (Petition, Annex D).</p>

<p class="BODY">The General Manager of the GSIS, however, declared that since <span class="SpellE">Aquino's</span> administrative penalty of being considered
resigned was deemed an involuntary separation from the service, which has the
same effect as separation for cause, <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> was not
eligible for retirement benefits, but was only entitled to refund of the
retirement premiums paid by him (Petition, Annex E).</p>

<p class="BODY">After vain efforts to secure a rewarding of the CLAC resolution
No. 1076, <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> appealed to the President for
relief, and approval of his retirement application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chief Executive referred the matter to
the GSIS, for appropriate action, but the GSIS General Manager reiterated his
original stand on the question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
this application for <i style="">mandamus</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main contentions of the petitioner are that (a) he was not
removed from the service for cause, because the filling of the information
sheets had no connection with the performance of his official duties as Chief
Accountant; (b) that the resolution of the CLAC Board of Trustees that
petitioner be "considered resigned ...<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>without prejudice to whatever retirement benefits he may be entitled
subject to availability of funds" did not deprive him of his right to
retirement benefits arising from his services; (c) that the GSIS is in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> to contest his right to retirement; and (d) that
he had no other plain, adequate and speedy remedy.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the first issue, no doubt can be entertained that petitioner
was, to all intents and purposes, dismissed from the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite the weaseling expression
"considered resigned", probably invented by some official superior
unwilling to face realities, the fact remains that <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
was separated from the service against his will, and that can be nothing else
but a dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Was the separation for cause? The brunt of petitioner's argument
is directed at the misrepresentation in the information sheet, which he claims
to have no connection with the discharge of his duties as accountant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He entirely omits all references to the
misrepresentation of his educational attainments contained in his sworn application
for civil service examination (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There he claimed to be a high school
graduate, which the Committee and Board of Trustees of the CLAC expressly found
not to be true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is an act of
dishonesty and is expressly made a ground for disciplinary action under the
Civil Service Rules, coming under the description of </p>

<blockquote>"Intentionally making a false
statement in any material fact, or practicing or attempting to practice any
deception or fraud in securing his examination, registration, appointment or
promotion." (Sec. 19, [v] , Civil Service Rules)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We need not emphasize that acts of the kind herein discussed,
which combine both perjury and falsification of an official document, infirm a
public officer's integrity and reliability qualities that are necessarily
connected with the discharge of petitioner’s functions<span style=""> </span>and duties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, even if the misrepresentation committed in the information
sheets (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. F and G) were to be disregarded, there
is still reason to consider petitioner as dismissed from the service for
cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the enjoyment of retirement
benefits under the Government Service Insurance System are conditioned upon a
retiree's satisfactory service is not contested.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the second issue, the consequences of dismissal or
involuntary separation from service for cause are governed exclusively by the
laws applicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The offices or entities
where service was rendered are powerless to affect such consequences, which are
not dependent upon the discretion of the officials heading the particular
office or entity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It follows that the resolution
considering <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> resigned, in so far as it provides
that it shall be deemed "without prejudice to whatever retirement benefits
he may be entitled" can not preserve for him such benefits if under the
law he has no right thereto; the CLAC being powerless to condone malfeasance or
misbehavior in office.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the alleged <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> of
respondent, suffice it to observe that the return of premiums and voluntary
deposits with interest to petitioner is specifically prescribed by Commonwealth
Act 186 (d) as amended; hence, no <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> can be
predicated thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Viewed in the light most favorable to him, the claim of
petitioner is neither clear nor indubitable; hence, he is not entitled to the
coercive right of <i style=""><u>mandamus</u></i>
that requires a showing of complete and clear legal right in the petitioner to
the performance of ministerial acts.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ applied for is denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
