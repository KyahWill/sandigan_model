				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>
with a plea for preliminary injunction, petitioner, the official candidate of
the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party for mayor of <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, in the
election held on November 14, 1967, seeks to nullify the resolution of respondent
Commission on Elections of December 29, 1967,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
granting a motion for the reconsideration of its previous resolution of
December 6, 1967, to annul the proclamation of the other respondent, <span class="SpellE">Anatalio</span> Reyes, the candidate of the Liberal Party for the
mayoralty of said municipality.</p>

<p class="BODY">The background facts, as set forth in the aforesaid resolution of
respondent Commission on Elections of December 29, 1967, follow: "Upon
petition of mayoralty candidate Alejandro Reyes in the November 14, 1967
election in <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>,
filed on December 2, 1967, wherein it was alleged that a proclamation for the
office of mayor in <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>,
was made on December 2, 1967, declaring <span class="SpellE">Anatalio</span>
Reyes as the mayor elect based on a canvass which was incomplete because of the
pending questions as to the correctness of the canvass of the returns in Precincts
Nos. 7 and 12, the Commission declared said canvass and proclamation null and
void." Then <span class="GramE">came</span> this portion of the resolution:
"Thereafter, this motion for reconsideration of said resolution of the
Commission of <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1967</st1:date>,
was filed on the ground that the proclamation was legal, being made by a duly
constituted board of canvassers and based upon complete and <span class="SpellE">unfalsified</span>
election returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And furthermore, it is
alleged that there is now pending in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> an election protest filed by Alejandro Reyes
involving the same election."</p>

<p class="BODY">It was then noted by respondent Commission in the aforesaid
resolution "that the petition filed by Alejandro Reyes with the Commission
for the annulment of the proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Anatalio</span>
Reyes as elected mayor was on <st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="12">December
 2, 1967</st1:date>, and that on <st1:date year="1967" day="4" month="12">December
 4, 1967</st1:date>, an election protest was filed by Alejandro Reyes with the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it appears in the copy of the petition of
election protest attached to the records of this case, that petitioner
Alejandro Reyes did not mention in his said petition of election protest
anything about the pending case with the Commission; and at the same time said
petitioner Alejandro did not also inform the Commission about the election
protest he filed with the Court of First Instance involving the same case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So that the Commission annulled the
proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Anatalio</span> Reyes on <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1967</st1:date>, two days after the
election protest was filed with the Court of First Instance, without any
knowledge or information of said election protest."</p>

<p class="BODY">After which, the law governing the matter in accordance with the
view of respondent Commission was set forth in this wise: "In view of the
aforesaid circumstances that there is now pending an election protest with the
Court of First Instance involving the same election as in the case with the
Commission, we are constrained to reconsider the Commission's resolution of
December 6, 1967, annulling the proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Anatalio</span>
Reyes as mayor-elect of <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, and leave the disposition of all questions involved
in said election with the Court of First Instance in the election protest now
pending with said court, in line with the doctrine laid down by the Supreme
Court in the case of Vicente <span class="SpellE">Acain</span> v. Board of
Canvassers of Carmen, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, et al., G. R. No.
L-16445, <st1:date year="1960" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1960</st1:date>, * *
*.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the
Resolution of December 29, 1967, sought to be annulled, reads as follows:
"WHEREFORE, the Commission resolves to grant, as it hereby grants, the
motion for the reconsideration of the resolution of the Commission of December
6, 1967, annulling the proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Anatalio</span> Reyes
as mayor-elect of <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>,
so that said proclamation is hereby reinstated as in full force and
effect."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the petition itself, there was the averment that the Municipal
Board of Canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>, “surreptitiously proceeded
with the canvassing on <st1:date year="1967" day="21" month="11">November 21,
 1967</st1:date>, and thereafter, proclaimed the alleged winners * * * [among
them, respondent] <span class="SpellE">Anatalio</span> Reyes, * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came the allegation that petitioner, realizing that his action for
judicial recount previously filed with the Court of First Instance would be
unavailing, filed with respondent Commission on Elections a petition for the
annulment of the above canvassing and proclamation, which as noted was granted
on December 6, 1967.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
After which came the admission that prior to such action being taken by
respondent Commission on Elections and the period for the filing of the protest
continuing to run in the meanwhile, petitioner "filed by registered mail
an election protest, * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The election protest, which was dated December 4, 1967, after stating that
petitioner was a candidate voted in the Office of the Municipal Mayor in the
election held in November 14, 1967, mentioned that <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Anatalio</span> Reyes, "was proclaimed as
municipal mayor of the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> on
November 21, 1967, * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
There can be no denying the truth of the finding of respondent Commission on
Elections then that when it annulled the proclamation of respondent <span class="SpellE">Anatalio</span> Reyes on <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="12">December
 6, 1967</st1:date>, an election protest had been previously filed with the
Court of First Instance by petitioner, without such knowledge or information on
its part that such was the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus the reliance on <span class="SpellE">Acain</span> v. Board of
Canvassers,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
by respondent Commission in the challenged resolution cannot be legally
impugned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts of <span class="SpellE">Acain</span> v. Board of Canvassers speak for themselves: "On
January 4, 1960, <span class="SpellE">Malimit</span> and <span class="SpellE">Acain</span>
instituted the present action of prohibition, <i style="">mandamus</i> and <i style="">certiorari</i>,
with preliminary injunction, to prevent the enforcement of said proclamation
and the assumption of office by <span class="SpellE">Degamo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Palarca</span>, and, after due hearing, to set aside said
proclamation, upon the ground that the same is null and void, because the
substitute members of the board of canvassers that made said proclamation were
not electors of Carmen belonging to the party of the suspended and substituted
members of said board, and because petitioners had requested a suspension of
the <span class="SpellE">recanvass</span> in order to secure from the proper
court a recounting of the votes in precincts Nos. 4, 5 and 6, but the request
was denied, thereby depriving them of a reasonable opportunity to have the
aforementioned recount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the filing
of the requisite indemnity bond, this Court issued on <st1:date year="1960" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1960</st1:date>, the writ of preliminary
injunction prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears,
however, that at the time of the filing of the petition, <span class="SpellE">Degamo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Palarca</span> were not merely 'threatening to assume
the office of mayor and vice-mayor respectively,’ as alleged in the petition,
but had already assumed said offices, which they held since January 1, 1960,
the date fixed by law <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Malimit</span>
had filed with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>
a petition for a writ of quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> and an election
protest against <span class="SpellE">Degamo</span> on December 17 and 28, 1959,
respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, on <st1:date year="1960" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1960</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Degamo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Palarca</span> moved for the immediate dissolution of
laid writ of preliminary injunction, alleging that, prior to the issuance
thereof, or on <st1:date year="1960" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1960</st1:date>,
said respondent had already assumed their offices as mayor and vice-mayor,
respectively, of Carmen, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">On the above facts, it was the holding of this Court, through the
then Justice, now Chief Justice, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, that
petitioners were not entitled to the relief prayed for, for the reason among
others:</p>

<blockquote>"5.<span style=""> </span>Upon the filing of the aforementioned petition
for a writ of quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> and election protest on
December 17 and 28, 1959, respectively, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> acquired exclusive authority to inquire into and
pass upon the title of <span class="SpellE">Degamo</span> and the validity of the
proclamation made by the municipal board of canvassers on December 7,
1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot, upon the authority of
the petition, herein, filed on January 4, 1960, determine said questions
without encroaching upon the jurisdiction of said court of first instance,
which it is the duty of this body, as the highest Court of the land, not only
to respect, but, also, to uphold."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above decision speaks with undiminished authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be no more appropriate disposition
of a dispute of this character than <span class="GramE">a recognition</span> of
the prior competence of a court of justice whenever an election protest has
been filed to determine who of the parties is entitled to the position in
controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be conducive to
confusion and conflict in authority if under the circumstances, as above disclosed,
the Commission on Elections would still be considered as having the residual
power to interfere with a pending election protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an undesirable result should be avoided,
and the <span class="SpellE">Acain</span> holding if deferred to, as respondent
Commission on Elections did, would serve such purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">What was done by respondent Commission on Elections in its
resolution of <st1:date year="1967" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1967</st1:date>,
reconsidering its previous resolution of <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1967</st1:date>, far from amounting then to a grave
abuse of discretion, was precisely in accordance with the applicable and controlling
legal principle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This petition is therefore
bereft of any support in law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, petition is dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs.</span></p>
