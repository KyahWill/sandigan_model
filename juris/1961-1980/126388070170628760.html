was imputed to respondent <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Tagala</span>,
a member of the Philippine Bar, in a complaint dated <st1:date year="1971" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1971</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Obrero</span>
alleged that under scandalous circumstances, she being then a clerk in his
office as Registrar of the Commission on Elections at <span class="SpellE">Paracale</span>,
he embraced and fondled her breasts, <span style="">at
the same time touching her private parts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such acts, according to her, were repeated on other occasions, her
inability to complain being due to the threat of dismissal hanging over her
head in case she would do so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There was a denial in the
answer filed by respondent, dated </span><st1:date year="1971" day="5" month="4"><span style="">April 5, 1971</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
pointed out that the office where the acts were alleged to have been committed,
at the most having a floor area of twenty-four square meters, was also occupied
by a Collection Agent of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, who was then holding
office in the same room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it
was accessible to anyone who had business to transact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise stated that such room was
adjacent to or beside other governmental offices, including that of the
Municipal Treasurer and the Chief of Police.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The public library was likewise in such area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stressed that it took complainant six
years to file the complaint when the acts imputed to him occurred in 1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, he did admit that in 1967,
when she was still unmarried, she filed a similar complaint using her maiden
name of Magdalena U. <span class="SpellE">Verin</span>, but that it was dismissed
in a resolution of this Court.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> He prayed for the dismissal of the
complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The matter was then referred to the Office of the <span style="">Solicitor General for investigation, report
and recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the convenience
of the parties, the Provincial Fiscal was designated to conduct the
hearings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not a routine but a
thorough investigation that was held, complainant testifying on her own behalf
and respondent doing likewise but also calling as witnesses his wife, <span class="SpellE">Segundina</span> E. <span class="SpellE">Tagala</span>, <span class="SpellE">Emerenciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Mandill</span>, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Bacuño</span> and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Elnar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Bacuño</span> was
the Bureau of Internal Revenue Collection Agent at the time of the alleged
acts, occupying the same room as that of respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the Office of the Solicitor
General went over the records of the case and on </span><st1:date year="1976" day="11" month="5"><span style="">May 11, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">, its report was submitted.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It is quite exhaustive being contained in
eighteen pages and discussing in detail the evidence for complainant as well as
that for respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The recommendation
is "that there are no sufficient grounds to proceed against respondent
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Tagala</span>, and
accordingly, the complaint of Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Obrero</span> should
be dismissed."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This Court, in the light
of the records of the case as well as of the above report, agrees with such
recommendation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1. Respondent did not insist on the matter having partaken of the
nature of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>
in view of the previous dismissal of such complaint against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even had he done so, there is still merit to
the approach taken by the Office <span style="">of the
Solicitor General that in matters of this character, the previous dismissal on
the ground of lack of interest could not be considered a conclusive bar to the
investigation subsequently ordered by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to accord deference to the doctrine
of In re <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> where the plenary power of this Tribunal
over admission to and thereafter termination of membership in the legal
profession was accorded impressive recognition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereby, there is full compliance with an explicit mandate of the
Constitution.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Such an approach is likewise commendable
insofar as it vitalizes further the constitutional right to petition.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> A member of the bar being an officer of the
Court and as such, in the language of In re MacDougall,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> he should be "competent, honorable, and
reliable; [one] in whom courts and clients may repose confidence."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">2. In this instance,
moreover, the inquiry into the </span>merits of the complainant redounded to
the benefit of respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even a
cursory perusal of the records reveals clearly why the recommendation cannot be
other than its dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged offended
party woefully failed to substantiate her accusation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus respondent's name has been cleared.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">3. Complainant would have this Court believe that the
"immoral acts were repeated on several occasions inside [respondent's]
office;"<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
that such acts lasted some "fifteen to twenty minutes" on several
occasions;<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
and worse they allegedly occurred "almost daily the moment he enters the
office."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
As was pointed out by the Solicitor General, if such were the case, why did she
not report the repeated commission of such acts to the proper authorities
"to bring to task respondent for his misdeeds * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
After noting that complainant "could not give any detail as to <u>when</u>
the 'immoral acts' were committed," the Solicitor General further
observed: "What is worse, however, is the fact that complainant had not,
even for one instance, reported respondent's actuations to the police when the
police department was just 3 or 4 steps away, or just within shouting distance,
from the room occupied by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
An even graver objection to the testimony of complainant being accepted, in
view of its "highly unbelievable and <span style="">improbable
character" was explained in the Report in this wise: "The room
occupied by respondent and complainant is more or less a 24-square meter
affair, and is also occupied by 2 other persons, a <span class="SpellE">BIR</span>
Collection Agent and another Election Registrar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is one of several other government offices
housed in the municipal building of <span class="SpellE">Paracale</span>, the
other offices being the police department which is just opposite the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> office, the municipal treasurer's office, the
public library, the <span class="SpellE">PACD</span>, <span class="SpellE">APC</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> office
in particular is so situated that in going to the comfort rooms, one has to
pass by the narrow corridor separating the <span class="SpellE">Cornelec</span>
office from the police department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
are two windows of the room through which one could see below the <span class="SpellE">ALATCO</span> Bus Terminal on one side and a street on the other
side along which are private houses and the post office building * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The year 1965, being an election year, was a
busy year for the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, and the <span class="SpellE">Paracale</span> <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> office was no
exception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same office was indeed a
beehive of activity with the registration of voters, with several political
leaders following up important papers, and with other people transacting
business with the <span class="SpellE">BIR</span> Collection Agent in the matter
of the payment of internal revenue, taxes and forest charges, buying of
documentary stamps, securing of residence certificates, * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The office was always open * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The location of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
office in relation to other government offices, particularly the police
department, and the varied activities therein, create reasonable doubt as to
the possibility that the respondent may have committed the acts of kissing,
embracing, fondling, [and] holding of private parts, complained of."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>What other conclusion could there be then than that the
complaint must be dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to
defer to what was so clearly stated in the In re <span class="SpellE">Tionko</span>
opinion of Justice Malcolm,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
a 1922 decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "The serious
consequences of disbarment or suspension should follow only where there is a
clear preponderance of evidence against the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presumption is that the attorney is
innocent of the charges preferred and has performed his duty as an officer of
the court in accordance with his oath."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
The authoritative character of such a doctrine is undeniable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So many later cases have been decided in
conformity with its dictate.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
There is no justification then for failing to show adherence to such a norm.</p>

The complaint is based on Section 27, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court which read
as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<u>Attorneys removed

removed or suspended from his office as attorney by the Supreme Court for any
deceit, malpractice, or other gross misconduct in such office, grossly immoral
conduct, or by reason of his conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude,
or for any violation of the oath which he is required to take before admission
to practice, or for a <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> disobedience of any
lawful order of a superior court, or for corruptly or <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>
appearing as an attorney for a party to a case without authority so to do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The practice of soliciting cases at law for
