				G.R. No. L-45121 and L-45122, January 09, 1979</h4>
				<H3>ROSARIO P. ARCEO, PETITIONER, VS. HON. NARCISO A. AQUINO, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF PANGASINAN, BRANCH XIV AT ROSALES, AND ANICETO SANDOVAL, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner Rosario P. <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> filed a
motion for the reconsideration of this Court's resolution dated <st1:date year="1978" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1978</st1:date>, dismissing her
petitions for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition in these two cases on the
ground that the same have become moot and academic due to the retirement of
respondent Judge as of <st1:date year="1978" day="23" month="2">February 23,
 1978</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> had assailed Judge <span class="SpellE">Aquino's</span> order of September 24, 1976, denying her petition
to disqualify the latter, on the ground of partiality, from acting in Special
Proceeding No. 116-R, the intestate proceeding for the settlement of the
intestate estate of her deceased husband, <span class="SpellE">Honorato</span> L.
<span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>, and in Civil Case No. 283-R, entitled
"Rosario P. <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span>
Sandoval."</p>

<p class="BODY">Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> in her motion for
reconsideration invited attention to the fact that she had also assailed two
other orders of respondent Judge, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) his order in Civil Case No. 283-R dated <u>October 12, 1976</u>
denying her motion that Sandoval's motion to dismiss be set for hearing for the
reception of evidence and (2) his order of <u>October 25, 1976</u> granting
Sandoval's motion to dismiss.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Arceo's</span> motion for
reconsideration to be meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those
two orders were questioned by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> on the
theory that respondent Judge, whose inhibition she had vigorously sought, was
partial to Sandoval because the two were members of the Lions Club and because
on some occasions respondent Judge allegedly fraternized with Sandoval.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition for <i>certiorari</i> impugning the said order of <st1:date year="1976" day="25" month="10">October 25, 1976</st1:date> (whose
reconsideration was denied in the order of <st1:date year="1976" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1976</st1:date>) was filed on <st1:date year="1976" day="29" month="11"><u>November 29, 1976</u></st1:date><u>.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, the same may be treated as a petition for
review under Republic Act No. 5440.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was apparently filed within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> had repeatedly asked the
lower court to set the motion to dismiss for hearing so that evidence may be
presented on the factual issues involved in that motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court refused to set for hearing
Sandoval's motion to dismiss to which she had registered an opposition.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the trial court erred in not setting that motion to
dismiss for hearing for the reception of evidence and that it acted with grave
abuse of discretion in granting it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
order of dismissal was based on disputed facts such as the capacity in which
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> had sued Sandoval, whether the obligation
had already been paid (first cause of action) and whether she had reserved the
right to file a separate action for the civil liability of Sandoval in the
grave coercion case (second cause of action).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Evidence should have been received on these factual issues before the
motion to dismiss was resolved or its determination could have been deferred
until the trial is finished.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this Court's resolution of June 16, 1978 is
reconsidered insofar as it dismissed Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Arceo's</span>
petition assailing the two aforementioned orders of Judge <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
in Civil Case No. 283-R.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two orders
are hereby set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court is
directed to receive evidence at the hearing of Sandoval's motion to dismiss
and, after such hearing, it may resolve the said motion or defer the resolution
thereof according to the exercise of its sound discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against respondent
Sandoval.</span></p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
