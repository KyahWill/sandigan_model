				G.R. No. L-17748, November 28, 1962</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. MANUEL YU, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MAKALINTAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Manuel Yu appeals from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila 
denying his petition for naturalization on the ground that he does not have a 
lucrative lawful occupation.
<p>The following appears from appellant's evidence: He was born of Chinese 
parents in Manila on March 22, 1934 and is at present residing with his mother, 
a widow, at 1319 Soler Street. Still single at the time of the trial, he has 
continuously resided in the Philippines, never leaving the country except for a 
short vacation in China while still a child. He is registered with the Embassy 
of the Republic of China as a citizen thereof (Exhibit H); and has the 
corresponding certificate of registration (Exhibit K) and immigrant certificate 
of residence (Exhibit J) issued by the Bureau of Immigration.</p>
<p>Appellant speaks and writes Tagalog and English (Exhibit M). He finished his 
elementary education at the Chinese Republican School, Magdalena St., Manila; 
his high school education at the Quezon College, Manila; and a semester of 
commerce at the Mapua Institute of Technology (Exhibit N-1).</p>
<p>The evidence likewise shows that appellant believes in the principles 
underlying the Philippine Constitution; that he has conducted himself in a 
proper and irreproachable manner during the entire period of his residence in 
the Philippines in his relations with the constituted government as well as with 
the community in which he is living; that he has mingled socially with the 
Filipinos and has evinced a sincere desire to learn and embrace their customs, 
traditions, and ideals; that he is not opposed to organized government or 
affiliated with any association or group of persons who uphold and teach 
doctrines opposing all organized governments, nor does he defend or teach the 
necessity or propriety of violence, personal assault, or assassination for the 
success and predominance of men's ideas; that he is not a polygamist nor a 
believer in the practice of polygamy; that he has not been convicted of any 
crime involving moral turpitude, and has not been charged with the commission of 
any offense (Exhibits O; 0-1 to 0-9 and 0-11); and that he is not suffering 
front mental alienation or any incurable contagious disease (Exhibit P). The 
nation of which he is a subject grants by law to Filipinos the right to become 
naturalized citizens thereof, and is not at war with the Philippines.</p>
<p>From appellant's evidence it seems that except for the lack of lucrative 
employment, he is qualified to become a Filipino citizen.</p>
<p>It is alleged that appellant is earning P1,440.00 annually as sales 
representative of the Victory Steel Chair Factory, 1319 Soler St., Manila, which 
is owned by his mother, Ong Kim. As evidence of this allegation appellant relies 
on his own testimony as well as on his mother's sworn written statement to that 
effect, which, however, was not testified to by her when she took the witness 
stand to verify the date and place of his birth. Where the applicant for 
naturalization claims to be employed by either of his parents he must submit 
more satisfactory proof than has been adduced herein that he is actually 
employed and worth the salary he is receiving, in order to eliminate any 
suspicion that his parents have employed him only as a convenient arrangement to 
satisfy the statutory requisites for naturalization.</p>
<p>But granting that appellant earns P120.00 monthly, he cannot be said to have 
a lucrative trade or occupation. Such amount is not sufficient (Lo Chicombing 
vs. Republic, 111 Phil., 428; Sy Ang Hoc vs. Republic, 111 Phil., 488; Tan vs. 
Republic 112 Phil. 131) in view of the present high cost of living and the low 
purchasing power of our currency (Sy Pi√±ero vs. Republic, L-17399, October 30, 
1962). Invoking the case of Lim vs. Republic, 92 Phil., 522; 49 Off. Gaz. [1] 
122, appellant asserts that the free board and lodging, worth P60.00 monthly, 
furnished by his mother-employer, should be added to his monthly salary in cash 
in order to arrive at his correct earnings. Even then, a monthly income of 
P180.00 will not qualify him, since even the amount of P250.00 has been 
considered not lucrative for purposes of naturalization (Ong vs. Republic, 
L-15764, May 19, 1961).</p>
<p>The decision appealed from is affirmed with costs against appellant. </p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. 
B. L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon,</i> and <i>Regala, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
