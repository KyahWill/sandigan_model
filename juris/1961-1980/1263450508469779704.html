				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This decision deals with
the specific question of whether a court of first instance of one district in a
<span class="SpellE">replevin</span> proceeding may ignore a search warrant
issued by another court of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In brief, this petition presents this situation:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge, the Hon. Amador E. Gomez, acting
on a complaint for <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> filed by the other
respondent Norberto L. <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> directed peti­tioner, <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Pagkalinawan</span>, </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">supervising agent of the National Bureau of Investigation to turn over
to the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> city an automobile which was
seized under </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">search warrant issued by the Court of First
Instance </span>of Manila, the Hon. Guillermo Santos presiding, as <span style="">a </span>subject of the offense of theft or
as stolen property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did respondent Judge
act in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion?</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">What happened next after
such seizure in accordance with the search warrant issued on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="4" month="2"><span style="">February
 4, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> was set forth in the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"That on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="2"><span style="">February </span><span style="">7, </span><span style="">1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondent Norberto L. <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>
filed a complaint for <span class="SpellE">Replevin</span> in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, which was docketed as Civil Case
No. R-8284 and assigned to Branch II presided by respondent Honorable </span>Judge
Amador E. Gomez, against the herein petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span>
B. <span class="SpellE">Pagkalinawan</span>, Supervising Agent, National Bureau
of Invest­igation, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City, [and two members of
the] Manila Police Department for the recovery of possession of the
aforementioned car alleging that it is wrongfully detained by the herein
petitioner * * *; that on February 8, 1964, the respondent Judge acting on said
complaint issued an order directing the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
City or any proper officer of the court, to take the aforementioned car into
his custody and said order was implemented by the Clerk of Court by issuing on
the same date a writ of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>; * * * that on same
date, February 8, 1964 the petitioner after said writ of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>
was served on him manifested that he could not possibly comply with said order
to deliver the aforementioned car to the sheriff because he was holding the
same in '<span class="SpellE">custodia</span> <span class="SpellE">legis</span>'
for the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch II, the court that issued the
search warrant under which the said car was seized and held in custody; * * *
that on February 12, 1964, the respondent Judge, acting on the 'urgent motion
to require defendant <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Pagkalinawan</span>,
Supervising Agent, National Bureau of Investigation, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
City, to explain why he persists in refusing to deliver the car in question to
the sheriff', which motion was vigorously opposed during the hearing by the
petitioner, issued an order directing the petitioner * * * 'to immediately
comply with the order of the court and to turn over to the sheriff the car in
question upon receipt of a copy of this order', with the warning that,
otherwise, 'this court visits on [him] the full harshness of its coercive
power' and under this circumstance the petitioner on the same date, February
12, 1964, was compelled to part with the custody of the said car to the
Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> who took over the
possession of the same and who in turn immediately gave it or turned it over to
respond­ent Norberto L. <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>; * * * that the
delivery of the car to the Provincial Sheriff who in turn delivered it to the
respondent Norberto L. <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> by virtue of the said
order of the respondent Judge, would place the petitioner in imminent danger of
being declared in Contempt of the Manila Court of First Instance that issued
the search warrant because he cannot now comply with the recent order of the
said court dated February 10, 1964 regarding the proper disposition of said
car; * * * that petitioner on February 14, 1964 filed an 'urgent motion for
reconsideration of the order dated February 12, 1964 and setting aside the writ
of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> dated February 8, 1964,' but respondent
Judge after hearing on said motion on February 15, 1964, denied the same in its
order dated February 20, 1964; * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was then alleged by petitioner that the aforesaid orders
issued by the respondent Judge compelling him to deliver such car to the
Sheriff so that it could be turned over to the other respondent, after it was
explained that it was being held in <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">legis</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>for the Manila Court of First
Instance, having been properly seized in pursuance of a search warrant issued
by it, were made without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse
of discretion; that said orders moreover would likewise "nullify the
purpose and defeat the force and validity of the search warrant issued by the
Court of First Instance, a competent court of equal category;" and
"would then cause confusion in the enforcement and implementation of
lawful orders issued by other courts thereby causing embarrassment in the
proper administration of justice; * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The prayer was for
respondent Judge being declared </span>as <span style="">having
acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion in
thus proceeding in the <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> action and that
pending the final hearing and determination </span>of this petition, an order
of preliminary mandatory injunction be issued directing the respondent Judge to
order the return of said car to petitioner, desisting and refraining until
further orders of this Court from acting on the matter.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1964" day="18" month="3"><span style="">March
 18, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, this Court
issued </span>a <span style="">resolution ordering
respondents to file an answer to the petition and likewise issued a preliminary
mandatory injunction without bond as prayed for.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the answer of
respondent <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>, there was in effect an admission
of the facts </span>as <span style="">alleged by
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respond­ent <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> would however impugn the actuations of petitioner,
who, it was alleged "instead of protecting the rights of the citizens of
this country used the powers of his office in arrogating unto himself the
interpretation of the law which only the courts are vested thereof and the
alleged contempt charge which petitioner asserts under this parag­raph is not
only nugatory and illegal but entirely imaginary for</span> <span style="">the reason that the [search warrant]
mentioned in the [Petition] </span>is <span style="">based
on fraud and deceit * * *."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The special defenses appearing in the answer
further stressed not only the fact of the car that was seized under the search
warrant as different from that referred to in the case pending in the Court of
First Instance of Manila, but also the fact of respondent being the true and
lawful owner thereof.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> There was thus a denial of the allegations
that respondent Judge in issuing the orders complained of, acted in excess of
his jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discre­tion, for the truth of the
matter, according to respondent, was that "the car in question is not
subject of a criminal case before a Court of First Instance of Manila, more specifically
before Hon. Judge Guillermo Santos," who issued the search warrant, or in
any other court, respondent <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> further stating
that he was not an accused "in any case where said car </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">allegedly stolen property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* *

<p class="BODY">More specifically in so far as the assertion of the jurisdiction
of respondent Judge on the suit for <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>
affecting the validity of the search warrant issued, it was alleged in the
answer "That respondent <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> denies the
allegations contained in paragraph 10 of the [petition] with respect to the
fact that the [orders] of co-respondent Judge Amador E. Gomez would nullity and
defeat the force and vali­dity of the [search warrant] for [its] issuance * * *
cannot prevent respondent Judge Amador E. Gomez to issue an order of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> <span style="">as </span>provided
by Section 2, Rule 60 of the Rules of Court; * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span style="">is </span>entitled
to the remedy prayed for; the writ must be granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be to ignore a principle to which
this Court has been firmly committed if under the cir­cumstances disclosed,
respondent Judge would be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
moment a court of first instance has been informed through the filing of an
appropriate pleading that <span style="">a </span>search
warrant has been issued by another court of first instance, it cannot, even if
the literal language of the Rules of Court<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>yield a contrary impression which in
this case demonstrated the good faith of respondent Judge for acting <span style="">as </span>he did, require a sheriff or any
proper officer of the Court to take the pro­perty subject of the <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> action if theretofore it <span style="">came </span>into the custody of another public officer by virtue of <span style="">a </span>search warrant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only the court of first instance that issued
such a search warrant may order its release.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Any other view <span style="">would be
subversive of </span>a <span style="">doctrine that
has been steadfastly adhered to, the main purpose of which is to assure
stability and consistency in judicial actuations and to avoid confusion that
may otherwise ensue if courts of coordinate jurisdiction are permitted to
interfere with each other's lawful orders.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Only the other day, in <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co.
v. Hon. Guillermo E. Torres,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court reaffirmed such a principle, when speaking through Justice <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, it held that only the particular branch of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> <span style="">City "can annul its own decision * * *."
The opinion continues:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is
settled that the jurisdiction to annul a judgment of a branch of the Court of
First Instance belongs <u>solely</u> to the very same branch which rendered the
judgment." As aptly stated, any other branch "even if it be in the
same judicial district" that would attempt to do so "either exceeds
its jurisdiction",</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">or
"acts with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction, *
* *."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> As set forth in the above <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> decision:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"In either case, certiorari and prohibition would be proper to
prevent the attempting branch of the court from proceeding to nullify </span>a
final <span style="">decision rendered by a co-equal
and co-ordinate branch." In this case then, certiorari is likewise an
appropriate remedy when respondent Judge disregarded a search warrant issued by
another court of first instance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Cabigao</span> v. del Rosario,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
which was a petition to restrain respondent Judge from interfering with
execution of a judgment rendered by another court of first instance, this Court,
speaking through Justice <span class="SpellE">Ostrand</span> stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Firstly, it is settled by an
overwhelming weight of authority that no court has power to interfere by
injunction with the judgments or decrees of a court of concurrent or coordinate
juris­diction having equal power to grant the relief sought by in­junction."</p>

<p class="BODY">In Philippine National Bank v. <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
which was a petition for certiorari, seeking to set aside a writ of preliminary
injunction issued by respondent Judge enjoining the Provincial Sheriff from
proceeding with the sale of a property attached to satisfy a judgment by
another court of first instance, the above doctrine was reiterated, followed
with the affirmation that such "ruling in the <span class="SpellE">Cabigao</span>
case is decisive on the issue before us."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">While the instant
proceeding does not deal with the annulment of </span>a <span style="">judgment previously issued, the principle </span>therein announced
calls for application here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise a
court of first instance would be allowed to pass on the validity of <span style="">a </span>search warrant, issued by another
court of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is to
preclude an undesirable situation from arising, one, which if, permitted, <span style="">as </span>above pointed out, would be fraught
with undesirable consequences as already indicated, for the bench, no less than
for the litigants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To such an
eventuality, this Court cannot give its sanction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, while not authoritative, this case being one of first
impression, the doctrine announced in <span class="SpellE">Molo</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
which denied an original petition filed with this Court for mandamus is
persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There the petitioner
alleging that by virtue of a search warrant issued by the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> for an alleged violation of the
Usury Law, certain documents belonging to him were seized and thereafter kept
in the possession of the respond­ent Collector of Internal Revenue, sought
their return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court did not oblige;
mandamus did not lie, <span style="">as </span>"the
one having the legal custody thereof is the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> which had ordered their seizure and which is the only
one authorized by law to return them to their owner." It is worth noting
that while the then Justice Laurel dissented, his opinion being in effect that
the remedy should be granted, he admitted that "where property is seized
under color of judicial process and brought under the control of the court, [it<span style=""> </span>was] placed beyond the reach of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> or other independ­ent or plenary remedy, * *
*."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Again, while the above ruling is not squarely on all fours, still the governing
principle does not seem to be in doubt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The remedy for questioning the validity of a search warrant may be
sought in the Court of First Instance that issued it, not in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of another Judge, and <span style="">as </span>admitted in the dissenting opinion of Justice Laurel, not
through <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ prayed for is granted, and the
mandatory preliminary injunction issued <span style="">made
</span>permanent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With costs against
respondent <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>.</p>
