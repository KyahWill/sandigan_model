Director to sell the same instead to the petitioners <span class="SpellE">Trazo</span>,
et al. therein, private respondents here, which petition was granted, the two
courts <u>a quo</u>, the Court of First Instance of Manila and the Court of
Appeals, invoking the provisions of Republic Act 1268, as amended by Republic
Act 3009, notwithstanding that herein petitioner had previously secured in
another <i>mandamus</i> case, Civil Case No. 39864 also of the Court of First
Instance of Manila, a decision, already final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
commanding the Director of Lands to sell the same land to it, also in pursuance
of Republic Act 1268.</p>

<p class="BODY">The material object of these proceedings is a parcel of land
known as Lot No. 79 of the San <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> Friar Lands
Estate located at the corner of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Boulevard and
C. <span class="SpellE">Lerma</span> Street, Manila, which together with another
lot of 1,000 square meters, known as Lot No. 11 of the same estate, was ordered
by the Court of First Instance of Manila to be sold to herein petitioner in
aforementioned <i>mandamus</i> case, No. 39864 as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the petition for <i>mandamus</i>
is hereby granted, and the respondent Director of Lands is ordered and directed
to execute a deed of sale of Lots No. 11 and 79 of the San <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span>
Friar Lands in favor of the petitioner, Manila Pencil Co., Inc. under the
following conditions:</blockquote>

in favor of the petitioner the latter must pay to the respondent, Director of
Lands, the amount of P26<span class="GramE">,750</span>. 00 corresponding to the
first installment for the first year with the payment of a similar amount
yearly for the next nine years thereafter; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That petitioner should likewise pay to the
respondent, by way of occupation fee, the amount of P10<span class="GramE">,700.00</span>
corresponding to 4% of the total purchase price of Lots No. 11 and 79, as
provided for in R.A. No. 1268, which amount shall be paid to the respondent ten
(10) yearly installments of P070.00 per year, the first payment to begin on the
date of the execution of the deed of sale by respondent in favor of the
petitioner." (<span class="GramE">page</span> 3, Record.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">When petitioner asked for the execution of this judgment, herein
private respondents, led by <span class="SpellE">Concordio</span> <span class="SpellE">Trazo</span>, whose attempt to intervene in Case No. 39864 was not
allowed by even this Court in G.R. No. L-16501, filed the petition in Case No.

their aforesaid petition that they were war sufferers during the liberation of
Manila and had been occupying portions of Lot 79 in question since before the
year 1954 up to the present; that they had constructed their respective houses
and/or places of business in the premises; that they were 'actual occupants'
and therefore entitled to purchase the respective portions they occupied, not
exceeding 200 square meters, from the government by virtue of Republic Act No.
1268 as amended by Republic Act 3009.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In their answer, herein petitioners-appellants denied the
material allegations of the petition and alleged in substance the following:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Petitioners' respective physical occupancy of
portions of Lot No. 79 are merely necessary consequences of the respective
leases to them by Manila Pencil Company, Inc. of certain portions of said Lot
79 or the improvements thereon and therefore, their occupancy are for and inure
to the benefit of their landlord, the Manila Pencil Company, who is the true,
legal and actual occupant of Lot 79;</blockquote>

<blockquote>'2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Republic Act No. 1268 became vested under
which Manila Pencil Company's right to purchase Lot 79 which took effect on
June 14, 1955 did not limit the area which may be purchase by an actual
occupant of the San <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> Friar Lands Estate and
that Republic Act No. 3009 amending the same, limiting the area to not more
than two hundred (200) square meters, took effect long after the decision in
Civil Case No. 39864 became final, ordering the execution by the Director of
Lands of a final deed of sale over Lot 79 in favor of the Manila Pencil
Company.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was another action pending before this
Honorable Supreme Court (referring to the appeal of <span class="SpellE">Concordio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Trazo</span>, G.R. L-16501, from the order of the Court of
First Instance of Manila in Civil Case No. 39864 denying his motion to
intervene) between the same parties for the same cause, inasmuch as the
interest of <span class="SpellE">Trazo</span> is identical and similar to the
interest of all the other respondent herein in Lot No. 79.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(As was mentioned earlier, this appeal of <span class="SpellE">Trazo</span> was dismissed by this Honorable Court.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>'4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court (trial court) was without jurisdiction
to declare null and void or countermand a final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch XVII, a co-equal and
coordinate court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The petition was barred by prior judgment
and/or is <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u>
because in the cases of Philippine Consolidated Freight Lines, Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Ajon</span> and Jose <span class="SpellE">Mandanas</span>, G.R. L-10206; Philippine Consolidated Freight
Lines, Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Agripina</span> Navarro, G.R. L-10207; and
Philippine Consolidated Freight Lines, Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span>
<span class="SpellE">Padernal</span>, G.R. L-10208, this Honorable Supreme Court
held that the Philippine Consolidated Freight Lines, Inc. (the
predecessor-in-interest of herein appellant Manila Pencil Company, Inc.) has a
superior right to the possession of Lot 79 of the San <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span>
Friar Lands Estate than any of the lessees or <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span>
of portions of the lot who were in physical occupancy thereon.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The trial court granted the issuance of a writ of preliminary
injunction to restrain the Director of Lands from executing or causing to be
executed a deed of sale over Lot No. 79, upon the filing by the petitioners
therein of a bond in the amount of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, upon motion of herein
appellants and upon their filing of a counter bond of P200<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
the writ was dissolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, a
sales contract dated <st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1962</st1:date>
was executed between the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(represented by the Director of Lands) and the Manila Pencil Company, Inc. over
said <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 79, which contract however contains a
stipulation that the sale is subject to the outcome of this case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After hearing on the merits, a decision was rendered by the
trial court on August 20, 1963, declaring that 'the petitioners (herein
respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>) have a better right to the
purchase of Lot No. 79 of the San <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> Estate, that
the sale thereof to the Manila Pencil Co. is illegal and void as against them,
and ordering the Director of Lands to sell it to them in accordance with
Republic Act No. 1268, as amended by Republic Act No. 3009, with costs against
the Manila Pencil Co." <span class="GramE">(pp. 4-6, Record.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The decision under review (majority opinion) is based on the
following considerations:</p>

<blockquote>"Setting aside momentarily the other aspects of this case, we
cannot reconcile ourselves to the proposition that respondent Manila Pencil Co.
(registered as a corporation on <st1:date year="1951" day="13" month="4">April
 13, 1951</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 8) <span class="GramE">is</span>
qualified to purchase <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 79 containing an area of 1,672
sq. m., specially after having already acquired <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 11
with an area of 1,003 sq. m. in the same vicinity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inequity is so <span class="GramE">disturbing,</span>
say shocking, particularly in the face of the clear and unmistakable
legislative policy that motivated the passage of Republic Acts 1268 and
3009.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legislative intendment is to
sell Lots 11 and 79 to the actual occupants (not constructive occupants).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Land Administrative Order 24 (promulgated
on March 23, 1958 to implement Rep. Act 1268), the term 'actual occupants'
shall be understood to mean those who 'occupied the premises as <u>war
sufferers</u> and <u>fire victims</u> immediately or shortly immediately or
shortly after the liberation of Manila in February 1945 and continued such occupation
by <u>themselves</u> up to the present, and who have been occupying and are
presently occupying and/or <u>residing</u> on the property with a building
constructed thereon since or prior to June 14, 1955 as shown in the records of
the Bureau of Lands'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 23).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here, the official residence of the 'Manila Pencil Co., Inc.' is at No.
5 <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue Extension, <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, whereas the residence of lot applicant <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Canlas</span> is at 1040 P.
<span class="SpellE">Tobera</span> St., <span class="SpellE">Bambang</span> Extension,
Manila, where they were served with the summons issued in the case at bar
(Record 31).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legislative policy, in
addition to what has been said, is to solve the 'social problem that the
present condition of the occupants of the property in question may give rise
to' (Explanatory Note, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">OO, re
Rep. Act 1268) and 'of giving land to the landless' (Explanatory Note <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> QQ re Rep. Act 3009) to as many war sufferers
as are possible under the circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All these considerations of social justice were however set to naught by
the sale of those two lots to <span class="GramE">respondent corporation</span>
of the 1951 vintage which cannot be classified under any concept as a war
sufferer, let alone the fact that the 200-square-meter restriction to each
actual occupant was likewise flagrantly disregarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With the same impunity, the
constitutional declaration of principle that 'the promotion of social justice
to insure the well-being and economic security of all the people should be the
concern of the state' (Art. 11, Section 5, Phil. Constitution), as well as Art.</span>
XIII, Section 4, providing that 'the Congress may authorize, upon payment of
just compensation, the expropriation of lands to be subdivided into <u>small
lots</u> and conveyed at costs to individuals' was likewise completely ignored
and trampled upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, what
happened in the case at bar was not the promotion of social amelioration as
envisaged by Manila Congressman Arturo <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> Francisco in proposing the passage of the aforesaid
Rep. Acts 1268 and 3009, but social injustice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As was well stated by Senior Land Examiner Atty. Miguel A. <span class="SpellE">Umali</span> in his memorandum for The Chief, Land Management
Division, Bureau of Lands, dated <st1:date year="1950" day="25" month="3">March
 25, 1950</st1:date>, 'the main purpose of the bill is primarily to help the
war sufferers to secure lots wherein they can establish their residence.' The
term 'war sufferers' can refer only to <u>individual persons</u> and their
families who have occupied for residential purposes portion of the patrimonial
property of the Government immediately after the liberation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This view is supported by the last sentence
of the explanatory note which states 'Because of the social problems that the
present condition of the occupants of the property in question may give rise
to.' Social amelioration can definitely refer only to social conditions
affecting <u>natural persons and not to artificial persons</u> primarily
engaged in commercial and industrial ventures.' <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.</span> KK and KK-1) Another high official of the
Bureau of Lands, no less than Assistant Director Vicente <span class="SpellE">Tordesillas</span>,
in his memorandum for the Honorable Executive Secretary, <span class="SpellE">Malacañan</span>,
Manila, dated May 19, 1960 and marked as <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. GG,
officially expressed the opinion that 'the amending House Bill No. 4404 appears
to have been mainly intended to have the big parcels (referred to above as
parcels 11 and 79) occupied by the Manila Pencil Co., Inc., subdivided into
lots of not more than 200 square meters <u>to benefit more people</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would seem that the intention of the bill
would be largely <u>frustrated</u> if the said parcels 11 and 79 are conveyed
to the Manila Pencil Company Inc. as directed by the Courts. <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Sgd</span>.)</span> Vicente <span class="SpellE">Tordesillas</span>,
Assistant Director of Lands' (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">GG-1).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The incorporation papers of respondent Manila Pencil Co.,
Inc., <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. HH, shows that the incorporators,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
P. <span class="SpellE">Canlas</span>, (2) Ernesto Y. <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span>,
(3) Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oconer</span>, (4) Atty. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>
N. Vicente, (5) F. B. <span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span>, (6) Capt. C. R.
Mason, and (7) Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> <span class="SpellE">Canlas</span>,
all businessmen, are far from being the landless gentry for whose benefit
Congress had intended to sell the lot in question in small parcels of not more
than 200 square meters each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither can
the respondent corporation be called an <u>actual occupant</u> of the areas
where the houses of petitioners-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> are located
because, for one thing, the houses are owned by the petitioners-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> and assessed for taxation in their respective
names.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much less was the corporation a
war sufferer and fire victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As shown
by <span class="GramE">respondent corporation's</span> own evidence, sketch <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 34, what it occupies physically is a rectangular
portion captioned 'Manila Pencil Sales Office.' Certainly, the respondent
corporation cannot be an <u>actual occupant</u> of the areas physically
possessed and occupied by the petitioners' houses over which it (corporation)
had no control at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a fact
admitted by respondent Manila Pencil Co. thru counsel on <st1:date year="1954" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1954</st1:date>, as per letter <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. JJ, addressed to the Undersecretary of Agriculture and
Natural Resources which, in its pertinent portion, says:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before closing, we should like to repeat that
since the early part of 1952, our clients have neither been <u>using nor
receiving rent</u> from Lot No. 79' (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
JJ-3-A).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even from the point of view of
priority of application, the evidence shows that sale applications of
petitioners Monica Guillermo (Sept. 6, 1957) and <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span>
<span class="SpellE">Quintos</span> (Oct. 22, 1957) were ahead of, and the sale
applications of petitioners Federico <span class="SpellE">Lindo</span> (March 18,
1958) and Tomas <span class="SpellE">Navarrete</span> (March 18, 1958) bore the
same date as the sale application of <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Canlas</span> (Mar. 18, 1958) upon whose personal sale application
the alleged right of respondent Manila Pencil Co., Inc. of which he (<span class="SpellE">Canlas</span>) is the president stems or is made to cling.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We concur in the conclusion of the lower court that herein petitioners-applicants
'are not bound by the decision of the CFI of Manila in Civil Case 39864 (Manila
Pencil Co. vs. Director of Lands, for <i>mandamus</i>), ordering the director
of lands to sell <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 79 to the Manila Pencil
Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were not parties thereto,
and the attempt by one of them, <span class="SpellE">Concordio</span> <span class="SpellE">Trazo</span>, to intervene therein was denied because it was not
made on time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their rights cannot
therefore be affected by the decision.' This is expressly recognized by the
Supreme Court when it said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'If the herein
petitioner has any right of action at all, his right can be fully protected in
a <u>separate</u> proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he
feels aggrieved, he should file an independent action' (see decision, Supreme
Court, in G.R. L-16501, Jan. 31, 1961, entitled <span class="SpellE">Concordio</span>
A. <span class="SpellE">Trazo</span> vs. Manila Pencil Co., Inc., Director of
Lands, and Hon. <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Solidum</span>,
Judge, CFI of Manila, marked <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 17-C).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the <u>first assignment of error</u>, the respondent
MAPECO contends that it has presented ample evidence to show that by itself and
through its predecessor-in-interest, the Philippine Consolidated Freight Lines
Inc., it is the actual occupant of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 79 since
1945.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said evidence, according to
MAPECO, further show that herein petitioners-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
have been occupying certain portions of the said Lot 79 in question as mere
lessees or <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span> of the respondent company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Granting, without admitting, this to be true,
nevertheless, the undeniable fact remains that the MAPECO is disqualified to
buy the said lot for the reasons that (1) being a post war corporation, as was
its predecessor, it cannot be a war sufferer and fire victim; (2) having given
up actual physical occupation of the portions in the hands of petitioners-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> since 1952 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
JJ-3-a), it cannot claim 'to have continued such occupation <u>by itself</u>
and has been occupying and is presently occupying and/or residing on the
property (the adversely possessed areas it seeks to purchase) with a building
constructed thereon' as prescribed by Lands Administrative Order 24, Series of
1958, issued by the Director of Lands with the approval of the Secretary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources pursuant to Section 5 of Republic Act 1268,
the governing statute; (3) Republic Act 1268, as amended by Republic Act 3009,
speaks not of legal possessor but of actual occupants of Lot No. 79, who can be
no other than those physically or in fact occupying it; (4) assuming again
hypothetically the petitioners-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> to be mere
lessees or <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span> (not who possess the required
qualifications to purchase), we see no plausible reason why the
disqualification of the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> (respondent
corporation) should be allowed to effect or to visit them when, after all,
Republic Act 1268, in its original version or as amended, and the
administrative rules and regulations applicable to this case speak of 'actual
occupants' the apparent intendment of the statute being to diffuse the
blessings granted by it to as many people as possible and to withhold a
monopolistic distribution of the land in question to only one or single
applicant as shown by the injunction therein of a 200-square-meter lot to each
occupant; (5) respondent corporation has not filed in its corporation capacity
an application to purchase the lot in question, but granting <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> in this regard that the application of <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Canlas</span>, in his
private capacity, may be considered an application of respondent corporation,
the latter (respondent) may no longer be authorized to acquire questioned Lot
79, it having already acquired earlier Lot No. 11 (with an area of 1,003 square
meters) under the provisions of the same Republic Act 1268.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As to the <u>second assignment of error</u> that the lower
court erred in declaring that the herein petitioners-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
are not bound by the decision in Civil Case No. 39364 (Manila Pencil Co., Inc.
vs. Director of Lands) rendered by the Hon. Judge <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Solidum</span>, under the doctrine of judicial <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, we may add to what has already been stated
heretofore (1) that the qualification of MAPECO to purchase Lot 79 within the
purview of Republic Act 1268 was never decided in the said case; (2) none of
the herein petitioners-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> were parties to said
case, and the decision therein was rendered on the basis of the mutual
admissions such that 'the issue of <span class="SpellE">MAPECO's</span> actual
occupancy of the lot in dispute within the meaning of Republic Act 1268,
although raised in the pleadings, was erroneously thought by the Court in said
Civil Case 39864 to have been admitted by therein (also herein) respondent,
Director of Lands' (<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> brief, 30).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Relying on what it assumed to have been
admitted by the parties in the Stipulation of Facts submitted by the parties in
Civil Case 39864, the CFI of Manila only passed upon the constitutionality
raised by the Director of Lands against Section 4 of Republic Act 1268' (<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' brief, pp. 17-18).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By abandoning his appeal in said Civil Case
39864, the Director of Lands allowed the decision therein to become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>; (3) the decision in Civil Case 39864 being 'a
consent judgment, it may not be binding on a person who did not consent
thereto, even though he was a party to the action, and <u>a fortiori,</u> he is
not bound where he was not a party to the action at the time of the rendition
of the judgment' (50 C.J.S. 162); and (4) with respect to the three (3) other
cases decided jointly by the Honorable Supreme Court on April 10, 1958 in favor
of <span class="SpellE">MAPECO's</span> predecessor, to wit, Philippine
Consolidated Freight Lines Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Ajon</span>, G.R.
L-10202; Phil. Consolidated Freight Lines Inc. vs. Navarro, G.R. L-10207; and
Phil. Consolidated Freight Lines Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Padernal</span>,
G.R. L-10203, which joint decision, according to respondents-appellants, should
bind herein petitioners-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> by virtue of its
principle of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> by judgment, it will be noted
that the issue of actual occupancy over Lot 79 within the meaning of Republic
Act 1268 was not raised therein or passed upon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The issue raised therein was one of possession for purposes of <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>, 'not actual occupancy as understood under
Republic Act 1268 upon which the present action has been predicated' (<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' brief 31).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We agree with this view.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With regard to the third assignment of error that the lower
court erred in declaring that respondent-appellant MAPECO had not acquired a
vested right to buy Lot No. 79 by virtue of the provisions of Republic Act 1268
and the <u>fourth assignment</u> of error that the lower court likewise erred
in applying Republic Act 3009, a law which limits each occupant to the purchase
of an area of not more than 200 square meters in dimension, suffice it to quote
herein that the lower court in the present case has stated in this
respect:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'The Manila Pencil Company
cannot claim that it had acquired a vested right to buy Lot No. 79 under Republic
Act 1268 before its amendment (by Republic Act 3009), for it had failed to
comply with the conditions prescribed by that law, namely, that it should be an
actual occupant, a war sufferer and fire, victim x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
x.' Hence, it is plain that respondent corporation, being disqualified to apply
for purchase, could not have acquired a vested right under Republic Act
1268.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment in Civil Case 29864
(Manila Pencil Co., Inc. vs. the Director of Lands) not having settled the
qualification of MAPECO to purchase Lot 79 under Republic Act 1268, the judicial
adjudication therein cannot be relied upon by respondent-appellant MAPECO to
disqualify the herein petitioners-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The <u>fifth assignment of error</u> as to the denial by the
lower court of respondents-appellants' motion for reconsideration of September
2, 1963 need no further discussion as it assails the judgment on substantially
the same grounds as their present assignment of error." <span class="GramE">(pp.
18-21, Record.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, petitioner contends in his petition that:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals erred in affirming the
decision of the trial court which had been rendered without and/or in excess of
its jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court acted
without and/or in excess of its jurisdiction in holding that the herein respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> have a better right to purchase Lot No. 79 and ordering
that the Director of Lands sell said property to them instead of to the herein
appellant Manila Pencil Company, Inc., because in so doing, the trial court in
effect set aside and declared null and void an already final decision
previously rendered by a co-equal and coordinate court (Branch XVII of the same
Court of First Instance of Manila) in another case, Civil Case No. 39864.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals, as did the trial
court, erred in inquiring further into the qualifications of herein appellant
Manila Pencil Company, Inc. to purchase Lot No. 79 for the reason that this
issue was passed upon and determined in a previous proceeding, Civil Case No.
39864 in the Court of First Instance of Manila and entitled 'Manila Pencil Company,
Inc. versus the Director of Lands'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
decision in said case, ordering the Director of Lands to execute the
corresponding deed of sale over Lot No. 79 in favor of Manila Pencil Company,
Inc. became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> long before the
institution by herein respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, of the
original proceeding in this case in the trial court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was error for the Court of Appeals as
well as for the trial court to hold that the occupation or possession required
by Republic Act 1268, to qualify an applicant for the purchase of the San <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> Friar Lands Estate, of which Lot No. 79 forms part,
is simple <u>material</u> or <u>physical</u> possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We submit that the possession or occupancy
referred to in Republic Act 1268 is possession as it is contemplated in law and
jurisprudence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals erred in giving no
significance to the relationship of landlord-tenant between the
petitioner-appellant Manila Pencil Company and herein respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> because the physical or material possession by
respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> of certain portions of Lot No.
79 is a mere consequence of their subleases from the petitioner-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As mere tenants or <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span>,
they can not claim any right superior to their sub-<span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
and whatever rights or benefits accrued by virtue of their occupancy or
possession must inure to their landlord, herein petitioner-appellant Manila
Pencil Company.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The better right of petitioner-appellant
Manila Pencil Company, Inc., thru its predecessor-in-interest Philippine
Consolidated Freight Lines, Inc. to possess and occupy Lot No. 79 had been
upheld by this Honorable Supreme Court in three previous cases, decided
jointly, 'Philippine Consolidated Freight Lines, inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ajon</span> and Jose <span class="SpellE">Mandanas</span>,
G.R. L-10206; Philippine Consolidated Freight Lines, Inc. vs. Agrippa Navarro,
G.R. L-10207; and Philippine Consolidated Freight Lines, Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Padernal</span>, G.R.
L-10208'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In these three cases, the
defendants were <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span> of portions of Lot 79, in
the same manner that herein respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> are
<span class="SpellE">sublessees</span> of certain portions of the same Lot 79 and
there exists therefore as among them a <span class="SpellE">privity</span> or
identity of interests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The joint
decision of this Honorable Court in the aforesaid three cases, long become
final, holding that petitioner-appellant's predecessor-in-interest had a better
right to possess the premises in question should have thus been given weight
and consideration by the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals also erred in applying
the requirement of being a 'war sufferer'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This requirement is not imposed by the law, Republic Act 1268, that
governs the acquisition of the San <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> Friar Lands
Estate but was merely added by Lands Administrative Order No. 24.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Insofar as Lands Administrative Order No. 24
imposes this additional qualification, it should be disregarded for being null
and void as it is tantamount to an improper exercise of legislative power by
the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals further erred in considering
the limitation to not more than 200 square meters on the area that may now be
purchased by each applicant from the San <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> Friar
Lands Estate, of which Lot No. 79 forms part.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This limitation was imposed only later, by an amendatory law Republic
Act 3009, and should not be applied retroactively in this case to deprive or
impair the right, already long vested in petitioner-appellant Manila Pencil
Company under the original law, Republic Act No. 1268, to purchase Lot No.
79." <span class="GramE">(pp. 7-10, Record.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After mature reflection and in the light of what appears to Us to
be the paramount objective of Republic Act 1268, as amended, We are convinced
that the view adopted in the majority opinion of the Court of Appeals stands on
solid equitable ground, apart from being a sound legal construction of the
Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The explanatory note of the bill
that became Republic Act 1268 sets forth the legislative purpose thereof thus:</p>

<blockquote>"As a result of the battle of liberation in Manila, many war
sufferers occupied vacant patrimonial properties belonging to the Government at
the intersection of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Boulevard and C. <span class="SpellE">Lerma</span> Street in the City of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present occupants would desire to
legalize their stay and acquire the lots respectively possessed by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is for the purpose of allowing them to
acquire ownership of their respective lots at a reasonable price that this bill
has been presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of the
social problems that the present condition of the occupants of the property in
question may give rise to, it is earnestly urged that this bill be immediately
considered and approved." <span class="GramE">(pp. 22-23, Record.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">And in pursuance of this objective and by
virtue of the authority granted him by the Act itself, the Director of Lands
issued Administrative Order No. 24, containing the rules and regulations
governing the sale of the subject land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The pertinent portion of said rules reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"For the purpose of these regulations, the term 'actual
occupants' as used in Republic Act No. 1268 shall be understood to be those
persons who are Filipino citizens qualified to acquire public lands in the
Philippines, who occupied the premises as war sufferers and fire victims
immediately or shortly after the liberation of Manila in February, 1945, and
continued such occupation by themselves up to the present, and who have been
occupying and are presently occupying and/or residing on the property with a
building constructed thereon since or prior to June 14, 1955, as shown in the
records of the Bureau of Lands."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We are in accord with the Court of Appeals that upon the premises
of this case, petitioner herein can in no sense be considered as the occupant
contemplated in the statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear
to <span class="GramE">Us</span> that notwithstanding that private respondents
have been occupying the buildings constructed by petitioner on the land in
dispute merely as its lessees of portions of said buildings, the legislative
intent was to benefit not the owner of said buildings but the actual occupants
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot see how the
commendable and benevolent objective of the statute to solve "the social
problems that the present condition of the occupants of the property in
question may give rise to" can be pursued by recognizing petitioner as
having a better right than private respondents under the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Act is indubitably a social legislation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From that perspective, a choice between the
respective situations of the petitioners, on the one hand, and the private
respondents, on the other, cannot but favor the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Basically, that is all <span class="GramE">We</span>
have to determine in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, also in equity, petitioner is entitled to be
reimbursed the cost of the improvements it has constructed, which are being
occupied by respondents, unless the latter should prefer to allow petitioner to
remove the same, because they would want to construct their own respective
houses.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b> and for the other
considerations on which the decision under review is based, the petition herein
is dismissed, and the appealed judgment is affirmed, without pronouncement as
to costs.</p>
