				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Plaintiffs seek, by writ of error, the review of an order of the
Court of First Instance of Manila dismissing the complaint in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Its factual background is this: On November 25, 1953, <span class="SpellE">Flaviana</span> <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> executed a deed
of extrajudicial partition stating that they are the widow and the only
legitimate son, respectively, of <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>, who died intestate in Manila on August 4, 1948,
and adjudica­ting unto themselves, in equal shares, three (3) houses, located
in the district of <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>, City of Manila,
belonging to said deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">Less than two (2) years later, or on July 8, 1955, Jose <span class="SpellE">Manangol</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> filed, with
the Court of First Instance of Manila, a petition, docketed as Special
Proceeding No. 26785 of said court, alleging that he is a legitimate son of the
deceased <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>
and the aforementioned <span class="SpellE">Flaviana</span> <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>,
and praying that he (Jose <span class="SpellE">Manangol</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>) be appointed administrator of the estate of said
deceased; that said deed of extrajudicial partition between <span class="SpellE">Flaviana</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> be declared of no force and effect; and that the
estate of the deceased be settled and distributed in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After appropriate proceedings, decision was
rendered therein dismissing said petition, upon the ground that Jose <span class="SpellE">Manangol</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> was, not a
legitimate son of <span class="SpellE">Flaviana</span> <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>, but
an illegitimate offspring of the latter and one <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Emilia</span>) <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal, taken by Jose <span class="SpellE">Manangol</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>, this decision was, on March 30, 1959,
affirmed by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 19361-R.</p>

<p class="BODY">Soon thereafter, or on <st1:date year="1959" day="24" month="5">May
 24, 1959</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Flaviana</span> <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>
died in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1959" day="23" month="12">December
 23, 1959</st1:date>, the Court of First Instance thereof approved in said
Special Proceeding No. 26785, the project of partition of the estate of <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>, deceased,
between the estate of <span class="SpellE">Flaviana</span> <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>,
deceased, and <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>,
in equal shares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Presently, or on <st1:date year="1960" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1960</st1:date>, the latter executed
an affidavit adjudicating unto himself the estates of <span class="SpellE">Flaviana</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>, consisting of cash amounting to P5,896.52 and
the aforementioned three (3) houses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, or on <st1:date year="1960" day="21" month="1">January 21,
 1960</st1:date>, said Court issued an order declaring the aforementioned
Special Proceeding closed and relieving the administrator therein appointed
from further responsibility, as such, <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> having acknowledged receipt from him of the
properties constituting the estates of his aforementioned parents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Over three (3) years later, or on November 4, 1963, said Jose <span class="SpellE">Manangol</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> and Antonio
and <span class="SpellE">Adalaida</span>, both surnamed <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>
– hereinafter referred to collectively as plaintiffs – commenced the present
action, in the same Court, against <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> – hereinafter referred to as the defendant –
alleging that plaintiffs Antonio and <span class="SpellE">Adalaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> are the children of <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> and Francisca <span class="SpellE">Untalan</span>;
that said plaintiffs had enjoyed the status of children of said <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>, by direct
acts of the latter and by admissions, made, in judicial proceedings, by the
late <span class="SpellE">Flaviana</span> <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span> and
defendant, <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>;
that said plaintiffs and Jose <span class="SpellE">Manangol</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> used to believe that <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> and <span class="SpellE">Flaviana</span> <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span> were married; that plaintiffs Antonio and <span class="SpellE">Adalaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>, accordingly,
thought that they were illegitimate children of <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>; that, sometime in 1962, plaintiffs found
that the marriage of <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Flaviana</span> <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span> does
not appear in the indices of marriages, from 1900 to 1904, of the Civil
Registrar for the City of Manila; and that defendant <span class="SpellE">Justo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>, acting in conspiracy with <span class="SpellE">Flaviana</span> <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>, had
deliberately and fraudulently deprived the plaintiffs of their lawful share in
the estate of <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>,
as his acknowledged natural children, by misrepresenting that he was married to
<span class="SpellE">Flaviana</span> <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>, and
concealing his competence to contract mar­riage at the time of the conception
and birth of said plaintiffs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The latter prayed, therefore, that judgment be rendered declaring
that they <span style="">and </span>the defendant are
acknowledged natural children of <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> and that the order of distribution of his estate
in Special Proceeding No. 26785 and the adjudication of said estate, made by
the defendant in his favor, is of no force and effect, apart from adjudicating
to the plaintiffs their respective shares in the estate aforementioned and
ordering the defendant to convey to each of the plaintiffs herein one-fourth of
said estate.</p>

<p class="BODY">As above indicated, the lower court ordered this case dismissed,
upon the ground: a) that the complaint states no cause of action; b) that said
court had no jurisdiction over the subject matter thereof; and c) that said
cause of action, if any, is barred by the statute of limitations of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, plaintiffs' appeal, which is untenable
for:</p>

<p class="NUM">1) The complaint does not show that <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> and <span class="SpellE">Flaviana</span> <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span> were not married.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lack of reference to their marriage in the indices of marriages, for
the years 1900 to 1904, of the Office of the Civil Registrar for <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
does not establish plaintiffs' claim, for said couple may have been married at
some other time or at some other place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, having concededly lived together as husband and wife for many
years, they are presumed to be legally married, unless and until the contrary
is satisfactorily proven.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The allegations in plaintiffs' complaint, even if proven, are inadequate to
offset this presumption.</p>

<p class="NUM">2) The alleged continuous possession by plaintiffs of the status
of acknowledged natural children of <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> does not suffice to support their claim for a
share of his estate, as such acknowledged natural children, because:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.3in; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a) The very complaint
shows that, up to 1962, plaintiffs thought that their father was married to <span class="SpellE">Flaviana</span> <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>; that the
general impression, therefore, was that he could not have married Francisca <span class="SpellE">Untalan</span> - the mother of plaintiffs Antonio and <span class="SpellE">Adalaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> - at the time
of their (plaintiffs') conception and birth (on January 17, 1926 and December
16, 1928); that they (plaintiffs), accordingly, believed they were <u>illegitimate</u>
(not natural) children; and that this - status of illegiti­mate children - was,
therefore, the status the possession of which they enjoyed.</p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>b) Continuous possession of the status of
a <u>natural</u> child which is <u>not</u> the status plaintiffs had possessed
- does not automatically confer the legal status of an acknowledged natural
child.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> Under the Civil Code of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Spain</st1:place></st1:country-region>
- which was the law applicable at the time of the death of <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span>,
in 1948 - it was, at best, a ground for compulsory recognition of said status,
which must precede an action for adjudication of their share as alleged heirs
of the deceased.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> Indeed, under the provisions of
said Code, a natural child, who is not <u>acknowledged</u> as such, has no <span class="SpellE">successional</span> rights to the estate of his natural father.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>c)
Pursuant to Article 137 of the Civil Code of Spain, an action for compulsory
recognition of a natural child may be brought only during the lifetime of the
presumed pa­rents, except:</p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the father or mother died
during the minority of the child, in which case the latter may commence the
action within the four years next following the attainment of its majority.</p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, after the death of the
father or mother, some document, before unknown, should be discovered in which
the child is expressly acknowledged.</p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"In this
case the action must be commenced within the six months next following the
discovery of such document."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The case at bar does not come under any of these exceptions,
except as regards plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Adalaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>, who became of age on December 16, 1949.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> However, she did not bring this action until <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1963</st1:date>, or long after the
expiration of the period prescribed in said Article 137, or that (2 years)
provided in Section 45 of Act No. 190,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> or in
Art. 285 of the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3) The Court of First Instance of Manila has no jurisdiction to
hear and decide cases for acknowledgment of natural children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to Section 38-A, par. (6) of
Republic Act No. 1401, such jurisdiction, in the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
is vested <u><span style="">exclusively</span></u><span style=""> </span>in the Court of Juvenile and Domestic
Relations. As we ruled in B. <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> vs. J. T.
Paterno:<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> by
the creation of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court, with its ex­clusive
jurisdiction over cases involving paternity and acknowledgment, recognition of
children and recovery of hereditary shares can <u>no</u> longer be properly
joined as causes of action, since <u><span style="">each
lies within the jurisdiction of a different tribunal</span></u><span style="">."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">4) As regards plaintiff <span style="">Jose
</span><span class="SpellE">Manangol</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>,
his claim as an alleged acknowledged natural child of <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> is, moreover, barred by the decision in
Case No. 26785 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, declaring that he is
the illegitimate son of <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>
and "one <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> (<span class="SpellE">Emilia</span>)
<span class="SpellE">Pañgilinan</span>".<span style="">&nbsp;
