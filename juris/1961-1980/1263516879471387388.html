COURT OF APPEALS AND ACE LUMBER CO., INC., RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This review of a decision of the Court of Appeals involves the
vexed question whether a party who files a motion to reconsider on the last day
of the period allotted by the Rules may still validly take further steps to
protect his interest the day after receiving the notice of denial of his
motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ace Lumber Co. Inc., had resorted to the Court of Appeals against
an adverse decision of the court of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its appeal (docketed as CA-G. R. No. 3637-R)
was dismissed by the appellate court for failure to submit its printed record
on appeal in due time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolution of
dismissal, dated <st1:date year="1966" day="9" month="3">9 March 1966</st1:date>,
was received by the appellant on <st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="3">22
 March 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fifteen days
later, on 6 April 1966, the appellant filed a motion for reconsideration, but
the Court of Appeals denied it by a resolution received by <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
on 9 April.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The very next day, appellant
filed a second motion for reconsideration, with leave of the court, and the
latter, after considering the motion, granted it and reinstated the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, Mara, Inc., contending
that the second motion had been filed on the sixteenth day, asked the court to
declare the original dismissal of the appeal to have become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
of Appeals declined to do so, and the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
unsuccessful in its attempts to induce said court to alter its position, came
to US on certiorari, charging abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question at issue had been considered and decided by this
Supreme Court in the case of <span class="SpellE">Lloren</span> vs. de <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>, 4 S.C.R.A. 637, promulgated on 28 March 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There an appeal was rejected as out of time
on the ground that, counting the total time elapsed between notice of the
decision and the filing of the appeal notice, record and bond, less the time
when the motion of new trial had been pending, the difference showed that the
appeal was late by one day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appellant, on the other hand, contended that since he filed the motion to
reconsider on the fifteenth day,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
the latter should not be counted, because it had not fully elapsed; hence,
appellant argued he was entitled to one more day to perfect his appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court then ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"After a mature deliberation, where the members of the Court
delved once more into the methods of computation discussed in the cases
mentioned by counsel for respondent, the Court resolved not to follow the
ruling in either of them and to adhere strictly to the rule of computation
embodied in Rule 28 of our rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
idea that prevailed is that since petitioner <span class="SpellE">Lloren</span>
filed his motion for reconsideration on the 15th day of the period within which
he may perfect his appeal, that day should be excluded so that when he received
copy of the order denying his motion for reconsideration he had still 1 day
within which to perfect his appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
period of one day should be computed again in accordance with the rule above
cited by excluding the day of receipt and including the next day, which in this
case is 17 April 1958.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the Court
concluded that the appeal interposed by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Lloren</span>
was still within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above ruling was embodied in the second paragraph of section
3, Rule 41, of the Revised Rules of 1964, that reads:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>How appeal
is taken</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- - - - - - - - - - - - -
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
- - - - - - - - - - - -.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"</span>But where such
a motion has been filed during office hours of the last day of the period
herein provided, the appeal must be perfected within the day following that in
which the party appealing received notice of the denial of said motion."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner argues that
the <span class="SpellE">Lloren</span> doctrine and section 3 of Rul</span>e 41
apply only to the computation of periods for appeal, and not to the fixing of
the finality of other orders of dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nothing would be gained, however, by changing the rule, and much
confusion would be avoided by applying a uniform method of computing periods
under circumstances similar to the <span class="SpellE">Lloren</span> case, where
motions that stop the running of peremptory periods are filed on the last day
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, in both the <span class="SpellE">Lloren</span> case and the one before us, the question posed is
the same:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>whether the judgment, or the
order dismissing the appeal, had acquired finality.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner points out
that by section 1, Rule 54, of the old Rules of Court, regarding motions for
rehearing or reconsideration, the appellate court was expressly granted (in the
last clause of said section) discretion to admit second motions for
reconsideration if filed "within two days from notice of the order denying
the first motion"; and that the Revised Rule 52 on the same subject
eliminated such saving proviso.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
attach no imÂ­portance to this feature, for the provision quoted had to be
eliminated as plainly incompatible with the doctrine of the <span class="SpellE">Lloren</span>
case that had been incorporated in Revised Rule 41.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The suppression, therefore, did not import a
departure from the basic doctrine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the petition for a writ of certiorari is
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against petitioner Mara,
Inc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
