<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Original petition in this Court 
by Marino A. Bautista for writs of certiorari and prohibition to annul an order 
denying his two motions to dismiss private respondent's complaint, and another 
order refusing to reconsider the preceding one, both issued by respondent judge 
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> in Civil 
Case No. 2486 entitled "G. A. Machineries, Inc., plaintiff, versus Marino A. 
Bautista, defendant", and to prohibit respondent judge from requiring petitioner 
to enter into the trial of said Civil Case No. 2486 and from further proceeding 
with said case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">From the record, we find that on 
28 December 1961 G. A. Machineries, Inc., commenced said case No. 2486 by a 
complaint alleging, <i>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></i>, that on or 
about 27 January 1960 defendant purchased from plaintiff certain personal 
properties described therein, all valued at P83,800.00, for which the former 
made a down payment of P12,570.00 and agreed to pay the balance of P71,230.00 in 
eleven (11) monthly installments starting from 28 February 1960, as evidenced by 
the sales contract attached therein; that defendant executed a chattel mortgage 
contract over the same personal properties to secure the payment of the unpaid 
balance of the purchase price, covered by several promissory notes, copy of 
which mortgage contract and notes are attached; that the parties agreed that in 
case defendant should violate any condition thereof, and/or fail to pay any due 
and demandable note, plaintiff would be entitled to take possession of said 
personal properties, to extra-judicially foreclose said mortgage, in which event 
defendant is liable to pay 25% of the total amount due as liquidated damages and 
attorney' s fees; that defendant failed to pay his obligations; that plaintiff 
applied to the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> for the 
extra-judicial foreclosure of said mortgage but the latter could not proceed 
with the auction sale because defendant failed and refused, despite demands made 
<span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, to deliver and surrender said personal 
properties. Whereupon, plaintiff prayed that defendant be ordered (a) to deliver 
said personal properties, and/or that the provisional remedy of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> be issued upon the filing of the requisite bond; 
(b) to pay the sum of P20,217.52, as liquidated damages and attorney's fees; and 
(c) in the event of non-delivery of said personal properties, to pay the sum of 
P71,230.00 plus interest thereon at the rate of 12% per annum from 28 February 
1960 until the same is fully paid; plus costs of the suit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In due time, after summons, 
defendant Marino A. Bautista filed, on 2 April 1962, a motion to dismiss the 
above-mentioned complaint, on the grounds that (a) there is another action 
pending between the same parties for the same cause, which Marino A. Bautista, 
together with a certain <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Jalandoni</span>, as plaintiffs, filed against G. A. Machineries, 
Inc., as defendant, in the Court of First Instance of Manila and docketed 
therein as its Civil Case No. 27110, for accounting and damages; and (b) that 
the filing of the complaint by G. A. Machineries, Inc., in <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> constitutes multiplicity of suits, which is not 
allowed by the Rules of Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Plaintiff submitted, on 
</span><st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="4"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">24 April 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, its 
opposition to said motion, to which opposition defendant Bautista presented, on 
</span><st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="4"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">30 April 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, his 
reply. To this reply defendant Joined a supplemental motion to dismiss, setting 
forth as additional ground <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> that venue was 
improperly laid, since plaintiff and defendant have expressly stipulated in 
their sales and chattel mortgage contracts that "in case of any litigation 
arising (t<span class="GramE">)<span class="SpellE">herefrom</span></span> or in 
connection (t)herewith, the venue of action shall be in the City of Manila, 
Philippines".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="5"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">8 May 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
trial court acted on the original motion to dismiss and issued an order <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"<strong><span style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Verdana;">IN</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Verdana;">VIEW OF THE FOREGOING 
CONSIDERATIONS</span></strong><b>, </b>the Court hereby suspends further 
proceedings in this case as well as suspends the period within which the 
defendant should file his responsive pleadings until after final determination 
of Civil Case No. 47110 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, entitled <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Jalandoni</span> vs. G. A. 
Machineries, Inc."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Apparently, the parties did not 
immediately receive copies of the <span class="SpellE">abovequoted</span> order, 
because plaintiff, on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="11" month="5"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">11 May 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
filed opposition to the supplemental motion to dismiss, while defendant replied 
to the opposition on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="5"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">15 May 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="9"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">17 
September 1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the clerk of the trial court 
notified the parties that the case was set for hearing on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="12" month="10"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">12 October 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On this last mentioned date, the 
trial court reconsidered and set aside the order of </span><st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="5"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">8 May 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
suspending the proceedings; denied defendant's supplemental motion to dismiss; 
and, at the same time, reset the case for hearing on November 
1962.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="10"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">15 
October 1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, defendant moved to reconsider 
the orders of </span><st1:date year="1962" day="12" month="10"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">12 October 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and 
to cancel the scheduled hearing in view of the fact that he had not yet filed 
his answer to the complaint and, therefore, the issues had not been joined. 
Plaintiff opposed said motion and countered with a motion to declare defendant 
in default.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="22" month="10"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">22 
October 1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, defendant filed a 
manifestation, advising the trial court that he intends to file a petition for 
certiorari and prohibition in the Supreme Court for the purpose of annulling the 
now questioned orders and reiterating his motion to cancel or hold in abeyance 
the scheduled hearing on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="11"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">13 November 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
Defendant attached to this manifestation his answer to the complaint, which 
requested to be admitted to obviate the possibility of his being declared in 
default.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="11"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">13 
November 1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the trial court denied both 
defendant's motion for reconsideration and plaintiff's motion to declare 
defendant in default; however, it admitted defendant's answer and, at the same 
time, allowed plaintiff to present its evidence ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> for failure of defendant and his counsel to appear at 
the hearing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Plaintiff was unable to finish 
presenting its evidence on the same day and the trial court continued the 
hearing of the case for 11 December 1962, at which later date defendant and his 
counsel again failed to attend; but they sent, instead, a copy of the petition 
filed in this Court. <span class="GramE">Notwithstanding, the trial court allowed 
plaintiff to proceed and terminate presenting its evidence and had the case 
submitted for decision.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The record also disclosed that 
petitioner filed, on 11 December 1962, the instant petition which was, at first, 
dismissed for lack of supporting papers; but later, upon motion, the dismissal 
was reconsidered and the petition given due course. This Court did not, however, 
issue any writ of preliminary injunction to stop the proceedings in the court 
below, since it was not asked in the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner Bautista now contends 
that respondent judge acted with patent and grave abuse of discretion, amounting 
to lack or excess of jurisdiction, in denying his original and supplemental 
motions to dismiss private respondent's complaint and in allowing it to proceed 
ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> with the trial of Civil Case No. 2486. It is 
insisted that when G. A. Machineries, Inc., filed its complaint in the Court of 
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, venue was improperly laid, 
since they (plaintiff and defendant therein) expressly stipulated in the sales 
and chattel mortgage contracts that any action arising between them in 
connection therewith should be instituted in the City of Manila, and this 
express stipulation amounts to a clear, valid and effective waiver on the part 
of plaintiff to Invoke the right of election granted it, as plaintiff, under the 
Rules of Court, to choose the venue; and that this stipulation was embodied in 
their contracts for his (Bautista" s) benefit and advantage because he has his 
principal office, and conducts principally his business, in the City of 
Manila.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Lastly, the petitioner avers that 
as soon as he manifested his decision to file a petition for certiorari and 
prohibition in the proper court, for the purpose of questioning the validity of 
the orders now complained of, respondent judge should have desisted or refrained 
from proceeding with the trial of said Civil Case No. 
2486.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Respondent G. A. Machineries, 
Inc., on the other hand, maintains that the express agreement on venue invoked 
by petitioner was intended solely for its convenience and benefit, and it still, 
therefore, retained the privilege or option to choose the venue granted it under 
Section 4, Rule 5, of the old Rules of Court (now Section 3, Rule 4, Revised 
Rules of Court), and since its (the corporation's) residence or domicile is in 
Polo (now Valenzuela), <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, the <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> Court of First Instance may properly take cognizance 
of said Civil Case No. 2486.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Respondent further maintains that 
since jurisdiction over the subject-matter or over the person is not in issue in 
the case at bar; that as improper venue does not constitute jurisdictional 
issue; that respondent judge has not been shown to have committed any grave 
abuse of discretion in denying petitioner's motions to dismiss; and that as the 
remedy of appeal is available to petitioner, the writs of certiorari and 
prohibition would be unavailing and ineffective remedies in the case at 
bar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The parties do not dispute that, 
in the written contracts sued upon, it was expressly stipulated that "in case of 
any litigation arising (t<span class="GramE">)<span class="SpellE">herefrom</span></span> or in connection (t)herewith, the venue of 
action shall be in the City of Manila, Philippines". We note that neither party 
to the contracts reserved the right to choose the venue of action as fixed by 
law (i.e., where the plaintiff or defendant resides, at the election of the 
plaintiff (par. (b), Section 2, Rule 4, Revised Rules of Court<span class="GramE">) ,</span>as is usually done if the parties purported to retain that 
right of election granted by the Rules. Such being the case, it can reasonably 
be inferred that the parties intended to definitely fix the venue of action, in 
connection with the written contracts sued upon, in the proper courts of the 
City of Manila only, notwithstanding that neither party is a resident of Manila. 
The Rules expressly sanction such stipulation by providing that " by written 
agreement of the parties the venue of action may be changed or transferred from 
one province to another" (Section 3, Rule 4, Revised Rules of Court), and, as 
aptly held in the case of Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span> de <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> vs. De Leon, 56 Phil. 169,-<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"By said agreement the parties 
waived the legal venue, and such waiver is valid and legally effective, because 
it was merely a personal privilege they waived, which is not contrary to public 
policy or to the prejudice of third persons. It is a general principle that a 
person may renounce any right which the law gives unless such renunciation is 
expressly prohibited or the right conferred is of such nature that its 
renunciation would be against public policy." 
<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It appearing that the action was 
brought in a place other than that fixed by the parties in their valid written 
contracts; that the ground of improper venue is clear and patent on the record 
of the case, the written contracts having been attached and made an integral 
part of the complaint; that the impropriety of the venue was properly and timely 
raised in a motion to dismiss; and that a writ of prohibition is a proper remedy 
when a trial court erroneously denies a motion to dismiss based on the ground of 
improper venue <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span>; we are 
constrained to rule that the trial court acted with grave abuse of discretion in 
denying petitioner's motions to dismiss based on the above-stated 
ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">With the above conclusion, it 
becomes unnecessary to consider the other issues raised by 
petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the writ of prohibition prayed 
for is hereby granted, and the respondent trial court is ordered to dismiss the 
complaint of G. A. Machineries, Inc., without prejudice to the filing of said 
complaint in the proper court. <span class="GramE">Costs against private 
respondent G. A. Machineries, Inc.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
