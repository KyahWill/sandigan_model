with mandatory preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 8, 1960 <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Garachico</span> (private respondent in the instant case) and
fourteen other former members of the police force of the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Naujan</span>, Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, filed
in the Court of First Instance of said province a petition for mandamus, quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span>, prohibition, and damages, with preliminary
injunction (Civil Case No. R-979) against <span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span> <span class="SpellE">Comia</span>, who was then the incumbent municipal mayor of <span class="SpellE">Naujan</span>, and the policemen who had replaced them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They prayed <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>
that judgment be rendered com­manding respondent <span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Comia</span> to reinstate them as members of the police
department of <span class="SpellE">Naujan</span> and ordering all the respondents
to pay, jointly and severally, the unpaid salaries due them since <st1:date year="1960" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1960</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the case was pending, the court became vacant with the
retirement of the presiding Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
virtue of Administrative Order No. 184, dated <st1:date year="1961" day="4" month="8">August 4, 1961</st1:date>, of the Secretary of Justice, Hon. Juan de <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> was authorized to hold court in Oriental and
Occidental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> for a period of not more than
three (3) months be­ginning <st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="9">September
 3, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge de <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> terminated the hearing of the case but before he
could decide it the period of his temporary assignment expired, and he had to
return to his permanent judicial station in <st1:city><st1:place>San Jose</st1:place></st1:city>,
Antique.</p>

<p class="BODY">Honorable Andres Sta. Maria took over as presiding Judge of the
Court of First Instance of Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="6">June
 25, 1963</st1:date> a motion to submit the case for decision was filed by
Atty. Nestor M. <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span>, one of the counsel of record
for the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the motion was
heard on <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1963</st1:date>,
Atty. Jose Rodrigo, one of the lawyers for the respondents, who happened to be
in court in connection with another case, manifested that Judge de <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> had al­ready rendered a decision, of which a copy had
been received by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also verbally
opposed the motion on the ground that he had not been furnished a copy thereof,
but he was required by the court to present his opposition in writing and to
submit evidence later to show that the case had in­deed been decided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="12" month="7">July
 12, 1963</st1:date> the motion was again heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Rodrigo failed to bring a copy of the
supposed decision of Judge de <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, Atty. Manuel <span class="SpellE">Gaba</span>,
another lawyer of record for the respondents, assured the court that he had a
copy of the decision, but that it was in <span class="SpellE">Naujan</span>,
Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In its desire to be enlightened on the matter, the court reset the
hearing of the motion for the next day and ordered Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gaba</span>
to produce the copy of the decision referred to.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the petitioners' motion was again heard on <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1964</st1:date>, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span> called the attention of the court to the fact that
a copy of an unsigned decision of Judge de <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>
appeared to have been attached to the records of the case but that there was
nothing to indicate how it was forwarded to the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He added that when the counsel for the
respondents tried to submit the unsigned copy he suggested that the submission
be held in abeyance until a signed copy was produced in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He therefore asked the court that the
unsigned copy "be either stricken out or taken from the records as having
been without any basis." Upon the court’s inquiry as to how it came to be
attached to the records, the Clerk of Court explained that he was verbally
instructed by the presiding Judge to so attach it when it was shown to the
latter by the Chief of Police (evidently of <span class="SpellE">Naujan</span>,
Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There­upon the presiding Judge asked the Clerk for proof that he had
given such instruction, and forthwith ordered that the copy of the decision be
detached.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the same hearing of January 9, 1964, Atty. Rodrigo was
allowed by the court to withdraw as counsel for the respondents upon his
representation that he was no longer on speaking terms with his clients by
reason of his change of party affiliation during the local elections of
1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The principal counsel for the
respondents, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gaba</span>, also asked the court that he
be substituted by another lawyer in view of his appointment as Assistant
Director of the Patent Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first
the court tried to dissuade him from with­drawing his appearance, stating
"that the case has dragged to a point where the appearance of other
counsel would prejudice the early disposition of this case considering that it
is a special remedy filed in 1960 and until now it has remained un­decided."
However, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gaba</span> assured the court that he would
look for a substitute, and there and then recommended Atty. Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Nieva</span>, who was then present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Atty. <span class="SpellE">Nieva</span> ex­pressed
his willingness to handle the case, the court granted Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gaba's</span>
verbal petition and ordered that "the appearance of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Nieva</span> be entered as counsel for the respondents in
substitution of all the lawyers who have heretofore appeared for the
respondents." The substitution of counsel having been effected, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span> immediately presented a verbal motion that he be
allowed to file a memorandum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court
granted the motion and ordered that:</p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The counsel for the peti­tioner, Atty. Nestor
<span class="SpellE">Andrada</span>, is hereby given fifteen days within which to
file a supplemental memorandum, and Atty. Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Nieva</span>,
counsel for the respondent, is likewise given the same period of time after the
receipt of said supplemental memorandum to file any responsive pleading if he
so desire, after which this case shall be considered submitted for
decision."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing proceedings took place before Judge Sta.
Maria.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But before he could render a
decision, he was transferred to another judicial station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In July 1964 Hon. <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span>
P. Nicolas assumed office as presiding Judge of the same court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding that the case was still undecided
although already submitted, he rendered a decision on <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1964</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which he amended in an order dated <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1964</st1:date>, to read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the
respondents and against the petitioners except <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span>
<span class="SpellE">Garachico</span> declaring valid and lawful the termination
of the services and removal of the petitioners Ben de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Reyes, <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> Conte, Francisco Villegas, <span class="SpellE">Honorio</span> Hernandez, <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span> <span class="SpellE">Gupit</span>, Jose Alvarez, Hugo <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>,
Alfonso de la <span class="SpellE">Torre</span>, <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gozar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, Jose Mendoza, <span class="SpellE">Lauro</span>
Gutierrez, <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Labaguis</span>
and Robinson Robles from the positions of lieutenant, sergeant, corporals and
patrolmen of the Police Depart­ment of <span class="SpellE">Naujan</span>, this
province, and con­sequently, their claim for salaries and damages is hereby
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court hereby declares
invalid and illegal the termination of services and removal of the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Garachico</span> who is a
civil service eligible from the position of patrolman of the police department
of <span class="SpellE">Naujan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court hereby orders the respondent Municipal Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Naujan</span>
<u>or any one acting in his place as Municipal Mayor of said municipality</u>
to reinstate immediately said petitioner <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Garachico</span> and, correspondingly, it is hereby ordered that
the salary of the said petitioner <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Garachico</span> at the rate of P130.00 a month to be paid to him
from January 1, 1960 up to the time of his actual reinstatement; his claim for
the damages is hereby denied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The counterclaim for damages filed by the respondents is also
hereby dismissed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Evidently the amendment, which consists of the insertion of the
phrase "or any one acting in his place as Municipal Mayor of said
municipality" in the last sentence, first paragraph, of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion, was made in order to bind anyone
acting as Municipal Mayor in place of respondent <span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Comia</span>, who resigned in January 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Nieva</span>, who
had been substituted as counsel of record for respondents, was not served with
copies of the decision and of the amendatory order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, Atty. Rodrigo, the former lawyer for
the respondents, was furnished with a copy of the decision itself, and Mayor
Manuel Marcos of <span class="SpellE">Naujan</span>, with a copy of the
amendatory order, the latter receiving it on <st1:date year="1964" day="14" month="9">September 14, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1964</st1:date>
the respondents, through their then newly engaged counsel, Attys. <span class="SpellE">Mascardo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Calupitan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>, filed with the lower court a motion to set aside
judgment on the ground that the case had already been dis­missed by Judge de <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attached to
and in support of the motion were:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) a
certification by the said Judge stating that on <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1962</st1:date> he dismissed the petition and that he
sent his decision to the Clerk of the Court of First Instance of Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> on or about the same date, and (2) a copy of the
decision itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the motion to
set aside the judgment (of Judge Nicolas) could be re­solved, the petitioners
filed their first motion for the exe­cution thereof on <st1:date year="1964" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1964</st1:date>
the court denied the motion to set aside judgment "for being
unmeritorious." Said the Court:</p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondents, thru their new counsel,
cannot and should not be allowed to seek the setting aside of the decision
rendered after the parties had submitted the case for decision; and after they
have led the Court to believe that the case was sub­mitted for decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Court cannot be set aside
on the allegation of the existence of another decision which was not brought to
its attention by the remedy provided for by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not to impugn the merit of the
decision of Judge de <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>, much less His Honor's cer­tification
to the effect that he rendered a decision on <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1962</st1:date> which was sent to the Clerk of Court of
Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The merit of the decision of Honorable Juan de <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>
and his certifica­tion are not in issue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is pivotal in this case is the inaction for so long a time of the
respondents in not taking the necessary legal steps to bring to the at­tention
of the Court the existence of that decision of Judge de <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This inaction amounting to latches produced
consequences the legal effects of which must necessarily be assumed by the
respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They created it and hence
they must suffer for it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under Section 1, Rule 26 of the New Rules of Court, the
decision must be (1) signed by the Judge and (2) filed with the Clerk of Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As adverted to above, the decision of Judge de <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> was not filed with the Clerk of Court, and hence,
lacking in that requisite, the Court cannot validly con­sider said
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This circumstance pro­bably
induced respondents to submit the case for decision on <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For if they had in their possession copies of the decision or if they
knew its existence, they would not have submitted this case for decision."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1964</st1:date>
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Calupitan</span>, who had not been served with a copy
of the aforesaid order, filed an opposition to the motion for execution,
alleging that the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period for appeal had
been interrupted by the motion to set aside judgment.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
On January 27, 1965 the petitioners again filed a motion for execution, which
was granted by the lower court in an order dated <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="2">February 3, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Manifesting that they had not received a copy of the order denying the
motion to set aside judgment and intimating that they would appeal, counsel for
the respondents filed on <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="2">February 8,
 1965</st1:date> a belated opposition to the second motion for execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the order of <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="2">February

execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners opposed the
motion and asked the court to cite Mayor Marcos for contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span>
filed his reply and opposition to the petitioners' motion for contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="21" month="5">May

Mayor Manuel Marcos personally filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for

portion of the decision dated <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="9">September
 9, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support thereof,

its transmit­tal to and receipt by the Clerk of the Court of First Instance of

both parties, numerous records and documents were annexed to the memorandum and

<p class="BODY">With the denial of their motion, <span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Comia</span> and Chief of Police Antonio <span class="SpellE">Gaba</span>,

and the other orders of the respondent Judge in Civil Case No. R-979; that said
decision, as amended, and the other orders be all declared null and void; and

preliminary injunction was issued on <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="6">June
 18, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal issue posed in this case concerns the jurisdiction
of the respondent Judge in rendering the decision of <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1964</st1:date>, as well as the amendatory order
of <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1964</st1:date>, and,
of course, the validity thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> contend
that since the case had been decided by Judge de <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>
on <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1962</st1:date>, which
decision had already become final, the decision of respondent Judge on <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1964</st1:date> was an absolute
nullity, as was also the amendatory order of <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, private respondent <span class="SpellE">Garachico</span>
denies the existence of the decision of Judge de <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>
and therefore maintains that the respondent Judge acted within his juris­diction
in deciding the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The questions of fact raised by herein petitioner have a decisive
bearing on the instant petition, but were not passed upon by respondent

particularly the deposition of Hon. Juan de <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>
taken on February 12, 1966 in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, Valenzuela Branch,
clearly show that on February 13, 1962 said Judge de <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>
penned a decision in Case No. R-979 of the Court of First Instance of Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>; that on February 14, 1962, under a transmittal
letter of the same date, he sent the said decision and the records of the case,
together with other records and decisions, to the Clerk of the Court of First
Instance of Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, via the Philippine Air
Lines under its Airway Bill No. P-00351; and that the aforementioned decisions
and records, including the decision and records of Case No. R-979, were
received by the then Clerk of Court, <span class="SpellE">Cristino</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, on <st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="2">February
 17, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The in­consistency
noted by the private respondent here between the statement in the affidavit of
Clerk of Court <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> to the effect that he received
the decision by registered mail, and the statement of Judge de <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> in his deposition that he sent it by the Philippine
Air Lines, does not alter the fact that the decision in the case was in fact
received by the Clerk of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, the decision of Judge de <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> was validly rendered in accordance with Section 1,
Rule 36<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
in relation with Section 9, Rule 135<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>,
of the Revised Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to
be noted that it is the filing of the judgment with the Clerk of Court that con­stitutes
rendition thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the judgment is
signed out­side the province by reason of the expiration of the temporary
assignment of the trial judge who terminated the hearing of the case, it is
considered filed with the Clerk of Court as of the date when the same is
received by him.</p>

<p class="BODY">That Judge de <span class="SpellE">Borja’s</span> decision was
received by the Clerk of Court is indubitably established by the
following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) The monthly reports submitted
by the then Clerk of Court (<span class="SpellE">Cristino</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>) to the Department of Justice for December 1961 and
January 1962 show that Case No. R-979 was pending decision; the monthly report
for <span class="SpellE">Feburary</span> 1962 shows that it had been
decided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(2) The annexes also clearly
show that both parties were served with copies of the decision of Judge de <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his
affidavit, the former Clerk of Court declared that he effected the service by
registered mail addressed to the respective attorneys of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(3) His allegation is supported by the
photographs of the registry receipt stubs of the <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span>
post office and by the certification of the postmaster that "registered
letters Nos. 2497, 2502 and 2503 were sent by the Court of First Instance of
Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> on February 28, 1962 to Attys.
Manuel <span class="SpellE">Gaba</span>, Jose Rodrigo and Romeo <span class="SpellE">Comia</span>, respectively, all residents of <span class="SpellE">Naujan</span>,
Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>"; (4) Receipt of said letters
by the respective ad­dressees is shown by the photographs of the corresponding
entries in the Registry Book of the <span class="SpellE">Naujan</span> post
office and by the certification of the postmaster to the effect that on March
2, 3 and 5, 1962, Attys. <span class="SpellE">Gaba</span>, Rodrigo and <span class="SpellE">Comia</span> received registered letters Nos. 2497, 2502 and 2503,
respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Comia</span>
has not denied that he received his copy; and since, as pointed out by the
petitioners herein in their memo­randum in support of their motion of December
8, 1965 (Annex "P" of the petition), the petitioners in the court
below filed their petition jointly and were represented by several lawyers, one
of whom was Atty. <span class="SpellE">Comia</span>, service upon him may be
deemed to be the service upon the others.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
No appeal having been perfected nor any motion for reconsideration filed within
the thirty-day period from <st1:date year="1962" day="5" month="3">March 5,

final on <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case, therefore, was removed from power

On page 25 of the Memorandum In Support of Defendants' motion dated December 8,

"up to February 8, 1966, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Calupitan</span> was
never furnished a copy of the order of denial dated November 27, 1964, and
during the hearing on February 8, 1966, the attention of the trial court was
