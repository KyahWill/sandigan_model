				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">From 1949 to 1964 the <span class="SpellE">Alatco</span>
Transportation, Inc. (herein­after referred to as the petitioner) employed <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> Rosales<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
(herein­after referred to as the claimant) as a regular driver of its passenger
buses plying the <span class="SpellE">Naga-Partido</span> route.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claimant started working after undergoing
a pre-employment physical examination given by the petitioner's company
physician who found him healthy and without physical defect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claimant received a starting monthly
salary of P120, which was raised to P135 after a year of service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in 1955, he became a driver on
commission basis, earning about P2<span style="">80</span>
to P300 per month.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1964</st1:date>
he filed with the regional office no. 6 in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
a claim for compensation; he alleged that because of his continuous work as a
driver and the concomitant strain and fatigue, he contracted pulmonary
tuberculosis, among other afflictions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
report of the petitioner's company physician, accompanying the <span style="">aforesaid claim, attributed the illness of
the claimant to the nature of his work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The physician recommended his assignment to a desk job.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner, on <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="11">November
 12, 1964</st1:date>, filed its report of sickness, disclaiming knowledge of
anything that happened to the claimant on <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hearing on the merits by referee <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span>
D. <span class="SpellE">Sarto</span> followed; on <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1966</st1:date>, the said referee rendered a decision in
favor of the claimant, finding that the latter had contracted his sickness in
the course of his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
decision ordered the petitioner (1) to pay the claimant the amount of P<span style="">2</span>,728 as compensation, cover­ing the period
from June 15, 1965 to July 31, 1966, pursuant to sec­tion 14 of the Workmen's
Compensation Act, as amended; (2) to pay the claimant the amount of P46.49
every week after July 31, 1966, subject to the limitations on the duration and
amount of payment provided for by the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
law, and to extend further medical services to the said claimant until his
sickness is pronounced cured; (3) to pay the claimant's counsel the amount of
P136.41 as attorney's fees; and (4) to pay the regional office the amount of
P28 as adminis­trative fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The referee denied a motion for reconsideration filed by the
petitioner and, considering the said motion as partaking of the nature of a
petition for review, forwarded the record of the case to the Workmen's Compensation
Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 13, 1967 the Workmen's Compensation Commission
(hereinafter referred to as the Commission), through Chairman Nieves <span class="SpellE">Baens</span> del Rosario, rendered a decision affirming the find­ings
of the referee, and ordering the petitioner (1) to pay the claimant the sum of
P4,914 as compensation, covering the period from June 16, 1965 to July 16,
1967, pursuant to section 14 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended; (2)
to pay the claim­ant a weekly compensation of P45.50 starting July 22, 1967
until his sickness is pronounced cured, the total sum payable not to exceed
P6,000; (3) to continue providing the claimant with medical services,
appliances and supplies until his sickness is pronounced cured; (4) to pay the
claimant's counsel the sum of P491.40 as attorney's fees; and (5) to pay to the
workmen's compensation fund the sum of P55 for administrative costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner subsequently sought reconsideration of the
aforesaid decision of <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 5, 1969 the Com­mission <u>en</u>
<u>banc</u> denied the petitioner's motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petition for <i>certiorari</i>, filed on March
7, <span style="">1969.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The questions presented for resolution relate to the matter of
the compensability of the illness of pulmonary tuberculosis con­tracted by the
claimant, and the grant to him of disability compen­sation and medical benefits
by the Commission.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the threshold, the
petitioner claims that no basis exists to sustain the award of compensation to
the claimant, alleging as fundamental error the finding of the <span class="SpellE">Comission</span> that the claimant's pulmonary tuberculosis arose
out of and in the course of his em­ployment and that his work aggravated his
illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner stresses that
the claimant was no longer suffering from the illness complained of in October,
1964 when he applied for compensation; this fact, the petitioner adds, renders
incongruous the finding of the Commission that the claimant's work aggravated
his pulmonary tuberculosis, then pronounced cured and/or arrested by the peti­tioner's
company physician.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Commission found</p>

<blockquote>"... that the cause of the sickness was in pursuance of his
(the claimant's) employment or that it was the result of the nature of such
employ<span style="">ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that all the pertinent symptoms and signs
disappeared on confinement and came back only when actually on duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore clear that his sickness was
the result of or aggravated by the nature of his employment as driver of the
respondent company..."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The Commission also found the work
assigned to the claimant dele­terious to his health, making him an easy prey of
the dreadful tubercle bacilli.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no cogent reason to disregard the findings of fact
arrived at by the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Modification or reversal of the findings of fact made by the Commission
may be justified only by the absence of substantial evidence in support
thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Repudiation of the conclusions reached must be based on a patent showing of
failure on the part of the Commission to properly evaluate the evi­dence on
record or to consider fundamental and clear logical rela­tionships in the
evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We have carefully
examined the record; we find that the Commission's findings of fact are amply
supported by the record.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner presses the point that the claimant, at the time
he filed his claim on October 15, 1964, was no longer suffering from active
pulmonary tuberculosis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission's
pertinent findings on this point, which indicate the contrary, deserve
attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Primarily, the referee found
- a finding subsequent affirmed by the Commission - that the petitioner knew of
the claimant's illness even prior to the filing of the claim in October 1964 <span style="">"despite its </span>earnest pretensions <span style="">to </span>the contrary." Then, the
Commission also found that the claimant, due to his illness, <span style="">stopped working on September 6, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, on June 16, 1965, the claimant, by
letter, informed the petitioner of his urgent need for money for his
hospitalization and operation expenses, which the said petitioner failed to provide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Believing that his separation from the
service constituted the most immediate of means of obtaining the much-needed
money, he applied for separation which the petitioner, without hesitation,
granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the petitioner
gave the claimant separation pay in the amount of P1,200 corresponding to the
period from July 1, 1949 to September 6, 1964.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We thus gather, evident from the foregoing findings of the
Commission, that at the time the claimant sent the letter seeking monetary aid
and requesting severance from the service, he was still in the employ of the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More important, during the
intervening period from September 6, 1964 (when the claimant ceased working due
to his illness) to June 15, 1965 (when he sought separation from the service)
he evidently was still suffering from the affliction complained of; otherwise,
there would have been no urgency in his appeal for financial help to meet his
hospitalization expenses.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second question
relates to the disability compensa­tion granted to the claimant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner vigorously objects to the
order of the Commission requiring it to pay the claimant the amount of P4,914
as compensation corresponding to the period from June 16, 1965 to July 16, 1967
and the amount of <span style="">P45.50 as weekly
compensation starting July 22, 1967 </span>until full treatment of the
claimant's illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner
alleges error on the part of the Commission in obligating it to pay the
claimant weekly compensation from <span style="">July
22, 1967, </span>contending that the claimant's sepa­ration from service on
June 16, 1965 resulted in the termination of employer-employee
relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since section 14 of
the Work­men's Compensation Act contemplates compensation for the period of
disability while the employer-employee relationship subsists, the petitioner
submits that it is no longer liable to pay the claimant any compensation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record reveals that the Commission computed the amount due
from the petitioner from June 16, 1965 - the date of the claimant's actual
separation from the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
claimant's disability, how­ever, actually started on September 6, 1964 when his
illness compelled him to stop working.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Disability compensation represents lost or impaired earnings of a
claimant due to his illness and becomes <span style="">due
from the time his earning power is lost or impaired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The liability, therefore, of the petitioner
to pay the disability compensation accrued on September 6, 1964 (when the
claimant's illness impaired his earning capacity) and subsisted only until June
16, 1965 (when the claimant was actually separated from service or, more parti­cularly,
when the employer-employee relationship between the petitioner and the claimant
ceased).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As modified, the amount of
disability compensation owing from the petitioner computed in accordance with
section 14 of the Workmen's Compensation Act amounts to only P1</span><span style="">,</span><span style="">820,
arrived at as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the claimant's
daily wage of P10.83 (per finding of the Commission) multiplied by 7 working
days equals P75.81 - the said claimant's weekly average wage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sixty <span class="SpellE">percentum</span> of
P75.81 is P45.50; P45.50 multiplied by 40 weeks corresponding to the period
from September 6, 1964 to June 16, 1965 amounts to P</span>1,820.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We
find no basis to sustain the grant of compensation after June 16, 1965 - the
date of termination of the employer-employee relationship between the
petitioner and the claimant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner finally
questions the order of the Commis­sion requiring it to provide the claimant
with further medical ser­vices, appliances and supplies.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fundamentally, the liability of an employer to provide medical
attendance and hospital services and supplies subsists during the entire period
of the employee's disability, notwithstanding the cessa­tion of
employer-employee relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
suffices that the employee contracted his illness during his employment or that
the nature of his work aggravated his illness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This obligation of the employer relating to medical attendance lasts
until arrest of the illness subject of compensation.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Only the unreasonable refusal of the disabled employee to accept the medical
services extended by his employer and his voluntary obstruction of such
services constitute justifiable grounds to defeat this right of the employee to
medical attendance.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 13 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, in obligating the
employer to furnish medical services to a sick employee, provides neither the
maximum amount payable by the employer nor the maximum time period during which
the employer's liability for medical expenses subsists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrari­ly, the said section requires the
employer to furnish the employee with such medical, surgical, and hospital
"services, appliances and supplies as the nature of his disability and the
process of his recovery may require." Thus, implied from the foregoing,
the employer shoulders such medical expenses, as necessity demands, until the
work-connected injury or illness of the employee ceases.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At all events, because of the supervening death of the claimant
on June 28, 1969 from "<span class="SpellE">parenchymatous</span>
nephritis" - a cause apparently distinct and different from the illness
subject of the claim herein - we deem it necessary to remand the case to the
Commission for determination of the expenses for medical attendance and
hospital services advanced by the claimant in connection with his illness of
pulmonary tuberculosis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We glean from
the record that, during the period from May 22, 1964 to August 27, 1964, the
petitioner's company physician extended medical treatment to the claimant
relative to his pulmo­nary tuberculosis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The record also shows that the petitioner's company physician ordered
the confinement of the claimant for treatment in his medical clinic from
September 8, 1964 to the <span style="">30th of the
same month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the latter date, or
from October 1, 1964, to be exact, the record fails to evince whether or not
the petitioner still furnished the claimant with medical services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Presumably, from October 1, 1964, the
petitioner no longer extended medical services to the claimant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, we find it reasonable and equitable
that the Commission determine the medical expenses advanced by the claimant
from October 1, 1964 - in the absence of any showing that from said date the
petitioner continued to extend medical attendance to the claimant - until the
final arrest of the said claimant's pulmonary tuberculosis, or until June 28,
1969, in the event of evidence adduced showing that the claimant never fully
recovered from his illness subject of compen­sation up to the time of his
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the obligation rests
on the petitioner to reimburse the heirs of the claimant the amount found by
the Commission as having been spent by the said claimant for his medical
services and supplies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, due to the modified amount of disability com­pensation
owing to the claimant, we also <span class="SpellE">recompute</span> the
attorney's fees and the administrative expenses the petitioner must pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 31 of the Workmen's Compensation Act allows, for services
of a claimant's lawyer in appealed cases, fees not in excess of ten percent of
the total sum of compensation due to the claimant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ten percent of P1,820 equals P182 - the
amount consti­tuting the attorney's fees of the claimant's counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 55 of the Workmen's Compensation Act requires the
employer in an adverse judgment to pay to the workmen's com­pensation fund the
sum of one peso for every one hundred pesos of the entire amount of
compensation granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same section
also requires the payment by an employer seeking review by the Commission of a
referee's decision, whenever the former affirms the decision of the latter, of
the sum of five pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Computed per the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> provisions, we find the petitioner liable for
the payment of the amount of P18 as administrative expenses and the amount of
P5 as cost of review by the Commission, or a total sum of P23, payable to the
workmen's compensation fund.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, modifying the decision of the respondent
Commission, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the petitioner company</p>
