				<BR><BR><div align=""><div class="Section1"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The facts of this case are not 
disputed: In connection with a final decision rendered by the Court of First 
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental in Civil Case No. 5790 
(Soledad L. <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> G. Diaz), sentencing therein defendant to pay the 
plaintiffs the sum of P97<span class="GramE">,532.93</span> with legal interest 
thereon from July 1, 1960 until fully paid, plus a sum equivalent to 25% of the 
total amount as attorney's fees, the court issued a writ of execution on August 
1, 1961. On August 7, 1961, the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental sent to the manager of <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span> Milling Company, wherein defendant Diaz was 
employed, a notice to garnish one-third of his monthly salary and of any other 
personal properties belonging to said defendant, to cover the total amount of 
P132<span class="GramE">,718.30</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Diaz filed with the court a 
motion to quash the writ of execution and to lift the notice of garnishment (of 
his salary), on the ground that the same are not enforceable gait his present 
family. It was claimed that since the judgment arose out of a contract entered 
into by him during his first marriage, said judgment cannot be enforces against 
his salaries which form part of the conjugal properties of the second marriage. 
Plaintiffs opposed s motion, for the reason that re-marriage is not a cause for 
extinction of obligations. As his aforesaid motion, after hearing, was denied by 
the court for lack of merit, the defendant instituted the present 
appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellant does not dispute the 
existence of the money judgment against him in the amount above-stated, which 
decision was rendered in 1947 and affirmed by the appellate court in 1950. It 
appears, however, that appellant, who became a widower in 1951, remarried in 
1960. The writ of execution and notice of garnishment in this case were issued 
and implemented in 1961. It is now contended that, as the conjugal partnership 
resulting of the second marriage is different from that of the first marriage, 
during which existence the obligation arose, such obligation, as far as the 
second conjugal partnership is concerned, is personal to the husband and cannot 
be charged against the properties of the second union. And, <span class="GramE">since</span> his salaries form part of the conjugal assets, the same 
cannot be garnished to satisfy his personal obligations. In support of this 
proposition, appellant cites Article 163 of the new Civil Code and the ruling of 
this Court that the right of the husband to one-half of the assets of the 
conjugal partnership does not vest until the dissolution of the marriage<span class="GramE">.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>1]</sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Article 163 of the new Civil Code 
relied upon by appellant provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Art. 163. The payment of debts 
contracted by the husband or the wife before the marriage shall not be charged 
to the conjugal partnership.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Neither shall the fines and 
pecuniary indemnities imposed upon them be charged to the 
partnership.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"However, the payment of debts 
contracted by the husband or the wife before the marriage, and that of fines and 
indemnities impost upon them, may be enforced against the partnership assets 
after the responsibilities enumerated in article 161 have been covered, if the 
spouse who is bound should have no exclusive property or if it should be 
insufficient; but at the time of the liquidation of the partnership such spouse 
shall be charged for what has been paid for the purposes 
above-mentioned."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As a general rule, therefore, 
debts contracted by the husband or wife before the marriage,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>[2]</sup></span> as well as fines and pecuniary indemnities 
imposed thereon, are not chargeable to the conjugal partnership. However, such 
obligations may be enforced against the conjugal assets if the responsibilities 
enumerated in Article 161<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>[3]</sup></span> of tile new 
Civil Code have already been covered, and that the obligor has no exclusive 
property or the same is insufficient. Considering that the enforceability of the 
personal obligation of the husband or wife, against the conjugal assets, forms 
the exception to the general rule, it is incumbent upon the one who invokes this 
provision or the creditor to show that the requisites for its applicability are 
obtaining.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the instant case, although it 
is not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> that there is due and owing the 
plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> a certain sum of money from the 
appellant debtor-a personal obligation-yet, it has not been established that the 
latter does not have properties of his own or that the same are not adequate to 
satisfy <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> claim. Furthermore, there is no 
showing that the responsibilities named in Article 161 of the new Civil Code 
have already been covered in order that the personal obligation of the husband 
may be made chargeable against the properties of the second 
marriage<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In view of the foregoing 
considerations, this case is hereby remanded to the court of origin for further 
proceedings, in accordance with the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> 
observation. No costs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
