				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A complaint for grave slander was filed on <st1:date year="1964" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1964</st1:date> by <span class="SpellE">Julita</span>
Santos against Nelly P. Cortez in the Court of First Instance of Manila. It was
alleged therein:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 14th day of November, 1963, <span style="">in </span>the City of Manila, Philippines,
the said accused did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>,
unlawfully, feloniously and pu­blicly utter and proffer slanderous words and
expressions which are grave and of insulting nature, considering that the
complainant is <span style="">a married </span>woman
with good reputation, such as '<span class="SpellE">Matanda</span> <span class="SpellE">kang</span> <span class="SpellE">walang</span> <span class="SpellE">hiya</span>,
<span class="SpellE">anak</span> mo <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">lamang</span> <span class="SpellE">nagpapaasawa</span> ka pa, <span class="SpellE">kaya</span> <span class="SpellE">ikaw</span> ay <span class="SpellE">hiniwalayan</span>
<span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">asawa</span> mo <span class="SpellE">dahil</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">gawain</span>
mo, <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">sabi</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">asawa</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span>
ay <span class="SpellE">nagpaasawa</span> ka <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">kanya</span>, <span class="SpellE">iyon</span> <span class="SpellE">pumunta</span>
ka <span class="SpellE">roon</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">Kalunya</span> mo’ and other words of similar import against <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Santos, thereby bringing the latter into public
disgrace, contempt and ridicule."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At the arraignment on <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="1">January
 30, 1964</st1:date>, the defendant, waiving the right to be assisted by
counsel, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The case was then set for hearing at
<st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30 A.M.</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="2">February <span style="">6, </span>1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On said date, however, on petition of Atty.
Angel <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">oficio</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>of the accused, to enable him to
prepare for the defense, the hearing was postponed to <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30 A.M.</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="3">March
 3, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">From this point, the record of the trial court shows that on the
date scheduled for hearing, the court rendered a decision which, after quoting
the charge, proceeded to state as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Upon being arraigned assisted by her counsel de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span>, Atty. Angel <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, the
accused voluntarily and spontaneously entered the <span style="">plea </span>of guilty and insisted thereto notwithstanding the
information furnished her by the Court regarding the consequences of her plea.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused NELLY P. CORTEZ guilty
beyond reasonable doubt of the commission of <span style="">the </span>crime of grave slander, defined and penalized in Art. 358 of
the Revised Penal Code, and appreciating in her favor the mitigating
circumstances of voluntary plea <span class="GramE">of</span> guilty, hereby
sentences her to suffer the penalty of four (4) months and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE">arresto</span> mayor, with the accessory penalties prescribed by
law, and to pay the costs of these proceedings.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span> (Record, p. 16)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The same day, the accused filed a notice of appeal to the Court
of Appeals, from said decision convicting her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeals, on <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="9">September
 3, 1964</st1:date>, certified said appeal to this Court as involving only ques­<span style="">tions of law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant in </span>her
brief now contends that she did not plead guilty to the complaint and that no <span style="">plea </span>of guilty had thereafter been
entered of record as required by the Rules.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant would rely on the fact that a page of the trial court's record
(page 15), which she alleges to have contained the stenographic recording of
the trial of March 3, 1964, is missing, adding that the loss appears to have
occurred while the case was in the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It is
</span>argued that said loss has rendered it impossible for appellant to prove
her claim that she never pleaded guilty to the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She stresses that the only plea of record is
that of "not guilty" entered on <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, with the conformity of the Solicitor General (See <span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span> brief, p.3), she now asks for a remand of the
case <span style="">for </span>trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fortunately, there are other data of record showing that
defendant really pleaded guilty in the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in appellant's motion of April 30,
1964, with her annexed affidavit (Annex "G") praying for admission of
attached documents as part of the record, and her supplemental motion of May <span style="">19, 1964, </span>asking that she be allowed
to present evidence, in addition to her plea of guilty, in order to obtain a
lesser penalty, both <u><span style="">filed in the
Court of Appeals</span></u><span style="">, </span>and
appearing in the <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> of this case, defendant <u><span style="">admits that she pleaded guilty but argues
that<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the court should have allowed her
to present evidence in<span style="">&nbsp; </span>spite of her plea
of guilty</span></u><span style="">, </span>to determine
the graveness or lightness of the offense charged as well as the corresponding
penalty to be imposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, she stated
in the affidavit:</p>

<p class="NUM">"2. That I have interposed said appeal of the lower Court's
judgment of conviction <u>not </u><u><span style="">for
the purpose of seeking its reversal</span></u><span style=""> but </span><span style="">only</span> for the
purpose of <u><span style="">seeking a modification of
the penalty</span></u><span style=""> </span>imposed
which I believe is rather harsh and severe or excessive;</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>

<blockquote>"With respect to the lawyer offered to me by the Honorable
Judge, I declined to avail of his services, <u><span style="">besides I was then already dead-set to lead guilty</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In
fact, my only conversation with the court-appointed lawyer was when I asked him
what the penalty would be in the event I enter a plea of guilty and he assured
me that <span style="">I will </span>only be made to
pay a fine not exceeding P20.00 or P30.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">Thus, </span>with this added
inducement coming from no less than a lawyer, <u><span style="">I did not even hesitate in expressing to the Honorable Judge my
willingness to plead </span></u><u><span style="">guilty</span></u><span style="">."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear, therefore, that defendant did not question the fact
that she pleaded guilty, but even admitted it, <u><span style="">until page 15 of the record was missing</span></u><span style="">; </span>thereafter, she started to deny said
plea of guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the foregoing circumstances and the presumption that
official duty has been regularly performed (Sec. <span style="">5[m], </span>Rule <span style="">131, </span>Rules
of Court), this Court can reach no other conclusion but that the statement in
the appealed decision, that the accused pleaded guilty upon arraignment, truly
reflects what transpired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And even
assuming that defendant's plea of guilty, <span class="SpellE">altho</span> made,
was not entered in the <span class="GramE">record,</span> the failure to so enter
the same does not affect the validity of the proceeding held. (Sec. 1, Rule
118, Rules of Court.)</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the correctness of the penalty, the slander, as quoted
in the complaint, is patently of a serious and insulting nature. The penalty
for slander, if of a serious and insulting nature, is <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">arresto</span></u></span><span style=""> <u>mayor</u> </span>in its maximum period to
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">prision</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>
</span>in its minimum period (Art. <span style="">358,
</span>Revised Penal Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court <u>a</u>
<u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style="">, </span>therefore, imposed the right
penalty. <span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed judgment is hereby affirmed, with
costs against appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let a copy of
this decision be transmitted to the Honorable, Presiding Justice of the Court
of Appeals, for any investigation he may wish to order regarding the missing
page of the trial court's record.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
