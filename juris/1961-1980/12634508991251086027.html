				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In a protest filed with the Bureau of Mines on <st1:date year="1959" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1959</st1:date>, the Manila Mining
Corporation charged that the mining claims of Alfredo B. <span class="SpellE">Grafil</span>
were made to overlap 26 of its 147 claims in barrio Del <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>
in <span class="SpellE">Cabadbaran</span>, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, in
order to create a conflict, contrary to section <span style="">57 </span>of the Mining Act, Com. Act 137.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Manila Mining asked that <span class="SpellE">Grafil</span>
and his men be restrained from invading its property.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Grafil</span> denied the charge and contended
that if there was an overlapping of claims the situation was brought about by
Manila Mining which had moved its claims from their ori­ginal location to where
<span style="">his </span>claims
were.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The LRM Mining Company later
intervened to assert common interest in the claims in dispute.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Bureau of <span style="">Mines </span>found no overlapping and upheld <span class="SpellE">Grafil</span>
and LRM Mining's right to <span style="">preference </span>in
the lease of the area covered by <span style="">the </span>claims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal, however, the Secretary <span style="">of </span>Agriculture and Natural Resources
reversed <span style="">the
decision of the Bureau after finding that 72 of <span class="SpellE">Grafil's</span>
claims did in fact overlap those of Manila Mining.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was held that while <span class="SpellE">Grafil</span>
had earlier located his claims, he had not made a valid location for the reason
that the claims were at the time held by another party, and that on the other
hand the location of the same mining claims by Manila Mining, while subsequent
to that of <span class="SpellE">Grafil</span>, was made after the right of the
former owner had expired.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Failing to secure a reconsideration of the decision of the
Secretary, <span class="SpellE">Grafil</span> and LRM Mining filed in the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> a petition for review,
naming the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, the Direc­tor of
Mines and Manila Mining as respondents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But on mo­tion of Manila Mining the case was dismissed by the court on
the ground that it had no jurisdiction to review the de­cision of the Secretary
of Agriculture.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A copy of the order of dismissal dated May 8, 1965, was received
by Attorney Jose G. <span class="SpellE">Montilla</span>, counsel for <span class="SpellE">Grafil</span> and LRM Mining, on May 28.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On June 9 Atty. <span class="SpellE">Montilla</span>
filed a motion for reconsideration which the court denied in its order of July
10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A copy of this order was sent by
regis­tered mail to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Montilla</span> at his given
address at 204 Cinerama Building, <span class="SpellE">Claro</span> M. Recto
Avenue, Manila, but des­pite three notices given him by the Manila Post Office
on<span style=""> July 27,
August </span><span style="">9
</span><span style="">and
August 17, counsel failed to claim the mail with the result that it was
returned to the court on September 10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the meantime, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Montilla</span> notified the <span class="SpellE">A<span style="">g</span>usan</span> court
that he had moved office to 304 AIU Building, Juan Luna, Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notice was dated August 30, </span><span style="">and was </span><span style="">received by the
court on September 2.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It was only on February 25, <span style="">1966
</span>that the mail contain­ing a copy of the order of July 10, 1965 was
finally claimed by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Montilla</span> who personally went
to <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <span style="">February
28 he appealed the orders of May 8 and July 10, 1965.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Manila Mining asked for the dismissal of the appeal on the ground
that the appeal was late and that the orders sought to be appealed had become
final, but the court denied the mo­tion and instead directed the clerk to
forward the records to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Manila Mining now reiterates its motion to dismiss the <span style="">appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The motion is well taken.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The thirty-day period<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
for appealing from the order of May 8, <span style="">1965
</span>began to run on May 29, a day after <span class="SpellE">Grafil</span> and
LRM Mining received through counsel a copy of the order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The filing of a <span style="">motion </span><span style="">for </span>reconsideration on June <span style="">9 </span>suspended the running of the pe­riod until August 2 (i.e.,
five days after the first notice sent by the post office on July 27) when,
pursuant to sec­tion <span style="">8 </span>of Rule
13,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Grafil</span> and LRM Mining must be deemed to have been
served a copy of the July 10, 1965 order denying their motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the parties had
only eighteen more days left, the period of appeal expired on August 20.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">result
</span>is that on February 28, 1966, when <span class="SpellE">Grafil</span> and
LRM Mining tried to perfect their appeal, the or­der <span style="">from which they were appealing had already
become final.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The claim that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Montilla</span> did not
receive any of the notices sent to him on July 27, August <span style="">9 </span>and August 17, 1965 <span style="">does not </span><span style="">inspire belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We </span><span style="">cannot </span><span style="">see how he could have missed </span><span style="">any of the three notices which, according to </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">Chief of the Registry Division of the </span><span style="">Manila Post Office, had been sent to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Between the denial of a party and the
assertion of </span><span style="">an artificial </span><span style="">whose duty
it </span><span style="">is to send no­tices, the
choice should </span><span style="">n</span><span style="">ot be difficult to make.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court said in disposing of a similar
contention:</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The allegation <span style="">that </span>petitioners'
former coun­sel never recei<span style="">v</span>ed
the postal notices cannot prevail over the positive statement of the su<span style="">perintendent of </span>the Manila Post Office
to the <span style="">effect that three notices were sent
to him, and such statement is </span>fortified by the legal presump<span style="">tion</span> that official duty <span style="">was </span>regularly performed."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">claim </span>should
be rejected for being unworthy of belief, let alone for being contrary to the
statement of pos<span style="">tal officials who have
in </span><span style="">their favor the presumption
that </span><span style="">they have performed their
duties regularly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the rule in se</span><span style="">ction </span><span style="">8 </span><span style="">of Rule 13 </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">a rule of convenience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing</span><span style=""> much</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">would be left of this
rule if, even in the face of </span><span style="">of­ficial </span><span style="">certification to the contrary, parties were permitted </span><span style="">to deny the </span><span style="">central idea around </span><span style="">which
</span><span style="">it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">built, namely, receipt of the postmaster's notice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor may the transfer of counsel's office be used as excuse for
failing to claim the <span style="">mail </span><span style="">considering that the </span>transfer,
by <span style="">counsel's own </span>admission, did <span style="">not take place </span><span style="">until the last week
of August, </span>1965 whereas the third and <span style="">notice was sent to him on August </span><span style="">17.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the instant appeal is dismissed, without <span style="">pronouncement as to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Section 61 of the Mining Act, as amended by section <span style="">3 </span>of Republic Act No. 746, <span style="">7
</span>Laws &amp; Res. 151 (1952), provides:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Conflicts
and disputes arising out of mining lo­cations shall be submitted to the
Director of Mines for decisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>,
That the decision or order of the Director of Mines<span style=""> </span>may be appealed to the Sec­retary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources within thirty days from the date of its receipt in case any one of
the parties should disagree from the decision or order of the Director of Mines
or of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, the matter may be
taken to the court of competent juris­diction within thirty days from the
receipt of such decision or order; otherwise the same decision or order shall
be final and binding upon the parties concerned."</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES">The trial court ruled that it had no jurisdiction of the ap­peal
because the phrase "court of competent jurisdiction" meant either the
Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court.</p>
