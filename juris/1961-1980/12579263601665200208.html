				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Appeal by certiorari from a decision of the Court of Appeals. <br></p><p>Petitioner Amador D. Santos is the owner of several taxicabs being
operated in the City of Manila and suburbs under the name and style of
"Santos Taxi" while Dolores Banzon Tolentino, hereafter referred to as
Mrs. Tolentino, was at the intersection of Espafia and Dos Castillas
Streets, City of Manila, on June 14, 1951, Vicente Duldulao y Dancel,
who was driving a "Santos Taxi", bearing Plate.No. 1027 for 1951,
backed it without blowing his horns and in such a negligent manner that
its rear part bumped Mrs. Tolentino, for which reason she fell down and
a rear wheel of the car ran over her, thereby inflicting upon her
serious physical injuries. The corresponding information for serious
physical injuries through reckless negligence was filed against
Duldulao with the Municipal Court of Manila (Criminal Case No. T-40174
thereof), which convicted and sentenced him, accordingly, on November
7, 1951. He appealed to the Court of First Instance of Manila (Criminal
Case No. 17273), where he eventually pleaded guilty to the charge and
was, on May 26, 1952, sentenced to four (4) months and one (1) day of
<span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> and to pay the costs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in accordance with a reservation made by Mrs. Tolentino
in said criminal case, she and her husband, Eulogio C. Tolentino, had,
on August 15, 1951, instituted the present civil action against Amador
D. Santos and Vicente Duldulao y Dancel, in the Court of First Instance
of Manila (Civil Case No. 14461). In the complaint therein, the
Tolentinos prayed that Santos and Duldulao be sentenced to pay, jointly
and severally, the sum of P10,000 by way of damages and attorney's
fees, aside from the costs. In their answer to the complaint, Santos
and Duldulao alleged that the accident was due exclusively to the
negligence of Mrs. Tolentino. In due course, said court rendered a
decision on December 21, 1955, sentencing Santos and Duldulao to pay
jointly and severally to Mrs. Tolentino the sums of P2,549.40, as
actual damages, and P5,000, as moral damages, in addition to the costs.
This decision was, on appeal to the Court of Appeals, taken by Santos
and Duldulao, affirmed on July 30, I960, with the modification that
Santos shall pay the aforementioned sums only in the event of inability
of Duldulao to satisfy said judgment, the civil liability of the
employer under Article 103 of the Revised Penal Code being merely
subsidiary to that of the employee who committed the offense giving
rise to said liability.</p>
<p>The case is now before the Supreme Court on Appeal by certiorari
taken by Amador D. Santos, who maintains that the decision of the Court
of Appeals should be modified by eliminating therefrom his subsidiary
liability for the payment of moral damages, which, he claims, is not
authorized by law. This pretense, however, has already been rejected in
Miguel San Jose, et al. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Romualdo del Mundo, 91 Phil., 170 (decided
on April 28, 1952), in which it was held:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Es cierto que en Marcelo <span style="font-style: italic;">contra </span>Velasco (11 Jur.
Fil., 299), Algarra contra Sandejas (27 Jur. Fil., 320), y Gutierrez
<span style="font-style: italic;">contra</span> Gutierrez (56 Jur. Fil., 193), este Tribunal no adjudicd
indemnizacion por dolor y sufrimiento, sino solamente por danos
reales. Pero eh Lilius <span style="font-style: italic;">contra</span> Manila Railroad Co. (59 Jur Fil., 800)
y en Castro contra Aero Taxicab Co. (46 Off. Gaz., 2023), este Tribunal
concedio indemnizacion por danos patrimoniales y morales. El Tribunal "
Supremo de Espafta, revocando su sentencia de 11 de Marzo de 1899,
admite la resarcibilidad de los danos morales. (2 Castan, De recho
Civil Espanol, Comun y Foral, 1943 Ed. 466; Sentencia de 14 de Febrero
de 1941; 2 Rodriguez Navarro, Doctrina Penal del Tribunal Supremo,
2223; Sentencia de 14 de Noviembre de 1934, 131 Jur. Crjm., 584; 2
Rodriguez Navarro, Doctrina Penal del Tribunal Supremo, 2222.)"</p>

<p>The cases of Cachero <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Manila Yellow Taxi Co.,101 Phil., 523;
Necesito <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Paras, 104 Phil., 75, Fores <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Miranda, 105 Phil., 266
and Verzosa <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Baytan, 107 Phil., 1010, relied upon by the petitioner
are not in point for said cases refer to the liability of a carrier for
breach of contract with an injured passenger, whereas, the action
against petitioner herein is based upon his liability arising from a
crime, which is governed by Article 103 of the Revised Penal Code.
Petitioner maintains that there is no reason why the carrier, who
cannot be held to answer for moral damages for breach of the contract
of carriage, should be liable for such damages in actions<em> ex delicto</em>, as in the case at bar. Suffice it to recall, in this connection, what we said in Fores <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Miranda (<em>supra</em>) with reference to the difference between actions <em>ex contractu </em>and actions <em>quasi ex delicto</em>, which is equally applicable to actions e<span style="font-style: italic;">x delicto:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">"Upon the other hand, the advantageous position of a party suing
a carrier for a breach of the contract of transportation explains, to
some extent, the limitations imposed by the new Code on the amount of
the recovery. The action for breach of contract imposes on the
defendant carrier a presumption of liability upon mere proof of injury
to the passenger; the latter is relieved from the duty to establish the
fault of the carrier, or of his employees, and the burden is placed on
the carrier to prove that it was due to an unforseen event or to <em>force majeure</em>
(Cangco <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Manila Railroad Co., 38 Phil. 768, 777). Moreover, the
carrier, unlike in suits for quasi delict, may not escape liability by
proving that it has exercised due diligence in the selection and
supervision of its employees (Art. 17b9, new Civil Code; Cangco <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>
Manila Railroad Co., <em>supra</em>; Prado<span style="font-style: italic;"> vs.</span> Manila Electric Co., 51 Phil. 900).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The difference in conditions, defenses and proof, as well as the codal concept of <em>quasi delict</em> as essentially <em>extra-contractual</em> negligence, compel us to differentiate between actions <em>ex contractu</em>, and actions <em>quasi ex delicto</em> and prevent us from viewing the action for a breach of contract as simultaneously embodying an action on tort."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wherefore, the decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby affirmed,
with costs against petitioner-appellant Amador D. Santos. Is is so
ordered.</p>
