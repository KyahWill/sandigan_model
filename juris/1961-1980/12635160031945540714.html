<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts are not complicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In June, 1947 the Central organized its
Security Guards Department, with Mariano H. <span class="SpellE">Cabarrubia</span>
as officer-in-charge, for the primary purpose of maintaining peace and order in
its premises at <span class="SpellE">Nasugbu</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>
and providing protection for its proper­ties, officials and employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More than eight years later, or on <st1:date year="1955" day="13" month="9">September <span style="">13,
 1955</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>a
majority of the security guards employed in the Central organized the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
with the election of its officers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> was not registered with the
Department of Labor until <st1:date year="1955" day="4" month="11">November <span style="">4, </span>1955</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1955" day="21" month="9">September <span style="">21, </span>1955</st1:date> <span class="SpellE">Cabarrubia</span> called a meeting of the security guards in order
to verify reports that some of the latter were contemplating to file money
claims against the Central for overtime pay, night compensation and Sunday and
holiday premiums, and also to discover the identities of the prospective
claimants.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day (<st1:date year="1955" day="21" month="9">September
 <span style="">21, </span>1955</st1:date>), case <span style="">1017-V, </span>enti­tled "Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Alarcos</span>, et al. vs. Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span>
Don Pe­dro," was filed with the CIR.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was an action for collection of overtime pay, night compensation
and separation pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <st1:place>Union</st1:place> alleged that subsequent to the
filing of the claims, the Central started to discriminate against the claim­ant
security guards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the
Central replied that because some security guards steadfastly refused to join
in the filing of the claims, the claimant guards continuously menaced,
intimidated and harassed the non-claimants, posing a serious problem to the
management.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1955" day="27" month="10">October <span style="">27, </span>1955</st1:date> the claimants
filed a joint request for "indefinite leave of absence without pay effective

 <span style="">19, </span>1955</st1:date> the
claimants, through Patricio <span class="SpellE">Erni</span>, president of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>,
advised the Central of their unanimous intention to return to work
"effective <st1:date year="1956" day="1" month="1">January 1, <span style="">1956</span></st1:date><span style="">." </span>On the fol­lowing day, <st1:date year="1955" day="20" month="12">December <span style="">20,
 </span>1955</st1:date>, the Central, through its gen<span style="">eral superintendent Juan <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span>, informed the

 14, </span><span style="">1956</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span><span style="">the
Central notified the claimants that their serv­ices were terminated effective
upon receipt of notifica­tion, and offered them one month's separation pay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Prosecutor <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> H. Adriano of the CIR filed a
complaint with the latter court </span><span style="">in
</span><span style="">behalf of twenty-eight Union
members, charging the Central with discriminatory dismissal of said members, in
viola­tion of section 4(a), sub-paragraphs 1, 4, and 5 of the Industrial Peace
Act </span><span style="">(RA </span><span style="">875).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Sub-paragraph <span style="">5 </span>of section 4(a), Republic Act <span style="">875, </span>refers only to the dismissal of an em­ployee on account of
unfair labor practice charges filed by him or testimony given there­<span style="">in, </span>but does not cover his dismissal
in con­sequence of his having filed a mere claim for overtime pay, night
compensation and separa­tion pay, which has <span style="">nothing to do with </span>or does not arise from <span style="">his union </span>membership or activities;</blockquote>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The three respondent judges of the CIR abused
their discretion in <span style="">finding </span>that
the filing of CIR case <span style="">1017-V </span>by
the claimant guards was related to their right of self-organization,
considering the absence of substantial evi­dence in support of such finding;</blockquote>

is clear proof in the record that the claimant guards were dismissed, not only
to avoid bloodshed between their group and the non-claimant guards, but also
because the management had lost confidence in them, and not because they had
filed CIR case <span style="">1017-V </span><span style="">or because they had organized a joined a

their dismissal was un­justified, the respondent judges of the CIR se­riously
erred in failing to order the deduction from the back wages awarded the
earnings pend­ing litigation from their other employments or occupations, and
also in failing to limit the back wages awarded to the period from the date of
dismissal to the submission of the case for decision by the trial court,
considering that although the case was submitted for adjudica­tion as early as
June </span><span style="">18, 1960, </span><span style="">the trial court did not render its decision
until almost two and a half years later.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In G.R. No.</span> <span style="">L</span><span style="">-</span><span style="">21619, </span>the petitioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
alleges that the res­pondent CIR erred and committed grave abuse of discretion
in denying the reinstatement of security guards <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dellupac</span> and Juan Lama who are similarly situated as
the twen­ty-four security guards who were ordered reinstated with back
wages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
also contends that the CIR erred and committed grave abuse of discretion in
refusing to clarify the phrase "without loss of seniority rights", as
used by the trial court in its decision of <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="12">December <span style="">13, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>for the better understanding and
guidance of the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In G.R. No.</span> <span style="">L-25767, </span>the petitioner Union claims that the order of the trial
court of July <span style="">12, 1965 </span>and the
resolution of the CIR <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> of August <span style="">5, 1965 </span>which deferred action on the motion <span style="">for </span>execution with respect to the
reinstatement of the twenty-four security guards pursuant to the decision of
the trial court of December <span style="">13, </span><span style="">1962, </span>"pending resolution of the
appeal," are contrary to law, in view of the mandatory and express
provision of section <span style="">6 </span>of the
Industrial Peace Act) to the effect that an "appeal shall not stay the
order of the Court and the person or persons named in the Court order shall
meanwhile obey said order." The Central asks for the dismissal of the
petition, contending that the cited portion of section <span style="">6 </span>is merely permissive, and that considering the intrinsic
nature of the work of a security guard, to insist on reinstatement of the
dismissed security guards pending final resolution of the case is tantamount to
compelling the Central to repose trust and confidence in the very employees it
dismissed for lack of confidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pending resolution by this Court of the aforementioned three
petitions, the respective petitioners on <st1:date year="1968" day="31" month="1">January <span style="">31, </span><span style="">1968</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>simultaneously filed separate motions
