ATTY. AGUSTIN ARCANGEL, RESPONDENT.

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.P., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Complainants Olegaria
Blanza and Maria Pasion ask this Court to take disciplinary action against
respondent Atty. Agustin Arcangel for professional non-feasance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They complain that way back in April, 1955,
respondent </span><u><span style="">volunteered</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">to
help them in t</span><span style="">h</span><span style="">eir respective pension claims in connection
with the deaths of their husbands, both P.C. soldiers, and for this purpose,
they handed over to him the pertinent documents and also affixed their
signatures on blank papers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
subsequently, they noticed that since then, respondent had lost interest in the
prog</span><span style="">r</span><span style="">ess of their claims and when they finally
asked for the return of their papers six years later, respon</span><span style="">dent refused </span>to surrender them.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent answered these
accusations before Fiscal Raña to whom this case was referred by the Solicitor Ge­neral
for investigation, report and recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He admitted having received the documents from complainants but
explained that it was for photostating purposes only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>His failure to immediately return
them, he said, was due to complainants' refusal to hand him the money to pay
for the photostating costs which prevented him from withdrawing said documents
from the photostat service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, he
had already advanced <span style="">the </span>expenses
himself and turned over, on December 13, 1961, the documents, their respective
photostats and the photostat service receipt to the fiscal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finding respondent's
explanation satisfactory and considering that he charged complainants nothing
for his services, Fiscal Raña recommended the former's exonera­tion, or at
most, that he be reprimanded only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Solicitor General, however, feels that respondent deserves at least a severe
reprimand considering (1) his failure to attend to the complainants' pension
claims for </span><span style="">six </span><span style="">years; </span><span style="">2) his failure to
immediately return the docu­ments despite repeated demands upon him, and (3)
his fail­ure to return to complainant Pasion, allegedly, all of her documents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing of the case before this Court on Octo­ber 21,
1963, only respondent, thru counsel, appeared.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In lieu of oral arguments therefore, respondent submitted his
memorandum, annexing therewith an <span style="">affidavit exe</span>cuted by Olegaria Blanza <span style="">asking </span>for
the dismissal of the administrative case.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent first submits that he was not obliged to follow up
complainants' pension <span style="">cla</span>ims <span style="">since </span>there <span style="">was </span><span style="">no agreement for his
compensation as their counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Res­pondent
however overlooks the fact that he <u>volunteered</u> his professional services
and thus, was not legally enti­tled to recover fees.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> But having established the attor­ney-client
relationship voluntarily, he was bound to at­tend to complainants' claims with
all due diligence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, We find the evidence adduced insuffi­cient to
warrant the taking of disciplinary action against respondent attorney.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no clear preponderance of evidence
substantiating the accusations against him.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent's explanation for the delay in filing the claims and
in returning the documents has not been contro­verted by <span style="">complainants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span>the contrary, they admitted<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
that respondent asked them to shoulder the photostating expenses but they did
not give him any money therefore.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the documents and their photostats were actual­ly returned by
respondent during the fiscal's investiga­tion with him paying for the
photostating costs himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the
condition of the photostats themselves - they ap­pear to have been in existence
for quite some time<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> -
supports respondent's allegation that they remained in possession of the
photostat service for the failure of the owners (respondent and/or complainants)
to withdraw the same upon payment of the corresponding costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, complainants themselves are partly to
blame for the delay in filing their respective claims.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As for the alleged
failure of respondent to return all her documents to complainant Pasion, the
former de­nies this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fiscal Raña made no
findings on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
affidavit of Mrs. Blanza pardoning respondent cannot prejudice complainant
Pasion because <u>res</u> <u>inter</u> <u>alios</u> <u>acta</u> <u><span style="">alteri</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>nocere</u> <u>non</u> <u>debet</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still, there is equiponderance <span style="">of evidence must
necessarily redound to respondent's benefit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Complainant Pasion had another opportu</span><span style="">nity to </span>substantiate her charges in the hearing set for October
21, 1963 but she<span style=""> </span>let it go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither she nor her counsel of record
appeared.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But while We are
constrained to dismiss the charges against respondent, for being legally
insufficient, yet, We cannot but counsel against his actuations as a member of
the bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A lawyer has a more dynamic and
positive role in the community than merely complying with the minimal technicalities
of the statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a man of law, he is
ne­cessarily a leader of the community, looked up to as </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">model
citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His conduct must, perforce, be
par excellence, especially so when, as in this case, he <u>volunteers</u> his
professional services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent here
has not lived up to that ideal standard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">unnecessary to </span><span style="">have complainants
wait, </span><span style="">and hope, for six long
years on their pension claims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
their refusal to co-operate, respondent should have forthwith terminated their
professional relationship instead of keeping them hanging </span><span style="">indefinitely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>And <span style="">altho We voted that he not be reprimanded, in a legal sense, let this
be a reminder to Atty. Arcangel of what </span>the high standards of his chosen
profession require of him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">Accordingly</span></b><span style="">, the case against respondent is dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
