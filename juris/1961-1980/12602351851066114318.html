<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On 10 December 1958, the Associated Waterfront Supervisors Union (PTWO) filed 
with the Court of Industrial Relations a petition against the Manila Port 
Service and the Manila Railroad Company for the recovery of overtime 
compensation for work rendered by its members during Saturdays from 22 June 1957 
to 30 September 1957, pursuant to the provisions of Republic Act No. 1880 in 
conjunction with Commonwealth Act No. 444. The petition stated among other 
things that the continued refusal of petitioners (respondents therein) to 
satisfy said union's claim has resulted in a labor dispute, which was likely to 
cause a strike.
<p>Petitioners' answer denied the material averments of the petition and set up 
special affirmative defenses.</p>
<p>On 31 March 1960, the Industrial Court, after due hearing, promulgated its 
order holding as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Wherefore, respondents [herein petitioners] shall comply with the provisions 
of Commonwealth Act No. 444 and Republic Act No. 1880 and pay petitioners, 
listed in Annex "A", pp. 4 and 5 of the Expediente, the overtime compensation of 
work rendered by them from July 1 to September 30, 1957."</p></blockquote>
<p>Against the foregoing order and the resolution <em>en banc</em>, denying 
petitioners, motion for reconsideration, this petition for review by writ of 
certiorari was filed.</p>
<p>Here, as in the court below, petitioners urge that the Court of Industrial 
Relations lacks jurisdiction to entertain the case, and that no overtime 
compensation is due, considering that Republic Act No. 1880 does not provide for 
any, and because, under the collective bargaining contract of 19 July 1957, the 
parties agreed that the regular working hours shall be from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 
noon and from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. from Mondays to Fridays, and from 8:00 a.m. 
to 1:00 p.m. on Saturdays, which, it is claimed, is not violative of said 
Republic Act No. 1880.</p>
<p>We find no merit in appellant's contentions as to the issue of jurisdiction. 
It is now settled that whenever a claim for overtime compensation is made, and 
there exists an employer and employee relationship between the claimant and the 
respondent (as in this case), or although such relation no longer exists, yet 
the petition includes a prayer for reinstatement, the case comes within the 
exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> This Court has also maintained the rule that 
the existence of a labor dispute which is likely to cause a strike places the 
labor question within the proper cognizance of the Industrial Court.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span></p>
<p>As to the merits of the controversy, the basic statute is section 562 of the 
Administrative Code, as amended by Republic Act 1880, which was made applicable 
"to all laborers employed in government-owned and controlled corporations." (R. 
A. 1880. sec. 3). The material part of said provision is a follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 562. <em>Legal hours of labor</em>—<em>minimum requirement</em>.—The 
Chiefs of Bureau and Office in every branch of the Government service shall 
require of all employees of whatever grade or class not less than the legal 
number of hours of labor.</p>
<p>"Such hours, except for schools, courts, hospitals and health clinics, or 
where the exigencies of service so require, shall be as prescribed in the Civil 
Service Rules, and as otherwise from time to time disposed in temporary 
executive orders in the discretion of the President of the Philippines, but 
shall be eight (8) hours a day, for five (5) days a week, or a total of forty 
(40) hours a week, exclusive of time for lunch. * * *"</p></blockquote>
<p>The Presidential Executive Order No. 251, Series 1957, implementing Republic 
Act 1880, provided as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The office hours of all bureaus and offices of the government including 
government owned and controlled corporations, but except schools, courts, 
hospitals, and health clinics, shall be from eight o'clock in the morning to 
twelve o'clock noon, and from one o'clock to five o'clock in the afternoon, 
Monday to Friday: Provided, That when the interests of the public service so 
require, the head of any department, bureau or office may extend the daily hours 
of labor for any or all of them to do overtime work not only on work days but 
also on holidays."</p></blockquote>
<p>Subsequently to the said law and executive order, a collective bargaining 
contract was, on July 17, 1957, entered into between appellants and the appellee 
Union (PTWO) whereby the hours of labor were fixed as—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon and 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. from Monday to 
Friday; and from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on Saturdays."</p></blockquote>
<p>The contract also provided that for work beyond these hours, workers would be 
paid overtime equivalent to 150 per cent of regular wages.</p>
<p>On October 30, 1957, the Board of Directors of the Manila Railroad Company 
adopted a resolution—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That effective October 1, 1957, members of the Associated Waterfront 
Supervisors' Union with fixed allowances who may be required to work on 
<em>Saturday</em> shall be given additional overtime pay for work done on that 
particular day."</p></blockquote>
<p>The appellee Union contends that the benefits of this Resolution should be 
made to retroact to July 1, 1957, when Republic Act 1880 was adopted, on the 
ground that by said Act, and Executive Order No. 251 heretofore quoted, 
Saturdays were made non-working days.</p>
<p>We see no merit in this contention. Under the legal provisions mentioned, 
office hours are eight (8) hours a day for 5 days from Monday to Friday or a 
total of 40 hours a week; but neither the law nor the executive order declares 
Saturday a non-working day. This result is produced only if during the five 
preceding days (Monday to Friday), the laborers or employees have worked the 
minimum of 40 hours prescribed. Since under their contract the members of the 
appellee union were called upon to work only seven (7) hours a day, it is clear 
that from Monday to Friday, they worked only thirty-five (35) hours, five hours 
<em>less than the minimum</em> prescribed by law. Logically, therefore, they 
could be lawfully required to work another five (5) hours on Saturday. 
Otherwise, they would not be working (40) hours per week.</p>
<p>It is well to note that the law fixes work of eight hours a day for five 
days, or forty hours per week, as a <em>minimum</em> requirement. The contract, 
moreover, clearly recognizes the laborer's understanding that they should work 
said number of hours, evidently because of exigencies of the service.</p>
<p>Appellees argue that in point of fact its members did work eight hours a day 
from Mondays to Fridays, as shown by the payroll. What they forget is that the 
last (eight) hour of each day was already paid for as <em>overtime</em>, and can 
not be counted toward the forty-hour weekly minimum. To require appellants to 
pay for the five hours work on Saturdays on <em>overtime</em> basis as well, is 
to declare that the appellee Union's members are entitled to work only 
thirty-five hours a week, which plainly can not be legally equivalent to a 
minimum of 40 hours a week. The Resolution of the Railroad Company dated October 
30, 1957 granting overtime pay for work on Saturdays was actually a concession 
beyond the terms of the law that can not be extended beyond its words and 
intent, nor given retroactive effect without the Company's consent.</p>
<p>In justice to the Industrial Court, it must be stated that its order, now 
under appeal, was predicated only on the fact that since July 1, 1957, "while 
security guards were paid additional compensation for work done on Saturday . . 
. the members of the petitioner union were not", and the Court viewed the 
difference as discriminatory. No facts appear, however, showing the number of 
hours of work actually rendered by these guards from Mondays to Fridays, or that 
the work or kind of labor performed by them was substantially the same as that 
of the members of appellee Union; and without such showing of identical 
circumstances, the alleged discrimination is not substantiated. Besides, 
discrimination was not a part of the original charge, nor is it material where 
unfair labor practice is not at issue.</p>
<p>Premises considered, we are of the opinion that the appealed order of March 
31, 1960 is legally unjustified.</p>
<p>The same is, therefore, reversed, and the claim for differential overtime pay 
ordered dismissed. Costs against respondent Associated Waterfront Supervisors 
Union (PTWO).</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera,
