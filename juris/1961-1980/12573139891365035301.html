				<H3>GUILLERMO B. GUEVARRA, PETITIONER, VS. THE HON. PEDRO M. GIMENEZ, AS THE AUDITOR GENERAL OF THE PHILIPPINES AND ISMAEL MATHAY, AS THE AUDITOR OF THE CENTRAL BANK, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an original action for mandamus to compel respondents, Pedro M. 
Gimenez, as Auditor General of the Philippines, and Ismael Mathay, as Auditor of 
the Central Bank of the Philippines, hereafter referred to, respectively, as the 
Auditor General and the Bank Auditor, to approve and pass in audit two (2) bills 
of petitioner Guillermo B. Guevara for professional services rendered by him to 
said Bank.
<p>It is admitted that, on or about September 1, 1959, Miguel Cuaderno, the then 
Governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines—thereafter referred to as the 
Central Bank—acting for and in behalf thereof, asked petitioner herein, as 
member of the Philippine bar and practising lawyer, to cooperate with the legal 
counsel of the Central Bank in defending the same and its Monetary Board in 
Civil Case No. 41226 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, an action for 
certiorari, mandamus, quo warrant and damages in the amount of P574,000, fixed 
against them by one R. Marino Corpus. Accordingly, petitioner entered his 
appearance as counsel for the respondents in said case and argued therein, 
verbally and in writing, on September 1, 8, 12, 24 and 28, October 22 and 
November 9, 1959, January 7 and 14, and March 10 and 17, 1960, as well as 
submitted the following:</p>
<ol><li>Motion to Dismiss, consisting of 16 pages, filed September 5, 1959;<br>
</li><li>Motion to Dismiss, the Amended Complaint, consisting of 2 pages, filed 
September 12, 1959;<br>
</li><li>Respondent's Rejoinder, consisting of 11 pages, filed October 11, 1959;<br>
</li><li>Additional Legal Arguments in support of Motion to Dismiss, consisting of 5 
pages filed June 14, 1960. </li></ol>
<p>In pursuance of his authority, under Resolution No. 1283 of the Monetary 
Board, dated September 8, 1959, reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Governor presented to the Board, and the latter approved by unanimous 
vote, the designation of Judge Guillermo as counsel to collaborate with the 
Legal Counsel of the Central Bank in connection with the court action filed by 
Mr. R. Marino Corpus against the individual members of the Monetary Board and 
the Governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines. The Board also authorized 
the Governor to arrange with Judge Guevara the amount of fee which the latter 
will charge the Central Bank for handling the said cases."</p></blockquote>
<p>Governor Cuaderno urged petitioner herein to submit a proposal setting forth 
the terms and conditions under which his professional services were being 
rendered, and petitioner did so in a letter of September 11, 1959, in which he 
stated that his professional fees would be as follows: "retainer's fee of 
P10,000, plus a per diem of P300 for every hearing or trial. In case of appeal 
to the Supreme Court, * * * another fee of P5,000.00". On the same date Governor 
Cuaderno accepted the proposal, as regards the retainer's fee and the per diem, 
effective as of the date of entry (September 1, 1959) of petitioner's appearance 
in said case. On June 14, 1960, the same was dismissed by the Court of First 
Instance of Manila, on motion of the respondents herein, represented by 
petitioner herein.</p>
<p>Prior thereto, or on January 10, 1960, the latter had sent to the Central 
Bank his bill for the retainer's fee of P10,000. The Bank Auditor sought advise 
thereon from the Auditor General, who, in a communication to the former, dated 
June 10, 1960, stated that he would not object to said retainer's fee of 
P10,000, provided that its payment was made "not in lump sum as causes or 
circumstances may arise which may prevent Judge Guevara from proceeding or 
continuing as counsel of the Bank in the aforesaid case before it is finally 
terminated", but, in installments, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"P3,000.00 after filing the answer to the petition; </p>
<p>P3,000.00 after decision by the CFI; </p>
<p>P2,000.00 after filing briefs in case of appeal; and </p>
<p>P2,000.00 when the case is finally terminated."</p></blockquote>
<p>with the understanding that, "in case there is no appeal from the CFI 
decision, the balance will be paid in full", once, presumably, the decision has 
become final. As regards the P300 per diem, the Auditor General expressed, 
however, the belief that it is "excessive and may not be allowed in audit". 
Hence, the present action for mandamus, filed on July 6, 1960, to compel 
respondents to approve payment of petitioner's retainer fee of P10,000 and his 
per diem aggregating P3,300, for the eleven (11) hearings attended by him.</p>
<p>In their answer, respondents alleged that the sum of P6,000 has already been 
paid on account of said retainer fee and impugned the legality of petitioner's 
contract with the Central Bank, upon the ground that the latter has no authority 
to enter into said contract, and that its Monetary Board no power to confirm it, 
because both can be and were represented in said case No. 41226 by the legal 
staff of the Central Bank, aside from the fact that the Government has its 
corporate counsel, and because the authority to engage special counsel for the 
Government of the Republic of the Philippines is vested, pursuant to section 
1664 of the Revised Administrative Code, in the Solicitor General, with the 
approval of the Secretary of Justice. Respondents further alleged that 
petitioner should have appealed from the action of respondents herein, instead 
of seeking a writ mandamus.</p>
<p>At the outset, we note that two (2) of the defenses set up by respondents 
herein are inconsistent with each other. On the one hand, they assail the 
legality of the contract between petitioner herein and the Central Bank, 
whereas, on the other hand, they allege that the sum of P6,000 has already been 
paid on account of the retainer fee stipulated in said contract. That payment 
which could not have been made without the approval of respondents and/or their 
authorized representatives—and the reliance placed thereon in respondents' 
answer constitute a partial performance of the aforementioned contract and a 
clear admission of its legality. Indeed, such implied admission is merely a 
reiteration of that made in the communication of the Auditor General to the Bank 
Auditor, dated June 10, 1960, expressing no objection to said retainer fee, on 
condition only that its payment be made in installments, as above indicated, and 
questioning the P300.00 per diem upon the sole ground that it is 
<i>excessive</i>. In fact, as early as September 19, 1959, the then Secretary of 
Justice, Hon. Pedro Tuason, had rendered an opinion upholding the inherent power 
of the Central Bank to employ attorneys for any compensation the Monetary Board 
may deem reasonable. The pertinent part of said opinion follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is in reply to your letter of the 20th instant asking me whether Judge 
Guillermo B. Guevara, who has been appointed special prosecutor under Section 
1686 of the Revised Administrative Code 'to assist the City Fiscal of Manila in 
the investigation and prosecution of violations of the Central Bank Act and 
other related laws, including violations of circulars and regulations issued by 
the Monetary Board, Central Bank, and Department Heads relative to importations 
and exchange control', may be paid a monthly retainer by the Central Bank 
instead of per diems.</p>
<p>"The same Section 1686 regulates the compensation of special counsel 
appointed thereunder, limiting it to 'thirty pesos per day for the time 
employed'. But I am inclined to believe that this limitations applies to fees 
payable by the Department of Justice or other branches of the Government. 
Governed by a special charter and enjoying a distinct personality with a right 
to sue and be sued, the Central Bank may be regarded as a private party 
unaffected by the restrictions of said Section 1686 as to salary in the hiring 
of lawyers to protect the bank's interest and prosecute violations of the 
Central Bank Act and of the Bank's rules and regulations. The fact that such 
lawyers are appointed by the Secretary of Justice to better carry out the work 
for which they are retained does not alter the Central Bank's inherent power to 
employ attorneys for any compensation the Monetary Board deems 
reasonable".</p></blockquote>
<p>The cases of Angara vs. Gorospe, 101 Phil., 79; 53 Off. Gaz. [14] 4480, and 
Enriquez vs. Auditor General, 107, Phil., 932; 58 Off. Gaz. (29) 5089, cited by 
respondents are not in point. The first involved a city official, who by law was 
entitled to be represented by the city attorney, and the second referred to a 
municipal corporation, which was entitled to be represented by the provincial 
fiscal. The aforementioned city official and municipal corporation are subject 
to the provisions of our Revised Administrative Code, whereas the Central Bank 
is governed by a special charter.</p>
<p>Section 1664 of the Revised Administrative Code, upon which respondents rely, 
provide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Solicitor General shall, when in his opinion the public interest 
requires it, upon approval of the Department Head, employ and retain in the name 
of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines such attorneys as he may 
deem necessary to assist him in the discharge of his duties. Such attorneys 
shall be entitled to travel expenses, if incurred, and such compensation as 
shall be stipulated for."</p></blockquote>
<p>This section refers to attorneys retained <i>in the name of the Government of 
the Republic of the Philippines</i> and deemed necessary by the Solicitor 
General "to assist <i>him</i> in the discharge of his duties". Petitioner herein 
does not fall under this class, he having been retained in the name of the 
Central Bank, which has a personality distinct and separate from that of our 
Government. Moreover, he did not appear in case No. 41226 as representative of 
the Solicitor General. In fact, the latter did not participate or intervene in 
any manner whatsoever in said case. In short, petitioner's services were not 
engaged for the purpose of rendering any assistance to the Solicitor General. 
Said Section 1664 is, therefore, inapplicable to this case.</p>
<p>It is urged that the proper remedy for petitioner herein is to appeal from 
the action of respondents herein, not to seek a writ of mandamus against them. 
It is well-settled, however, that when a contract has been made by an agency of 
the Government, through its proper officer, acting within the scope of his 
authority, and there is an appropriation made by law to cover the disbursements 
required by said contract, apart from the fact that delivery of the goods or 
rendition of the services stipulated has been duly attested to, the Auditor 
General or his representative has the duty, enforceable by mandamus, to approve 
and pass in audit the voucher for said disbursements, if issued by the proper 
officer of said agency of the Government. (Radiowealth vs. Agregado, 86 Phil, 
429; Tan C. Tee &amp; Co. vs. Wright, 53 Phil, 194; Inchausti &amp; Co. vs. 
Wright, 47 Phil. 866.)</p>
<p>Under our Constitution, the authority of the Auditor General, in connection 
with expenditures of the Government is limited to the auditing of expenditures 
of funds or property pertaining to, or held in trust by, the Government or the 
provinces or municipalities thereof (Article XI, section 2, of the 
Constitution). Such function is limited to a determination of whether there is a 
law appropriating funds for a given purpose; Whether a contract, made by the 
proper officer, has been entered into in conformity with said appropriation law; 
whether the goods or services covered by said contract have been delivered or 
rendered in pursuance of the provisions thereof, as attested to by the proper 
officer; and whether payment therefor has been authorized by the officials of 
the corresponding department or bureau. If these requirements have been 
fulfilled, it is the ministerial duty of the Auditor General to approve and pass 
in audit the voucher and treasury warrant for said payment. He has no discretion 
or authority to disapprove said payment upon the ground that the aforementioned 
contract was unwise or that the amount stipulated thereon is unreasonable. If he 
entertains such belief, he may do more than discharge the duty imposed upon him 
by the Constitution (Article XI, section 2), "to bring to the attention of the 
proper administrative officer expenditures of funds or property which, in his 
opinion, are irregular, unnecessary, excessive or extravagant". This duty 
implies a negation of the power to refuse and disapprove payment of such 
expenditures, for its disapproval, if he had authority therefor, would bring to 
the attention of the aforementioned administrative officer the reasons for the 
adverse action thus taken by the General Auditing office, and, hence, render the 
imposition of said duty unnecessary.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the writ prayed for is granted and respondents herein are hereby 
ordered to pass in audit and approve the payment of the amounts claimed by 
petitioner herein, after deducting therefrom the sum of P6,000 already collected 
by him. It is so ordered.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, Paredes,
