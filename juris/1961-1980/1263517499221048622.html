				<H3>JULIO OZAMIZ, PETITIONER, VS. HONORABLE
MARIANO ZOSA AS JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MISAMIS
OCCIDENTAL AND ELEUTERIO QUIMBO, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner Julio <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> seeks to annul
an order of dismissal of respondent Honorable Mariano <span class="SpellE">Zosa</span>
as Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said petitioner is a resident of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Jimenez</st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental</st1:placename></st1:place>,
and a registered voter of Precinct No. 1 of the same municipality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="9">September
 30, 1967</st1:date>, he filed with the Court of First Instance of said
province, presided over by respondent Judge, a petition for the exclusion of
respondent <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quimbo</span>
from the list of voters of Precinct No. 16 of said municipality, alleging that
he is a citizen, not of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
but of <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing of the petition on October 7,
1967, <span class="SpellE">Quimbo</span> filed a motion to dismiss upon the
ground "that the petition fails to allege jurisdictional facts" -
namely, that he had "applied for registration" and that the same had
been "validated or approved"; that "the petition fails to
include the election registrar and members of the election board as
indispensable parties"; and that having previously exercised the right of
suffrage and been elected vice-mayor, he is "presumed to be a Filipino
citizen." In an order of the same date, respondent Judge granted the
motion and dismissed the petition for exclusion, without costs, upon the theory
that the court "has no jurisdiction to inquire into the citizenship"
of <span class="SpellE">Quimbo</span> and "that an inquiry" into such
question "does not come within the purview of <span class="SpellE">Secs</span>.
7 and 15, Republic Act No. 3588 and Sec. 123 of the Revised Election Code,
Republic Act 180, as amended," in view of the summary nature of such proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reconsideration of said order having been
denied, petitioner commenced the present action, alleging that respondent Judge
had acted with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the order of October 7,
1967, and, accordingly, prayed that the same be annulled.</p>

<p class="BODY">More specifically, petitioner maintains that, in proceedings for
the exclusion of voters, the court may pass upon any question necessary to
decide the issue therein raised, including the question of citizenship of the
person sought to be stricken from the list of voters, if the determination of
said issue depends - as in the case at bar - upon his political status; and
that, if the exclusion case were heard on the merits, he would introduce the
documentary evidence attached to the petition herein, showing:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that, according to the records in the
office of the local civil registrar of Jimenez, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental, <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quimbo</span>
was born a Chinese citizen, the legitimate son of <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Quimbo</span>, born in "Amoy, China," and Angela <span class="SpellE">Azcuna</span>, born in said municipality of Jimenez; and (2) that <u>unlike</u>
his brothers, Pedro and <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Quimbo</span>,
and their mother, Angela <span class="SpellE">Azcuna</span> - after the death of
her husband - who filed the requisite affidavits of election of Philippine
citizenship and took their respective oaths of allegiance to the Republic of
the Philippines, <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quimbo</span>
had filed no such affidavit of election of Philippine citizenship.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his unverified answer to the petition herein, respondent <span class="SpellE">Quimbo</span>, <u>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></u>,
adopted and reiterated the allegations made, on his behalf, by the Provincial
Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental, in his likewise,
unverified answer to the petition for exclusion, to the effect that his father,
<span class="SpellE">Laureano</span> <span class="SpellE">Quimbo</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"was born in <span class="SpellE">Mandawe</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, as an <u>illegitimate</u> son of Victoria <span class="SpellE">Quimbo</span> (deceased), who was a Filipino citizen"; that,
accordingly, <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span> <span class="SpellE">Quimbo</span>
had followed the Philippine citizenship of his mother; and that his son, <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quimbo</span>, did not have to
elect, therefore, such citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
respondent averred, also, that "the issue at bar has become purely
academic," inasmuch as the 1967 elections - to which said petition
"refers naturally" - "are over".</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contention is well taken, inasmuch as the authority
to order the inclusion in or exclusion from the list of voters necessarily
carries with it the power to inquire into and settle all matters essential to
the exercise of said authority, unless the law provides otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not aware of, and respondents have not
pointed out, any such law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently,
respondent Judge could not conceive that so important an attribute as one's
nationality could be left for determination in an exclusion proceeding,
considering the summary nature thereof, and that the decision therein of the
Court of First Instance is not - he thought - <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
to a higher court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This process of
reasoning overlooks, however, the fact that - except insofar as the right to
remain in the list of voters <u>for the elections in relation</u> to which the
proceedings had been held -said decision does not constitute <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">adjudicata</span></u>, not
only as regards the nationality of the person concerned, but, even as to his
right to vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, whatever
said decision may be, it would neither be conclusive on his political status,
nor bar subsequent proceedings on his right to be registered as a voter in <u>any
other </u>election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in Tan <span class="SpellE">Cohon</span> v. Election Registrar,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>,
stated:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> in
view of the fact that the two matters involved in the assigned alleged errors
are of public interest, those of inclusion in the permanent list of voters and
of the alleged Filipino citizenship of appellant (<span class="SpellE">Aba√±il</span>,
et al. v. Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, et al. , 70 Phil. 28), it is made clear
that even as it is here held that the order of the City Court in question has
become final, the same does not constitute <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">adjudicata</span></u> as to any of the matters therein
contained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is ridiculous to suppose
that such an important and often intricate matter of citizenship may be passed
upon and determined with finality in such a summary and peremptory proceeding
as that of inclusion and exclusion of persons in the registry list of
voters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if the City Court had
granted appellant's petition for inclusion in the permanent list of voters on
the allegation that she is a Filipino citizen qualified to vote, her alleged
Filipino citizenship would still have been left open to question."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Insofar as decisions in cases of exclusion do not bar subsequent
litigations or constitute <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">adjudicata</span></u>, the foregoing view reiterates that taken in
Mayor v. <span class="SpellE">Villacete</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
on <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1961</st1:date>, and first
expressed, on <st1:date year="1928" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1928</st1:date>,
in <span class="SpellE">Nuval</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Guray</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We have not overlooked the fact that the Mayor case was dismissed
upon the ground that it had become academic, in that the case <u>served no
useful purpose</u>, since it sought to dispute the lower court's order of
exclusion insofar as the 1959 elections were concerned, and said elections had
taken place before the Supreme Court could render its decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted, however, that the
exclusion proceedings involved therein were held under Rep. Act No. 180, known
as the Revised Election Code, pursuant to which a list of voters was prepared
for <u>each</u> election, regular or special (Rep. Act No. 180, sections 101
and 102).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case at bar refers,
however, to proceedings conducted under Rep. Act No. 3588, as amended by Rep.
Acts Nos. 4730 and 5178, the main feature of which is the establishment of a permanent
list of voters, substantially distinct and different from that provided for in
the Revised Election Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under such
Code, the inclusion and exclusion proceedings were held in connection with the <u>preparation</u>
of the list of voters for each election, so that, after such election, the
proceedings became moot, since <u>another</u> list would be prepared for each
subsequent election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other
hand, under Rep. Act No. 3588, as amended, inclusion and exclusion proceedings
take place always in relation to the <u>contents</u> of <u>one and the same</u>
list of voters, the <u>permanent</u> one.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that, unlike the decisions of courts of first instance
in inclusion and exclusion proceedings, under Rep. Act No. 180, as amended,
which could not be appealed, those rendered under Rep. Act No. 3588, as
amended, are <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the Supreme Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
and that petitioner herein contests the order complained of in a pleading
captioned "petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch, however, as the same was filed on
November 3, 1967, or ten (10) days after notice of said order,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and, hence, within the period to appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, We
hold that said petition may and should be regarded as one for review of the
order in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, again, in the <span class="SpellE">Cohon</span> case, a
decision of the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, denying the
inclusion of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Cohon</span> in the list of voters, was
brought for review to the Court of First Instance, which dismissed the
proceedings upon the ground that the same raised questions of fact, and that
the decision of the City Court is - pursuant to Rep. Act No. 5178 -
"immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <u>final as to questions of fact</u>."
Thereupon, petitioner gave notice of her intention to appeal from said order of
dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notice, likewise, stated
"that an appeal <u>will also</u> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <u>be taken</u> from the order of the City Court x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." In the Supreme Court,
appellant assailed, however, <u>not</u> the order of dismissal of the Court of
First Instance, but <u>the decision of the City Court</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After finding that the Court of First Instance
had not erred in dismissing the case and that <u>the records did not disclose
any appeal taken from the decision of the City Court</u>, We held it
"impossible" for Us to consider the errors allegedly committed by the
latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, the ruling
therein made is not controlling on the question whether the case at bar should
be dismissed as moot, by reason of the fact that the 1967 and 1969 elections
have taken place long ago.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, Dr. Jose P. Laurel - a foremost constitutionalist
and one of the outstanding framers of our Fundamental Law, whose wealth of
experience in the practical operation of our political system is acknowledged -
had the following to say, on behalf of the Court, in <span class="SpellE">Aba√±il</span>
v. Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>:</p>

<blockquote>"While the present controversy may seem academic because the
1938 election is over, we have nevertheless assumed the task of deciding the
same on its merits in view of the imperative necessity and importance of having
a correct electoral census in the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, and for that matter in any
municipality or city in the Philippines, for use in future elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the scheme of our present republican
government, the people are allowed to have a voice therein through the instrumentality
of suffrage to be availed of by those possessing certain prescribe
qualifications (Article V, Constitution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>;
sections 93 and 94, Election Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
people in clothing a citizen with the elective franchise for the purpose of securing
a consistent and perpetual administration of the government they ordain, charge
him with the performance of a duty in the nature of a public trust, and in that
respect constitute him a representative of the whole people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This duty requires that the privilege thus
bestowed should be exercised, not exclusively for the benefit of the citizen or
class of citizens professing it, but in good faith and with an intelligent zeal
for the general benefit and welfare of the state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
<u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE">Cruikshank</span>, 92 <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
588.) In the last analysis, therefore, the inclusion in or exclusion from the
permanent electoral list of any voter concerns not only the latter in his
individual capacity but the public in general."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The considerations that impelled this Court to decide the <span class="SpellE">Aba√±il</span> case on the merits, despite the fact that the
election therein contemplated was over, acquire greater significance in the
present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the right of
suffrage involved therein is dependent upon the question whether or not
respondent <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quimbo</span>
is a foreigner, and our laws are particularly, as well as justifiably,
concerned about any form of alien intervention in our political life, whereas
the <span class="SpellE">Aba√±il</span> case hinged merely on the ability of some <u>Filipinos</u>
to prepare their own ballots as one of the requirements for the possession and
exercise of the right of suffrage.</p>

<p class="BODY">Needless to stress, this right is but an attribute of
sovereignty, which, in a democratic state, particularly one of the republican
type, like ours, resides in the <u>Filipino</u> people, and "it is
elementary that such sovereignty be exercised <u>exclusively</u> by
nationals."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
For this reason, it has been deemed necessary to warn courts "that they
should <u>ever</u> endeavor to bar the possibility that judicial proceedings
should be utilized to circumvent the policy of our constitution and laws, even
temporarily."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, by adopting a theory -neither supported by any statute,
decision or legal principle, nor advanced by any of the parties, who thus
impliedly accept the jurisdiction of the lower court - the same allowed
respondent <span class="SpellE">Quimbo</span> to vote in two (2) general
elections, despite the debatable nature of his right to participate
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, he would, also,
manage to participate in the processes for the amendment or revision of no less
than our Fundamental Law, soon scheduled to begin, even if he were not entitled
thereto, unless the exclusion proceedings against him were finally disposed of
soon enough, and this is likely to suffer delays, if the present case were dismissed
as moot, to give way to a new proceeding for his exclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order complained of is hereby set aside,
and respondent Judge or the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental is hereby directed to immediately hear and decide on the merits the
petition for exclusion of respondent <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quimbo</span>, with the costs of this instance against him.</p>
