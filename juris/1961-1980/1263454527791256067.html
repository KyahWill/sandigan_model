ADMITTED TO THE PHILIPPINE BAR:  MARCH 9,
1957, RESPONDENT.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an administrative case for disbarment instituted by
Manuel R. Go on <st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1966</st1:date>
against Atty. <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Candoy</span>
on the basis of acts committed by the latter allegedly constituting
"deceit and grossly immoral conduct".</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint recites that by virtue of a "previous
agreement" between the complainant Go and the respondent <span class="SpellE">Candoy</span> over "Lot 11, Block 16 (LRC) Psd-12510 <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> Village P-1 with an area of 350 sq. m. located
at <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>," Go
gave to the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> Development Corporation<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
on March 4, 1964 his personal check for P7,140, which sum represents the initial
payment on the said lot plus the required cash bond; that by virtue of this
payment, the corporation executed an "Agreement to Purchase and Sell"
in favor of <span class="SpellE">Candoy</span>; that on the same date, "in
view of the foregoing consideration and the additional amount of P2,000 in cash
given" by Go to <span class="SpellE">Candoy</span>, the latter executed an
"Agreement to Purchase and Sell" in favor of Go; that on March 31,
1964 Go gave to the corporation another personal check for P16,337.01, which
amount represents the "unpaid balance of the purchase price of the said
lot"; that in view of this last payment, the corporation on the same date
executed a "Deed of Absolute Sale" in favor of <span class="SpellE">Candoy</span>;
that on August 30, 1965 <span class="SpellE">Candoy</span> and his wife, by
virtue of a "Contract to Sell", sold the land to the spouses <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span> and Astrid N. <span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span>; that to protect his rights, Go instituted a
civil case (9047, CFI of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>) against <span class="SpellE">Candoy</span> and his wife, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span>
and the corporation, as well as a criminal prosecution for <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span>
(15756, CFI of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>) against <span class="SpellE">Candoy</span>;
and that both cases are now pending adjudication.</p>

<p class="BODY">In answer to the complaint, <span class="SpellE">Candoy</span>
admits the existence of the "Agreement to Purchase and Sell" in favor
of Go as well as the "Deed of Absolute Sale" executed by the corpora­tion
in his (<span class="SpellE">Candoy's</span>) favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise admits having executed a
"Contract to Sell" in favor of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span>,
but avers that he did so only "after the petitioner (complainant) had
defaulted and after the respondent had given him all the opportunity to comply,
but nevertheless, the petitioner failed, so the respondent was compelled to <span style="">rescind his agreement </span>with the
petitioner and it was only then that the respond­ent sold the lot <span style="">in </span>question to the spouses <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span> and Astrid <span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
a special and affirmative defense, <span style="">he </span>asserts that there was<span style=""> </span>no deceit, much less any immoral
conduct, on his part in rescinding the sale to Go and selling the land to the
spouses <span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span>, because he gave Go "all the
opportunity to comply with their agreement and it was only after the petitioner
refused to comply with their agreement that the respondent decided to rescind
the agreement."</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was referred to the Solicitor General for investigation,
report and, recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1967</st1:date> <span class="SpellE">Candoy</span>,
with the conformity of Go, moved to dismiss the case on the ground that they
had reached an amicable settlement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1967</st1:date> the Solicitor General,
without any hearing had in the case, submitted his report and recommendation,
the pertinent portions of which read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Although this <span style="">case </span>may
be disposed of in the light of the joint motion for dismissal filed by the
parties and their counsel, it appears from the very answer of respondent that
the double sale complained of was occasioned by a very trivial alleged
violation of the first vendee of the condition of <span style="">the sale, </span><span style="">namely, </span><span style="">the alleged
non-payment of as</span><span style="">sociation dues
in the amount of around P52.50 w</span><span style="">hich in the mind of the undersigned should not have
been taken advantage of by respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, it is hard to believe the denial made under oath by respondent
of receipt of P2,000.00 as additional consideration of the land sale as alleged
in paragraph </span><span style="">3 </span><span style="">of the petition;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under the circumstances, in order that lawyers may be
restrained from doing any act which in any manner may be tainted with some
degree of unfairness or oppressiveness, albeit legal, which, in this case <span style="">is </span>doubtful
because the alleged lesion was not serious, it is advisable that the respondent
be correspondingly admonished."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Commenting on the foregoing recommendation, <span class="SpellE">Candoy</span>
in his memorandum expressed surprise "as to how the Solicitor General has
arrived at the conclusion that ‘it <span style="">is </span>hard
to believe the denial made under oath by the respondent of receipt of P2,000.00
<span style="">as </span>additional
consideration’ when there was no investigation whatsoever conducted and the
complainant has not presented any evidence to prove his allegation." <span class="SpellE">Candoy</span> argues that even on the assumption that the
violation committed by Go is trivial, the fact remains that the latter
committed a breach of contract justifying rescission of their agreement, and
that such rescission cannot in any manner be regarded as constituting
"deceit and grossly immoral conduct" on <span class="SpellE">Candoy's</span>
part.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding the joint motion to dismiss <span style="">filed </span>by
the parties, this Court can still hold the respondent <span class="SpellE">Candoy</span>
accountable for breach of professional conduct, if he has committed any
relative to his contractual relations with the complainants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A lawyer, whenever <span style="">his </span>moral character is put in issue, should satisfy this Court
that he is a fit and proper person to enjoy continued membership in the
Bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He can not dispense with nor
downgrade the high and exacting moral standards of the law profession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, a case of suspension or
disbarment may proceed "regardless of interest or lack of interest of the
complainants <span style="">if
</span>the facts proven so warrant."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It is of <span style="">no </span>moment, therefore,
that the parties herein "have considered this matter closed with the
termination of the transaction had" by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What matters is whether, on the <span style="">ba</span>sis <span style="">of the facts borne out by the record, the </span>charge of <span style="">deceit and grossly immoral conduct has been
duly proven.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is quite elementary that in disbarment proceedings, the burden
of proof rests upon the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
be made the ba­sis <span style="">for </span>suspension
or disbarment of a lawyer, the charge against him must be established by
convincing proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record must disclose
<span style="">as </span>free from dou<span style="">bt </span>a case which compels the exercise
by this Court of its disciplinary powers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">The dubious character of </span>the
act done as well as of the motivation thereof must be clearly demonstrated.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Coming back to the case at hand, it is our view that the <span style="">Solicitor General erred in concluding </span>that
"it is hard to be­lieve the denial made under oath by the respondent of
receipt of P2,000 as additional consideration of the land sale".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apart from the bare allegation that the
complainant gave the respond­ent "the additional amount of P2,000.00 in
cash", which allegation was squarely traversed by the latter under oath,
the record is absolutely bereft of any proof that the said amount was in fact
paid to, and received by, the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was easy enough for the complainant to prove payment of the amount of
P2,000, by the <span style="">mere tender of </span>the
corresponding receipt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since there was
no investigation conducted in the case, and the complainant has not at all
presented any evidence of payment by him of the said amount, the respondent was
under no obligation to prove his exception or defense.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span>his report and
recommendation, the Solicitor General observed "that the double sale
complained of was occasioned by a very <u>trivial</u> alleged violation of the
first vendee of the condition of the sale, namely, the alleged non-payment of
association dues in the amount of around <span style="">P52.50,"
</span>and concluded that the rescission of the contract by the respondent was
"tainted with some degree of unfairness or oppressiveness." <span style="">We </span>disagree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General overlooks the fact that
the breach <span style="">of </span>the "Agreement
to Purchase and Sell" committed by the complainant did not embrace alone
“non-payment of association dues" but as well and, more importantly,
failure to pay the full consideration of the sale of the <span style="">lot </span>in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the said agreement, the complainant bound
himself to "pay to <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> Development
Corporation the balance of P19,460.00 on or before <st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1965</st1:date> including 12% interest per annum on the said
balance".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant paid the <span style="">sum </span>of only <span style="">P16,337.01, leaving, therefore, the sizeable unpaid balance of
P3,122.99.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Although the ques<span style="">tion of rescission is now academic, the
parties having settled their differences amicably, this Court is not prepared
to say that in rescinding the agreement the respondent acted with
"unfairness and oppressiveness", as he merely exercised a power
explicitly conferred upon him by the said agreement, this power being one of
the <u>special</u> stipulations and covenants thereof "strict and full
compliance" with which the complainant unequivocally bound himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the complaint for disbarment against Atty. <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Candoy</span> is hereby
dismissed.</p>
