attachment.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 17, 1976 See Hong, the proprietor of <span class="SpellE">Ororama</span> <span class="SpellE">Supermart</span> in <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City, sued the spouses
Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Conching</span> <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Oriental for the collection of the sum of P58,400 plus litigation expenses and
attorney's fees (Civil Case No. 4930).</p>

<p class="BODY">See Hong asked for a writ of preliminary attachment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1976" day="5" month="3">March
 5, 1976</st1:date>, the lower court issued an order of attach­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deputy sheriff attached the properties of
the <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> spouses in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Valencia</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
<span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span> and in <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City.</p>

<p class="BODY">To lift the attachment, the <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> spouses
filed on <st1:date year="1976" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1976</st1:date> a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> in the amount of P58<span class="GramE">,400</span>
with Towers Assurance Corporation as surety.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In that undertaking, the <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> spouses and
Towers Assurance Corporation bound themselves to pay <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span>
to See Hong the sum of P58<span class="GramE">,400</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1976</st1:date>
the <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> spouses filed an answer with a
counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For nonappearance at the
pre-trial, the <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> spouses were declared in default.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 25, 1976, the lower court rendered a decision,
ordering not only the <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> spouses but also their
surety, Towers Assurance Corporation, to pay <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span>
to See Hong the sum of P58,400.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
court also ordered the <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> spouses to pay P10<span class="GramE">,000</span> as litigation expenses and attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> manifested that he did not
want to appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1977" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1977</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Ororama</span> <span class="SpellE">Supermart</span> filed a motion for execu­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court granted that motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writ of execution was issued on March 14
against the judgment debtors and their surety.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1977" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1977</st1:date>,
Towers Assurance Corporation filed the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i>
where it assails the decision and writ of execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the lower court acted with grave abuse of discretion
in issuing a writ of execution against the surety with­out first giving it an
opportunity to be heard as required in Rule 57 of the Rules of Court which
provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 17.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>When execution returned unsatisfied,
recovery had upon bond</u><span class="GramE">.-</span> If the execution be
returned unsatisfied in whole or in part, the surety or sureties on any counter
bond given pursuant to the provisions of this rule to secure the payment of the
judgment shall become charged on such counter bond, and bound to pay to the
judgment creditor upon demand, the amount due under the judgment, which amount
may be recovered from such surety or sureties <u>after notice and summary
hearing in the same action</u>."<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under section 17, in order that the judgment creditor might
recover from the surety on the counter bond, it is necessary (1) that execution
be first issued against the principal debtor and that such execution was
returned unsatisfied in whole or in part; (2) that the creditor made a demand
upon the surety for the satisfaction of the judgment, and (3) that the surety
be given notice and a summary hearing in the same action as to his liability
for the judgment under his counter bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first requisite mentioned above is not applicable to this
case because Towers Assurance Corporation assumed a <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>
liability for the satisfaction of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A surety is not entitled to the exhaustion of the properties of the
principal debtor (Art. 2959, Civil Code; Luzon Steel Corporation vs. <span class="SpellE">Sia</span>, L-26449, May 15, 1969, 28 SCRA 58, 63).</p>

<p class="BODY">But certainly, the surety is entitled to be heard before an
execution can be issued against him since he is not a party in the case
involving his principal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Notice and hearing constitute the essence of procedural due
process.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Martinez vs. <span class="SpellE">Villacete</span>, 116 Phil. 326; Alliance Insurance &amp; Surety
Co., Inc. vs. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Piccio</span>, 105 Phil. 1192, 1200;
Luzon Surety Co., Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Beson</span>, L-26865-66, January
30, 1970, 31 SCRA 313).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order and writ of execution, insofar as
they concern Towers Assurance Corporation, are set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court is directed to conduct a
summary hearing on the surety's liability on its counter bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
