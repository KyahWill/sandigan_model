<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appeal from a decision of the 
Court of Juvenile and Domestic Relations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> <span class="SpellE">Rayray</span> seeks the annulment 
of his marriage to defendant <span class="SpellE">Chae</span> Kyung Lee. Inasmuch 
as, the latter's whereabouts is unknown, and she was formerly a resident of 
</span><st1:place><st1:city><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Pusan</span></span></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
</span><st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Korea</span></st1:country-region></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, summons was served by 
publication, as provided in the Rules of Court. Thereafter, plaintiff moved that 
defendant be declared in default, she not having filed an answer, and that a 
date be set for the reception of his evidence. Before acting on this motion, the 
lower court referred the case to the City Fiscal of Manila, pursuant to Articles 
88 and 101 of the Civil Code of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, for the purpose of determining 
whether or not <span class="GramE">a collusion</span> between the parties exists. 
Said officer having found no such collusion, the case was heard on the merits. 
In due course, thereafter, decision was rendered dismissing plaintiff's 
complaint, without costs, upon the ground: (1) that the court could not nullify 
a marriage contracted abroad; and (2) that the facts proven do not warrant the 
relief prayed for. A reconsideration of this decision having been denied, 
plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the 
Supreme Court, the jurisdiction of the lower court being in issue in the 
appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In relation thereto, the court 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">a quo</span></em> found that it had no 
jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of plaintiff's marriage to the defendant, 
it having been solemnized in </span><st1:place><st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Seoul</span></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
</span><st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Korea</span></st1:country-region></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. Said conclusion is erroneous. 
In order that a given case could be validly decided by a court of justice, it 
must have jurisdiction over: (1) the subject-matter of the litigation; (2) the 
person of the parties therein; and (3) in actions<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> in <span class="SpellE">rem</span></span></em> or 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">quasi-in-<span class="SpellE">rem</span></span></em>, the <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">res</span></em><span class="GramE">.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>1]</sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The subject-matter of the present 
case is the annulment of plaintiff's marriage to the defendant, which is within 
the jurisdiction of our courts of first instance<span class="GramE">,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>2]</sup></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> </span>and, in 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, of its Court of Juvenile and 
Domestic Relations.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[3]</sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The same acquired jurisdiction 
over plaintiff herein by his submission thereto in consequence of the filing of 
the complaint herein<span class="GramE">.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>4]</sup></span> Defendant was placed under the 
jurisdiction of said court, upon the service of summons by publication.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[5]</sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is an action <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">in <span class="SpellE">rem</span>,</span></em> for 
it concerns the status of the parties herein, and status affects or binds the 
whole world. The <span class="SpellE"><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">res</span></em></span> in the present case is the 
relation between said parties, or their marriage tie.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[6]</sup></span> Jurisdiction over the same depends upon 
the nationality or domicile of the parties, not the place of celebration of 
marriage, or the <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">locus <span class="SpellE">celebrationis</span></span></em>.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[7]</sup></span> plaintiff herein is a citizen of the 
Philippines, domiciled therein. His status is, therefore, subject to our 
jurisdiction, on both counts. True that defendant was and - under plaintiff's 
theory -still is a non-resident alien. But, this fact does not deprive the lower 
court of its jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of her marriage to plaintiff 
herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Indeed, marriage is one of the 
cases of double status, in that the status therein involves and affects two 
persons. One is married, never in abstract or in a vacuum, but, always to 
somebody else. Hence, a judicial decree on the marriage status of a person 
necessarily reflects upon the status of another and the relation between them. 
The prevailing rule is, accordingly, that a court has jurisdiction over 
the<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="SpellE">res</span>,</span></em> in an action for annulment of marriage, 
provided, at least, one of the parties is domiciled in, or a national of, the 
forum<span class="GramE">.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>8]</sup></span> Since plaintiff is a Filipino, domiciled 
in the Philippines, it follows that the lower court had jurisdiction over the 
<span class="SpellE">res</span>, in addition to its jurisdiction over the 
subject-matter and the parties. In other words, it could validly inquire into 
the legality of the marriage between the parties herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As regards the substantial 
validity of said marriage, plaintiff testified that he met the defendant in 
<span class="SpellE">Pusan</span>, Korea, sometime in 1952, where she was 
operating a night club; that they lived together from November 1952 to April 
1955; that they were married in <span class="SpellE">Pusan</span>, Korea, on March 
15, 1953, as attested to by their marriage certificate Exhibit D; that before 
the wedding she obtained the "police clearance" Exhibit A, written in Korean 
language, and dated February 16, 1953, which was necessary in order that she 
could contract marriage; that on June 30, 1953, he proceeded to India and left 
the defendant, then in advanced stage of pregnancy, in Korea; that in October, 
1953, she joined him in India, bringing with her said Exhibit A, and its 
translation into English, Exhibit B; that he then noticed that, on February 16, 
1953, defendant was already married, according to said Exhibit B; that as he 
confronted the defendant with the contents of this document, her reply was that 
it is not unusual for a Korean girl to marry twice in Korea; that when he 
inquired about her status on March 15, 1953, defendant confided to him that she 
had lived with about two (2) Americans and a Korean, adding, however, that there 
was no impediment to her contracting marriage with him; and that, later on, they 
were separated and her whereabouts are now unknown to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The lower court considered 
plaintiff's evidence insufficient to establish that defendant was married to 
another person prior to </span><st1:date year="1953" day="15" month="3"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 15, 
1953</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, and 
we agree with this conclusion. To begin with, Exhibit A is not signed. It merely 
purports to bear the seal of the Chief of <span class="SpellE">Pusan</span> 
National Police. Secondly, the record does not show who prepared it, much less 
that he had personal knowledge of the truth of the entry therein concerning 
defendant's status on </span><st1:date year="1953" day="15" month="2"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 15, 
1953</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. It 
should be noted, that defendant was a native, not of 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Pusan</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, but of 
</span><st1:place><st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Seoul</span></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
</span><st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Korea</span></st1:country-region></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. Hence, Exhibit A could, at 
best, be no more than hearsay evidence. Again, when plaintiff allegedly 
confronted the defendant with the contents of Exhibit B, defendant did not say 
that she had been married before. Plaintiff declared that she admitted having 
previously lived with several other men, adding, however, that she had no 
impediment, thus, in effect, negating the alleged previous 
marriage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Thirdly, if Exhibit A was 
obtained on </span><st1:date year="1953" day="16" month="2"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 16, 
1953</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, in 
order to establish defendant's qualification to contract marriage, why is it 
that the wedding took <span class="GramE">place,</span> despite the entry in said 
document to the effect that defendant was married already? There is no competent 
evidence to the effect that Korean laws permit bigamy or polygamy. Moreover, the 
presumption is that the foreign law is identical to the <span class="SpellE"><i>lex</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">fori</span></i>, or, in the 
case at bar, the Philippine law<span class="GramE">.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>9]</sup></span> In fact, the statement, imputed by 
plaintiff to the defendant, to the effect that, although she had cohabited 
before with other men, there was no impediment to her marrying him, clearly 
suggests that a previous marriage on her part would have been, in her opinion, a 
legal obstacle to her marriage with the plaintiff. Then too, the marriage 
certificate Exhibit D contains spaces for the entry of data on whether any of 
the contracting parties had been previously married; whether the prior marriage 
had been dissolved by a decree of divorce; and, if there had been such decree, 
the date thereof. Surely, these data would be absolutely irrelevant if polygamy 
were sanctioned in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Korea</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. And, again, why is it that 
Exhibit D states that defendant had had no previous 
marriage?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Last, but not least, plaintiff 
cannot possibly secure the relief prayed for unless full faith and credence are 
given to his testimony, but we cannot believe him for the records show that he 
would not hesitate to lie when it suits his purpose. Thus, for instance, when 
plaintiff contracted marriage with the defendant, he said that he was single, 
although, he admitted, this was a lie, because, sometime in 1940, he married in 
<span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, one <span class="SpellE">Adelaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Melecio</span> or Valdez,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[10]</sup></span> But, then he would, also, have us 
believe that his marriage with the latter was illegal or fictitious, because 
<span class="SpellE">Adelaida</span> and he did no more than sign, on a small 
window in the City Hall of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, certain documents 
the contents of which he did not read.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision appealed from 
should be, as it is hereby, affirmed, with the costs of this instance against 
plaintiff-appellant. IT IS SO ORDERED.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
