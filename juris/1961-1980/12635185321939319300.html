<p class="BODY">Upon these facts and the submission of the parties that the only
issue is whether or not the obligation of the petitioners was subsisting at the
time of the appro­val of Republic Act No. 897, the Amendatory Act of June 20,
1953 to Republic Act 304, the original back pay law, the trial court dismissed
the petition, as already stated, and directed respondent sheriff to proceed and
continue with the public auction sale of the property mortgaged in accordance
with the foreclosure application of respondent Development Bank of the Philippines
after due notice to petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
their appeal, petitioners’ sole assignment of error is that: "The trial
court erred in declaring that the loan of the petitioners-appellants was not
subsisting when Republic Act No. <span style="">897 </span>was
enacted on <st1:date year="1953" day="20" month="6">June <span style="">20, 1953</span></st1:date><span style="">."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal has no merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent portions of the controlling provisions of the
aforementioned Back Pay Law, as amended by Republic Act No. 897 on <st1:date year="1953" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1953</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
read as follows:</p>

recognition of the right to the salaries and wages as provided in section one
hereof, and notice of such acknowledgment shall be issued to the applicant
which shall state the total <span style="">amount </span>of

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is indeed settled that
under the above provi­</span>sions, the Government or any of its agencies does
not have any discretion in the acceptance of back pay cer­tificates,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

It is equally clear, however, that the same <span style="">provisions expressly require </span>that the
obligations - for which certificates of indebtedness may be accepted as
payments of - must be <u><span style="">subsisting</span></u><span style=""> </span>at the time of the approval of
Republic Act No. 897; hence when, as in the instant case, such back pay certifi­cates
are offered in payment to a government-owned cor­poration of an obligation
thereto which was not subsisting at the time of the enactment of said
amendatory Act on June 20, 1953, such corporation may not legally be compelled
to accept the certificates.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that appellants' application for an urban real estate
loan was approved by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> bank on <st1:date year="1953" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1953</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">appears, however, </span>that appellants did not
avail of it until much later, <span style="">as </span>in
fact, they executed the mortgage contract only on <st1:date year="1954" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1954</st1:date>, and furthermore, that the release of the
amount of the said loan of P19<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> was to be made
in installments and subject to compliance with certain conditions by said
appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances, <span class="GramE">Our</span> ruling in the case of Rodriguez vs. Development Bank of

<p class="BODY">In that case, <span style="">Rodriguez </span>obtained a loan from the said Development Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to be received by him in several releases and to be paid later in in­stallments,
under the terms and conditions specified in the loan agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to said agreement, Rodri­guez
received the first release in the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,000.<span style="">00</span></span><span style=""> on </span><st1:date year="1953" day="27" month="5"><span style="">May 27, 1953</span></st1:date><span style="">, while the subsequent releases cover­ing the
P9,000.00 - balance of the loan were all availed of and received by him later
than June, 1953.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, Rodriguez paid
the installments </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">they fell due.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When a balance of about P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
remained unpaid, Rodriguez offered to pay </span><span style="">the said outstanding </span><span style="">balance of the loan with his back pay
certificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Bank refused at first
to accept the said tender of payment in certifi­cate, and when it accepted the
same later, it limited its acceptance only to the amount of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> repre­senting the portion of the loan released
before the passage of Republic Act No. 897, although the amount of the back pay
certificate offered by </span><span style="">Rodriguez was more than sufficient to cover the
total unpaid balance of the loan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So,
Rodriguez instituted an action for <i>mandamus</i> in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> to compel the Bank to accept his

<p class="BODY">Herein appellants' situation is even worse than that of
Rodriguez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here appellants actually
availed of their approved loan only about nine (9) months after the enactment
of Republic Act 897 and <span style="">the </span>corresponding
releases thereof were received by appellants only after the execution of the
mortgage contract on <st1:date year="1954" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1954</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Undoubtedly, notwithstanding the approval by
the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Development Bank of the Philippines
(RFC) of appellants' loan application on April 30, 1953, appellants did not
thereby incur any obligation to pay the same; only after the corresponding
amounts were released to appellants after March 23, 1954 did such obligation
attach; and it cannot, therefore, be said that the said loan was an <u><span style="">obligation</span></u><span style=""> <u>subsisting</u></span> at the time of the approval of Republic Act
No. 897 on June 20, 1953.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be truly said, as contended by appellants, that when their
application for the loan was approved by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Bank on April 30, 1953, an agreement was perfected between them and said Bank,
but it should be noted that under such agreement the only enforceable
obligation that was created was that of <span style="">the
</span>Bank to grant the loan applied for, whereas the obligation of appellants
to pay the same could not have arisen <span style="">until
</span>after the amount of the loan has been actually released to them; and
said release was even subject to their compliance with certain conditions
specified in the mortg<span style="">age </span>contract
executed after the <span style="">approval </span>already
of Republic Act 897.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants' appeal
that a more li­beral construction of the <span style="">law
would enable </span>"many crip­pled or disabled veterans, or their wives
and orphans, <span style="">or </span>those who had in
one way or another unselfishly sacrificed or contributed to the cause of the
last war" to take advantage of their back pay certificates, does deserve
sympathy, for indeed, among the avowed purposes of the said law are:
"First, to serve as a source of financial aid to needy veterans, like
crippled or dis­abled veterans, and to their wives and orphans.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, to give recognition to the
sacrifices of those who joined the last war and <span style="">particularly </span>to those who have given their all for the cause of
the last <span class="GramE">war.</span>" (Congressional Records No. 61, 2nd
Congress, 4th Regular Session, May 6, 1953, page 74, <span style="">as quoted in <span class="SpellE">Floren<span style="">tino</span></span></span><span style=""> et al
vs. PNB, 98 Phil. 959, 961-963).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, however, <span class="GramE">We</span> cannot see any room for
interpretation or construction in the clear and unambiguous language of the
above-quoted provision of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Court has steadfastly adhered to the doctrine that its first and fundamental
duty is the application of the law according to its express terms,
interpretation being called or only when such literal application is
impossible.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> No process of interpretation or construction
